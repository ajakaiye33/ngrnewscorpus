          "text": "Justice D. U. Okorowo a Federal High Court in Abuja has stopped the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Ameachi; Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), and the Bureau of Public Procurement from nominating any company or entity to be operators of the International Cargo Tracking System in Nigeria.\n\nThe order of the Court was sequel to an ex parte motion marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1587/2021 filed by Incorporated Trustees of Citizens Advocacy for Social and Economic Rights complaining about the official malfeasance associated with the ongoing process of appointing an implementation agent for the ITCN.\n\nA copy of the enrolled order was obtained by journalists in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nThe order specifically restrained Medtech Scientific Limited and Rozi International Nigeria Limited (4th and 5th defendants) or their agents from parading themselves or functioning as operators of ICTN in Nigeria pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice.\n\nJustice Okorowo granted the interim orders against the defendants pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice filed by the plaintiffs.\n\nThe motion ex parte dated December 9, 2021, but filed on December 13, was supported by an affidavit sworn to by the Executive Director of CASER, Frank Tietie, and accompanied by a written address.\n\nAfter listening to A.U Mustapha (SAN), for the plaintiff/applicant, Justice Okorowo made the following orders:\n\n\u201cAn order of interim injunction is hereby made restraining the 2nd defendant (BPP): either by itself, servants, agents, privies or through any person or persons howsoever described or termed from appointing the 4th and 5th defendants as the operators of the International Cargo Tracking System in Nigeria pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice.\n\n\u201cAn order of interim injunction is hereby made restraining the 2nd defendant; either by itself, servants, agents, privies or through any person or persons howsoever described or termed from giving further approvals and waivers to the 1st defendant (Honourable Minister, Federal Ministry of Transport) in the planned appointment of the 4th and 5th defendants as the operators of the International Cargo Tracking System (ICTN) in Nigeria pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice.\n\n\u201cAn order of interim injunction is hereby made restraining all the defendants either by themselves or through their officials or agents or any other person or persons howsoever from taking further steps towards nominating any company or entity to be operators of the International Cargo Tracking System in Nigeria pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the case has been adjourned to January 12, 2022, for arguments on the motion on notice.\n\nTietie had explained that CASER instituted the case out of serious concern for Nigeria\u2019s internal security following the massive inflow of small arms and light weapons through Nigerian seaports.\n\nAccording to him, CASER was also concerned that Nigeria loses huge billions of dollars following the improper tracking of cargo exports and imports.\n\nThe overall goal of the case by CASER, he said, was to simply ensure compliance with the provisions of the Public Procurement Act in line with international best practices and standards in the procurement of such security-sensitive services.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The World Health Organisation says there is now \u201cconsistent evidence\u201d that the Omicron variant was outpacing Delta, as COVID-19 continues to account for around 50,000 deaths worldwide every week.\n\nWHO Director General, Tedros Ghebreyesus told journalists at the agency\u2019s Headquarters in Geneva that it was also more likely that people who had been vaccinated, or recovered from the virus, could be infected, or re-infected.\n\n\u201cThere can be no doubt that increased social mixing over the holiday period in many countries will lead to increased cases, overwhelm health systems and more deaths.\n\n\u201cAll of us are sick of this pandemic. All of us want to spend time with friends and family. All of us want to get back to normal.\n\n\u201cThe fastest way to do that is for all of us \u2013 leaders and individuals \u2013 to make the difficult decisions that must be made to protect ourselves and others,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said delaying or cancelling events, was the responsible thing to do: \u201cAn event cancelled is better than a life cancelled. It\u2019s better to cancel now and celebrate later, than to celebrate now and grieve later.\u201d\n\nMore than 3.3 million people have lost their lives to COVID-19 this year \u2013 more deaths than from HIV, malaria and tuberculosis combined in 2020, and Africa was now facing a steep wave of infections, driven largely by the Omicron variant.\n\nJust a month ago, Africa was reporting its lowest number of cases in 18 months, Ghebreyesus reminded reporters on Monday, whereas last week, it reported the fourth-highest number of cases in a single week so far.\n\n\u201cNone of us want to be here again in 12 months\u2019 time, talking about missed opportunities, continued inequity, or new variants,\u201d he said.\n\nThe director general emphasised that for the pandemic to end in 2022, \u201cwe must end inequity, by ensuring 70 per cent of the population of every country is vaccinated by the middle of next year.\u201d\n\nAround the world, the WHO was working with countries to restore and sustain essential health services disrupted by the pandemic.\n\nAccording to new data released this year, 23 million children missed out on routine vaccines in 2020, the largest number in over a decade, increasing risks from preventable diseases like measles and polio, the UN correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported.\n\nProgress is, however, still being made in many other areas of healthcare and medicine.\n\nFive countries were able to introduce the human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) to prevent cervical cancer, and a further nine are planning to introduce it over the next six months, and in September, WHO launched a global road map to defeat meningitis by 2030.\n\nThe pandemic has also caused setbacks in the agency\u2019s efforts to defeat the world\u2019s leading infectious diseases, with an estimated 14 million more malaria cases and 47 thousand more malaria deaths in 2020, compared to 2019.\n\n\u201cHowever, WHO certified two countries \u2013 China and El Salvador \u2013 as malaria-free this year, and a further 25 are on track to end malaria transmission by 2025,\u201d Ghebreyesus said.\n\nHe said the WHO also made an historic recommendation for broad use of the world\u2019s first malaria vaccine.\n\nServices for non-communicable diseases have also been hit, with more than half of countries surveyed between June and October, reporting disruptions to services for diabetes, cancer screening and treatment, and management of hypertension.\n\nSumming up a tumultuous year, he also noted that several important steps had been taken to strengthen the global health architecture, and WHO itself.\n\n\u201cWe launched the WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence in Berlin; We broke ground on the WHO Academy in Lyon; We established the WHO BioHub System,\u201d he said.\n\nIn early December, Member States agreed to negotiate the world\u2019s first new agreement on pandemic preparedness and response.\n\n\u201cWe have also taken decisive steps to address instances of sexual exploitation and abuse and to make sure that our people meet the high standards that we, and our Member States, expect of them.\n\n\u201cWe took decisive steps to address sexual exploitation, following shocking revelations of alleged abuse committed by some WHO staff during the deadly tenth Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201c2022 must be the year we end the pandemic,\u201d said the director general, but to prevent a future disaster on the same scale, all countries must invest in resilient health systems, build on primary care, with universal health coverage as the goal.\n\n\u201cWhen people can\u2019t access the services they need, or can\u2019t afford them, individuals, families, communities and entire societies are put at risk.\n\n\u201cIn the year ahead, WHO is committed to doing everything in our power to end the pandemic, and to beginning a new era in global health \u2013 an era in which health is at the centre of every country\u2019s development plans,\u201d he said.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "By Dapo Akinrefon\n\nNigerian Ambassador to Benin Republic, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai (retd), weekend, canvassed for strong and innovative think tank as a panacea to Nigeria\u2019s development.\n\nSpeaking at the ground breaking ceremony of Tukur Buratai Research Centre, TBRC, at the weekend in Keffi, Nasarawa State, the former Chief of Army Staff said TBRC will fill the vacuum in the area of research and policy development, especially in the areas of security and defence, peace, conflict management, climate change, leadership and development.\n\nBuratai stated that his passion for human capital development was borne out of his genuine desire to give back to the system and contribute his own quota.\n\nHis words: \u201cOne may want to know why a retired General cum diplomat will decide to collaborate with a university to set up a think-tank like TBRC. Since this a straight question, I will respond with an answer that is precise and straight to the point. My simple philosophy about life is to continue to live a life of value by improving on the system that we have, and as someone coming from the military, I reckoned that the best way for me and my associates to add value to our society and make our country better and stronger is through a think-tank like TBRC.\n\n\u201cLet me make it categorically clear to us that one of the factors that helped the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries is strong and innovative think-tanks. As far back as 1831, the Duke of Wellington set up the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies with the aim of helping policy makers navigate through complex policy problems.\n\nThen the London Fabian Society which got established in 1884, home to Sydney and Beatrice Webbs, who later founded the London School of Economics. In 1919, scholars like Lionel Curtis of the Oxford University spearheaded the establishment of a think-tank to explore international problems and advocate policy solutions.\n\n\u201cAfter that, we saw the emergence of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 1916, which in 1927, merged with two other institutions to form the widely acclaimed Brookings Institution. I believe that there exists a gap in our polity that \u201cTBRC as a think-tank can fill through research and policy development especially in the areas of security and defence, peace, conflict management, climate change, leadership and development.\u201d\n\nBuratai, who noted that development in every sector of the country should not be left alone for the government, he said all hands must be on deck if Nigeria must achieve the Eldorado it craves for.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe need development in every sector of our national life, and this is something that should not be left for the government alone to do. As I have said in so many fora, there can be no real development without security and peace, and in the same vain, there must be economic opportunities, equity and justice for security and peace to exist which in turn serves as the foundation or pillars of development.\n\n\u201cTBRC will devote attention to the interplay between these critical factors taking cognisance of our environment and its peculiarities with a view to coming up with policies that can help the government. Our objective is geared towards a more secured and better Nigeria for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIncreased productivity, improved socioeconomic well-being, increased income, infrastructure development, job creation, and improved quality of local produce for both domestic and international markets remain the hallmarks of a well-thought-out research initiative and development agenda by a prosperous nation led by a visionary/corrupt-free leader.\n\nThe anticipated benefits of a functional research and development program include training people with the necessary capacity to conduct economic tasks with an appreciable degree of skill, hence achieving maximum production.\n\nThese capacities include equipping individuals with the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to successfully harness and exploit the potentials found in their surroundings. Nigeria\u2019s current situation demonstrates that it is a populous nation with a plethora of potentials but insufficient capabilities to transfer these potentials into socioeconomic reforms.\n\n\u201cEvidence abounds in nations throughout the world that house research centre dedicated to developing necessary initiatives and or strategies that will aid in mitigating development issues and maximizing environmental potential. While a few of nations have achieved significant milestones and or breakthroughs in this area, many others are still struggling to find their footing in terms of designing mechanisms by which their potentials can be fully realized.\n\n\u201cResearch entails an in-depth investigation of an object or situation with the goal of promoting development and progress. It is a process that involves the collection of reliable and usable information and data on the subject of the research, as well as the analysis of the data acquired in order to reach a legitimate conclusion. Thus, the primary purpose of research is to uncover answers to important questions targeted at resolving societal problems.\n\n\u201cI must say that research and well-informed policy frameworks are indispensables to those in the positions of leadership. We leave in a globalized world and things now move with break neck speed.\n\n\u201cThe world of today is no longer an environment that responds to those who have military might or have numerical strength; it also doesn\u2019t give a damn if a country has an armada of natural resources like the one we have in Nigeria. \u201cSometimes, I picture those in positions of leadership as sailors of ship cruising on the ocean, supposedly taking their people to the Promised Land.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s world simply responds and obeys those who are well informed and those who have fool-proofed policies.\n\n\u201cThis is why research centres and think-tanks like TBRC are critical to success of every leader. There is no gainsaying the fact that leadership without well-informed and fool proofed policies will lack clear vision and direction. This is the major cause of setbacks in most African nations.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2018Monarch accused me of being too stingy with money\u2019\n\nAs governor of Osun State, Chief Bisi Akande had problems with the immediate past Ooni of Ife, Oba Okuade Sijuwade, and the Owa-Obokun of Ijeshaland, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran.\n\nAkande, in his book, \u2018My Participations\u2019, said the late Sijuwade wanted him to plunge the state into debt by taking a loan for a water project the Oba had an\n\ninterest in.\n\nHe also said Oba Aromolaran was always saying bad things about him because of his belief that he was stingy.\n\n\u201cI was not surprised that most of the obas did not want to associate with the Owa-Obokun, His Majesty, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran.\n\n\u201cOne day he came to me to complain that he had no car. I told him that Osun State had no money now to buy cars for traditional rulers.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cBut his pestering was too much and I secretly sent money to him to buy a car.\n\n\u201cI went to meet him at his palace in Ilesha and told him that he should use the money I sent to buy a car. He then called Lere Adebayo.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to know how much of the money he should return to me! Lere then told him, \u2018Don\u2019t try that with Akande o! Ajemonu tie niyen!!\u2019\n\n\u201cMaybe that was the practice before my time. A few weeks after that incident, the Commissioner of Police was changed and the new man was touring the state and when he got to Ilesha, the Owa called him aside.\n\n\u201cHe told the CP that the only person he should be careful of within the state was Governor Akande. \u2018He is too stingy with money,\u2019 Kabiyesi said. The Commissioner of Police reported to me.\n\n\u201cSo one day the Owa came again to report to me Mr Niran Fajuke, the chairman of the local government in Ilesha. He complained that Fajuke was not taking good care of him.\n\n\u201cI accused him, saying, \u2018Baba, you too are not sometimes a nice person. Even after I gave you money secretly to buy a car, you still told the new Commissioner of Police that I was dangerous and stingy!\u2019\n\n\u201cOn another day, I met Owa alongside Rauf Aregbesola in Bola Tinubu\u2019s house at Bourdillon and tried to warn Aregbesola to be careful with Owa Aromolaran. Among the Obas and chiefs, the Owa seemed unpopular,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the Owa had a long-standing grudge against Ooni Sijuwade who wanted to dominate the entire space.\n\n\u201cOoni wanted to make an entourage of the smaller obas with a view to tormenting the Owa and other obas who might be opposed to him. He would give them money.\n\n\u201cWhat worried me with bringing the smaller obas into the Council of Obas to make them have an equal ranking with the other paramount rulers was that it might undermine the age-old tradition of the Yoruba people.\n\n\u201cAs far as my government was concerned, only three obas were paramount in Osun State: The Ooni, the Orangun and the Owa,\u201d he said.\n\nAkande added that when his old boss at BP, the Ajalorunof Ijebu-Ife, Ogun State, wanted to honour him with the traditional title of Jagunmolu Oodua, the late Ooni opposed it.\n\n\u201cHe wrote him a letter insisting that he being the Arole Oodua, was the only one who could confer a title with the word \u2018Oodua\u2019 as part of its name.\n\n\u201cHe warned that if Oba Oguntayo should go ahead he would incur the wrath of the Yoruba deities. The Ajalorun wisely went ahead and I received the title. The Ajalorun has been waxing stronger since then.\n\n\u201cThe Ajalorun is one of the most ancient of Yoruba traditional thrones and like all other leading obas, the throne originated from the House of Oduduwa in lle-Ife.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Ijebu-Ife is regarded as a replica of the old Ile-Ife. But the problem I had with the Ooni was more serious and graver and it also had to do with money,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the late Ooni wanted him to renew the Ede-Osogbo Waterworks which was to be repaired with $300 million.\n\nHe refused to sanction the deal.",

Look at what happened to Bola Ige!\u201d\n\nAkande said he was enraged and screamed at Obasanjo on the phone of the then commissioner of police: \u2018You must be out of your mind Mr President!\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cHow can you say lapses in my security when Bola Ige was killed in Ibadan?

You know that Bola Ige too was my friend! What happened was very unfortunate!\u201d\n\nHe also relived how he heard of the incident: \u201cIn the evening of December 23, 2001, I returned from a trip to the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cI was met at the Murtala International Airport by a team of top officials from Osun State, including my Attorney General, Dr Yemi Adedeji and Sola Akinwumi, the SSG.\n\n\u201cI drove in my car with Akinwumi and we headed for Osogbo. We took the old road from Ibadan, passing Iwo to Osogbo.\n\n\u201cWe had passed Iwo and getting close to Osogbo when Akinwumi\u2019s phone rang. Muyiwa Ige was on the other end.\n\n\u201cAkinwumi was just shouting Ah! Ah! Ah!! Then, the line went off. \u2018Uncle Bola has been killed!\u2019 Akinwumi announced flatly when he finally gathered himself.\n\n\u201cI was in shock! I did not know what to do. For the second time in my life, I had suddenly become an orphan again.\n\n\u201cIge was more than a political mentor to me. He was my uncle, my friend, my confidant.\n\n\u201cHis loyalty was total and his love was deep and profound. For me, he was irreplaceable.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cWhen we arrived at the Government House, I gathered my entourage together and broke the tragic news to them.\n\n\u201cThere was an uproar \u2013 groaning and moaning and general confusion. Someone suggested we should pray.\n\n\u201cWe bowed down our heads and prayed. By the time the prayer ended, I noticed that the Commissioner of Police was now with us.\n\n\u201cHe had walked into the centre gingerly and was now standing close to me. Before we greeted, his phone started ringing. He gave me the phone.\n\n\u201cIt was President Obasanjo on the other end.\n\nIt occurred to me that what concerned the President more was not to arrest the assassins of his friend, but to prevent social unrest and calm the nerves of the populace.\n\n\u201cI told him we would take all necessary measures to prevent a breakdown of law and order.\n\n\u201cI sent messages to traditional rulers and other leaders that night\u2026\u201d",

That didn\u2019t make me to have a change of opinion about Obasanjo.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI have never seen anything genuine about him despite his self-glorification,\u201d Akande wrote.\n\nHe claimed the ex-president\u2019s nationalism and patriotism were fake, adding that his ambition to be the centre of Nigeria\u2019s universe made him express constant hatred for the late Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cIt was this vaunting ambition that made him express constant hatred to the most altruistic and selfless leader of our time, Chief Obafemi Awolowo.\n\n\u201cHe continues to wonder till tomorrow why the Yoruba people, especially after his tour of duty as a two-time President, continue to elevate Awolowo to the highest pedestal while they have no respect for him. So, he would wonder to his grave!\n\n\u201cIn his detestations for Awolowo, he is ruled by a virulent inferiority complex, believing that he needed to do everything to supplant the greatness of Awolowo or undermine his legacies.\n\n\u201cThat was why he launched the Universal Basic Education in 1978, knowing that free education would be the core of Awolowo programme for the Second Republic.\n\n\u201cThat was also why he continued in this line during his two-term disastrous presidency.\n\n\u201cFor the reason that I was not dancing to his tune, Obasanjo did everything to depress and discredit my government and undermine us in Osun state.\n\n\u201cIndeed, he wanted my government to collapse and once I had problem with Omisore, he adopted him as a willing tool and railroaded him into the Senate despite his detention for the assassination of Bola Ige,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe accused Obasanjo of ordering that Osun State should be short-paid by N216 million monthly from the Federal Allocation.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, we were earning about N150 million when our salary bill was about N260 million.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, the price of crude oil was rising and the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) was back in the account.\n\n\u201cSo instead, of our own income to move from N150 to N300 million, we were experiencing reduction.\n\n\u201cSuddenly also, they decided deducting N216 million from our allocation.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Budget Office in Abuja to find out why they were making the deductions and we were told it was \u2018order from above,\u2019 meaning they were acting on a directive from the Presidency.\n\n\u201cMy finance commissioner, in frustration, advised that perhaps we should bribe them. I said \u201cNo\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know what the cause of this order from above was but we didn\u2019t find out anything. They did this for a few other states too.\n\n\u201cThey claimed they were deducting for some inexplicable international debts.\n\n\u201cBut I came to know the sinister motive when Oyinlola became governor and they paid the arrears of the deductions to his government,\u201d Akande added in the autobiography.",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Oladesu, Deputy Editor and Toba Adedeji, Osogbo\n\nAfenifere leader: I won\u2019t sue Akande\n\nOyinlola denies allegations\n\nAfenifere Acting Leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, has said he will not take former Osun State Governor Bisi Akande to court over his comments about him in his book, My Participations.\n\nBut the elder statesman denied that his Lekki house, which is a bone of contention between him and Akande, was built for him by the All Progressives Congress (APC) stalwart, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nAlso, Akande\u2019s predecessor, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, who denied the allegations against him, alleged that Akande financed his 2003 re-election bid by collecting part-payment from the contractor building the Governor\u2019s Office.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOyinlola, who is also a former Lagos State military administrator, said he had warned Akande against creating a wedge between himself and his former deputy, Chief Iyiola Omisore.\n\nThe retired Brigadier-General said his own autobiography will answer Akande\u2019s allegations against him.\n\nAlso, Adebanjo told reporters in Lagos that three years ago, when he launched his book, titled: Saying It As It Is, Tinubu described him as an incorruptible person and man of great character.\n\nThe Afenifere leader urged the anti-graft agency to probe how Akande built his houses at Ila, his home town in Osun State, and Ibadan, the Oyo State capital.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo intention to sue. The allegations and my responses are now before the public.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman said he built his house from his sweat, adding that he also sold his landed property, including the land given to him by the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, to build the Lekki house.\n\nAdebanjo added: \u201cI hereby authorise the EFCC to verify the facts.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader said he has no reason to ask for money from Asiwaju Tinubu after he left office since he never demanded such from him before he became governor.\n\nDescribing Akande\u2019s allegations as \u201cmalicious falsehood\u201d, Adebanjo challenged the former Osun State governor to disclose how he got his own property as he had done.\n\nAccording to him, Akande \u201cis a neophyte, a beneficiary of a struggle he never took part in\u201d.\n\nGiving details of how he built his house, Adebanjo said: \u201cI deny the lie propagated by Akande. I wish to state categorically that my house at Lekki was built with my resources through the sale of three developed properties, loan from GTBank and the sale of undeveloped landed property given me by my former leader, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, of blessed memory.\u201d\n\nOyinlola, in a statement in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, maintained that Akande accused him wrongly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Osun State Governor\u2019s Office (Bola Ige House) contract, Chief Akande said I wrongly accused him of corruption in the construction of the Governor\u2019s Office. I did not level any false charges against him. I came into office in May 2003 and discovered that the Governor\u2019s Office complex, which Akande commissioned for use after he lost the election, was not completed.\n\n\u201cThe state government asked the contractor to come back to the site and complete the works; more so when evidence in government accounts showed that he had been paid. But the project consultant shocked everyone with his claim that part of the payment was taken back to finance the 2003 re-election bid of Chief Akande.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe consultant said the contractor could not go back to work unless he was paid his full dues. One of Akande\u2019s appointees confessed collecting money from this contractor for Akande\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cI consulted Chief Akande on this. He denied having any deal with the contractor and the consultant. Some people were subsequently taken to court on a seven-count criminal charge. Stakeholders in the state and Alhaji Arisekola Alao later intervened. I have the details of who collected how much in my forthcoming book\u2026\u201d\n\nOyinlola alleged that Akande made N800 million advance payments to contractors in his last days in office, despite complaining that there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, leading to mass retrenchment.\n\n\u201cChief Akande wrote on the Government House that he wanted to build on a site on Ilesa Road in Osogbo, which I stopped. I found it strange that Chief Akande, who boasted that he was prudent and honest as governor, awarded the construction of a Government House in his last days in office, after he lost the election and in advance paid the contractors the entire contract sum of N800 million. Chief Akande confirmed this strange payment on page 393 of his book.\n\n\u201cThis was a man who said there was no money to pay workers and pensioners, but he had enough to pay a contractor in advance for a Government House after losing his re-election. In any case, the state already had an ongoing Government House started by the military government, which Akande refused to complete.\n\n\u201cI completed the project and added chalets plus a presidential lodge. Everything was completed and commissioned within my first year in office. The state has continued to use the structures till date.\u201d",

So, we assigned a chalet to him at the Government House.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI attended the ceremony as a mark of honour to him. I thought I should encourage him to link up with us in Osun.\n\n\u201cI was encouraging him but did not know how to say it. First, his background was not Osun.\n\n\u201cSecond, a Commissioner for Works in Lagos controls a far bigger budget than the Governor of Osun State.\n\n\u201cBeing a native of our state, he could be thinking of doing something different in future.\n\n\u201cSo, I started introducing him to people and encouraging him to be part of us. That was how we linked up with Rauf Aregbesola,\u201d Akande recalled.\n\nWhen Omisore was impeached, he discussed with Tinubu about having Aregbesola as his deputy.\n\n\u201cHe promised to get back to me. We didn\u2019t see often and the phone was not efficient in those days.\n\n\u201cTinubu had something doing in Seattle, in the western coast of the United States where he was to be honoured by his old American school. He invited me.\n\n\u201cThe second or third day, Rauf appeared in my hotel room. He said Tinubu said I wanted to talk to him. I asked him to take a seat.\n\n\u201cI offered him the post of deputy governor which would be confirmed by the House of Assembly. Afterwards, I would be able to ease myself out.\n\n\u201cHe thanked me and said he would come back to me. Instead of him, it was Tinubu who came.\n\n\u201cHe said: \u2018That boy is shy and he didn\u2019t know how to put it.\u2019 Tinubu explained that Rauf was holding an important position for him in Alimosho local government politics and that he would still need him for mobilisation leading to the 2003 general elections.\n\n\u201cHe apologised that it would not be possible for him to release Rauf. He said I should look for someone else and after my second term, we would think of the next step,\u201d Akande said.\n\nHe added that Tinubu said after the election, Aregbesola would come to learn more about Osun and its politics.\n\n\u201cSo, he chose Sooko Adewoyin, an elderly and experienced person from Ile Ife who was introduced to him by Prince Peter Ogunleye as his deputy.\n\n\u201cAt the appointed time, Rauf indeed came to Osun and he proved equal to the task, becoming the first Governor of Osun State to spend full two terms,\u201d he said.",

Buhari also noted that adopting direct primaries has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government, as constitutionally insured.\n\nThe president said the conduct of direct primaries would lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties, as well as the increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nHe explained that the direct consequences of the high cost are monetization and that it will drive and increase the financial crimes and constitutes further strain on the economy. In his view, Buhari said it will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilize all party members for the primaries, a situation which he said is not healthy for the sustenance of multiparty democracy in Nigeria.\n\nHe further stated that security agencies will also be overstretched, as direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry.\n\n\u201cSuch large turnout without effective security coordination, will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues on the outcomes of such election\u201d, he said.\n\nSignificantly, Buhari said: \u201cThe amendment as proposed is the violation of the underlying spirit of democracy, which is characterized by freedom of choices of which political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right of freedom of association.\u201d\n\nHe also said the proposed amendment might also give rise to a plethora of litigations based on diverse grounds and issues of law, including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment could not work in retrospect, given that the existing constitution of the parties already registered with the INEC permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries.\n\nPresident Buhari said his decision is based on informed advise by relevant ministries, departments and agencies of the government, and careful review of the bill in light of the current realities prevalent in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the circumstances.\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency has said the National Assembly is free to make public President Buhari\u2019s reasons for withholding assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021.\n\n\u201cThe President has sent a letter to the National Assembly stating his position on the bill amending the electoral act.

          "text": "\u201c The amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy, which is characterised by freedom of choices. Political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of association.\u201d\n\n\u2022Wike: N\u2019Assembly lacks will power to override President\n\nObinna Chima\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, notified the National Assembly of his resolve to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nThe president in a letter to the leadership of the National Assembly, exclusively obtained by THISDAY, clearly highlighted his reasons for refusing to sign the bill into law.\n\nBuhari, whose letter to the lawmakers was obtained by THISDAY on the last day of the 30 days stipulated in the constitution for him to communicate his position on the bill, stressed that political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of either direct or indirect primaries to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities might permit.\n\nHe argued that direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 would significantly raise the cost of conducting primary elections by political parties and could have negative implications on the outcome of elections.\n\nIn the letter titled: \u201cWithholding of Assent to Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021,\u201d Buharistated: \u201cFurther to the letter dated 18th November, 2021 forwarded for Presidential assent, the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, as passed by the National Assembly, I have received informed advice from relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the government, and have also carefully reviewed the bill in light of the current realities prevalent in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the circumstances.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that arising from the review, it was worthy to note that the conduct of elections for the nomination of party candidates solely via direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, \u201chas serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, which cannot be accommodated at the moment considering our nation\u2019s peculiarities.\u201d\n\nThis, Buhari further said, \u201calso has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\u201d\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, seeks to amend certain provisions of the extant Electoral Act 2010. Part of the objective of the Bill is the amendment of the present Section 87 of the Electoral Act, 2010 to delete the provision for the conduct of indirect primaries in the nomination of party candidates such that party candidates can henceforth only emerge through direct primaries.\n\n\u201cThe conduct of direct primaries across the 8,809 wards across the length and breadth of the country will lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties as well as increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by INEC, who has to deploy monitors across these wards each time a party is to conduct direct primaries for the presidential, gubernatorial and legislative posts.\n\n\u201cThe addition of these costs with the already huge cost of conducting general elections will inevitably lead to huge financial burden on both the political parties, INEC and the economy in general at a time of dwindling revenues.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the president held that the indirect consequences of the issues of high cost and monetisation were that it would raise financial crimes and constitute further strain on the economy.\n\nIt will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilise all party members for the primaries, he said.\n\nAccording to him, this would not be healthy for the sustenance of multi-party democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition to increased costs identified above, conducting and monitoring primary elections across 8,809 wards will pose huge security challenges as the security agencies will also be overstretched, direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry and such large turn-out without effective security coordination will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues for the outcomes of such elections.\n\n\u201cThe amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy, which is characterised by freedom of choices. Political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of association. Several millions of Nigerians are not card-carrying members of any political party.\n\n\u201cThus, the emphasis should be on enabling qualified Nigerians to vote for the candidate of their choice during general election as a means of participation in governance and furtherance of the concept of universal adult suffrage or universal franchise.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, he noted that the proposed amendment might also give rise to \u201cplethora of litigations based on diverse grounds and issues of law including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment cannot work in retrospect given that the existing constitution of the parties already registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries.\n\n\u201cThis real possibility, will, without doubt, truncate the electoral programme of the nation as another electoral exercise is imminent towards a change of Government in 2023. Nigeria is at the moment still grappling with the issues of monetisation of the political process and vote buying at both party and general election.\n\n\u201cThe direct implication of institutionalising only direct primaries is the aggravation of over[1]monetisation of the process as there will be much more people a contestant needs to reach out to thereby further fuelling corruption and abuse of office by incumbent contestants,who may resort to public resources to satisfy the increased demands and logistics of winning party primaries,\u201d he argued.\n\nBuhari also insisted that direct primaries would be subjected or susceptible to manipulation or malpractices as most parties cannot boast of reliable and verified membership register or valid means of identification, which therefore means non-members could be recruited to vote by wealthy contestants to influence the outcome.\n\n\u201cRival parties can also conspire and mobilise people to vote against a good or popular candidate in a party during its primaries just to pave way for their own candidates. Whereas where voting is done by accredited delegates during indirect primaries, the above irregularities are not possible.\n\n\u201cThe major conclusions arrived at upon the review are highlighted hereunder, to wit: Asides its serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, the limitation or restriction of the nomination procedures available to political parties and their members constitutes an affront to the right to freedom of association.\n\n\u201cIt is thus undemocratic to restrict the procedure or means of nomination of candidates by political parties, as it also amounts to undue interference in the affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries or collegiate elections are part of internationally accepted electoral practices. More so, direct primaries are not free from manipulations and do not particularly guarantee the emergence of the will of the people especially, in circumstances like ours,where it is near impossible to sustain a workable implementation framework or structure thereof.\n\n\u201cIn the premise of the above, I hereby signify to the National Assembly that I am constrained to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cIt is my considered position that the political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of direct or indirect primaries to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities may permit. Please accept, the assurance of my highest consideration and esteem,\u201d Buhari stated.\n\nWike: N\u2019Assembly Can\u2019t Veto Buhari\u2019s Refusal to Sign Electoral Bill\n\nRivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, has said the National Assembly lacked the temerity to veto President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s withholding of assent tp the Electoral Act amendment bill.\n\nHe said the reason was because it was part of the All Progressives Congress (APC) scheme to allegedly deny Nigerians free, fair and transparent election in 2023.\n\nGovernor Wike spoke yesterday at the flag-off of Chokocho-Igbodo Road in Etche Local Government Area of the state.\n\nAccording to him, the only way for Nigerians not to repeat the 2015 and 2019 mistakes of voting the APC-led federal government into power was to send them packing in 2023.\n\nThe Rivers State governor recalled that, \u201cThree weeks ago I told Nigerians that there is a conspiracy not to have a free, fair, transparent election in 2023 and that conspiracy was very clear. And I told Nigerians, Mr President will not sign the Electoral Act amendment bill.\u201d\n\nWike stated that having known the modus operandi, style and strategy of the APC, it was obvious to him and all discerning minds that the clause on direct primaries was inserted into the Electoral Act amendment bill as a ploy for the president to refuse assent to the bill.\n\nHe said the APC members were afraid that if results were transmitted electronically, they would not survive the 2023 general election.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhat APC resolved in the meeting they had was that their problem is not necessarily direct primaries, but the electronic transmission of result in 2023. If they allow that, obviously APC will lose the election in 2023 and they told themselves that the only way we can survive that is to include the direct primaries in the bill so that Mr President can use that as an excuse, that he will not sign the bill.\u201d\n\nHe accused the APC governors and their National Assembly members of allegedly deceiving Nigerians that they were engaged in battle of supremacy over the issue of direct primaries, whereas they had secretly agreed to scuttle the possibility of transmitting election result electronically in 2023.\n\nThe Rivers governor said, unfortunately, the National Assembly does not have what it takes to veto the president\u2019s refusal to assent to the bill, because they were not interested in protecting the interest of Nigerians and ensuring that elections were free and fair with the electronic transmission of election results.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, you don\u2019t have a National Assembly that has what it takes, that will stand for the people, that will say, look, we were elected by the people and we want to give the people the best. Nobody in the National Assembly, not even the leadership can have what it takes to say Mr President, for the interest of Nigerians, we are going to veto this your refusal.\u201d\n\nThe governor maintained that because APC did not consider the interest of Nigerians as priority, its leaders were immersed in crisis, jostling for benefits that could fan their personal egos.\n\nHe said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was different, because it was waxing stronger as a true political party, and working everyday in improving the socioeconomic conditions of the people in PDP-controlled states.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Sanwo-Olu: It\u2019s the largest bond ever by a sub-national in Nigeria\n\nSegun James\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu yesterday signed a N137.3 billion 10-year bond to finance key infrastructural projects in the state.\n\nAt 13 per cent, the debt instrument is under the N500 billion fourth debt series expected to run between 2021 and 2031.\n\nAt the signing ceremony which took place at the State House, Alausa in the presence of the 24 issuing houses and eight trustees among others, the governor said the bond was to finance key infrastructure projects, on roads and healthcare.\n\nThese he listed to include the Lagos-Badagry Expressway, Lekki Regional Road, Rehabilitation of Ijeododo road and Rehabilitation of the alternative route to Admiralty Circle Toll Plaza.\n\n\u201cIn the last eight months, and with the unwavering support of our transaction advisers, we have been able to achieve this laudable feat \u2014 which to some observers had seemed impossible.\n\n\u201cWe set out to raise up to N125 billion and closed the Book Build with bids totalling N137.3 billion. This strong response from the investing community \u2013 to our administration\u2019s debut bond issuance \u2013 is humbling and is indeed a testament to continued investor confidence in the state\u2019s ability to deliver on its infrastructural and socio-economic developmental objectives; and to meet repayment obligations.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the significantly over-subscribed book, and active participation from a wide array of institutional investors \u2013 including banks, pension fund administrators, asset managers and corporates, Lagos State has maintained its discipline on size and pricing. Mindful of the prevailing yield environment, the Series IV Issuance was maintained at N137.3 Billion and cleared at a coupon of 13 per cent per annum. Only bids within the clearing bid were accepted,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe issuing houses were led by Managing Director Chapel Hill, Denam, Kemi Awodehin.\n\nSanwo-Olu added: \u201cIt gives me great pleasure to preside over this ceremony and to welcome you all, as Lagos State once again celebrates another milestone in the Nigerian domestic debt capital markets, with the issuance of the largest bond ever by a sub-national in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThis was also be the third time a sub-national would be issuing a long-date Bond (10 years), following the debut issuance of a 10-year instrument in 2017.\n\n\u201cWe are gathered here for the signing of the necessary documents required by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) to finalise the issuance of Lagos State\u2019s N137.3 billion 13 per cent 2021/2031 Fixed Rate Bond Series IV Bond Issuance, under the N500 billion fourth debt issuance programme.\n\n\u201cThe conclusion of this process will bring to N377.715 billion the total value of bond issued from the Lagos State N500 billion debt issuance programme.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment I formally received my mandate in May 2019, the imperative to drive our THEMES agenda aggressively has been clear. In order to adequately kick-start the funding of our projects, we formally commenced this issuance process in April 2021.\n\n\u201cIn line with the state\u2019s vision to build a Greater Lagos, the proceeds of the Bond will be used to finance key infrastructure projects, primarily in roads and healthcare. These include the Lekki Regional Road, Rehabilitation of Ijeododo road and Rehabilitation of the alternative route to Admiralty Circle Toll Plaza.\n\n\u201cThese projects will contribute to a better quality of living for our people, while also creating a more enabling environment for commercial and economic activity. There is no doubt \u2014 and we have seen this from previous interventions \u2014 that the multiplier social and economic effects will more than justify the cost of the investment.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the Federal Ministry of Finance, PenCom and the Debt Management Office Nigeria, for their support and collaboration. Our appreciation also goes to the Securities & Exchange Commission.\n\n\u201cWe equally thank the investing community for their sustained support of Lagos State and our efforts to improve the social and economic welfare of all residents in Lagos. We do not take for granted your enthusiastic response to our Bond offer.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to uphold our commitment to remain the most responsible issuer in the Nigerian capital market.\u201d\n\nIn another development, Sanwo-Olu yesterday inaugurated nine network of roads and a bridge expected to cater for 300,000 people in the Kosofe area of the state.\n\nWith a total length of 2.840km, the roads are to improve connectivity in the Kosofe area of Lagos mainland.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cToday bears testimony to the fulfilment of our administration\u2019s promise to ensure continuity of governance by completing projects that were inherited from the previous administration, especially those that are directly beneficial to the well-being of our people.\n\n\u201cIn addition to initiating new projects, we have expended huge resources on the completion of several projects which cut across different sectors in all parts of the state.\n\n\u201cSoluyi Community is a strategic settlement with a fast growing population in need of infrastructural renewal. This prompted our decision to prioritize the completion of this network of roads, with a total length of 2.840km, including a bridge, which will serve a population of more than 300,000 people, within the Soluyi-Araromi-Ifako-Gbagada Communities.\n\n\u201cThese projects exist as a testament to our administration\u2019s resolve to continue to provide the necessary infrastructure for sustainable development, in every part of the state.\n\n\u201cWith the completion of these projects, our administration has once again demonstrated the topmost priority that we accord to the welfare and well-being of the people of Lagos, in line with our Greater Lagos Vision, and the Traffic Management and Transportation Pillar of our THEMES Governing Agenda.\n\n\u201cThe ever-increasing number of people living in Lagos, and the attendant rise in vehicular traffic volumes and axle loads are partly responsible for the issues we face regarding road infrastructure in the State. Our administration will continue to respond to this challenge by stepping up our efforts in the area of construction and rehabilitation of roads and highways, and the expansion of our transportation network, with renewed focus on our multimodal transport strategy.\n\n\u201cWe can and will take some pressure off our roads by utilizing our waterways and by rail technology. This is why we are pushing ahead with determination on the Lagos Light Rail project, as well as the construction of jetties and deployment of boats and ferries across the State.\n\n\u201cI want to implore the Community Development Association of this area to immediately assume ownership of and responsibility for the judicious use of these projects/roads. You must care for them with devotion and dedication, and keep them clean, and the drainage free of waste, at all times.\u201d\n\nThe Governor highlighted some of the benefits of the roads to include as an alternative route to the Third Mainland Bridge (TMB) and Apapa-Oworonsoki Expressway via the Third Axial underpass; to address the perennial environmental and infrastructural challenges among others.\n\nWelcoming the audience, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Works and Infrastructure, Engr Aramide Adeyoye said, \u201cFor us, the driving force behind this is to ensure connectivity and reduce the burden and pressure on major arterial roads that link to an integrated intermodal transport system which in turn opens up the local economy.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, prior to the project inception, the only access in and out of Soluyi Community, Gbagada, was via the ever- busy Ayodele Okeowo Road abutting Deeper Christian Life Bible Church.\n\n\u201cThe attendant traffic gridlock arising from high vehicular volume during peak periods necessitated the provision of an alternative route to ameliorate the discomfort, residents around the area experience while also addressing environmental challenges, particularly flooding due to inadequate drainage system.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says Nigeria has recorded 500% rise in infection\n\n\u2022FCTA announces surge in new virus cases\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo and\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has launched its yuletide season campaign with the theme: #CelebrateResponsibly as part of measures to reduce spread of the COVID-19 during the yuletide.\n\nAccording to the NCDC, Nigeria has recorded a 500 per cent increase in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases over the past two weeks across the country due to the Delta and Omicron variants.\n\nA statement by the centre yesterday said the campaign tagged, \u201c#TakeResponsibility campaign\u201d first began in February, 2020\n\nIt focuses specifically on measures Nigerians needed to take to protect themselves and loved ones from COVID-19 during this period.\n\nThe NCDC said the campaign was targeting the entertainment industry, transport industry, religious settings, media, security personnel, young people, and the general public to promote adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures during this festive period.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cAs of 19th December 2021, a total of 223,887 cases and 2985 deaths have been recorded in Nigeria across all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cThe country is now in a fourth COVID-19 wave.\n\n\u201cThe federal government through the Presidential Steering\n\nCommittee on COVID-19, the Federal Ministry of Health, as well as NCDC and its partners, are therefore intensifying risk communication efforts to remind Nigerians of the risk we face and need to take collective responsibility to reduce transmission of the virus.\u201d\n\nThe NCDC said the response to COVID-19 required a whole-of-society approach.\n\n\u201cTherefore, individuals, families and institutions also need to play their part in protecting each other by ensuring adherence to COVID-19 public health and social measures.\n\n\u201cCritically, Nigerians are urged to adhere to recommended measures by NCDC and other public health authorities, as they celebrate Christmas and New Year,\u201d it added.\n\nThe Centre advised Nigerians to avoid all non-essential travel within and outside Nigeria to reduce the risk of transmission.\n\nIn a related development, the FCT Administration has disclosed that it had detected almost 3,000 new cases of COVID-19, indicating the escalation in the spread of the virus which is now in its fourth wave in the country.\n\nThe Secretary of FCT Health and Human Services Secretariat (HHSS), Dr. Abubakar Tafida, raised the alarm yesterday at a media briefing where he provided insights on the spread of the pandemic in the territory.\n\nHe pleaded with residents of the Federal Capital Territory to minimise physical contacts and other non-pharmaceutical measures to control the spread of the virus.\n\nIn addition, he urged members of the public to maintain social distancing, wear facemasks and wash their hands with soap or hand sanitisers to prevent the escalation of the pandemic.\n\nHe said the secretariat had resolved three weeks ago that the Territory had lapsed into the forth wave of the pandemic following an exponential rise in the number of new cases.\n\nTafida said the health authority confirmed 84 new cases on Sunday to bring the cumulative cases in the FCT to 24,861 since the first wave out of which 224 deaths were recorded.\n\n\u201cNow we have 1,246 active cases. We also noted additional 13 cases in the past 24 hours. In terms of people or cases on admission, we have a total of 105. Of this number, 92 are in THISDAY Dome and13 at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada.\n\nThis, he said signified the severity of the conditions, saying preparedness was key to effectively handling the pandemic.\n\n\u201cSo you can see that within the span of three weeks, we are having almost a thousand plus, so if we continue to neglect these preventive measures, the situation might become very alarming and difficult to handle,\u201d he warned.\n\nHe added that at the last meeting they had evaluated the current situation as well as the increasing number of cases, the Health Secretariat developed strategies that were in consonance with scientific and other available data.\n\nHe implored all stakeholders, including security, traditional, religious leaders, people of note, to ensure that they are supporting the effort, by imploring and advising people to continue to observe these measures.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs we are all aware, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a lot of global upheaval, as there were lots of agitations, destructions , death and socioeconomic hardships.\u201d\n\nHe lamented the vaccine apathy even though there were over 320 teams working within the FCT providing vaccination.\n\nHe warned that in view of the attitude the authority might be compelled to enforce the national vaccination mandate in the territory.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the lead counsel to the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu has said that an undisclosed senior attorney will henceforth lead the defence team of the pro-Biafra separatist leader.\n\nEjiofor revealed that a visit to Kanu in the detention of the Department of State Services (DSS) on Monday was described as \u201ca surprise Christmas present\u201d with the inclusion of the lawyer he called a \u201clegal giant, a consummate member of the Inner Bar, a legal Iroko, who has distinguished himself in the practice of law.\u201d\n\nEjiofor decided not to reveal the identity of the new lawyer who would be in the frontline of Kanu\u2019s legal battle against the Nigerian government, noting that, \u201cWe have opted to desist from publicising to you our legal exploits for certain salutary reasons. It has also become necessary that we show such restraint because of the presence of moles who have infiltrated and literally taken over the social media space.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer said these in an update on his visit to Kanu on Monday, which was made available to SaharaReporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cWe paid our routine visit to our untiring, unwavering, unrelenting, rock-solid and noble client, Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yesterday, at the DSS detention facility at Abuja. The visit, this time, was spectacular and was greeted by an infectious air of camaraderie. Onyendu was particularly enthused by the visit and preferred to describe it as 'A SURPRISE CHRISTMAS PRESENT'.\n\n\u201cYou may not understand the peculiarity of this visit and how significant it is. But in due course, I am certain you will be in the best position to fully appreciate the wisdom that informed it. Suffice it to say that as the lead attorney of Onyendu, I took advantage of the visit to unveil a legal giant, a distinguished and an accomplished member of the Inner Bar, whom I have chosen to fortify our defence team.\n\n\u201cThe learned Senior counsel is an excellent and a consummate learned gentleman, distinguished in academics and in the practice of law in our law courts. The reason that informed this arrangement is my unflinching desire to throw in every weapon in our arsenal to ensure that Onyendu gets the BEST at all times.\n\n\u201cThis latest masterstroke, evident in the legal giant that has intervened, came to Onyendu as a big surprise. Although he was not oblivious of my arrangement to enlist the assistance and co-operation of a Senior attorney, he did not know that I could get a Senior attorney of the rarest breed. He was particularly delighted to welcome this legal giant, a consummate member of the Inner Bar, a legal Iroko, who has distinguished himself in the practice of law when we visited him yesterday.\n\n\u201cI must state here and now that the Senior attorney involved has been my mentor over the years. He has worked from the sidelines with our legal team since 2016. He is a man imbued with profound intellect, legal sophistry, an infectious sense of history, much like Onyendu, and of impeccable character. His brilliance radiates effortlessly. He is indeed an excellent advocate.\n\n\u201cThe stage which we have attained in the court gymnastics involving Onyendu signposts an auspicious time at which to introduce the leading and erudite member of the Inner Bar to our defence team.\n\n\u201cHenceforth, he will lead our defence team in proceedings in court.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting yesterday, we deliberated extensively on other issues. But such deliberations, for tactical reasons, are to remain private for now. I want to assure you, UMUCHINEKE, that our legal team, is, presently, more fortified than ever to do battle in court, and God being on our side, victory is assured,\u201d the statement said further.\n\n\u201cI must hasten to declare to you that we are not relenting in our firm resolve to secure the release of other members who have been unjustly and unlawfully incarcerated in the various detention facilities of Nigeria's security agencies all over the country.\n\n\u201cSome of those persons include Ada Nsukka, Idara, and others, who were recently abducted by lawless and overzealous agents of the state. I assure you that in due course we will effectively utilise the instrumentality of the law to set them at liberty.\n\n\u201cThe mere fact that we do not publicise our legal interventions in the social media space does not mean that we are not taking concrete and effective steps to secure the release of all those unjustly detained. I assure you that we have been taking effective steps and implementing concrete measures geared towards that.\u201d",

          "text": "The founder of the One Love Family, Sat Guru Maharaj Ji, has asked Yoruba leaders to sheathe their swords over the recent book released by former interim National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande.\n\nAkande in his 559-page autobiography titled \u2018My Participations\u2019, launched in Lagos on December 9, 2021, had claimed that the leader of pan-Yoruba socio-political group, Afenifere, Ayo Adebanjo pestered Bola Tinubu to build him a house in Lekki, where he now resides.\n\nHe claimed on Page 415 that the 93-year-old Afenifere leader pestered Tinubu to build him (Adebanjo) the house in Lekki.\n\n\u201cOne day, Sir Olaniwun (Ajayi) was launching a book at Muson Centre, Lagos. After the book presentation, Tinubu said I should not go and that he would like to see me. We met in a small room where he also invited Sir Olaniwun Ajayi. \u2018Papa, you can see that this document is old, Tinubu said as he handed over a big envelope to Ajayi. This is your C of O (Certificate of Occupancy).\n\n\u201cTinubu told me later that after he presented Adebanjo\u2019s C of O to him, Adebanjo was always pestering Tinubu until he helped built a house on the plot.

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our star agents, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our agents tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these agents,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk.

He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering.

That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Want luxury fashion? Play Africa\u2019s first metaverse crypto game",
          "text": "The digital age has seen people try to imitate reality online. A result of this trend is that people are buying the online versions of what they would normally buy in real life: luxury houses, dresses, and even land. For example, this year saw the purchase of the world\u2019s first digital home, sold for over $500,000 on the NFT market. Instead of physical artworks, people now buy Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), digital assets whose ownerships are recorded on the blockchain.\n\nDigital fashion allows designers to model their designs in pixels instead of silk, cotton, lace, or polyester. Digital fashion can be in the form of digital fashion conceived to produce physical garments or fashion that a person can wear only with augmented or virtual reality. Or it can be fashion that is sold directly to an avatar.\n\nPowered by blockchain and NFTs, the digital fashion world is steadily growing. This growth is marked by the emergence of fashion houses like The Fabricant, which creates digital-only fashion; and RTFKT, a company that specialises in making digital sneakers that can be used and traded in virtual spaces as NFTs. In what represents a landmark moment in digital fashion, The Fabricant sold the world\u2019s first digital-only dress, \u201dIridescence\u201d, for $9,500 to a Canadian, Rachel Ma.\n\nThe Fabricant\u2019s \u2018Iridescence\u2019 | @the_fab_ric_ant\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic forced designers to rethink and seek a digital option to showcase their collections, leading to the creation of hyper-real digital showrooms around the world.\n\nA product of digital fashion, hyper-real fashion, is used to explain the use of tech to virtually showcase fashion products. By removing the need for humans to physically examine fashion products, hyper-real fashion tech continues to blur the lines of a prominent human physical experience: shopping.\n\nThis has also led to the development of Obsess, an experiential e-commerce platform, that uses 3D to create 360-degree virtual stores. Their portfolio includes brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dior, and Charlotte Tilbury. \u201cVirtual stores can be created completely digitally and don\u2019t have to exist in real life. Brands use this option to create super engaging experiences for their customers,\u201d says Neha Singh, Obsess\u2019s founder and CEO, in an interview with Vogue India earlier this year.\n\nPositioning for \u201cmeta fashion\u201d\n\nThe metaverse is the use of the combination of technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, and video to create a digital world. The metaverse, unlike the way we currently access the internet, is immersive.\n\nSome of the earliest collaborations between the metaverse and fashion industry can be seen in games. There is Burberry\u2019s first-of-its-kind NFT collection with Mythical Games\u2019 Blankos Block Party, Gucci\u2019s Garden Metaverse with Roblox and their Aria Collection Film at Christie\u2019s, and Louis Vuitton\u2019s \u201cLouis The Game\u201d NFT in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French house\u2019s founding.\n\nWhile it is evident that the metaverse will enjoy massive investments from the fashion industry, the gaming industry is not left behind. Collaboration between the fashion and gaming industry in the metaverse presents a huge economic opportunity. Some notable collaborations in recent times include Balenciaga and Fortnite working together to design accessories and skins, Burberry partnering with Tencent to create exclusively designed skins for Honor of Kings characters.\n\nThe fashion industry is investing in the metaverse to create the branding of the future. While the metaverse is still new and building around it is still ongoing, its building blocks\u2014fashion avatars, digitally designed spaces, exotic pets in games\u2014are not entirely foreign.\n\nIn an attempt to tap into the trend of combining fashion and the digital world, Delz Erinle, a product and UX designer and Niyi Okeowo, an art director, started Thrill Digital, a company that started as a virtual fashion showcase and now pioneers a fashion metaverse. Thrill Digital uses a combination of Web3 technologies like XR (AR/VR), video, audio, crypto, and gaming to create its own fashion metaverse and other unreleased digital products.\n\nDuring the pandemic last year, Erinle saw how difficult it was to shop. So, he decided to bring in Lead Developer and Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Luke Jeffers, to use 3D to create a VR shopping product, to make shopping more accessible and effortless for an audience that was stuck at home.\n\nPivoting from creating the initial idea of a fashion show, Thrill started working on a VR shopping product. Thrill Digital pitched a lot of investors and won Epic Game\u2019s MegaGrant worth $40,000 in January this year to create the VR shopping product. They eventually delivered the product during Lone Design Club fashion week in February.\n\nAfter that, Erinle carried out research in a mall in London where he asked people if they would play a game to win luxury prizes. The feedback they got from people was affirmative. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to create a metaverse project initially. It was like a virtual shopping experience, first, \u201d Erinle said.\n\nThis was how Thrill Digital started Astra, a fashion crypto game where players can win real-life fashion luxury items. The game would have its own crypto token, which must be connected to a crypto wallet like the popular crypto game, Axie Infinity. The game will be open on December 20 and users can play to win a Balenciaga Small Hourglass Tote Bag. When players win a luxury item on Astra, it would be delivered to them wherever they are in the world.\n\nErinle, who doesn\u2019t believe a fully fleshed metaverse has been created yet, explained the metaverse as \u201ca collection of interoperable virtual worlds which people can experience using an avatar. The metaverse is a virtual 3D environment where people can interact but this time with phones; it is an immersive experience.\u201d\n\nLead 3D designer, Charles Egbejule, believes daring to dream they can build a mini metaverse out of Africa was one of the biggest challenges they had to face. While lead VR architect, Adekunbi Ajai, believes building remotely from different parts of the world also poses a challenge for the team. But they were able to adapt and can now easily communicate, she added.\n\nFor the team\u2019s brand designer and co-founder, Niyi Okeowo, one difficulty they faced was raising awareness on a new concept like digital fashion. \u201cWe were trying to sell the product while teaching people about it.\u201d\n\nThe audience that Astra is targeting is people who love fashion, people who use crypto, and people who love games\u2014or people who love all three.\n\nSo here is how the game works: players amass as many crypto tokens as they can within an allotted time, after which a leaderboard is created where winners will be declared and win luxury fashion.\n\nJeffers explained that NFTs would play a huge role in claiming ownership of clothing accessories and land in Astra.\n\nErinle explained that it chose to build its metaverse on the Solana blockchain because of its low gas fees and low energy consumption. Citing a report that says transactions on the Solana blockchain consume less energy than two Google searches, Astra believes it is contributing to the reduction of environmental sustainability issues.\n\nThe game will be available first on PC before VR headsets and, hopefully, mobile devices.\n\nTapping into the play-to-earn trend\n\nLike the play-to-earn crypto game, Axie Infinity, Astra will make money through protocol profits too. Revenue is generated via fees for interacting with a protocol\u2014a game\u2019s unique crypto token.\n\nAxie Infinity made huge profits using a similar approach this year. The leading crypto game has raked in $84.9 million in funds, making its protocol profit one of the biggest in the market. In the case of Axie Infinity, whenever a player sells one of the Axie creatures, he pays a 4.25% marketplace fee. He does this when he sells land or special items. Another way Axie makes money is through the fee of 4 AXS, the game\u2019s native token for \u201cbreeding\u201d more digital creatures called Axies.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ventures Platform launches a $40m fund, invites Seni Sulyman as venture partner",
          "text": "As far back as 2005, Kola Aina knew he wanted to invest in companies. He even registered a company name after his MBA program\u2014one which he\u2019s too embarrassed to share and ended up not using. After a number of rejections, unreplied messages, and bootstrapping his first business, Kola Aina launched Ventures Platform, an early-stage pan-African VC firm, in 2016.\n\nToday, Ventures Platform, announced a $40m fund for African tech startups. The new fund which has reached the first close is being led by the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nThe fund features participation from experienced investors and some new leading names in Africa\u2019s technology and corporate ecosystem,, including UAC Nigeria, VFD Group, Gbenga Oyebode, Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade, as well as global investors like Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and Adam Draper. A sizable portion of the fund comes from local partners, Ventures Platform told TechCabal.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Ventures Platform has backed almost 70 startups including Seamless HR, PiggyVest, Mono, and Paystack\u2014which Stripe acquired in October 2020 for over $200m.\n\nThis new fund will allow Ventures Platform to significantly deepen its long-standing presence in Nigeria and West Africa while also investing in select companies in East, North and Francophone Africa that are able to expand across the continent.\n\n\u201cPrior to this fund, we could only write one cheque, then introduce the entrepreneur to our network of investors for a follow-on round. Now we\u2019re not only able to write their first cheque but also write follow-on rounds for our companies,\u201d Kola Aina, founder and General Partner at Ventures Platform, told TechCabal.\n\nThis new capital injection will enable Ventures Platform to double down on existing investments in its category-leading portfolio via subsequent rounds. Aina believes that being able to double down on existing investments means they can assure startups that they have a long-term capital partner. It also helps Ventures Platform defend their ownership stake in the companies, as they can participate in the upside they helped build, which is important from a returns perspective.\n\nAs part of a move to further deepen its expertise, Ventures Platform has also onboarded leading figures across African tech as Venture Partners, including Seni Sulyman (ex-VP at Andela, founder at Black Ops.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very bullish about the market; it\u2019s about the entrepreneur first. Across our portfolio, we now have two companies whose entrepreneurs we\u2019ve funded twice. We funded their first project, it didn\u2019t work; we\u2019ve funded them again,\u201d Aina said.\n\nAina has a heart for entrepreneurs as he\u2019d been one before becoming an investor.\n\nFascinated by the power of capital\n\n\u201cI was just always fascinated by the power of capital. I always wanted to end up being an investor, even when it wasn\u2019t popular.\u201d\n\nWhat attracted Aina to investing? It was the notion of giving people money and seeing them build something meaningful with it.\n\nIn 2009, Aina moved back from the US to Nigeria and co-founded Emerging Platforms, a software company. Initially, they had some customers willing to pay, but the business needed funding. They tried to raise funds but faced rejection at every corner.\n\n\u201cWe wrote a letter to every bank in Nigeria, got introductions but everyone said no. So, we went back to the drawing board and bootstrapped the business.\u201d\n\nThe harrowing experience of fundraising stayed with Aina and ignited the desire to change how people got access to capital in Africa.\n\nMaking new mistakes\n\nFortunately, the bootstrapped business thrived and Aina started angel investing in 2014. Two years later, he had an epiphany that waiting for the government and donors to solve society\u2019s problems was pointless. A better alternative was to find and fund young people using technology to solve these problems.\n\nInspired by Silicon Valley-esque accelerators, Ventures Platform was born in 2016. The initial approach was to get the best entrepreneurs from across Africa to fly into a campus in Abuja for a 16-week acceleration program. They were paired with investors, team members, capital, and mentors.\n\n\u201cObviously everyone told us acceleration is too difficult to do in Africa, but we told them we\u2019ll make new mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhile making new mistakes, they also got a few things right. One of the things Ventures Platform did then that was pioneering and different was that it was fully transparent with its terms of investing in startups. It offered $20,000 for 10% equity.\n\n\u201cAt that time it was one of the fairer deals out there,\u201d Aina said.\n\nThis transparency helped ventures attract talents like Kayode Oyewole, partner at Ventures Platform and Fola Olatunji-David, who later left the firm to become Head of Startup Success and Service at Google. Aina also believes that sharing the firm\u2019s manifesto helped move the market forward in setting the terms of evaluation for pre-seed companies in Africa.\n\nAlongside the accelerator, Aina continued investing and got to invest in startups like Paystack, Kudi, Kangbe (now Reliance HMO), Printivo and Tizeti.\n\nAfter the first year, Aina and his team saw that the accelerator wasn\u2019t ideal for the continent, so they pivoted to an early-stage fund model.\n\n\u201cWith people living together on campus, you\u2019re not just investing and helping people scale their businesses, you\u2019re also dealing with personalities. It was almost like the Big Brother House but for investing.\u201d\n\nNotably, the initial capital used to run the accelerator and invest in startups was Aina\u2019s personal funds. He had to have a conversation with his wife telling her that he needed to raid their savings to support startups.\n\n\u201cWe did over a million dollars in investments in the early days. But, in retrospect, that was a smart decision because it helped us show a track record.\u201c\n\nBy late 2017, Ventures Platform started raising external capital: syndicate funds. This happened because people who were impressed with the performance of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies wanted to invest in Ventures Platform.\n\nThe syndicate style investments continued until mid last year when Aina felt it was time for Ventures Platform to start working on raising its first institutional fund.\n\nWhy did he wait this long to raise an institutional fund?\n\n\u201cI wanted to see evidence that there\u2019s liquidity in this market before I raised an institutional fund. Startups are not just about inspiration or motivational talk. It\u2019s real business. Startup founders sometimes forget that I have to return money to my investors.\u201d\n\nWhy $40m matters\n\n2021 has been a record year for African startups as they\u2019ve raised over $4 billion so far. It\u2019s easy to see $40m, in an era where $100m raises are the new normal and wonder \u201cWhat difference does $40m make?\u201d\n\nAina believes that while the increase in capital inflow is important, the venture capital space needs to be seen as a continuum. For him, Venture Platforms\u2019 role is to find companies early and support them along the way as they gain product-market fit and look to scale.\n\n\u201cThere was a period when a company raising $500,000 was huge. Five years ago, you could count the number of local funds in the market. I think it\u2019s day one for this fund. We must not get ahead of ourselves. We want to stay disciplined. We\u2019re very clear about our thesis and are staying grounded to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "After 5 reluctant years of bootstrapping, CinetPay is closing in on Francophone Africa dominance",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nOluwanifemi and Emmanuel here.\n\nYes, it\u2019s us again, and we can\u2019t tell if you missed this combo, but we decided to give it a go one last time before we start feasting this festive season. Today, we\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane through some of the news trends we observed on Techpoint Digest in 2021.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\u2019s next frontier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, music came in cassettes or rolling discs, and I, sometimes, marvel at how much has changed since then. I mean, you either buy Daddy Showkey\u2019s I in a store, or you wait for NTA to play. I\u2019m probably not old enough to think of anything else, but you get my drift.\n\nToday all you need, if you want to be legitimate, that is, is a decent Internet connection and either Deezer, Spotify, Audiomack, or YouTube music, and you can get your favourite songs at the click of a button or two.\n\nTechnology has changed the game in every industry, and entertainment has been a huge recipient. But what does the future hold? Our reporter, Bolu, had a chat with executives from Spotify and Audiomack to paint a pretty picture.\n\nHave fun: Blockchain-powered music and bigger investments: The next frontier for music tech.\n\nMAX raises $31 million for its electric vehicle subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MAX.ng Twitter\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) has closed a $31 million Series B funding round. Interestingly, this is the first of other closes in this round that should be expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThis round was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock and UAE-based VC firm, Global Ventures. Other backers include Kenyan VC, Novastar Ventures, Japanese multinational, Yamaha \u2014 these two participated in a $7million round MAX closed in June 2019 \u2014 TMT Investments, and Proparco.\n\nThe fund would be deployed towards expansion into Egypt and Ghana in Q1 2022 and later into Francophone, Eastern, and Southern Africa to compete with the likes of Gozem. It will also go into the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, and the provision of credit and financial products to drivers, specifically those that utilise their vehicles for commercial purposes.\n\nApparently, MAX\u2019s business model has evolved since it launched in 2015. From logistics to bike-hailing and now to offering vehicle subscriptions and other packages that help drivers to maximise revenue and minimise costs.\n\nThis is MAX\u2019s largest VC-funded round to date. $8.2 million raised in four major funding rounds \u2014 through venture funding, angel investments, bank loans, and debt financing \u2014 and a previous raise of over $40 million of institutional debt for driver financing. The startup also moved into Nigeria\u2019s capital market after completing the issuance of a \u20a6400 million ($1 million) bond in September 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore context: Nigerian mobility-tech startup MAX bags $31 million in Series B round, set to expand across Africa, build EV infrastructure\n\nInternational calls get a new look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live outside Nigeria, it\u2019s important to note that the country\u2019s telecom regulator is finally regulating the cost of making a call to a loved one back home.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), from January 2022, the standard international termination rate (ITR) for calls will be pegged at a minimum rate of $0.045.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Whenever you make a call from outside the country, your telecom operators pay Nigerian telecom operators a certain amount to complete the call successfully. Before now, the NCC fixed the amount at \u20a624.\n\nSo what happened? Since the fee was in naira, the NCC is saying that the telcos have been losing money due to the devaluation of the naira. Consequently, it believes getting the fees in dollars will help the telcos make more revenue, even if the naira falls again.\n\nThe big picture: Even the NCC is betting that the naira would keep falling, but what can we do? When you convert the new fee, it\u2019s just \u20a618.4 now, but who knows what it would grow to tomorrow?\n\nTrends we observed\n\nEgyptian startup funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can guess that at some point this year, people in the African startup scene had exclaimed, \u201cthese Egyptian startups are on fire!\u201d It felt like it was time to take lessons from them. The largest raise from an Egyptian company was $120m, and over $400m was raised this year, more than half of what the country had seen since 2015.\n\nTrue, Egypt is part of Africa\u2019s big four in terms of startup market size and funding, but the gap is quickly closing between Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. MaxAB\u2019s $55m Series A, MNT-Halan\u2019s $120m, Paymob\u2019s $18m Series A, and Trella\u2019s $42 million Series A made the highlights.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s a good year for Africa\u2019s startup funding scene. Several Nigerian startups hit unicorn status, and Francophone Africa got its first unicorn. 2022 seems like the year to expect more exciting rounds\n\nRegulatory somersaults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nOf course, you should have guessed we wouldn\u2019t miss this. Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem was fraught with regulatory somersaults, which we have gotten used to for quite a while.\n\nThe crypto ban\n\nFirst, we were hit with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Though crypto is not illegal in the country and the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was planning progressive regulations for the space, that didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s circular basically sent crypto users underground \u2014 peer to peer (P2P). The opportunity to regulate a decentralised space got swept away, creating difficulties for well-meaning users and breathing room for bad eggs. But nothing is scarier than \u201cmoney made out of thin air\u201d, right?\n\neNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIf the ban on crypto platforms had no constitutional grounds, then the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter was a clear violation. But we had to roll with it because Twitter was apparently a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. The perfect excuse for African governments looking to censor free speech.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since Nigeria\u2019s information minister said the ban would be lifted in a matter of days. I guess he wouldn\u2019t be lying if it takes six months.\n\nStartups want to digitise SME operations\n\nQuite a handful of African startups came up with decent plans to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector. TradeDepot, Marketforce, Doroki, Capiter, Sabi, Alerzo, OmniBiz, Sokowatch, BIZ301, and several others are working on digitising different segments of SME activities that have been largely offline.\n\nThis would definitely be a space to watch in 2022,\n\nFintech unicorns\n\nThan previous years, Africa recorded more unicorns in 2021. For context, these are tech companies valued above $1 billion. The continent now has six unicorns, and more than half of them are Nigerian and fintech startups.\n\nInterswitch is older in the record. Meanwhile, this year, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave, Chipper Cash, and Andela joined the list.\n\nThe bigger picture: We\u2019ll leave this open-ended. Why not bare your thoughts in the comment section? The most interesting responses might just make it to Techpoint Digest on January 3rd.\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nChristmas is in four days.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, technology has had a strong role in how we create, distribute, and consume works of art. Music, for example, has gone from stringed cassette tapes that\u2019ll go on to become a child\u2019s plaything (if you\u2019re me) to being globally available with a simple tap.\n\nOne of the most profound effects technology has had on music is blurring the geographical boundaries that set sounds from different cultures apart, making music truly universal.\n\nIt\u2019s no doubt technology has aided major paradigm shifts in every industry, rendering applauded methods of doing things obsolete and establishing another method as the status quo. But at the point where music is now, it\u2019s hard to think of innovations that will disrupt the current model of music creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nBut after a closer look and talking to some of the industry\u2019s brightest, the signs are there \u2014 the next frontier for music tech may be closer than we imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t predict the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nMusic is in a very exciting place right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Marcela Laskoski on Unsplash\n\nWhile Victor Okpala, who recently became Spotify\u2019s Artist & Label Partnerships Manager, West Africa, sees amazing things coming to African music tech, he\u2019s still pretty excited about where things are right now. Okpala is also the Founder of Nabsolute Media, a communication and marketing agency.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he started with the subject of monetisation and said artistes can now truly live off their music.\n\n\u201cFor example, we know how bootlegging used to work. A huge percentage of the people that consume music in Nigeria downloaded them from free websites. It was something illegal that somehow got normalised. But we are moving to a place where people see the value in music enough to pay for it.\n\n\u201cApart from the traditional streams of income which were live shows and endorsements, the music itself is able to bring in revenue as a product.\u201d\n\nBootlegging or piracy is the illegal manufacture, distribution or sale of goods. It has been a thorn in the flesh of Nigerian artistes for years. The amount lost to piracy runs into millions of dollars every year.\n\nAdeyemi Adetunji, a lawyer who is also Audiomack\u2019s Manager of Operations and Commercial Partnerships, is just as excited about African music.\n\nAccording to him, he knew afrobeats would become a thing when he was a DJ, playing the songs to an international audience back in the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would play them Wande Coal, P-Square, and D\u2019banj songs all the way back in 2011, and I just felt like the music was resonating with people, so I knew there was something there.\u201d\n\nAdetunji is particularly pleased that Nigerian musicians were maximising the opportunities technology presented. From building a strong following to connecting with fans on a deeper level.\n\nInternational collaborations and more international award nominations are also exciting phenomena in music right now. Adetunji beams with excitement as he recounts how the international collaborations that only started trickling in in 2010, are becoming the norm today.\n\n\u201cAll the new school kids are doing that a lot now, the Fireboys, the Remas and Omahlays. They\u2019re really big on that.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Okpala, the next frontier for music is that it will be viewed more as a product. He said it\u2019s currently seen solely as a form of art that doesn\u2019t drive enough investment in the industry. Ultimately, he believes the music industry is worthy of the same attention investors pay to fintech or healthtech, for example.\n\nA study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) published on November 17, 2020, revealed that music supports two million jobs and contributes \u20ac81.9 billion ($91.69 billion) to the European economy annually.\n\nIn the US, music contributes even more to the economy. According to a 2021 study by the Recording Industry Association of America, music contributes $170 billion to the US GDP annually and supports 2.5 million jobs.\n\nThis is possible due to robust investments in the industry. In the US, record companies invested more than $4.5 billion in the industry in 2015.\n\nWhile Nigeria cannot boast such levels of investment, the state of the music industry signals that more investments could have a positive impact on the economy. Per Statista, motion picture and music recording made up $1.8 billion out of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the music industry raked in $40 million in 2021. This number is projected to reach $44 million in 2022. Interestingly, there are now data points that can be used to predict investment in music. As Okpala points out, this will aid more investments as there is enough data for investors to bet on.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, if you\u2019re about to invest in an artiste that has, say, 10,000 monthly listeners and 1 million monthly streams on Spotify, you can calculate his monthly revenue to be $5,000. So, if you decide to invest $5,000 towards branding, marketing, and extending reach with the goal of multiplying your audience, you can predict what the revenue could look like.\u201d\n\nHe adds that gone are the days when investors had to bet on just talent as it is never enough.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that come into play when it comes to the success of an artiste, which could be the name, the branding, the story, and the content, of course.\u201d\n\nMusic, blockchain, and the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@zarakvg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Zarak Khan</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/music-streaming?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nWhile Adetunji believes no one knows tomorrow and doesn\u2019t like to make bold statements about the future, he indicates that the advent of Web3 and blockchain might have a strong role to play in the future of music.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing blockchain innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) disrupting the music space.\n\nWhile Okpala agrees that these technologies will play a big part in music, he believes that the future is still very far away. Streaming, on the other hand, isn\u2019t going anywhere soon but will only get better.\n\nNot only is it the current frontier, it\u2019ll most likely still be the next frontier. The convenience streaming brings to music is probably why it\u2019s playing a big role in music growth now.\n\nGlobal streaming revenues have grown by 42% since 2015, surpassing the entire recording industry, which has only grown by 9% in the same amount of time.\n\nAdetunji and Okpala are optimistic about the future of African and Nigerian music, one where tech will definitely determine what the next frontier will be.\n\nWith such interesting predictions, I can\u2019t wait to see more experts from the music scene share their thoughts at Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nYou can also be a part of Techpoint Build 2021, the biggest tech event in West Africa, by registering here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "The expected combination of Flour Mills Nigeria (FMN) and the flour mills unit of Honeywell Flour Mills plc (HFMP) will form a formidable entity and an unassailable market leader in the agro-allied sector in Nigeria, according to industry players and market analysts.\n\nLast month, Flour Mills announced it had reached a deal to acquire the flour mills business of Honeywell in an N80 billion deal that will significantly enhance its market leadership.\n\nFMN is believed to hold about 40 percent of the flour business in Nigeria and its leadership in the sector will become even more secure following the combination with Honeywell Flour, which has a production capacity of 835,000 metric tons of food per annum.\n\nBusinessDay learns that the deal has been helped by several factors including the fact that the combination is seen as a \u201cstrategic fit\u201d and also the leaders of the two businesses including their chairmen have known themselves for a very long time. They have mutual respect for each other.\n\nIn full year ended March 2021, the turnover for the two was N771.6 billion for Flour Mills and N109.59 billion for Honeywell Flour, and the combination will see FMN emerge as a true continental giant, amassing substantial value for shareholders and huge economic benefit for Nigeria.\n\nRead Also: Honeywell, Flour Mills N80bn merger to boost Nigeria\u2019s food production\n\nFMN, established in 1960, prides itself of being in the vanguard of feeding the nation for the past 60 years.

          "title": "The many legal battles of Ecobank and Honeywell",
          "text": "The lawyers for both Ecobank and Honeywell Group are pushing several cases against each other in connection with the dispute over the settlement of claims of N5 billion by the bank against Honeywell as well as an unrelated matter of the sale of shares held originally in what is today\u2019s Airtel Nigeria plc.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Honeywell wrote to Ecobank accepting the terms for the resolution of the claim by the bank agreed at the meeting held the day earlier and saying, \u201cwe confirm our agreement to pay the sum of N3.5billion as full and final settlement of our indebtedness to your bank. As part of the verbal agreement reached at the meeting, we shall immediately pay the sum of N500million towards the facilities. We propose that the balance of N3 billion be paid in three equal half yearly payments.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Ecobank sent back a response in which the bank said, \u201cplease note that the agreement was for a full and final payment of N3.5 billion to be part paid immediately by \u2013 N500 million on Monday, July 22, 2013, and the balance to be paid immediately thereafter before the CBN examiners leave the bank.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the payment became a big issue and this saw both parties moving their wranglings to the court on October 16, 2015, via a suit by Ecobank before Justice Tsoho seeking to wind up Honeywell.\n\nRead Also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\n\nHowever, both parties began to get public attention for their dispute after Ecobank secured an ex-parte motion to restrain Honeywell and Oba Otudeko from operating their accounts in all banks and financial institutions and an order directing their respective banks to furnish Ecobank with details of their accounts in the banks.\n\nThis same bank-customer dispute was submitted to the subcommittee of ethics and professionalism of the Bankers\u2019 Committee for adjudication and ruling was issued in favour of Honeywell, but Ecobank in a letter dated November 14, 2014, maintained that \u201cduring a recent CBN/NDIC review of the bank, the accounts were flagged and that the CBN had insisted that the amount outstanding be paid without further delay.\u201d\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Honeywell filed a suit before Justice M. B. Idris in which it sought an interim injunction to restrain Ecobank from making any representation suggesting that it owed the bank and on August 10, 2015, the interim injunction was granted and both parties ordered by the court to maintain status quo.\n\nFollowing this, Ecobank filed a preliminary objection on the basis that the Federal High court lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute and on December 11, 2015, the court presided by Justice Idris held that the Federal High court had jurisdiction to hear the matter. Ecobank immediately appealed this decision.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, Ecobank filed two separate suits before Justice Abang. On this same day, Ecobank filed another two petitions before Justice Yunusa who on December 4, 2015, varied the ex-parte orders by granting Honeywell Flour Mills restricted access to its banks accounts allowing the company to take no more than N15 million weekly.\n\nWorried by the orders of Justice Yunusa, Honeywell petitioned the National Judicial Council alleging judicial misconduct arising from what the company called, \u201cthe unfair and unlawful exercise of his discretion.\u201d\n\nAfter this petition to the NJC, Ecobank\u2019s lawyer wrote to Honeywell demanding a copy of the petition. This got Honeywell thinking that something was amiss.\n\nSensing that Ecobank\u2019s lawyers might be attempting to use the administration of justice to blackmail Honeywell into submission, on April 7, 2016, Honeywell petitioned the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee also known as the Body of Benchers.\n\nIn the petition, the company said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Mr Kunle Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act CCAP L11. LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nAt an emergency meeting held on September 15, 2017, the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee adjudicated on the matter and in a statement dated 11/1/2018 and signed by Hadizatu Mustapha, Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court, the committee said as follows, \u201cHoneywell Group petitioned Kunle Ogunba SAN alleging professional misconduct against him. The misconduct alleged consists of the institution of multiplicity of proceedings before different judges of the Federal High Court on the same subject with the deliberate aim of abusing the process of court and derailing the course of justice. This is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee (at which the respondent was given a fair hearing) it was decided that the petition is meritorious.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee at its 129th plenary meeting sanctioned the senior lawyer, withdrawing a set of privileges from him forthwith.\n\nHoneywell is also in court pressing damages claim against Ecobank for harm to its interests arising from the ex-parte order granted against it and which has now been made voided by courts including the Supreme Court.\n\nOn July 13, 2018, justices of the Supreme Court made two rulings, both in favour of Honeywell.\n\nIn one, suit number SC.401/2016, which was an appeal by Honeywell against the ruling of a lower court in favour of Ecobank, the justices in the ruling read by Amiru Sanusi upheld the appeal.\n\nIn another ruling delivered by John Inyang Okoro, the Supreme Court justices reviewed an appeal brought before them by Ecobank in relation to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on March 30, 2016, said inter alia, \u201chaving resolved all five issues against the appellant (Ecobank) , I hold that this appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. I affirm the decision of the court of appeal delivered on 30th March, 2016.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, the Supreme Court justice said, \u201cHonestly, I have tried to understand the complaint of the appellant in this issue but it appears to be the more you look, the less you see.\u201d\n\nIn an unrelated matter, Honeywell and Ecobank are also in court over the sale of Airtel shares by Ecobank to Bharti Airtel for $28 million. Honeywell claims that as at the time the shares were sold to Delta State government, which then sold to Oceanic Bank (acquired by Ecobank), there was a subsisting shareholder agreement that stipulated that existing shareholders were to be given rights of first refusal.\n\nHoneywell is now asking that the court compel Ecobank to deposit the $28 million proceeds from the share sale into the accounts of the court until the determination of the substantive suit brought by Honeywell.",

          "title": "NCC sets new Mobile International Termination Rate for voice services paid by overseas telco carriers",
          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), has determined the new International Termination Rate (ITR) for voice services paid by overseas telecom carriers for terminating international calls on local networks in Nigeria at $0.045.\n\nNCC\u2019s Director Public Affairs, Dr Ikechukwu Adinde disclosed this in a statement on Monday.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe new rate is contained in the \u2018Determination of Mobile International Termination Rate\u2019 issued by the Commission on November 25, 2021. The $0.045 rate is the floor price for ITR services and shall take effect from January 1, 2022. The rate is to be paid in US Dollar to enable Nigerian operators to receive an increasing rate in Naira terms to accommodate devaluation.\n\n\u201cNo licensee shall charge and or receive effective rate per minute below determined ITR floor rate. As such, payment discounts, volume discounts and any other concession that has the effect of bringing the effective ITR lower than the rate determined shall be deemed a contravention of the new determination and will attract sanctions in line with the Nigerian Communications (Enforcement process, etc.) Regulations, 2019.\n\n\u201cThe ITR Floor is the minimum that can be charged. Operators will be free to negotiate a rate above the floor and this will be entirely left to commercial negotiation between the operators and international carriers/partners.\n\n\u201cHowever, while the ITR only pertains to the cost of bringing traffic into Nigeria, Nigerian operators will continue to pay the regulated Mobile Termination Rate (MTR), the local termination rate among themselves.\n\n\u201cThe MTR of N3.90 for generic 2G/3G/4G operators and N4.70 for new entrant Long Term Evolution (LTE) operators determined in 2018, will continue to apply for local call terminations until a new rate is determined by the Commission pursuant to its powers as enshrined in the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA), 2003.\n\n\u201cThe subsisting regime of interconnection rates was sustained by the Commission\u2019s Mobile (voice) termination rate issued on June 1, 2018. In the determination, it was stated that the ITR of N24.40 determined in 2016 will continue to apply until a new determination is made.\n\n\u201cThe ITR, being denominated in Naira had multiple negative impacts on local operators which was further exacerbated by episodes of devaluation of naira which ultimately left Nigeria from being a net receiver with respect to international minutes to a net payer.\n\n\u201cThe Commission also observed that operators continue to face series of challenges occasioned by the denomination of ITR in Naira, necessitating a need for a cost-based study on ITR. In view of the foregoing and in fulfillment of its statutory mandate of periodic review of regulatory policies, the Commission engaged Messrs\u2019 Payday Advance and Support Services Limited to undertake a cost-based study of voice MTR that is most suitable for the Nigerian telecommunications industry.\n\n\u201cCommenting, the Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, said in arriving at the new MTR of $0.045, \u201cThe Commission has carefully considered the information provided by stakeholders and taken a view on parameters and regulatory measures in the light of relevant information such as international experience, cost model results, the state of competition in the sector and the Nigerian macro-economic environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe added that the process of arriving at the ITR had been conducted transparently with a view to providing maximum clarity to all parties without compromising the confidentiality of commercially-sensitive information.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the result the review will make a significant contribution to the development of the telecoms sector in Nigeria and be beneficial to subscribers, operators and the country at large,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe EVC, on behalf of the Board and Management of the NCC, extended the Commission\u2019s gratitude to all operators and industry stakeholders, who submitted information relating to the regulation of interconnection rates and the costing models as well as the consultant, for their participation in the process leading to the Determination.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The government of Lagos State says it has signed necessary documents required by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) to facilitate the issuance of N137.328 billion bond aimed at executing key infrastructure in critical sector of the economy in the state.\n\nThis follows the meeting of all statutory instruments that will facilitate the raising of the 13% fixed rate bond by the Lagos state government from the capital market.\n\nIn his remarks on the occasion, Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who presided over the signing ceremony where the necessary documents were signed by the Lagos State Attorney General, issuing parties and trustees of the funds, said that the state set out to raise N125 billion from the capital market but closed the bids with N137.3 billion, following oversubscription.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the development is a demonstration of a strong response from the investing community and testified to confidence of investors in the State\u2019s ability to deliver on its infrastructural and socio-economic developmental objectives, while meeting repayment obligations\n\nThe event marked the third time Lagos Government would be issuing a long-tenure bond of 10 years (2021-2031), bringing to a total value of N377.715 billion bond issued from the Lagos State\u2019s Series IV N500 Billion Debt Issuance Programme.\n\nAccording to the governor, proceeds from the bond would be used to finance key infrastructure projects in healthcare, environment and road construction, including the 10-km Regional Road in Eti Osa, six-lane Lekki-Epe Expressway, Ijeododo Road in Alimosho and Oba Sekumade Road in Ikorodu, among others.\n\n\u201cLagos once again marks another milestone in the domestic debt capital markets, with the issuance of the largest bond ever by a sub-national Government in Nigeria. The signing ceremony finalises the issuance of N137.3 billion bond at 13 per cent fixed rate in our Series IV Bond Issuance under the N500 Billion Fourth Debt Issuance Programme,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe set out to raise up to N125 billion, but we closed the book with bids totalling N137.3 billion. This is a strong response from the investing community to our administration\u2019s debut bond issuance. This humbling achievement is a testament to continued investors\u2019 confidence in the State\u2019s ability to deliver on its infrastructural and socio-economic developmental objectives, and also to meet repayment obligations.\n\n\u201cIn line with our vision to build a Greater Lagos, proceeds from this bond will be used to finance infrastructure projects, primarily in roads, environment and healthcare. These projects include 10-km Regional Road in Eti Osa, six-lane Lekki-Epe Expressway, Ijeododo Road in Alimosho and Oba Sekumade Road in Ikorodu. These will contribute to a better quality of living for our people, while also creating a more enabling environment for commercial and economic activity.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu said there had been multiplier effects in socio-economic activities felt from the previous intervention capital raised justified the cost of investment in critical sectors. He said Lagos had maintained high discipline on the size and pricing of its bonds, noting that the State got the clearance to proceed with the issuance as its coupon of 13% yearly fell within the acceptable clearing bid.\n\nThe Governor disclosed that the issuance process started in April based on the advice of the State\u2019s transaction advisers. With the issuance of the third bond, Sanwo-Olu said the imperative to aggressively drive his administration\u2019s THEMES agenda had been boosted, pledging to deliver more iconic projects would be raise the value of the State\u2019s economy.\n\nIn his own remarks, the state Commissioner for Finance, Dr. Rabiu Olowo, said that 319 bids were submitted during the offer period, while total bids at N146.328 billion value were received.\n\nOlowo said N137.328 billion qualified under the terms of the offer at the clearing price of 13% per annum.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn April 2021, we accelerated an ongoing conversation on the need to quickly intervene on the huge infrastructure gap in the face of limited financial resources. We took advantage of the favourable investment climate in the capital market to initiate a bridge to finance transaction by redeeming and refinancing the existing bonds\n\n\u201cIt is fulfilling to note that despite the hurdles that were faced, we have been able to achieve the target we set for ourselves. In fact, we exceeded the target. Many thanks to Mr. Governor for his timely intervention at different phases. This is undoubtedly another momentous transaction for Lagos.\u201d\n\nThe Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo, SAN, was represented at the occasion by the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mrs. Titilayo Shitta-Bey.",

As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, there\u2019s been a lot of challenges with women being at home and a lot of men are finding finances quite difficult, and of course, this has eventually come out and show itself as violence against women.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cPeople do not have something doing, and this increases violence in the family,\u201d she added.\n\nAnyanti, therefore, called on government to provide social welfare schemes for women who are victims of GBV. She also called for policies on punishment of GBV perpetrators.\n\nShe urged victims of GBV to speak out and seek help, saying GBV figures are rising because more people are afraid to speak out and some others are seeking personal solutions.\n\n\u201cWe as Family Health Society are trying to encourage people who faced violence to speak out and discuss with friends, neighbors and family members.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhen people speak out, help will get to them and something will be done about it.

The Service is completely guided by the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) which governs its suspect handling rules.\n\n\u201cEl-Zakzaky is talking tongue in cheek. It is unfortunate someone like him chose to lie. Possibly, he lost complete memory about the facts and the truth. The DSS doesn\u2019t maltreat suspects. While in India years back, he chose or preferred to be returned to the DSS custody. Why? Because according to him, he had better treatment. So, we will ignore him. Those who have issues before the court should face their cases and stop blaming the DSS. We respect the laws and will always be governed by the principles of rule of law.

Since the time we reached Kaduna, after we were released, nobody gave us a single bottle of water! We were feeding ourselves.\n\n\u201cEven during our stay in Abuja, we were feeding ourselves. But this is something that cannot be disclosed because it was illegal. Legally, they were supposed to feed us. But they didn\u2019t want anybody to hear that we were feeding ourselves. For the entire five years, seven months that we were in detention, we fed ourselves; nobody gave us a bottle of water!\n\n\u201cWe were even paying electricity and water bills, while in detention.

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has tabled before the National Assembly N305billion as projected expenditure for the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe development came amidst concerns over decision by President Muhammadu Buhari, who withheld his assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill which was forwarded to him by the National Assembly November 19.\n\nIn 2018, President Buhari failed to assent to the bill as amended then with the excuse that the time was too close to the 2019 general election.\n\nBy the constitutional provision, the president has up to 30 days to assent to any bill brought before him by the National Assembly or withhold same.\n\nAnd with the 30-day window expiring Sunday, the 19th of December, the National Assembly is now left with the option of vetoing the president, a decision that has become a subject of controversy among Nigerians.\n\nBuhari explains\n\nExplaining reasons for his decision to withhold assent to the Bill, President Buhari listed high cost of conducting direct primaries, the security challenge of monitoring the election, violation of citizens\u2019 rights and marginalization of small political parties among others.\n\nIn a communication to Senate President Ahmad Lawan, the president said the current situation across the country won\u2019t allow for his assent to the Bill.\n\nBesides, Buhari said he received \u201cinformed advice from relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of the government.\u201d\n\nThe leadership of the National Assembly had at different times met with Buhari during which they assured the president would concur with them on the Bill.\n\nPrior to the end of the 30-day period, a presidential spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, had said President Buhari was not under obligation to publicly declare his decision on the Bill.\n\nSpeaking Sunday on Channels Television\u2019s \u201cSunday Politics,\u201d Shehu argued that taking such a decision to the public without the knowledge of the National Assembly would amount to \u201cunkind treatment of the lawmakers.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m not in a position to tell you, yes or no. But given the way things are done, the president would have completed his consultations some time back. The president would be communicating with the National Assembly on whatever he decides either yes or no.\n\n\u201cAnd as I said, it would be disrespectful of the National Assembly, for me at this time, to say this is the content of the president\u2019s communication, assuming that the communication has been sent to them. So as I said, allow them to resume, I believe that the president will not act in breach of the Constitution. No, he will do what is right.\n\n\u201cThe constitution says the president must sign within 30 days, the constitution did not say that there should be the disclosure of that decision within 30 days to the public when the disclosure to the National Assembly has been made.\u201d\n\nINEC\u2019s budget\n\nNotwithstanding the uncertainty over the fate of the Electoral Bill, the electoral body is pushing on with its plan for credible elections in 2023, just as it announced the indefinite suspension of Ekiti-East bye election after four unsuccessful attempts.\n\nSubmissions to these effects were made by INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, while appearing before the Senate Committee on Appropriations Monday in Abuja .\n\nThe committee, had in view of the 2023 general elections , invited the INEC boss to table before it, projected expenditure for the election for the purpose of capturing it in the 2022 budget billed for passage by both chambers of the National Assembly Tuesday this week.\n\nYakubu clarified that the N305billion was outside of its yearly N40billion budget.\n\nWhile noting that N100billion had earlier been given to the commission out of the total projected expenses, the INEC chair said this would not be enough for adequate preparation.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe commission made a submission through the executive being part of the executive body. We made a submission for N305billion for the 2023 general elections in a very comprehensive 22-page document with 260 budget lines.\n\n\u201cIn submitting the executive proposal to the National Assembly, the sum of N140billion was made available to INEC as a one-line item in the budget, and as usual, we broke it down and submitted same to the committee that oversights INEC in both the House and the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe N140billion was broken into two, we take it that N40billion is our regular budget as an agency of government and N100b was the first tranche of the 2022 budget and we have gone ahead to make provisions accordingly.\n\n\u201cFor the N40billion annual budget, including in that are also elections that we are supposed to conduct particularly off-season elections. It may interest the committee to know that we have 8 bye-elections pending; three Federal constituencies and five State constituencies. In fact, the last vacancy occurred only last Wednesday following the death of a member representing Jiwa west in Kaduna state.\u201d\n\nIn making case for more releases from the N205billion balance , the INEC chairman highlighted before the lawmakers activities that must be carried out ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done is to look at the activities that we have to conduct before the general election. There are activities that must be concluded. For instance, if you are going to replace some of the critical facilities like ballot boxes, voting cubicles, these things must be done before the election.\n\n\u201cParty primaries must be conducted and concluded before the election and names of candidates submitted, registration of voters would have to be concluded before the election. Printing of the permanent voter\u2019s card would have to be concluded before the election and then some of the critical election technology for the 2023 general election must be concluded and procured before the election\u201d, he explained.\n\nEkiti bye-election\n\nOn the controversial Ekiti East bye election, the INEC boss said it has been suspended indefinitely having tried four times without success.\n\nHe lamented that in the last attempt, voters were killed on the queue as well as security operatives and electoral officers at polling units\n\n\u201cINEC will never reward bad behaviour. The election can only be repeated in June next year during the gubernatorial election,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nSenate speaks\n\nIn his remarks, the committee Chairman, Senator Jibrin Barau (APC Kano North), said required appropriation would be made for the electoral body in the 2022 budget in the general interest of Nigerians.\n\nHe assured journalists after the session that report of his committee on 2022 budget proposals would be laid in plenary Tuesday at both Chambers to be considered and passed.\n\nCTA on CSOs\n\nMeanwhile, the Centre for Transparency Advocacy (CTA) has asked the parliament to veto the president on the bill.\n\nCTA also called on the civil society organisations, students, religious and traditional leaders to prevail on the National Assembly to do the wish of the people as the country looks forward to 2023 general elections.\n\nIn a statement Monday in Abuja, Executive Director CTA Faith Nwadishi said Nigerians had hoped President Buhari would have given the country the Electoral Act as amended as a birthday gift but hope was dashed \u201cdisappointingly.\u201d\n\nCTA said the delay, until this time, confirmed the fears that the provisions envisaged by the citizens and expectations thereof may be dashed by the actions of the president, stressing that \u201claws are made in the interest and benefit of the people and not for those in power.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Centre for Transparency Advocacy is by this release in full support of the calls by other CSOs for the National Assembly in the spirit of patriotism to veto the president and pass the bill into law as a way forward to conducting a free, fair, and credible election that will stand the test of time.\n\n\u201cWe equally, call on citizens, patriots, the civil society, students, religious and traditional leaders to prevail on the National Assembly to do the wishes of the people as we look forward to 2023 General Elections.\n\n\u201cThe Centre for Transparency Advocacy is concerned and at the same time worried that the president seems to be interested more in mundane personal aggrandizement that will benefit a few cabals instead of improving our elections and the integrity of the electoral process across the entire electoral value chain.\u201d",

Deputy National Youth Leader of the party and flanked by six others, the group said the party owed President Buhari the moral duty of sustaining his laudable legacy in this regard.\n\nWhile commending the Buni-led committee for being steadfast and dogged in its approach to party governance, the group asked the party leadership \u201cnot to listen, let alone accede, to the cacophony of sponsored suggestions in some quarters that the February 2022 date be still pushed forward to a later date.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, \u201cthe people making this dangerous suggestion are familiar retrogressive voices who do not mean well for our party.\u201d\n\nDescribing the next national convention as a make or mar for the APC, the group said the party \u201cwill continue to remain united, indissoluble, big and strong is firmly predicated on the kind and quality of decision our leaders take at the convention in February.\u201d\n\nThey urged the party leaders \u201cto be careful not to play cheaply into the hands of some doomsday prophets who have wildly predicted the end of our party in a short-while.\u201d\n\nThe youth group further resolved: \u201cThe party should not compromise on the kind and calibre of persons who should aspire for leadership positions in the party\u2019s forthcoming convention.\n\n\u201cOnly sound and competent members of the party, with requisite experience, should be allowed to take over the leadership of the APC at the national level.\n\n\u201cYoung and vibrant party members should be allowed to take up strategic leadership positions in the forthcoming convention.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe party should use this convention to give life to the leadership aspirations of Nigerian youths which President Muhammadu Buhari blessed in 2018 with his assent to the Not-Too-Young-to-run Bill.

According to him, direct primaries will increase the Federal Government\u2019s financial burdens because they are expensive to conduct.\n\nAside from the cost implication, the Nigerian leader explained that direct primaries will stifle smaller parties and also raise security concerns since there would be a large turnout of voters in such a mode of election.\n\nBuhari added that political parties should decide the best way to pick their candidates for elections, noting that his stance was based on a careful review and consultations.\n\nThe President\u2019s move ends the debate over the delay in signing the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nCritics and high-profile Nigerians had before now speculated over the possible reasons for Buhari\u2019s delay in assenting to the bill.\n\nWhile some believe it was the direct primaries clause, other like Governor Nyesom Wike claimed it was due to the electronic transmission of results.\n\nDespite the debates generated before Tuesday\u2019s reading of the letter at the National Assembly, presidential aide Garba Shehu had maintained that his principal does not need to explain his stance to the public following the expiration of the 30-day period during which Buhari was expected to sign the bill.\n\n\u201cAnd as I said, it would be disrespectful of the National Assembly, for me at this time, to say this is the content of the president\u2019s communication, assuming that the communication has been sent to them,\u201d he said on Sunday.\n\n\u201cSo as I said, allow them to resume, I believe that the president will not act in breach of the Constitution.

          "text": "Contrary to misconceptions and misinterpretations, the Federal High Court in Lagos did not bar Federal marriage registries in Ikoyi, Lagos and Abuja from further contracting marriages under the Marriage Act, 2004 in Nigeria.\n\nThis is the correct version of the latest judgment of the Federal High Court delivered by Justice Daniel Osiagor on December 8, 2021, on a suit filed by four local governments in four states who were seeking to stop the federal government from further contracting, celebrating, registering marriages as well as issuing licences to authorise intending parties to marry and issuing marriage certificates, under the Marriage Act.\n\nEti Osa Local Government Council in Lagos State is the first Plaintiff. The three others are the local government areas, where the Federal Government established Federal Marriage Registries \u2013 Egor local LG Council in Edo State, Owerri Municipal LG Council in Imo State and Port Harcourt City LG Council in Rivers State.\n\nIn the case instituted in 2018, the applicants sued the Minister of Interior and the Attorney-General of the Federation. A firm, Anchor Dataware Solutions Limited, was later joined as a third defendant, by an Order of the Court in 2019.\n\nThe reliefs sought included an Order directing the Minister of Interior to transmit or return all marriage certificates issued within the Plaintiffs\u2019 Local Government Councils subsequently after the delivery of a 2004 judgment of Justice Oyindamola Olomojobi of the same Federal High Court, which gave Local Government Registrars exclusive authority to register marriages.\n\nThe Plaintiffs\u2019 6th and 7th prayers also sought an Order for the 1st defendant to return all monies paid by couples since the 2004 judgment to the Plaintiffs\u2019 Marriage Registries for re-issuance, and for the Court to seal all Federal Marriage Registries established in the aforementioned four local governments, or to alternatively restrict Federal Marriage Registries to only issue Licenses to places of public worship for the celebration of marriages.\n\nBut in their legal arguments, the Federal Government through the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation contended that no law either under the Constitution or under the Marriage Act that regulates marriages in Nigeria, gives exclusive authority to a Local Government registrar to contract and celebrate marriages in Nigeria. It added that parties have the option of where to celebrate and contract their marriage.\n\nRESOLUTION\n\nFirst, Justice Osiagor condemned the steps taken by the Interior Minister to enter into a Public Private Partnership Agreement with Anchor Dataware, \u201cwith the primary purpose of establishing marriage registries across states of the Federation.\u201d\n\nThe ministry was also found to have directed the Nigeria Immigration Service to make federal marriage certificates an inclusive eligibility requirement for all married applicants for international passports.\n\nIt also directed marriage registries in the local governments to obtain approval from federal marriage registries so as to continue to conduct marriages in accordance with the marriage act.\n\nThe court described these steps as a complete abuse of power that undermines the constitutional recognition of the three tiers of government in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBy this agreement, the first respondent (ministry of interior) literally outlawed any marriage conducted by the local government (Marriage District) registrars.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first defendant combining with its private partners (third defendant) are metamorphosing from a regulatory agency into a revenue-driven agency in establishing marriage registry to conduct marriages all over the federation within the marriage district (local government areas) reserved for the registrars of marriages in these districts\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is highly condemnable and I so condemn it. The stealthy manner in arrogating marriage territories beyond the statutorily delineated Central Licensing place of worship and undermining the local governments (Marriage Districts) is illegal. Let no minister stealthily and surreptitiously do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cVOYAGE IN FUTILITY\u201d\n\nThe judge said that any Federal marriage registry established by the interior ministry outside the former Federal Capital Territory of Lagos and the present Federal Capital Territory of Abuja is a \u201cvoyage in futility.\u201d\n\nBut, the court issued a perpetual injunction restraining the Interior Minister and his agents from further contracting, celebrating, granting certificates of marriage and registering marriages under the Marriage Act within the plaintiffs\u2019 local government areas, EXCEPT marriages conducted in the registries in Ikoyi and Abuja.\n\nHe, however, refused to grant an Order for the ministry of interior to return marriage certificates it had earlier issued and to also refund the fees paid by couples.\n\nOn the last relief sought seeking the sealing of all federal Marriage registries, the court says, \u201cthere shall be no Federal Marriage Registry in the Marriage Districts (Local Government Councils) save Ikoyi and Abuja Federal Marriage Registry predating the 1999 Constitution, without prejudice to the 1st Defendant\u2019s exclusive powers to issue license to places of public worship to celebrate marriages all over the Federation.\u201d\n\nBut, the Ministry of Interior, says it will appeal the \u201cconflicting and confusing\u201d decision. Dr. Shuaib Belgore, who is the Permanent Secretary/Principal Registrar of Marriages at the Ministry, also appealed to \u201cthe general public, the international community, to couples who had hitherto had their marriages solemnized at Federal Marriage Registries by duly licensed places of worship and to all intending couples to be calm and continue transacting their normal businesses at all Federal Marriage Registries subsisting throughout the federation in line with statutory and constitutional provisions.\u201d\n\nNote:\n\n-Justice Osiagor slams FG for \u201cundermining powers of LGs to conduct marriages\u201d\n\n\u2013 Interior ministry to appeal decision, says federal marriage registries established throughout federation subsists",
          "summary": "Contrary to misconceptions and misinterpretations, the Federal High Court in Lagos did not bar Federal marriage registries in Ikoyi, Lagos and Abuja from further contracting marriages under the Marriage Act, 2004 in Nigeria.\nThe three others are the local government areas, where the Federal Government established Federal Marriage Registries \u2013 Egor local LG Council in Edo State, Owerri Municipal LG Council in Imo State and Port Harcourt City LG Council in Rivers State.\nIn the case instituted in 2018, the applicants sued the Minister of Interior and the Attorney-General of the Federation.\nIt also directed marriage registries in the local governments to obtain approval from federal marriage registries so as to continue to conduct marriages in accordance with the marriage act.\nThe stealthy manner in arrogating marriage territories beyond the statutorily delineated Central Licensing place of worship and undermining the local governments (Marriage Districts) is illegal.",

Lines for COVID-19 tests wrapped around the block in New York, Washington and other U.S. cities as people clamoured to find out if they were infected before celebrating the holidays with family.\n\nSouth Korea, the Netherlands, Germany and Ireland were among countries to reimpose partial or full lockdowns, or other social distancing measures, in recent days.\n\nIsrael added the United States to its \u201cno-fly\u201d list, citing concerns over the variant, while Kuwait said it would require incoming travellers to have received a booster shot if more than nine months had passed since their second vaccine dose.\n\nDIFFERING APPROACHES\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said the situation was \u201cextremely difficult\u201d as hospitalisations rose steeply in London.

          "text": "The United States is set to become the world\u2019s biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter in 2022, surpassing Qatar and Australia, and may hold that title for years to come.\n\nIn a year when China and other large economies in Europe and Asia scrambled to source enough supply for heating and power generation, the United States was sitting on a bevy of supply \u2013 one that will grow in coming years.\n\nGlobal LNG demand has hit record highs each year since 2015, due mostly to surging demand in China and the rest of Asia. Much of that global appetite has been met by steadily rising U.S. LNG exports, which have reached new records every year since 2016 and is poised to continue in 2022.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration projects U.S. LNG exports will reach 11.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2022. That would account for roughly 22% of expected world LNG demand of 53.3 bcfd next year, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs and would outpace both Australia and Qatar, the two largest exporters at present.\n\nOne billion cubic feet is enough gas for about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.\n\nThe United States should remain the biggest LNG exporter by capacity until around 2025, when Qatar could regain the lead as its North Field expansion starts to enter service.\n\nBut if some U.S. developers start building new LNG export plants, the United States may not give up the crown.\n\nMajor U.S. developers like Cheniere Energy, the largest U.S. exporter, have signed numerous long-term deals to sell LNG in recent months that should enable them to secure the financing needed to go forward with additional multibillion-dollar projects.\n\nMany of those long-term contracts came from Chinese buyers.\n\n\u201cAfter years of avoiding a commitment to buy U.S. LNG, Chinese companies have finally made their move,\u201d said Nikos Tsafos at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nSo far in 2021, most U.S. LNG exports went to Asia with about 13% going to South Korea, 13% to China and 10% to Japan, according to U.S. energy data. Those were the same top three destinations in 2020 when 13% of U.S. LNG went to South Korea, 12% to Japan and 9% to China.\n\nThe growth of U.S. LNG exports helps people worldwide \u201cget greater access to an abundant and reasonably-priced product that helps ease the world\u2019s current supply crunch,\u201d said Charlie Riedl, executive director for the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas (CLNG).\n\nGas prices around the world repeatedly reached record highs in 2021 as utilities tried to lock in LNG cargoes to rebuild low stockpiles in Europe and meet heavy demand in Asia. U.S. gas futures also rose, hitting a 12-year closing high in October. But after mild weather in early December, U.S. natgas stocks were replenished, and prices overseas are now 11 times higher.\n\nThe oil and gas industry touts natural gas as a less polluting fossil fuel than coal or oil. Gas burns more cleanly, so switching from coal lowers emissions, although unburned gas or methane released to the atmosphere contributes heavily to global warming.\n\nUtilities around the world have been using gas to keep power prices relatively low and maintain reliable electric grids as they meet rising energy demand while transitioning from coal to cleaner renewables. However, some countries, including China, have boosted coal production due to the lack of available LNG.\n\nAnalysts at RBN Energy said three developers will probably go forward with new projects over the next year: Cheniere\u2019s Stage 3 expansion at Corpus Christi in Texas, Venture Global\u2019s Plaquemines in Louisiana and Tellurian Inc\u2019s Driftwood in Louisiana.",

          "title": "OPEC+ Misses Oil Supply Target as Over-Compliance Hits 117% in November",
          "text": "Compliance with oil production cuts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies known as OPEC+ stood at 117 per cent in November, up from 116 per cent the previous month.\n\nThis indicated that the group\u2019s production levels continued to stay below agreed targets in the month under review, with compliance from the 10 OPEC countries participating in the production cut reaching 122 per cent and participating non-OPEC countries achieving 107 per cent.\n\nThe situation has further worsened as some members, mostly led by Nigeria have continued to struggle to increase output.\n\nThe figures excluded Mexico, which was yet to accept an official quota since July last year, but remains part of the agreement and sometimes features in the group\u2019s calculations.\n\nData seen by Argus showed the conformity of the 10 OPEC nations that participate in the production cut effort climbing to 122 per cent in November from 121 per cent in October, and non-OPEC compliance rising to 107 per cent from 106 per cent.\n\nComparatively, the group remained 580,000 bpd below its 37.94 million bpd November production target, even though collective output rose by 410,000 bpd month on month.\n\nOPEC+ producers continue to face difficulties in bringing back production at a time when the group is pressing ahead with monthly increases.\n\nThe coalition would raise its output goal by 400,000 bpd to 38.34 million bpd this month, and by the same amount again to 38.74 million bpd in January.\n\nThe gap between the theoretical production target and what the group delivers may explain the decision to proceed with output increases at a time of high uncertainty caused by the new, more transmissible Covid-19 Omicron variant.\n\nThis has led to several countries adopting restrictions in the run-up to year-end festivities.\n\nSeveral OPEC+ members, particularly in West Africa, have experienced infrastructural collapse, underfunding and sabotage in recent months, challenging their efforts to raise production\n\nIn the preceding month compliance by members of the cartel averaged 116 per compared with 115 per cent in September, according to documents, indicating that the group continued to produce less than its agreed targets.\n\nThe over-compliance was partly driven by Nigeria and Angola which had been struggling to grow production, with both countries around 240,000 bpd under their respective OPEC+ targets last month.\n\nWhile over-compliance was welcomed last year when demand collapsed in the wake of the pandemic, the OPEC+ group now faces pressure from key oil-consuming countries to raise output faster to soften global oil prices.\n\nNigeria\u2019s waning oil infrastructure, especially upstream, due to years of under-investment and last year\u2019s OPEC-induced shut down of some oil assets aimed at complying with the production cuts on the back of the Covid-19 pandemic, have combined to hobble Nigeria\u2019s production capacity.\n\nFor months, the country has been unable to meet its production obligation to the producers\u2019 group, further leading to a situation where demand outstripped supply by at least 600,000 bpd in October.\n\nAs a result of the increasing underperformance, OPEC produced barely half the oil production increase it had planned for October as African members, especially Nigeria and Angola continued to struggle with output losses.\n\nBut despite Nigeria regaining the top spot among crude oil producing countries in Africa with the nation\u2019s crude oil production averaging 1.27 million barrels per day in November, according to the latest monthly report from OPEC, it still failed to meet its allocation.\n\nThe previous month, Nigeria had lost its Africa\u2019s top oil producer status to the North African country, as its crude oil production continued to fall mainly due to ageing upstream infrastructure.\n\nIn that month, Nigeria\u2019s oil output fell to about 1.23 million barrels per day from about 1.25 million bpd the previous month, with Libya, which overtook Angola as the second-biggest producer on the continent in December last year, seeing its oil production rise to 1.24 million bpd.\n\nBut in November, Nigeria pumped an additional 47,000 barrels per day when compared to the 1.228 million bpd produced averagely in the month of October 2021.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "There appears to be conflicting research finding on the Omicron COVID-19 as a survey conducted by researchers at Oregon Health & Science University has found that infections in people who had been vaccinated, \u201cgreatly enhance immune response to variants of the virus.\u201d\n\nThe summary of the research findings obtained on the website of US-based Newsweek magazine on Monday, stated that a breakthrough infection, \u201cgenerates a robust immune response against the delta variant.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also believed that the immune responses from breakthrough infections caused by other variants, such as Omicron, would be similar.\n\nThe findings were at variance with that of the Imperial College London, which held that Omicron variant largely evades immunity from past infection or two vaccine doses.\n\nThe report (Report 49), from the Imperial College London COVID-19 response team had also estimated that the risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant was 5.4 times greater than that of the Delta variant.\n\nHowever, the study by researchers at Oregon Health & Science University discovered that antibodies in blood samples of those who experienced breakthrough cases were as much as 1,000 percent more effective than those generated two weeks after the second dose of a Pfizer vaccine.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get a better immune response than this,\u201d a senior author of the study and an assistant professor of molecular microbiology and immunology in the Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine, Fikadu Tafesse said.\n\n\u201cThese vaccines are very effective against severe disease. Our study suggests that individuals who are vaccinated and then exposed to a breakthrough infection have super immunity,\u201d Tafesse added in a statement.\n\nThe findings could show, \u201can eventual end game\u201d for the pandemic,\u201d a co-author of the study and associate professor of infectious diseases at the school, Marcel Curlin added.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re at the end of the pandemic, but it points to where we\u2019re likely to land: Once you\u2019re vaccinated and then exposed to the virus, you\u2019re probably going to be reasonably well-protected from future variants.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur study implies that the long-term outcome is going to be a tapering-off of the severity of the worldwide epidemic,\u201d he said.\n\nResearchers did not specifically examine the Omicron variant, which was first detected in South Africa in November and is now circulating throughout the US.\n\nBut Tafesse said they, \u201cwould anticipate that breakthrough infections from the omicron variant will generate a similarly strong immune response among vaccinated people.\u201d\n\nScientists are still tracking the new variant, but a South African study on Omicron published recently found that it appeared to be more resistant to vaccines, while causing less severe illness than the Delta variant.\n\nThe study compared COVID-19 immune response in blood samples from 52 people\u2014all employees of the university.\n\nOf those people, 26 had experienced mild breakthrough infections after they were vaccinated. Researchers say the study shows getting vaccinated is a crucial step to ending the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe key is to get vaccinated,\u201d Curlin said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a foundation of protection.\u201d\n\nBut amid concerns about the rapidly spreading omicron, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States and White House Chief Medical Adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci has described the booster jabs as the tool to fight the spread of omicron.\n\n\u201cOur booster vaccine regiments work against omicron,\u201d US-based ABC News quoted him to have said.\n\n\u201cAt this point, there is no need for a variant-specific booster,\u201d he added. While a specific booster was not needed, booster shots, in general, have been shown to greatly restore antibody levels in the fight against omicron, he added.",
