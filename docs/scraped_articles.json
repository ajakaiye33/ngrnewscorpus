          "title": "How to address Nigeria\u2019s socio-economic challenges \u2013 Uche Nwankwo",
          "text": "**It\u2019s difficult to solve our problems without paying attention lower strata\n\n**To present new book The Centrist Manifesto, next Tuesday in Lagos\n\nBy Clifford Ndujihe, Politics Editor\n\nTO surmount the deluge of socio-economic challenges burdening Nigeria, policy makers and all stakeholders must apart from the government pay attention to what happens at lower level such as companies and individual economic behaviour, erudite author, Uchenna Nwankwo, has said.\n\nNwankwo, in his latest book, The Centrist Manifesto, that will be launched next Tuesday, in Lagos, his study shows that \u201cNigeria\u2019s commercial, professional and industrial leaderships have not been as visionary and as creative as they ought to be. To a large extent, it is the economic collapses which occur within their scope of operation and influence, at the micro-levels, that manifest at the national scale and have largely led to the persistent cycles of massive corruption and economic stagnation that have become the norm of the Nigerian system for quite some time.\u201d\n\nThe 202-page book, which will be presented at the Nigeria Institute of International Affairs, is geared towards addressing the hydra-headed socio-economic and political problems militating against mankind, in general, and Nigeria, in particular.\n\nRenowned Economist and Management Consultant, Mr. Victor Mbamalu, will chair the event with Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State as special guest of honour.\n\nNigeria\u2019s socio-economic challenges\n\nExamining Nigeria\u2019s socio-economic challenges in Part 1 of the Three-part book, Nwankwo wrote: \u201cMost often analysis of Nigeria\u2019s social, economic and political conditions or lack of well-being focuses almost entirely on the role or contribution of government and political leaderships to that state of affairs. We generally tend to lose sight of the crippling input made by other forms of leadership to the nation\u2019s socio-economic and socio-political failures.\n\n\u201cI am talking about the contribution of the nation\u2019s captains of industry, pioneers and leading entrepreneurs, etc. to the malady. A close examination readily reveals that the extent to which the national economy is compromised at these lower levels is indeed enormous and ought to be taken into consideration by any genuine attempt at analysing, resolving and reversing the trends that have brought the society and economy to their present sorry past.\n\n\u201cIndeed, in so far as macroeconomic aggregates subsume the aggregation of decisions and activities at the micro-level, any pretensions at solving or proffering solutions to Nigeria\u2019s problems without paying adequate attention to the occurrences at the lower strata, at the level of companies and individual economic behaviour will completely miss the target.\n\n\u201cOur study shows that Nigeria\u2019s commercial, professional and industrial leaderships have not been as visionary and as creative as they ought to be. To a large extent, it is the economic collapses which occur within their scope of operation and influence, at the micro-levels, that manifest at the national scale and have largely led to the persistent cycles of massive corruption and economic stagnation that have become the lot of the Nigerian system for quite some time.\n\n\u201cThe contribution of the private sector of the Nigerian establishment to the dismal performance of the economy is best analysed using the professionals or professional groupings as index. We are referring to the style and modus operandi of our doctors, architects, engineers, accountants, pharmacists, lawyers, etc. It is noteworthy that one of the chief characteristics of Nigerian professionals is the trend towards fragmentation and the establishment of one-man practices. In Nigeria today, virtually every qualified professional architect, engineer, pharmacist, lawyers, etc., is a firm by himself.\n\n\u201cThis should be contrasted with the trend in most other parts of the world where it is common to find professional firms with very large pools of professional men and women making up each firm or corporate practice. In virtually all the developed economies, emerging markets and the seriously upwardly mobile developing countries most professional groups or firms usually consist of upwards of scores and hundreds of professionals. You would find, for instance, big law firms with up to one thousand or more lawyers, all working together and under one single corporate leadership; ditto for architects, engineers, etc.\n\nThe advantage of the latter kind of set-up, collocation or clustering together is that there is synergy, specialisation even within the profession, cross fertilisation of ideas, research and economy of scale. This is a recipe for efficiency, optimum performance and progress. Indeed, this is what organisation is all about! It is well known that usually each professional man tends to be very good in particular branches of the profession and not so good in some others. There are really very few all- rounders.\n\nThus, some architects, for instance, are either good in design, detailing, presentation, site works or supervision, contract management or job letting, etc., or a combination of a number of these or other aspects of the professional duties of the architect. Large professional architectural firms thus have the potential of being made up of \u2018experts\u2019 in virtually all the branches and aspects of the professional calling. On the face of it therefore, the large firm is in a better position to handle a professional job and assignment more efficiently and successfully than a small group or one-man firm.\n\n\u201cIt is these successes that are recorded at the micro- levels, at the level of companies and firms by such large and organised groups that translate into the economic success and development that manifest at the macro-level, at the level of society and nation. In contrast, the presumed failures, handicaps or inefficiency and poorly conceived and shoddily executed projects that characterise small professional groups or one-man firms, translate to dismal economic performances that seem to have become part and parcel of \u2018unorganised\u2019 societies and countries like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHave you stopped to imagine or contemplate how the many one-doctor clinics and hospitals that dot the Nigerian landscape and healthcare delivery system manage \u2013 say, during surgery? Well, the picture is that you would in a generality of cases, have the single in-house doctor perform diverse roles \u2013 acting the part of the surgeon and perhaps those of a number of these: the aesthetician, technician or controller of the oxygen cans and other equipment, bio- chemist, pharmacist, administrator of all the myriad operations that go with surgery \u2013 all by himself, and perhaps with the aid of a few ill-qualified, ill-motivated and inexperienced nurses. With that kind of scenario, does it surprise anybody that these one-doctor clinics and hospitals have very few successful operations or surgery; that they indeed constitute slaughter houses in which innumerable patients get butchered every now and then?\n\nSo to recap, the failures and collapses recorded by these outfits constitute part of the drawbacks that have kept Nigeria\u2019s healthcare delivery system in the doldrums.\n\nIt can equally be shown that the picture painted above of the one-man architectural firm or the one-doctor hospital in Nigeria could be replicated and likened to some of the operations of the other numerous one-man professional outfits in Nigeria, be it in engineering practice and some of the ill-network of roads, public drains or other line-systems some of them design and supervise; in accountancy and some of the shoddy and fraudulent audit reports that emanate from that sector; in law practice and some of the innumerable un- researched ill-conceived advocacies some of them proffer; and the rest of them. It is all a catalogue of dismal failures at the micro-levels that have ultimately translated to collapses at the macro-level or the level of nation and society.\n\n\u201cIt is not only that these small practices do not have the right depth of staff to generate the right professional advice and work, they also cannot muster the right resources to acquire the needed tools and equipment, books, professional journals, etc. that should keep them in line with the latest developments and new concepts in any of the professional callings. Little wonder then that they can hardly perform, help themselves and make the requisite contribution expected from them to our social, economic, technological, and even political progress.\n\n\u201cWhat are the unique factors that have tended to detract the Nigerian professionals from the corporate track commonly trodden by their counterparts in other parts of the world? What are those peculiarities of the Nigerian professionals that seemingly make them so different from professionals from other lands? Again, we prefer to seek the answers from the micro-levels. The truth is that historically the Nigerian pioneer and leading professionals who more or less took over from the expatriate professional firms did not take care of the younger generation of (Nigerian) professionals that came later or that served under them.\n\n\u201cIn their general drive to \u2018maximise\u2019 profit, the pioneers and leading professionals threw the standards established by white men or the colonialist expatriates they replaced, overboard and began to appropriate virtually all incomes made by the new firms to themselves, leaving peanuts for the retinue of employed fellow professionals and other sundrystaff that worked under them even when these employees worked on multi-million dollar projects which attract huge fees for the firm.\n\n\u201cIn fact, matters did degenerate to a point where the corporate leaders began to determine the salaries of their employees based on the notion that they should and would be collecting huge sums of money as \u2018gifts\u2019 from whatever contractor or companies they supervise or superintend over. This generally forces the younger professional to depend on the contractors\u2019 hand-outs for virtually all his livelihood. And being thus compromised, the project suffers, for as the saying goes, there is no free lunch. It is this kind of in-built corruption that account for shoddy jobs and the lowering of standards that is so commonplace in Nigeria. The scenario is also typified in the civil service where too many people are employed but paid such mean salaries that they become permanently and perpetually corruption-prone.\n\n\u201cIt is in fact woe betide thee for any of these young professionals or employees that refuses to toe the line; to feed from the filthy lucre offered by those individuals or companies he superintends over, for it is his colleagues, bosses, even relatives and \u2018friends\u2019 that will bury him alive and dance on top of his grave for his mere non- compliance with the subsisting system in operation \u2013 to say nothing about the excruciating impact of the poor salary and wages on which he is signed on. Yet we all moan about corruption and make believe that we detest its negative impact on the country! And that we would want it eradicated from society.\n\nGiven that scenario, it can be said that in Nigeria, corruption is compelling, and will remain so for as long as the status quo persists. The above scenario should be contrasted with what obtains among some internationally-linked business outfits where some level of prudence and fairness in distributive standards \u2013 the so-called \u2018international standards of ethics\u2019 \u2013 prevail. We are talking about what is witnessed among some of the foreign oil companies and suchlike that do\n\nbusiness in Nigeria. Here, different rules appear to operate. We find that in generality of cases, many Nigerians who work for such companies refuse to accept hand-outs from contractors and professional groups that work for them or handle their consultancy briefs. But this, as many of such individuals would say, is because they are well paid by the companies they work for and therefore do not need to \u2018palm\u2019 such \u2018gifts\u2019 or \u2018hand-out\u2019. We agree that this might well be due largely to the monitoring mechanisms inherent in most of these multinational companies. But these are Nigerians nonetheless!\n\nTherefore, it is safe to conclude that what makes the difference is the system. And that the persistence of corruption as witnessed in the earlier scenario is patently systemic. The average Nigerian young professional is therefore more of a victim of the system than the happy exploiter of it. Indeed, many feel quite humiliated by the status quo, and some do try to extricate themselves from that system of values and livelihood; to shorn a beggarly existence and perpetual manipulation by (or collusion with) contractors, or clients in the case of accountants, auditors, etc.\n\nMovement of Individualism & Enthronement of Anarchy\n\nHistorically, the above subsisting Nigerian system has led to bad blood and fragmentation of professional firms across the board as well as a gross lowering of professional ethics and standards. For being thus humiliated and short- changed by the system, most of the younger Nigerian professionals predictably move out from the established firms to seek solace in the establishment of smaller groups and/or one-man outfits. Before you knew it, a pattern emerged in which younger Nigerian professionals generally moved on or were expected to establish their own professional firms as soon as they pass their professional practice exams or immediately after pupillage. Hence the emergence of the unique degenerate Nigerian system and fractured or compromised professional ethics or culture discussed above, in which virtually every qualified professional becomes a firm of his own. That culture is one of incipient disorganisation and anarchy, which has inextricably affected the larger society for the worse.\n\nIt is now clear that what happened was that as the number of firms in any one professional group mushroomed, the practitioners were inevitably forced by the cut-throat competition that became the order of the day to begin to undercut one another in order to remain afloat. The rules of professional conduct and all the extant regulation that were set up to regulate and guide professional practice were virtually jettisoned and compromised by the day.\n\nIn Nigeria today, we have degenerated to severe underhanded practices; to a level where, for instance, a professional firm could, in collusion with government officials steal a proposal submitted to government by another professional group, erase the name of that firm from the document, affix his own imprint, resubmit same, collect the contract and smile to the banks without any repercussion for such a dastardly unprofessional conduct. In Nigeria today, integrity hardly counts, nor is professional competence of much consequence. All these have in turn ravaged the professions leading to paralysis and the collapses of many professional groups, large or small.\n\nMeanwhile, the predictably derisory services offered by the inadequately staffed, ill-funded and withering local firms and companies became manifest and unbearable. The trend has partially created the loophole for foreign professional groups and companies to recapture the commanding heights of professional practice in the country. It has reasserted the \u201conly-white-hand-can-do-it\u201d syndrome in virtually all areas of professional practice in the country, be it in engineering design and construction, accountancy and architecture.\n\nThus many key projects or contracts are now being let out as turn-key projects in which foreign groups and companies handle everything from design to construction and even furnishing and interior decor. Examples abound and include the refurbishment and standardisation of the nation\u2019s Railway, the multi-billion naira Abuja National Stadium Complex and of course innumerable important projects in the private sector, especially in the nation\u2019s fledgling oil industry.\n\nThe Nigerian medical system with its many ill-staffed, ill-equipped hospitals and clinics, public or private, is side- tracked by those who can afford to go abroad for even the slightest of afflictions. But for the expected insurmountable difficulties the nation\u2019s judicial and legal systems pose for the foreigner or the uninitiated, foreign lawyers and legal practitioners would have invaded and taken over legal advocacies offered by the lucrative litigation-prone Nigerian environment. Did the Federal Government of Nigeria not hire a team of foreign lawyers to research into and represent her at the World Court in our then dispute with Cameroun over the ownership of the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula?\n\nObviously, one of the reasons for that action was that no local legal firm was thought to possess the manpower and research capability and resources to corner such a lucrative contract or brief. In the same vein, it would appear, no local accounting firm is thought large and strong enough to possess the capacity to audit big government parastatals like the NNPC. The pre-shipment inspection agents that inspect imports coming into the fatherland at about one per cent of the value of these imports as fee must not be Nigerians, if for no other reason, because Nigerian professionals and businessmen have not been able to show capacity and capability by building any agency or firms that can boast of the staffing and other resources to undertake such assignments. So, we have to pay huge scarce foreign exchange resources to get foreigners to perform these otherwise simple tasks for us.\n\nOne obvious and damaging consequence of the above trend is that government\u2019s presumed attempts to reflate the economy by the award of huge road construction and other contracts have ended up being dismal failures because the multi-national companies that get these contracts repatriate virtually all the disproportionately large proceeds while their local counterparts similarly siphon whatever they get abroad for savings and investment in the more stable economies of the Western world. Under the prevailing system where no form of protection is offered to workers, they get away with paying the local labourers and employees that work under their supervision just enough to keep body and soul together.\n\nThis then obviates and obstructs the trickle-down effect that should have put more money into the hands of Nigerians through the quantum of solid and substantial earnings expected to accrue to the skilled and unskilled workers in the nation\u2019s construction or service sector in general. The effect is to prolong the economic depression that has been with us for so long by stagnating consumer purchasing power and disposable incomes of the masses of Nigerian citizens.\n\nIndeed, in recent times, many leading Nigerian professional architects and engineers have turned into portfolio consultants. They no longer maintain offices and staff nor do they bother to make use of (younger) Nigerian professionals and draughtsmen as employees in the execution of lucrative design schemes and briefs that come their way. Rather, the practice today is to hop over to Ghana where they engage Ghanaian consultants and professional groups in the execution, design, detailing and drafting of the assigned projects, and of course pay cheaply in grossly devalued cedi, the Ghanaian currency.\n\nIn the meantime, many young Nigerian graduate- professionals are left without work and avenues to imbibe needed professional ethos and practical training. It is clear that if this trend continues, then in the near future, the professional instincts of jobless Nigerian graduate-professionals will atrophy; many will turn to trading and crime, and national professional and technological know- how will be the worse for it.\n\nIt is regrettable that some senior Nigerian professionals who have been exposed and are knowledgeable about developments and professional practice in the more advanced countries of the world could allow themselves to embrace the odd notion that there are too many professionally trained people in Nigeria. Trained architects in Nigeria for instance number less than a few tens of thousands! In some of the developed economies, that number could make up just about three or four architectural firms. Sadly, in Nigeria, they would represent thousands of firms. Mark you; we are not saying that small or one-man practices are native to Nigeria alone. No, developed countries equally have them but their proportion in such climes are not as large as what we have!\n\nThe picture in other professions conforms to the above model. But rather than see the problem in the available number of firms, many Nigerian professional leaders prefer or pretend to see the problem in terms of the available number of individual professionals! Thus instead of devising measures to mollify the alienated younger professionals, they cast off in the opposite direction and adopt measures that further alienate and frustrate the younger members of the professions, creating chaos and untold upheavals and declines in the social and economic aesthetics of the nation.\n\nBut the above synthesis is not limited to the professions. The model is applicable to all private sector players and operators in the Nigerian economy, be they in the commercial, industrial or agricultural sectors. The winner- takes-all syndrome painted for professionals above is noticeable in the myriad trading, manufacturing, agricultural and other establishments or sectors of the economy. There is a systemic process and abiding general propensity for those at the helm to consistently corner a disproportionate size of company incomes or added-value to themselves and leave a\n\npittance to the mass of hired hands and labourers that are used in running these outfits, companies and organisations.\n\nA survey of factor-shares in Nigeria\u2019s quoted or public liability companies clearly underscores this point. Many of these companies devote very low proportions of their added- value to the payment of salaries and wages and general staff welfare. This is to say nothing of undeclared incomes that do not come under the purview of distribution between the relevant and requisite factors of production \u2013 Labour and Capital.\n\nThe situation is even worse in the private or limited liability companies and in the so-called informal sector where generally speaking one man represents or functions both as chairman and managing director of a company as well as its board of directors. Here anything goes, and really nobody is there to call the chief executive officer, CEO, to account for anything, either in terms of taking good care of employees, paying adequate salaries and wages or even in terms of paying commensurate tax to state coffers, and over-indulgence.\n\nWhen these occurrences are put down in a generalised fashion, people might and do get the impression that the situation is exaggerated. But we have come across several instances of this discouraging practice on the part of some Nigerian business organisations that could startle anybody.\n\nAbout ten years ago, we came across a letter of employment emanating from a renowned law firm in which a qualified lawyer and university graduate of nearly ten years\u2019 postgraduate experience was being offered a basic salary of N3,000.00 a month with various allowances making up a total of N10,000.00 gross monthly pay package, to work six-days a week in the company.\n\nMany graduate school teachers earn less than N6,000.00 per month, all-found, to teach in many of the growing number of private schools that actually make a killing in their line of business; that derive fantastic revenues from the army of Nigerian parents and guardians that are so eager to pull their wards out of the deteriorating Nigerian public schools. This is at a time when the stipulated minimum wage in the country was put at N18,000.00 per month for unskilled workers.\n\nIndeed, Governments\u2019 attempts to bolster the take- home pay of workers through the praxis or stipulation of minimum wage have been less than effective for a number of reasons. One, such stipulations usually do not go far enough. Two, the stipulations are hardly adhered to in the private sector. Three, in the areas where such is respected and upheld, like the civil service and the big firms, these pegged rates are usually quickly overtaken over time by developments in the economy, especially in times of galloping inflation and as a result of stiff increases in national income or productivity.\n\nNow if the above salary offer, in our above example of a company which offered a pittance to a university graduate it wanted to employ, was coming from some low-level company battling to stay afloat, the offer would not cause any consternation or surprise anybody. But the Law firm alluded to above and its subsidiaries were leaders in the industry and were known to be making a killing in the field. Its proprietor was one of the nation\u2019s leading lights, a social and human rights crusader who ought to know the overall impact and implication of this kind of salary structure on the economic and other rights of the recipient and the Nigerian economy as a whole.\n\nAs a highly successful firm, the company could afford to pay a lot more than it was offering. But the instinct to maximise profit in an environment with a glut of qualified applicants and job-seekers appears to be the restraining factor. With this scenario, it appears that the hope of reflating the Nigerian economy via the so-called trickle-down effect, (in which large firms and/or generous recipients of high incomes and government fat contracts are expected to better the earnings of their employees) will never come about.\n\nIn the Nigerian informal sector, the notorious one-man business syndrome is most pronounced. Take the traders and the array of semi-skilled artisans, welders, plumbers, motor mechanics, for instance. There is little effort on the part of this social category to forge medium or large-scale organisations, to build economies of scale, trading conglomerates and such like; structures that can muster the resources that would ensure sustainable and promising future and leverage for the company, and that would cushion its members against risks and unforeseen bad times and hence enhance the quality of life of its members.\n\nRather, what we see is the same propensity on the part of leading members of this group to build one-man empires, short-change their employees, associates and appropriate virtually every income to themselves. Again, the result has been the kind of fragmentation prevalent among the professionals. It is a situation that, for the traders, produces honeycomb market structures and myriad tiny squalid windowless market stalls where these traders display their odd wares and engage in cut-throat competition and petty frauds. This should be contrasted with the modern emergent mega-shopping facilities and department stores that have become a permanent and endearing feature of progressive nations of the world.\n\nIn all the more progressive states of the world, what we see or what transpires virtually by the day are mergers of giant corporations to produce even larger groups and combines. The new emergent mega-companies are then able to pool together more resources to carry out new and intricate research, patent new inventions and create new wealth and fantastic fortunes. In Nigeria on the other hand, the general trend is towards ruptures and disintegration into smaller ineffective and unproductive groups.\n\nConversely, Nigeria\u2019s pinnacle of wealth is not populated by men that have patented any inventions nor even earned their riches through copyright in artistic or any other form of intellectual work. Rather the majority of the country\u2019s men of riches are people who made their money through government either as contractors, suppliers or through dubious deals and swindling, grand larceny and outright embezzlements. It is a process that impoverishes the masses and breeds more and more corruption, indolence, and dependence on crude petroleum resources that Nigerians do not even tap or mine by themselves. This truncates societal values and work-ethic, erodes and whittles the authority of those in government to the extent that there is such acute erosion of authority that they virtually fall back to naked force to get anything done.\n\nParlous Economy & Social Disintegration\n\nThe cumulative effect of the above build-ups can be easily enumerated. First, there is a mammoth concentration of national resources in fewer and fewer hands that have practically wiped off the middle class in the country. (Nigeria is now said to have one of the world\u2019s highest levels of inequality; its Gini coefficient, which is a measure of the level of inequality in the system, is put as high as 0.6. Of course with such a high level of inequality most people are untouched by economic development as most increases in income accrue to those who are already rich).\n\nSecondly, there is a dangerously depreciating disposable income and purchasing power for a large proportion of the populace. Thirdly, mass unemployment and a process of internal marginalisation that has been grinding away the foundations of society are evident everywhere. Fourthly, public life is marked by financial indiscipline at the workplace and a concomitant endemic corruption in high and low places. Fifthly, the crime waves keep rising.\n\nThese then are some of the main factors or manifestations that shape the decidedly parlous Nigerian economy. The low and depreciating purchasing power of consumers has been responsible for poor sales on the part of manufacturers and producers in general, leading as it were to overflow inventory in company warehouses, cut-backs in production, retrenchments and general business collapses.\n\nAnother remarkable dysfunctional feature of the Nigerian economy is the tendency on the part of owners and captains of industry to import wholesale foreign-built industrial plants and machinery. There is little attempt to have Nigerians design and fabricate machinery and manufacturing plants locally. The persistent attempt by our industry captains to rely solely on foreign technology for Nigeria\u2019s industrial production purposes has indeed had a very profound and negative impact on the economy.\n\nIn the first place, because these imported technological artefacts are too sophisticated for our stage of development and call for continuous and steady supply of spare parts from the original producers, they constitute a permanent drain of the nation\u2019s scarce resources. Even so, Nigerian technicians often have great difficulty in providing the kind of maintenance demanded by these machines and production plants. Invariably, the plants break down and have to be discarded and replaced with new and even more sophisticated newer models.\n\nAlternatively, foreign engineers and technicians are imported at great cost to fix or repair them. It has in fact been calculated that the cost incurred by Nigerians in importing, repairing and replacing these plants generally outstrip the net value added to the economy by these artefacts. Conversely, the indiscriminate wholesale importation and employment of foreign technology or alien machines and production plants contribute more in the impoverishment of Nigerians than in the economic development of the country we target.\n\nA case in point is the unending turn-around- maintenance of Nigeria\u2019s foreign-built state-owned oil refineries. The project which again is being handled by foreign technical experts is said to have gulped, in the last thirty years, over N5.5 billion (about US$3 billion dollars), an amount that could quite easily have built new refineries for the country, especially, if handled by local engineers and technicians, for some of these foreign-built refineries are not better than the Biafran-built Amandugba petroleum refinery now of yore. It is truly arguable whether the actual values added to the nation\u2019s economy by these foreign-built refineries are anywhere near the total cost paid by Nigeria for their construction and maintenance over the years.\n\nSecondly, the wholesale employment of foreign technological artefacts by Nigerian manufacturers, construction firms, etc., tends to de-emphasise and discourage the use of labour-intensive modes of production as well as whittle labour incomes. It alienates the masses of abundant and capable human labour resources in the country from the workplace and creates what is generally termed technological unemployment. This adds to the massive unemployment situation in the country and helps swell the rank of retail traders milling around in every nook and cranny of the country virtually stampeding or choking the economy by its sheer size. For what we have is a situation where a disproportionate size of young men and women who should be working in factories, farms, etc., roam the streets all day long in the name of trading or business.\n\nIndeed, in the last few decades, Nigeria has witnessed a geometric rise in the proportion of its populace engaged in the retail trading sub-sector while the proportion of those that could be regarded as producers of any kind of goods have shrunk to a point where Nigeria could be derisively referred to as largely a nation of traders \u2013 traders of mainly imported goods. This is a minus for the country, for no great economy can be built through low production at home and a propensity for a great majority of its citizens to turn into importers and sellers of foreign goods.\n\nThe third consequence of Nigeria\u2019s over-dependence on foreign technological artefacts is that local initiative at the creation of an indigenous technological culture is dampened and permanently stifled. The Biafran revolution had aptly\n\ndemonstrated that an indigenous black technological civilisation is possible and achievable around here. The absence of such a civilisation in Nigeria today is therefore clearly not inherent in the quality of mankind that inhabit the geographical space called Nigeria, but definitely on the way the country has been managed or mismanaged since the end of the Nigeria-Biafra war.\n\nWeak and visionless political leadership\n\nOur analysis in the foregoing has tended, on the face of it, to blame the dismal performance of the economy on the actions of company managers, captains of industry and leading members of the business community. The analysis may have given the impression that the problem of efficient and sound national economic management is further complicated by the fact that actors and managers in the economy are many and diverse, pursuing multiple and often mutually opposing objectives. It is not by any means so.\n\nThe operators and managers mentioned above only deal at the micro-levels of the economy. National economic management deals with the issues at the macro-level, at the level of national political leadership. It is thus the general duty of government, at the national level, to give overall direction in all matters of economic development. It is the duty of the Federal Government of Nigeria to manipulate the macro-economic variables in such a way as to check any dysfunctional and economically oppressive attitudes and enactments at the micro-levels, to provide overall health to the national economy. But how well has this vital role of government been handled over the years?\n\nThe answer to that question is of course located in the perceived and actual state of well-being of the economy itself. Accordingly, it is obvious that governments\u2019 efforts in this direction have been less than assiduous and efficacious.",
          "summary": "It is noteworthy that one of the chief characteristics of Nigerian professionals is the trend towards fragmentation and the establishment of one-man practices.\nWhat are those peculiarities of the Nigerian professionals that seemingly make them so different from professionals from other lands?\nIndeed, in recent times, many leading Nigerian professional architects and engineers have turned into portfolio consultants.\nThe model is applicable to all private sector players and operators in the Nigerian economy, be they in the commercial, industrial or agricultural sectors.\nThese then are some of the main factors or manifestations that shape the decidedly parlous Nigerian economy.",

He urged journalists and other communication professionals to amplify the Commission\u2019s voice in its publicity and sensitization of the citizens and all stakeholders on the importance of the new generation network towards the economic development of the nation.\n\nThe NCC Chief Executive stated that the Commission looks forward, very enthusiastically, to a robust collaboration with all stakeholders in communication practice, in order to ensure goal-oriented reporting of the unfolding national developments in the digital economy sector, because of the derivable benefits to the citizens, businesses and the nation at large.\n\nWhile thanking the Management of National Economy for the visit, commendation and support to the Commision over the years, Danbatta also expressed NCC\u2019s commitment to sustaining its favourable relationship with the media.\n\nThe delegation from the National Economy was led by Chief Mike Okpare, Vice Chairman.

          "text": "NNPC, as the sole importer of PMS into the country, awards contracts to its vendors for shipment of the commodity. The vendors, depending on their partnership with oil merchants in turn contract them for shipment into the country.\n\nFor every country, there are specifications for their PMS requirements. Upon arrival of the consignment in Atlas Cove jetty off the coast in Lagos, the NMDPRA, formerly DPR, moves in to the vessel to test the conformity of the product with the Nigerian standard before it is released into the market. The highest methanol level for Nigeria is just about two per cent.\n\nOnce the product meets the required standard, it is then sent to the depots for onward discharge to marketers through the various means of transportation available, including through the pipelines.\n\nBut the question on stakeholders mind is at what point could the product have been contaminated? For some, what has happened may not have been contamination of the product in the real sense of it. This is because the vendor contracted to import the fuel already knows the standard requirement of the country. Therefore, bringing in something contrary to the requirement means it is an \u201coff Spec\u201d.\n\nYet, others believe that there could have been a compromise in the supply chain. Reason? Officials of the NMDPRA are expected to inspect the quality of the fuel upon landing at Atlas Cove before it is released the market.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, for some stakeholders, attention should be focused on the importer, Duke oil and Litasco, for the \u201coff spec\u201d brought into the country. This is because a major marketer, Total, was the first to discover the substandard quality of the consignment it got following a test it conducted on its allocation. Others like MRS were to later discover same.\n\nLitasco, is a firm founded in 2000 in Switzerland. It is the exclusive international marketing and trading company of LUKOIL Oil Company, a Russian firm. Litasco describes itself as one of the world\u2019s major traders of crude oil and refined petroleum products.\n\nThe question now is how did the consignment escape the supposedly eagles eye of the Nigerian oil regulators?",

I. Oye and Associates, with each company allotted 5 million shares.\n\nOjerinde and a company \u2013 Dolaf Nigeria Limited \u2013 are also shareholders in the bank.\n\nAt the mention of the case, Shogunle told the court that the plea bargain talks between the parties had failed.

          "text": "A group, Citizens Advocacy Centre (CAC), has urged President Muhamamadu Buhari to reinstate the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police Abba Kyari to add bite to the fight against kidnapping and other forms of criminality across the country.\n\nThe group argued that since no criminal case was established against Kyari, as was evident in the final letter from the office of the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, he has been cleared of all allegations.\n\nCAC further stressed: \u201cThe letter was very clear on the fact that all investigations done have cleared DCP Kyari of all criminal and corruption allegations\u201d.\n\nKyari was implicated by Abbas Ramon, popularly known as Hushpuppi, a Nigerian undergoing prosecution in USA for fraud.\n\nBut the group maintained: \u201cThe letter from the Attorney General clearly said no dime was given to Kyari by Hushpuppi or anybody under prosecution in USA as celebrated during the media trial last year\u201d.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to CAC, with no evidence provided against an officer of high standing like Kyari, it leaves much to be desired to hear that Nigeria is in discussion with the US government over Kyari\u2019s extradition.\n\nThe group, in a statement signed by its Chairman, Barr Joseph Donald, explained that Malami, \u201cnever said Nigeria was already holding talks with its US counterpart to extradite Kyari\u201d.\n\nRather, it explained: \u201cWhat the Honourable Minister said was, if there was any criminal case found in the investigations, it might warrant commencing a process of extradition.\n\n\u201cHe was clear on it. The Minister also knows that the process of extradition is cumbersome and difficult and not a straight jacket because there\u2019s a court of law, which usually adjudicates to determine if there is a Criminal case committed and there are more than enough criminal evidence warranting extraditions or trial of the case here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the first investigation resulted in nothing but cleared Kyari\u2019s name. Yet, due to pressure from certain quarters, another investigation was instituted.\n\n\u201cSecond investigations also cleared Kyari on all criminal/Corruption grounds but it was clear from the first investigation and second investigations that, two key areas of infractions on police duties were mentioned against Kyari. One, the use of social media to defend himself without IGP permission and two, commencing the process of investigating a reported case without due process of getting an approved petition from the IGP.\n\n\u201cThese infractions were deemed disciplinary offences relating to internal police matters and not corruption or criminal offences. These infractions which are not criminal offences are always handled internally between the Police and Police Service Commission based on disciplinary laid down rules.\u201d",

          "text": "By Muyiwa Lucas; Bolaji Ogundele, John Ofikhenua, Abuja; Segun Showunmi, Ibadan and Toba Adedeji, Osogbo\n\nFear grips Petroleum Ministry department\n\nScarcity spreads to Osun\n\nHow did the adulterated petrol get into the country? Whose negligence or compromise led to it?\n\nThese and other issues around the toxic petrol are to be unravelled after a probe by the Federal Government, Minister of State Petroleum Resources Timipre Sylva said yesterday.\n\nSylva said: \u201cThere\u2019ll be a major investigation to unravel everything and then let\u2019s really get to the bottom of it before we can come back and tell you what is going to happen to the culprits.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cWe know that some people\u2019s vehicles must have also been damaged. That is also going to be taken into consideration in dealing with the situation.\u201d\n\nSylva\u2019s statement unsettled officials of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe NMDPRA is a department in the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, not a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited as earlier reported.\n\nIt is responsible for the inspection of the imported petroleum products.\n\n\u201cThose in the unit are jittery\u201d, a source told The Nation last night.\n\nNMDPRA on Tuesday said methanol above Nigeria\u2019s specification was discovered in a limited quantity of petrol in the supply chain.\n\nIt said the impacted product had been isolated and withdrawn from the market, including the loaded trucks in transit.\n\nThe development resulted in product scarcity in Abuja, Lagos and other cities.\n\nSylva, speaking with State House Correspondents after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the Presidential Villa, said he met with President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday over the matter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in a position to disclose the identities of the companies, but there are some issues and we are actively tackling it.\n\n\u201cNobody has, before now, checked for methanol in our fuel. It\u2019s not very usual and this is the first time this is happening and NNPC is very much up to the task.\n\n\u201cI will also convey your question to NNPC and maybe NMDPRA, but we\u2019re actively handling it and I want to assure you that the problem will be a thing of the past very soon,\u201d he said.\n\nAn industry player wondered how the contaminated product could have found its way into the country as refineries produce only requested specifications.\n\nThe source explained that once an importer sends its country specification to a refinery, the product must meet that standard.\n\n\u201cNormally, if a country is importing from a refinery, it will give its specification of the product. And when the product arrives, it is taken to the DPR laboratory in Lagos for a test.\n\n\u201cIt usually arrives in Lagos by the mother basin in the high sea, from where smaller vessels collect.\n\n\u201cOnce it comes to the depot, the DPR tests the product. DPR has to do a water test and a purity test as to whether the chemical is okay for Nigeria\u2019s standard.\n\n\u201cPeople realised that this particular one was adulterated when motorists started using it.\u201d\n\nThe scarcity caused by the toxic petrol withdrawal extended to Oyo and Osun states yesterday.\n\nThere were queues in many petrol stations in Ibadan, the Oyo capital, and Osogbo, the Osun capital, and environs.\n\nBut the NMDPRA said Nigeria currently has 20 days of petrol sufficiency and that there was no need for panic buying.\n\nThe department said it was also working round the clock with other stakeholders to address the issue of substandard PMS.\n\nNMDPRA Chief Executive Mr Farouk Ahmed, in a meeting with downstream industry stakeholders in Lagos, said: \u201cI am happy to say that loading has been going on in most of the depots because we have been able to identify, isolate and quarantine the limited amount of gasoline that was affected by the methanol volume that was discovered.\n\n\u201cWe have vessels that have arrived in the country recently. At least six arrived in the last few days ordered by the NNPC carrying a total volume of close to 300 million litres just to close the gap created by those vessels we have withdrawn from the system.\n\n\u201cAll in all, as of today (yesterday), we have about 20 days sufficiency of PMS in the country.\n\n\u201cOur ideal days of sufficiency are 30 but the withdrawal of the vessel created the gap in our 30 days sufficiency.\n\n\u201cAgain, with aggressive importation by the NNPC, this will be closed in a few days from the data we got from the NNPC\u2019s import programme.\n\n\u201cLoading is also ongoing in most of the depots that have confirmed spec products so there is no need for panic. Hopefully, by tomorrow (today) or early Friday, Lagos will be cleared.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, a 9,000MT vessel was about to discharge at the Apapa Port, which would be providing PMS to major marketers including OVH Energy, TotalEnergies, 11 Plc, ConOil and Ardova Plc.\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) confirmed the sale of adulterated petrol in some service outlets in the Southeast.\n\nThe Chairman of IPMAN, Enugu Depot Community, Mr Chinedu Anyaso, whose zone covers Anambra, Ebonyi and Enugu states, said the development had been communicated to the headquarters of the association.\n\nMany vehicle ranges are believed to have been damaged by the toxic fuel.\n\n\u201cWe have received complaints about the sale of bad petrol within Enugu Zone for about two weeks now.\n\n\u201cWe have escalated the information to our zonal and national secretariats, which are already talking with the NNPC.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we have tried to protect customers by directing our members to stop selling such product until it is tested and approved by the regulatory agencies,\u201d Anyaso said.\n\nIPMAN has also directed its members to suspend the distribution of the toxic petrol.\n\nIts National Vice President, Alhaji Abubakar Maigandi, told The Nation: \u201cWe have told our marketers to stop buying from the depots until they get the one that doesn\u2019t have methanol.\u201d\n\nMore petrol stations in Abuja sold the petrol yesterday compared to the previous day, but black marketers were seen selling on roadsides.\n\nThe retail outlets that sold had very long queues that obstructed traffic flow on major roads.\n\nThe contaminated fuel was brought in by Duke Oil, a trading arm of the NNPC Limited.\n\nDuke Oil had supplied a cargo of petrol purchased from an international trader, Litasco, which was delivered in Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer.\n\nThe vessel, carrying about 50, 000 metric tons of petrol or 100 million litres discharged in the Lagos port between January 24 and 30.\n\nIt was learnt that from this vessel, some major oil marketers such as OHV, MRS, NIPCO, Ardova and Total got a combined 36.958 metric tonnes of the contaminated fuel.\n\nMRS, in a statement, said upon receiving the product in its depot and distribution to eight of its stations in Lagos, it was observed that the product appeared hazy and dark.\n\nAn analysis revealed that the product had 20 per cent methanol, an illegal substance.\n\n\u201cAs a Company, we are aware that alcohol/ethanol is not permitted to be mixed in PMS specification. We immediately informed NNPC, NMDPRA and MOMAN and it was confirmed that other members had similar experiences,\u201d the statement read.\n\nMRS said the adulterated product had been isolated and would not be sold to the public.\n\nIn Ebonyi State, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) arrested six persons conveying 90,000 litres of adulterated petroleum products.\n\nThe State Commandant, Terrumun Gbue, told reporters in Abakiliki that the suspects were arrested on the Abakaliki-Enugu federal highway on Monday night.\n\nNNPC generates N2.613tr in one year\n\nAlso yesterday, the NNPC said it generated N2.613 trillion from the sale of petrol from August 2020 to August 2021.\n\nThis was contained in the August 2021 Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR), according to the NNPC Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Malam Garba Deen Muhammad yesterday.\n\nHe said: \u201cTotal revenues generated from the sales of white products for the period of August 2020 to August 2021 stood at N2.619trillion with petrol contributing about 99.76 per cent of the total sales with a value of ?2.613trillion.\u201d\n\nThe total sale of white products for August 2020 to August 2021 stood at 20.032billion, with petrol accounting for 99.81 per cent.\n\nIn terms of value, said the NNPC spokesman, a total sum of N203.43billion was made on the sale of white products by PPMC in August 2021.\n\nThe NNPC said in the downstream sector, a total of 1.532billion litres of white products were sold and distributed by the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), a downstream subsidiary of the NNPC, in August 2021.\n\nThe NNPC also announced a total of $224.29 million receipts from crude oil and gas export in August 2021. This is against $191.26million in July 2021.\n\nA breakdown of the figures captured in the August 2021 NNPC MFOR showed that export of crude oil amounted to $7.77million while gas and miscellaneous receipts stood at $65.26 million and $151.26million.\n\nTotal crude oil and gas export receipt for the period of August 2020 to August 2021 stood at $1.84billion.\n\nIn the gas sector, a total of 233.57 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas was produced in August 2021, translating to an average daily production of 7,534.67million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd).\n\nFrom August 2020 to August 2021, a total of 2,890.67bcf of gas was produced representing an average daily production of 7,303.61mmscfd during the period.\n\nPetroleum tanker drivers threatened to proceed on strike over the condition of critical roads.\n\nIt alleged that some people were already pilfering the N621billion Road Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme meant for the rehabilitation of 21 critical roads across the country.\n\nIts National Chairman, Comrade Salmon Akanni, told reporters in Abuja that members of his association would proceed on strike at very short notice if the government does not put the roads in order very soon.\n\nOn the N621billion, he said: \u201cTo the delight of all of us, the issue was tabled before the Federal Executive Council and was expressly approved within two weeks as agreed.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, and to our greatest shocks, we heard it from very reliable sources that some vultures in the garbs of being state governments, officials of Ministry of Works and Housing and politicians are already depleting these funds and misappropriating them on roads and projects not intended in the agreement as approved by the Federal Executive Council.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government is to launch a probe into the importation of adulterated petrol into the country, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva has said.\n\nThis comes as the scarcity of petrol, which became noticeable two days ago, continued in Lagos and Abuja, with long queues characterising the few filling stations that still had products to sell despite assurances from the Nigerian Downstream Midstream Petroleum Authority (NMDPRA) that the trend would ease.\n\nFindings by Daily Sun across filling stations in Lagos and Abuja yesterday revealed that the assurances from NMDPRA failed to yield the expected results as motorists and other consumers complained of not having east access to the product and spending hours at filling stations before being served.\n\nThe development has equally led to a slight increase in the cost of Transportation. A bus ride from Ikeja to Fagba which usually costs N250 has now moved to N300 while from Ikeja under bridge to GRA which hitherto costs N150 has now been jerked up to N200.\n\nSome of the commuters in separate interviews expressed frustration at the sudden hike in transportation cost, urging the Federal Government to as a matter of urgency arrest the situation before it gets out of hand.\n\nAlso, the assurance by the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria(IPMAN) to consumers that fuel would be available from yesterday(Wednesday) proved unrealistic as queues at both independent and major fuel outlets persisted, yesterday.\n\nOil marketers have estimated that about 100 million litres of contaminated petrol were imported into country by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited.\n\nHowever, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, addressing State House Correspondents at the end of the Federal Executive Council meeting in Abuja, said the government would launch a probe to unravel the cause of the crisis.\n\nHe said the decision followed a briefing on the issue to President Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday with the aim of getting to the bottom of the matter.\n\nSpeaking after the meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) presided over by President Buhari at the presidential villa, Abuja, Sylva cautioned against drawing conclusions before the investigation is completed.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThe issue did not come up in council, but of course, you will recall I was here yesterday to brief Mr. President on the issue. I\u2019m not in a position to disclose the identities of the companies, but there are some issues and we are actively tackling it. Nobody has, before now, checked for methanol in our fuel, it\u2019s not very usual and this is the first time this is happening and NNPC is very much up to the task.\n\n\u201cI will also convey your question to NNPC and maybe the Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, but we\u2019re actively handling it and I want to assure you that the problem will be a thing of the past very soon.\u201d\n\nSylvia also assured that the government would consider compensating those who may have been adversely affected by the bad fuel.\n\nOn possible sanctions for the erring companies, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to rush to any conclusions. There\u2019ll be a major investigation to unravel everything and then let\u2019s really get to the bottom of it before we can come back and tell you what is going to happen to the culprits. We know that some people\u2019s vehicles must have also been damaged, that is also going to be taken into consideration in dealing with the situation.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of State had also spoken on the approval granted to his ministry by the council, saying FEC closed out the contract for the construction of the 17 storey local content building in Yenagoa at the cost of N1.817 billion.\n\nMinister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, on his part said the council granted approval made by the Advisory Committee on Nigeria citizenship for 286 foreign nationals out of 600 applications received.\n\nHe said 208 of those approved were granted citizenship by Naturalisation, while 78 others were granted citizenship by registration.\n\nHe said the persons approved by council cut across various countries of the world.\n\nMinister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, said FEC approved a contract for the replacement of Aviation Operations (AvO) at the cost of N12,097,215,800 billion.\n\n\u201cSo, today in Council, a memo was presented by us in aviation. And the amount of the contract to awarded whose purpose is to replace our AVO bridges is N12,097,215,800.09, which is for 12 months and it will include 7.5 per cent VAT. This contract is not only for supplying but it\u2019s also for installation and maintenance, including spare parts and is awarded to a company called Gulf of Africa International Limited.\u201d",

Oando, he said, imported its product through a vessel, MT Elka Apollon, while Duke Oil brought its product through MT Nord Gainer vessel.\n\nKyari said the four companies had been notified to take remedial actions, while promising that NNPC will work with NMDRA for other actions.\n\nThe NNPC GMD said: \u201cWe wish to update our customers and the public on the ongoing efforts by NNPC and other stakeholders to resolve the issues generated by the unfortunate supply and discharge of methanol blended gasoline (PMS) in some Nigerian depots.\n\n\u201cOn 20th January 2022, NNPC received a report from our quality inspector on the presence of emulsion particles in PMS cargoes shipped to Nigeria from Antwerp-Belgium.\n\n\u201cNNPC investigation revealed the presence of methanol in four (4) PMS cargoes imported by the following DSDP suppliers namely MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, Oando and Duke Oil.\n\n\u201cCargoes quality certificates issued at loadport (Antwerp Belgium) by AmSpec Belgium indicate that the gasoline complied with Nigerian Specification.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC quality inspectors, including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G conducted tests before discharge also showed that the gasoline met Nigerian specification.\u201d\n\nHe said the cargoes were also certified by inspection agent of NMDRA to have met Nigerian specification.\n\nKyari said however that the usual quality inspection protocol employed in both the load port in Belgium and discharge ports in Nigeria do not include the test for percent methanol content, explaining why the additive was not detected by Nigeria\u2019s quality inspectors.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cin order to prevent the distribution of the petrol, we have ordered the quarantine of all un-evacuated volumes and the holding back of all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine).\n\n\u201cAll defaulting suppliers have been put on notice for remedial actions and NNPC will work with the authority to take further necessary actions in line with subsisting regulations.\n\n\u201cNNPC wishes to reassure Nigerians that we are currently sourcing additional cargoes to ensure product sufficiency.\u201d\n\nThe NNPC revelation came a few hours after MRS issued a statement claiming that the NNPC imported the product.\n\nIn a statement by the Managing Director, Marco Storari claimed, MRS said it would \u201ccontinue to work with NNPC and NMDPRA, for the evacuation of the contaminated product to NNPC, who is the sole supplier of the product.\n\n\u201cThe allegation reported against the Company that MRS imported contaminated products, is therefore mischievous, false and untrue.

The Conveners of a meeting of 100 leading business, political, civil society, and thought leaders, which held last week in Lagos, yesterday explained that the gathering should not be linked to the 2023 presidential election but a platform to chat a new consensus for national rebirth.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by the coordinators of the group, Chairman of THISDAY/Arise Media Group, Nduka Obaigbena, and former Presidential Liaison Officer to the Senate, Kashim Imam, the eminent persons noted that the gathering was meant to build consensus towards national rebirth.\n\nThe meeting, which held from February 4 to 6 under the aegis of \u201cThe 2022 Committee\u201d, the conveners pointed out, remained non- partisan. They said the retreat to chart a new consensus for national rebirth was attended by 14 incumbent governors, 13 former governors, and three former senate presidents.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Committee\u201d conveners stated, \u201cWhilst the 2022 committee is interested in the quality of leadership that will emerge in Nigeria at all levels, we consider attempts to link the committee with candidates or political parties for the 2023 elections as an unwarranted and unnecessary distraction. Candidates are only chosen by political parties and we are not a political party.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the group stressed that participants, working in three sub-committees, namely: national security, the economy, and Nigeria in transition, recognised that there was an urgent need to seek common ground and irreducible minimum actions to stabilise the polity at this critical time of transition.\n\nThe statement came against the backdrop of speculations that the well-attended event was to select a presidential candidate among the attendees.\n\nBut the coordinators of the meeting stated that although all the 100 leading lights of the 2022 committee had the capacity for national leadership, it should not be linked to the politics of 2023.\n\nThe conveners said among the active participants in the work of the committee were over seven persons, from three or more political parties, who had already publicly declared their aspirations to lead the country but were desirous of working with other patriots for non-partisan greater national goals.\n\n\u201cWe must have a secure, peaceful and united nation before we can have candidates for political offices,\u201d it added.\n\nThe statement further said the committee was of the view that what Nigeria needed today was for all patriots to come together to rescue the country from all political, economic and security threats, and promote the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cThe meetings will continue as we work with federal and state governments, current and future political leaders of all political persuasions, as well as other eminent patriotic citizens, for the greater good of the Nigerian people,\u201d the group maintained.\n\nThe group of eminent Nigerians called on all patriotic volunteers, willing and able, to join the collective effort to stabilise the country so that a new Nigeria that all could be proud of, could be built.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Consequently, the NNPC through their trading arm Duke Oil, supplied a cargo of PMS purchased from international trader Litasco and delivered it with Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer. This vessel discharged in Apapa between the 24th and 30th of January, 2022,\u201d it had alleged.\n\nAs one of the beneficiaries, MRS said it received the product in its depot and distributed the product to only eight of its stations in Lagos.\n\nThe company described the allegation trending at the time as mischievous, false and untrue.\n\nBut the NNPC boss maintained that the methanol blended petrol was imported into the country by the suppliers, including MRS, through its Direct-Sales-Direct-Purchase arrangement.\n\nThe arrangement allows the national oil company to deliver monthly crude oil lifting on Free on Board (FOB) basis to suppliers who in return are supposed to deliver petroleum products of Nigerian standard specification to NNPC.\n\nThe petroleum products delivered are usually equivalent in value to the crude oil received from NNPC subject to the general terms and conditions as advised.\n\nBut according to the NNPC, the companies that supplied the methanol blended petrol included MRS which made the importation through a vessel named MT Bow Pioneer.\n\nHe said while Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium brought in the fuel through a vessel identified as MT Tom Hilde, Oando allegedly brought in the product through a vessel named MT Elka Apollon, while Duke Oil came through MT Nord Gainer vessel.\n\nFuel queues had been building in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, due to fuel shortages caused by the withdrawal of the contaminated petrol from the market. But NNPC was said to be seeking thousands of tonnes of the product to ameliorate the situation, the report said.\n\nThe Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) had said it found fuel with methanol above national specifications in the supply chain and removed the fuel from circulation. Although methanol, in small amounts, is a regular gasoline additive, the regulator said the supplier of the off-specification gasoline was known but did not name the firm.\n\nNigeria depends almost entirely on imports to meet its domestic fuel needs after many failed attempts to revamp the dilapidated refineries, with daily consumption exceeding 60 million litres.\n\nNNPC handles nearly all the imports through crude-for-fuel contracts, known as Direct Sale, direct Purchase (DSDP), with consortia of local and foreign oil firms.\n\nEach consortium receives 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in exchange for products, making the combined total about 320,000 bpd of Nigeria\u2019s output.\n\nNigerians feel that cheap fuel is one of the few benefits the average Nigerian gets from the government, which sets price caps at the pump through a controversial and patchy subsidy scheme.\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Executive Officer of NMDPRA, Farouk Ahmed, yesterday stated that NNPC had received delivery of 300 million litres of petrol to close the supply gap created in the country by the withdrawal of the off-spec petrol.\n\nSpeaking in Lagos, when he met with marketers in a bid to raise distribution and remove the substandard fuel from supply chain, Ahmed said the 300 million litres arrived through six vessels ordered by NNPC. He noted that with the latest delivery, the fuel queues being witnessed in the country should disappear by Friday.\n\nAhmed said, \u201cToday, I am happy to say that loading has been going on in most of the depots because we have been able to identify, isolate and quarantine the limited amount of gasoline that was affected by the methanol volume that was discovered.\n\n\u201cWe have vessels that have arrived in the country recently. At least six arrived in the last few days, ordered by the NNPC, carrying a total volume of close to 300 million litres, just to close the gap created by those vessels we have withdrawn from the system.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Ahmed disclosed that there was a 9,000-metric tonne vessel that was being discharged at the Apapa Port to major marketers, including OVH, TotalEnergies, 11 Plc, Conoil, and Ardova Plc.\n\nAccording to him, as soon as the vessels complete discharging and start pushing products to oil marketers, the fuel queues in Lagos should fully disappear by Friday.\n\n\u201cSo, once these vessels complete discharging and start pushing the products to marketers, I believe Lagos will be cleared by Friday,\u201d Ahmed stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have got that assurance from the marketers. Also, most of these vessels will be providing volumes to most of the key members of DAPPMAN.\u201d\n\nBut the NMDPRA boss stated that the country currently had petrol that could last for 20 days, 10 days short of the usual 30-day reserve.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur ideal days of sufficiency is 30 but this happened because of the concern that made us withdraw the vessels, which created the gap in our 30 days sufficiency.\n\n\u201cAgain, with aggressive importation by the NNPC, this will be closed in a few days, according to the data we got from the NNPC\u2019s import programme.\n\n\u201cLoading is also on-going in most of the depots that have confirmed spec products; so, there is no need for panic. Hopefully, by tomorrow, Lagos will be cleared.\u201d\n\nThe regulatory agency said it was also working to address the challenge thrown up by the importation of substandard petrol into the country.\n\nOther attendees at the meeting included top officials of NNPC, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), and members of the Depots and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN).\n\nFG Orders Investigation\n\nBriefing newsmen at Abuja, after the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said government had initiated moves to investigate the supply and circulation of adulterated petrol in the country. Sylva said the federal government wanted to get to the root of the matter, and warned against hasty conclusions.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to draw any conclusions yet,\u201d the former Bayelsa State governor said. \u201cThere will be a major investigation to unravel everything and then let us really get to the bottom of it before we can come back and tell you what is going to happen to the culprits,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister assured that the government would consider compensating those who might have been adversely affected by the bad fuel.\n\n\u201cWe know that some people\u2019s vehicles must have also been damaged, that is also going to be taken into consideration in dealing with the situation,\u201d he stated.\n\nAsked whether the issue was discussed at the FEC meeting and whether the suppliers would be punished, Sylva said, \u201cThe issue did not come up in council, but, of course, you will recall I was here yesterday to brief Mr. President on the issue. I\u2019m not in a position to disclose the identities of the companies, but there are some issues and we are actively tackling it.\n\n\u201cNobody has, before now, checked for methanol in our fuel, it\u2019s not very usual and this is the first time this is happening and the NNPC is up to the task.\n\n\u201cI will also convey your question to the NNPC and maybe the Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, but we are actively handling it and I want to assure you that the problem will be a thing of the past very soon.\u201d\n\nMRS had in a newspaper advertorial yesterday said Duke Oil supplied a cargo of the adulterated petrol, which it purchased from an international trader, Litasco, and delivered with Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer. MRS further stated the vessel was discharged in Apapa, Lagos, between January 24 and 30, 2022, explaining that major marketers received the following quantities: OVH \u2013 10,000mt; MRS \u2013 5,000mt; NIPCO \u2013 5,958mt; ARDOVA \u2013 6,000mt; and TOTAL \u2013 10,000mt\n\nSylva also spoke on the approval granted to his ministry by the council, saying FEC okayed the contract for the construction of the 17-storey local content building in Yenagoa at the cost of N1.817 billion.\n\nHe explained, \u201cYou will recall that in 2020, Mr. President already commissioned that project. There were some ancillary works that had to be done to connect some of the buildings and that was now presented to council for the sum of N1.817 billion and this now closes out this contract and we have told the contractor. This is the full and final payment for everything.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the end of this project and we have completely delivered this to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) engaged the services of the Association of Distributors and Transporters of Petroleum Products (ADITOP) to ensure uninterrupted distribution of petroleum products and maintain sanity in the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry.\n\nIPMAN President, Mr. Chinedu Okoronkwo, who disclosed this to journalists yesterday said the strategy would weaken the threat by the National Association of Transport Owners (NARTO), which recently issued a threat to embark on industrial action.\n\nOkoronkwo said IPMAN was not part of any trade association and would not embark on industrial action to further compound the predicament faced by Nigerians. He said members were already heavily indebted to banks and could not afford to stagnate their businesses, adding that already, many have shut down operations as a result of harsh operating environment.\n\nThe president said IPMAN was ready to confront the excesses of the NARTO and Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD), who he alleged illegally fleeced marketers.\n\nOkoronkwo stated, \u201cThey are not registered under oil and gas, but as dry dock. But today they are gradually redefining operations of marketers who have signed bulk purchase arrangement with the NNPC.\n\n\u201cWe have lost over N27 billion over time from illegal fees they collect from marketers. They collect about N45,000 per truck and taking in millions that ought to be part of our margins and are building stations and purchasing trucks at the expense of duly licensed marketers.\u201d\n\nOkoronkwo raised concern about the dwindling margins of marketers and the heavy debts hanging on the necks of IPMAN members.\n\n\u201cThe products we purchased with N1 million in the past is now about N7 million without additional margin to operators,\u201d he said.\n\nNARTO had threatened to stop haulage of petroleum products across the country over the hike in the price of diesel to N430 per litre and other operational challenges. The association had earlier decried the delay in the payment of about N45 billion bridging cost, and demanded an increase in the transportation allowance factored into the pump price of petrol.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Diri: Bayelsa broke because of unfavourable federation allocation",
          "text": "Douye Diri, governor of Bayelsa state, says the state is broke owing to unfavorable federation allocation.\n\nThe governor said this while speaking on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, on Thursday, on his record as governor in two years.\n\nA report by Economic Confidential listed Bayelsa among the insolvent states in the country.\n\nDiri said Bayelsa has not been treated fairly despite being an oil-producing state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the reason for the clamour for restructuring is so that all states can get their deserved allocation.\n\n\u201cThe question I ask myself is, is it just or fair that what is generated here as income comes back to Bayelsa as federal allocation. Those are the issues I keep talking about because we can\u2019t have a chunk of money generated from our land, taken to the federal government and shared to states and in the end say Bayelsa state is insolvent and that\u2019s why we are talking about restructuring,\u201d the governor said\n\n\u201cThat is why the constitution has to be amended. We can\u2019t say a particular land is for the people but what is underneath is for the FG.

          "text": "To \u2018japa\u2019 or not to \u2018japa\u2019, that is not the question. The question is; if not Naija, where else? If it is not Naija, e no go fit be like Naija. The song by Korede Bello, \u2018I love Naija\u2019, plays in my head. \u2018\u2019I love my country, I love Naija; I no go run cause I believe e go better, Naija will be sweeter; we can make it together, cause now and forever Naija is my home.\u2019\u2019 Riddim\u2026!!!\n\nHave you caught the \u2018japa\u2019 bug? If you have, all well and good. Godspeed to you in your sojourn. Naija will always welcome you with open arms. \u2018\u2019No matter where you go, make you no forget area o; mother land eyeh o\u2019\u2019 \u2014 God rest Sound Sultan\u2019s soul. Seriously, emigration is only natural. People will always go hither or thither. Absolutely normal. But what is contemptible is dragging Nigeria through the tarmac on the voyage abroad.\n\nSome Nigerians while exiting the country \u2013 at the airport \u2013 will post derisive comments with gleeful photos in tow on social media as a parting shot to the country \u2014 \u2018\u2019Nigeria you have done enough; you\u2019re a destiny killer, goodbye forever\u2019\u2019. But soon enough, they find out living in any country comes with its own peculiar challenges and complexities \u2013 and that Nigeria, regardless of its flaws, will remain home.\n\nAs I shared on Twitter, our first contact with the world outside our native sphere is as Nigerians; and we will always be seen and judged as Nigerians. Ridiculing Nigeria to make a point is self-ridicule. We are eternally connected to Nigeria and whatever image we project of our country; we make of ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA foreigner running a successful business in Nigeria told me: \u2018\u2019Only Nigerians don\u2019t see the opportunities in their country\u2019\u2019. Sadly so. The Lebanese have been thriving in the retail, construction and hospitality sectors in Nigeria for decades. The Indians are dominating the pharmaceutical, power and transmission sectors in Nigeria. The Turks are gradually taking over the furniture, education and manufacturing sectors in Nigeria. Only Nigerians do not see the opportunities in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2017, the federal government granted citizenship to 335 foreigners out of 500 who applied to become Nigerians. I understand the path to be becoming a citizen of Nigeria is fraught with thistles and thorns. It is not an easy picking. It could take many years for an application for citizenship to be approved by the Nigerian authorities. Yet many foreign nationals apply. I learnt some foreign nationals lobby to be granted citizenship \u2013 but Nigerian citizenship processes are thorough.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rauf Aregbesola, minister of interior, announced that the federal government had granted citizenship to 286 foreign nationals out of 600 who applied. Among those granted the very prestigious Nigerian citizenship were Americans, Europeans and Asians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLai Mohammed, minister of information, aptly described the approval as groundbreaking. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s a groundbreaking memo as it will tell you, because just as some people think Nigeria is not a fit and proper place to live, we have thousands of people who are applying daily all over the world from virtually every continent to be citizens of Nigeria. I think that is very instructive.\u201d\n\nNigeria is not an El Dorado but it is a country with immense opportunities that only the self-attuned can divine. Opportunities lurk everywhere in the country even in the heap of confusion. It is a country where anyone can become successful in whatever craft by sheer industry and determination. There is no pot of gold anywhere in the world, and nothing can substitute hard work and resilience. Nigeria has never been arid of opportunities.\n\nSome say the country is unsafe and uninhabitable considering the threat by bandits and insurgents. Yes, there is insecurity in the land, pestilence and human vultures ravaging parts of the country, but the security agencies have been dutiful in countering this threat. As of January 2022, over 200 bandits have been killed while 1,081 Boko Haram fighters have surrendered to the army \u2013 as of December 2021. So far, over 17,000 Boko Harm insurgents have surrendered and over 3,000 bandits have been killed \u2013 according to official sources.\n\nWe cannot obviate or make light of the security challenges, but it is reassuring to know that the country\u2019s security forces are tackling this problem. The spasmodic incidents of kidnapping in the south-west and in the south-east have been relatively contained, and though parts of the north-west and the north-central remain afflicted by these vermin, there is the prospect of peace returning to the area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInsecurity is a quotidian problem. Every country faces it in different mutations. But what matters is how the government of the country responds to this snag. According to the World Population Review, out of the estimated 250,227 gun-related deaths worldwide in 2019, 65.9 percent occurred in just six countries \u2014 Brazil, the United States, Venezuela, Mexico, India, and Colombia. The much-vaunted \u2018God\u2019s own country\u2019, the US, has the second-highest gun-related deaths globally.\n\nNigeria will surmount these current teething troubles. It will always win \u2013 even through the deadliest tempest.\n\nBy Fredrick Nwabufo; Nwabufo aka Mr OneNigeria is a writer and journalist.",

          "text": "As the African Cup of Nation (Afcon) fiesta rages in Cameroon, a young photographer is positioned to make a name for himself. The moment comes but his accreditation doesn\u2019t. What next? The making of a viral photographer.\n\nThis article was contributed to TechCabal by Patrick Nelle/bird\n\nThe crowd\u2019s roar is taking eardrums in the stadium to the point of bursting. Colourful and exuberant football lovers have packed the 60,000 seat arena and now they are screaming, shouting, singing, dancing and enjoying themselves as legendary Congolese rhumba hit-maker Fally Ipupa belts out a crowd-pleaser.\n\nThe sky is bright over the Olembe stadium in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon\u2019s capital city, where the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations is opening on a memorable and vibrant show. Standing near the pitch, a young man is looking on. In a few minutes, he will be triggering his camera, producing incredible shots that will go viral and bring him fame. This is the power of Afcon, Africa\u2019s biggest regular footballing event.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe 28-year old Cameroonian in the crowd is Didier Lefa, a wedding and event photographer who spent two years in the run-up to Cameroon\u2019s African Cup of Nations event preparing to break into sports and freelance photography. He upgraded his gear with a new lens and other state-of-the-art equipment to ensure quick delivery of his photos. He\u2019s still bemused at how he has found himself in the crowd and worried that he has somehow messed up. He needn\u2019t worry. He\u2019s minutes away from being one of the most-watched photographers on the continent.\n\nOnly a few hours before the beginning of the competition, Didier\u2019s dream was on the verge of collapse. After two years of preparation, a crucial element was missing\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t received my accreditation yet,\u201d he explained. He had not yet been granted accreditation from the CAF, the Confederation of Africa Football. The accreditation document gives journalists and photographers the right to access stadiums and venues where the Afcon takes place.\n\n\u201cWithout it, I couldn\u2019t do anything. I was totally discouraged. My morale was at its lowest, all of my efforts had been in vain\u201d, he said in an interview.\n\nHad his aunt\u2014who is a sports photographer\u2014not woken him up in the early hours of that Sunday morning, he would have stayed home and watched the fiesta on TV.\n\nFootball fans on the street/ Didier Lefa.\n\n\u201cAccreditation or not, be there\u201d, she told him. He argued but finally bowed to her harsh insistence.\n\n\u201cShe took me to the stadium at 7 am\u201d, he said.\n\nHe recalled that he was wondering why she was taking him there so early in the morning. The opening ceremony was set to start only at 2.00 pm. He would soon discover why.\n\n\u201cThe stadium\u2019s gates were still closed, but the place around was already overcrowded, everyone was already in a joyful mood, the Afcon fiesta had already started. Ten hours before the game kick-off, it looked like we were late\u201d, he remembered.\n\nHe pulled his camera out of his bag and started to shoot. He and his aunt were the only photographers on the site, and being there gave him a renewed energy, Lefa said.\n\n\u201cI took pictures frantically. I captured images of football fans undergoing their covid-19 tests and being vaccinated. I posted them on Twitter, and they went viral. Every picture I was posting was going viral, it was amazing.\u201d\n\nAmid the excitement of his work going viral, Lefa was still worried about his accreditation. He still didn\u2019t know if he would finally be able to enter the stadium. Once again, his aunt came to his rescue.\n\nA Cameroonian fan at the Afcon opening ceremony. Image source: Didier Lefa.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how she managed to do that, she just said \u2018don\u2019t worry, follow me\u2019 which I did, and I found myself inside the stadium. It was an awful wait,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 4 hours into a non-stop filming spree, he was starting to feel tired, but being near the pitch and a few meters from the players provided an energy boost. He excitedly shot joyful fans screaming in the stands, game action and players\u2019 prowess on the field, streaming to social media with a flow of powerful and vivid pictures, all of them going viral, one after another.\n\nAnd at 11 pm, totally exhausted, someone called him on the phone. \u201cYour accreditation is ready, come and collect it\u201d said the voice.\n\nFeedback on his Twitter profile showed how his pictures had struck a chord with an audience.\n\n\u201cThere is real life in his pictures, when I saw them, I really felt like I was there at Olembe enjoying with the other fans,\u201d said Bernadette, on why she became one of Lefa\u2019s more than 130,000 Twitter followers.\n\n\u201cOur country is mired in crisis, and I think his pictures are keeping hope alive and helping us believe that despite the crisis, we still have the potential to achieve big things,\u201d Onana, another Lefa fan, added.\n\nThe opening ceremony of the 33rd Afcon in Olembe stadium, Yaounde on Jan 9 2022. Image source: Didier Lefa.\n\nLefa made photography his profession just 4 years ago, resisting the demands of his father who wanted to veto his career choice. His mother, however, defended her son\u2019s decision and such was his determination that finally won his father over too. The family supported his passion and career orientation to the extent that they financed a $2,000 professional camera.\n\nIt\u2019s that very camera that is now producing memorable pictures of one of the most important moments in his country\u2019s modern history\u2014capturing the raw emotion, the life and beauty of a moment in time.\n\nHis passion for photography came at an early age, he said, when he discovered photography through his aunt.\n\n\u201cI\u2018ve always liked to take pictures\u201d.\n\nHe recalled that one day his aunt took him to an orphanage for a photo report.\n\n\u201cShe gave me a Nikon reflex camera, it was my very first experience with that kind of camera. She told me \u2018just take pictures\u2019 which I did. This is how it all started.\u201d\n\nCameroon team members celebrating their goal against Burkina Faso during the opener of the 33rd Afcon in Olembe stadium, Yaounde on Jan 9 2022.

For example, he explained, many media organisations across Africa \u201cloot\u201d pictures on the internet and use them without the permission of the owner and without respect to copyright principles.\n\nHe had exactly that issue with a local Cameroonian newspaper that took one of his Afcon images directly off Twitter to use for content illustration, without citing him as the author. He denounced the move on his Twitter feed, sparking an online mobilisation against the media, leading the offending organisation to apologize.\n\nLefa didn\u2019t slow down after that first viral photo. Throughout the tournament, he traveled from one town to another, passionately capturing the essence of each Afcon game. He agreed to a bird interview during a short transit in Douala from Yaound\u00e9, on his way to Limbe where he was to cover the game between Ivory Coast and Algeria.\n\nWith a burning desire to embrace new challenges, Lefa was already looking ahead. His current experience has allowed him to build connections with foreign photographers and to enter partnerships with some media like RTI, the Ivory Coast public broadcaster.\n\nHis next \u201cbig thing\u201d will be the football World Cup next November in Qatar, he said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Bantaba wants to help African startups tap into diaspora resources",
          "text": "A few months into the coronavirus pandemic in April 2020, a team of 4 students of African origin in Sweden\u2014including The Gambia-born Lamin Darboe who had recently moved to Stockholm to pursue a master\u2019s degree\u2014contested in a climate action challenge organised by Norrsken Foundation and Stockholm Innovation & Growth (Sting).\n\nThough the team, which also had Fabrice Ouedraogo, Eliane Birba, and Noufou Kafando as members, did not win the challenge, participating in the competition birthed what is today known as Bantaba, a Sweden-based digital matchmaking platform that connects African startups with professionals and investors in the African diaspora, of which Darboe is CEO.\n\nWhat inspired the platform?\n\nDarboe left his West African home country in 2012, initially going to the National Institute of Bank Management in India for 3 months to study banking and finance before he got a scholarship to attend Bocconi University in Milan. After completing his undergraduate studies in 2015, he moved to Ireland for 6 months to work for a consulting firm before returning to Italy. There, he worked within the finance team of a telecom company and in August 2019 moved to Stockholm to pursue an MSc at the Stockholm School of Economics.\n\nDuring his almost-a-decade of travelling across Asia, North America, and Europe, one thing was constant: Darboe met many people of African origin who had done great for themselves professionally. And like him, they were willing to engage more actively with and invest in Africa even though they are no longer on the continent. But that was nearly impossible without moving back home, a rather impractical idea considering most have settled in their new locations and even started families.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSimilarly, Darboe\u2019s had the opportunity to interact with several entrepreneurs across Africa, and a recurring complaint by founders was the lack of support and resources available to them compared to their peers in other parts of the world. So, on the one hand, there was a pool of resources abroad waiting to be tapped, and on the other, readily available demand from entrepreneurs that needed them.\n\nWorking with a few students from Africa he met at the Norrsken-Sting climate competition, Darboe started building a platform to bridge this gap. \u201cFrom renewable energy and aerospace engineering to machine learning and cloud computing, many Africans abroad have exceptional professional knowledge and experience,\u201d he told TechCabal on a call. \u201cMany of us have talent and skill sets that are highly needed back home coupled with a burning desire to engage more actively with Africa.\u201d\n\nTalent and funding, on one platform\n\n\u201cBantaba\u201d is an ancient Manding word for a big tree under which elders of an African village would gather to make important decisions, according to Darboe. \u201cLike its origin, our Bantaba is a digital meeting place that bridges the gap between Africa\u2019s tech startup ecosystem and diaspora capital, knowledge, and network,\u201d he said. The platform is built on two value propositions.\n\nFirst is helping founders with access to crucial professional support. African startups can create pages on Bantaba detailing the problems they\u2019re solving to be discovered by diaspora mentors, consultants, and investors. Likewise, diaspora professionals can create profiles and get matched with startups based on their interests.\n\nFor instance, a Togolese startup in need of a consultant in artificial intelligence could be matched with UK-based Daniel, who has more than a decade of experience working as an AI engineer at Amazon, essentially facilitating knowledge transfer between the diaspora and startups in Africa.\n\n\u201cIt could be something less technical even. For instance, African founders could reach out to diasporans experienced in VC investment for advice on their pitch decks and business plans,\u201d explained Darboe, who has some experience in the early-stage investment ecosystem having worked for a VC firm and an incubator in Stockholm. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting knowledge that will guide founders in the right direction. What\u2019s more interesting is we charge nothing for this matching.\u201d\n\nThe platform\u2019s second core offering revolves around enabling access to capital, especially for startups with viable business models but struggle to raise funding at the early stage.\n\nThough Africa saw a record \u223c$5 billion in venture capital funding last year, there\u2019s still relatively limited capital available to early-stage startups on the continent. Bantaba aims to address this by connecting founders with the diaspora wealth through its digital infrastructure. For context, remittance inflows to Sub-Saharan Africa reached $45 billion in 2021, per World Bank data, most of which were spent on consumption purposes.\n\nFunding rounds launched by startups will have specific targets and investors can contribute in return for equity. With that opportunity, the diaspora can invest in promising African startups listed on and vetted by Bantaba, which will make money off each transaction.\n\n\u201cIn the future, we plan to collaborate with local partners to validate startups after which those approved can launch fundraising campaigns on the platform,\u201d Darboe explained. \u201cAvailable data shows that 70% of startups in Africa lack access to talent and capital to grow their businesses. We\u2019re addressing this with a digital platform that\u2019s scalable and available to startups across the continent.\u201d\n\nLamin Darboe at the Stockholm School of Economics. Image credit: Supplied.\n\nAcross Africa, a number of startups like Bantaba have emerged in recent years with the aim of changing the status quo of startup financing and venture capital on the continent. While similar, players in the space don\u2019t operate a monolithic model.\n\nLagos-based GetEquity, for instance, allows companies digitise their assets via tokens and market themselves to angel investors, syndicates, and institutional investors, who can buy equity in a listed startup for as little as $10. Raise, an all-in-one platform in Kenya, helps African startups simplify fundraising process and close deals faster for a \u201cthird of the cost\u201d, as well as manage equity and legal compliance.\n\nRegardless of the model, these platforms enable underfunded entrepreneurs avoid the friction associated with conventional methods of funding a startup, by allowing them connect and network with potential investors beyond private funding and venture capitalist firms.\n\nSince launching its beta platform in July 2021, Bantaba has onboarded more than 150 African tech startups from at least 20 African countries and over 300 diaspora experts and investors. \u201cWe\u2019ve witnessed strong engagement between Africa tech startups and diaspora on the platform,\u201d Darboe said, adding that the company has also built \u201cstrategic partnerships\u201d with companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and some Nordic universities to create new value streams for startup users.\n\nBantaba recently raised more than $400,000 in pre-seed funding from Swedish angel investors to move from the minimum viable product (MVP) to a full-fledged product with expanded features. In addition to serving as a platform where diaspora talent and capital is accessible to African startups, Bantaba aims to provide relevant news updates to both parties, among other services.\n\nDarboe envisions a future where the platform is eventually open to non-Africans abroad. \u201cOur vision is to become the foremost platform for international investors with interest in Africa\u2019s tech scene, starting with the diaspora community.\u201d\n\nBuilding a network of African startups and diasporan experts and investors will definitely not be a walk in the park but Darboe\u2019s convinced his team is up to the challenge. Bantaba\u2019s core team members have known each other for many years and according to the CEO, their biggest edge is the \u201cunderstanding of the problem, the diaspora community, and Africa\u2019s startup ecosystem\u201d.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

Since the internet emerged in the 1970s, it has morphed into something bigger than amusing Google searches, laughable passwords, and finstagram accounts.\n\nLike most avid Twitter users, I have had a few of my tweets end up on the wrong side of bird avenue. Before Twitter introduced the option to limit who replies to your tweets\u2014particularly tweets that garner a lot of attention (likes, retweets, etc)\u2014curtailing abusive or mean-spirited responses was an impossible feat.\n\nBut, like most social media platforms that are popular amongst young digital natives\u2014most of whom are bullish about protecting their mental health and pushing kindness online\u2014Twitter is invested in protecting its users and keeping internet bullying or contentious behaviour at bay.\n\nTo mark today\u2019s celebration of safer global internet usage, Twitter launched an emoji (which you can activate by tweeting #SaferInternetDay) to encourage people to join the conversation on the importance of internet safety. According to Statisa, Twitter reportedly recorded 206 million active users in Q2, 2021. In recent times, Twitter users have opened up about experiencing one form of internet abuse or the other. The platform has, over the past several years, marked Safer Internet Day by rolling out various initiatives such as dedicated emojis, blog posts, events, and more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to join safety partners from all over the world to mark #SaferInternetDay2022 and to play our part in creating a safer internet for all.

          "text": "Paris-born Nigerian singer, Asa, was recently announced the Spotify EQUAL Global Music Programme ambassador for the month of February.\n\nIn April 2021, months after it expanded to 38 African countries, Spotify launched the Spotify EQUAL Music Programme in commemoration of International Women\u2019s Day. According to Spotify, the programme\u2014which consists of highlighted playlists created and marketed by Spotify\u2014was launched to highlight women creators on its platform and work towards equity for women in the audio industry.\n\nGlobally, charts are often dominated by male performers. From 2017 to 2019, for example, Hypebot reports that only 21% of performers on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 were women. Apple Music and Spotify, during the same period, had even less, with female performers representing only 19% of charts. In 2018, at Spotify\u2019s 10th-year anniversary, only 2 women\u2014Rihanna and Ariana Grande\u2014made the 10-year streaming charts. Critics have also commented on how the most visible and high-ranking playlists on Spotify are male-dominated. More recently, Spotify itself funded research that showed only 1 in 5 artistes on the charts are women. This research helped fuel the drive for its EQUAL Global Music Programme.\n\nSince its launch, the programme has curated 17 playlists featuring female artistes all over the globe. The EQUAL Africa playlist\u2014which has over 70,000 likes\u2014 has 50 songs from female artistes from all over the continent. This includes songs from Ghana-born singer, Gyakie, who has had over 13.5 million streams on Spotify, Nigeria\u2019s Ayra Starr who recently hit 1 million streams on the platform, Zambia\u2019s Titose, Morocco\u2019s Rhita Nattah, and Botswana\u2019s Sebina.\n\nAsa, who has over 375,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, is the latest on the list. Her recently released track, Mayana, will lead the EQUAL Africa playlist and also feature on the EQUAL Global playlist. Mayana already has over 560,000 streams on Spotify, and the addition to EQUAL playlists will boost it further.\n\nSpeaking about her selection, the singer said, \u201cI\u2019m honoured to be the Spotify EQUAL ambassador of the month. It\u2019s great to be part of something like this\u2014a movement that\u2019s new yet has always been. It\u2019s beautiful when we are celebrated and recognised for contributions to music and art over the years.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLolade woke up that morning with some pain in her chest. She had experienced it the day before, deciding to go to bed much earlier than her usual time of 10 p.m. She was also very tired despite having had the required eight hours of sleep.\n\nSadly, Lolade died of a heart attack within two hours, leaving behind two very distraught parents and some pretty angry siblings. With Lolade\u2019s job at a fintech startup, she served as breadwinner, bringing in 70% of the income the family lived on. But here\u2019s where things got tricky.\n\nAs the savvy investor that she was, Lolade used many investment apps and had several online investments. She also had some shares which she bought a few years before. Very active on social media, she had accounts with massive followings on Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms.\n\nApart from this, she loved to take pictures. She took pictures of herself, family, friends, nature, and pretty much anything she felt was worth photographing. Consequently, she had several terabytes of data stored in her Google Drive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApart from their grief and worrying about how to bury her, her family has encountered another challenge; they can\u2019t access any of these things because Lolade\u2019s passwords are either obsolete or unavailable.\n\nIn a world where everything is pretty much digital, a lot of us stand to put our loved ones in the same shoes as Lolade\u2019s.\n\nIn times past, historians used texts, pictures, and many times, word of mouth testimonials to piece history together. But with the advent of technology, anything one could want to learn about the world is on the Internet.\n\nBy 2025, it is estimated that more than 445 exabytes of data would have been generated on the Internet. All of this is pulled from different places: from social media platforms to messaging platforms to Internet of Things (IoT) devices to sites we\u2019ve visited.\n\nHumans are creating digital diaries of themselves every single day. A seldom asked yet important question is what happens to our data when we die?\n\nThis question is made more important by our perception of death while we go through life. In Africa, where death is not a welcome discussion topic, we quickly reject it and rain curses on unseen enemies as we belt out songs and scream prayers against them.\n\nWhat the law says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from <a\n\nTechnically, you have no rights to your data upon your death. Laws like the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation and the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation protect the data of living people.\n\nIf, for example, you ask Google to delete your account when you die, while the company would do that, it\u2019s very likely that data from your account probably still exists on the cloud or in their servers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo rights that you enjoyed while you were still alive, like being able to request the total deletion of your data, your consent being required before your data is transferred or used in a different manner, no longer exist.\n\nFor platforms like Google and Facebook, which claim to aggregate and anonymise data, your data would probably form part of a large dataset that they could sell to third parties or use for other things.\n\nWhat else can you do? Let\u2019s go back to Lolade.\n\nData protection for the dead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: wuestenigel Flickr via Compfight cc.\n\nBy 2100, an estimated 4.9 billion dead users would be on Facebook, making it arguably the world\u2019s largest memorial. Lolade has become part of this statistic; her profile, another one of many that would never see action by her hand again.\n\nBut if she has made some arrangements, her family members or friends can still manage some of her accounts.\n\nOrdinarily, the Terms of Service, which she agreed to, bars third party users like her family from gaining access to her profile data. Since 2009, Facebook began memorialising profiles of dead people. To do this, anyone could send a death certificate to the platform. When that is confirmed, the profile is marked as \u201cremembering\u201d, no one is allowed to log in to the account, and birthday notifications, among other things, are turned off.\n\nIn 2019, Facebook announced that it would be using AI to identify profiles of dead people. It also restricted the ability to request memorials to only family members and close friends. The year before, the parents of a dead German girl who had sued the platform in 2012 to gain access to her account after it had been memorialised won their case. Around the same time, Facebook introduced legacy contacts.\n\nThese legacy contacts are persons you trust to manage and look after your account upon your passing. They can accept friend requests, change your profile picture and cover photo, and decide who can post tributes. They can\u2019t log in as if they are you and start making changes like deleting photo albums or posting new status messages.\n\nYou can also set your profile to \u201cdelete after death\u201d if you don\u2019t want the former option.\n\nSo for Lolade, who had no idea she could do this on her Facebook account \u2014 or probably didn\u2019t care \u2014 her family members would have no access to her profile to retrieve pictures and important data, among other things.\n\nWith Google, the same process applies through what the company calls an Inactive Account Manager service. You can activate this on the Data and Privacy column of your Google Account when you click \u201cMake a plan for your digital legacy\u201d at the very bottom.\n\nGoogle proceeds to ask you a bunch of questions, including how long after your account remains inactive would you want the service to kick in (3, 6, 12, and 18 months), your legacy contacts (up to 10), what apps each of them is restricted to, how long they can have access.\n\nOf course, Google would send a nudge to you after some time of inactivity to ensure you\u2019ve actually kicked the bucket and not just gone off-grid. You can also set it to delete your account upon death, giving your legacy contacts three months to download whatever they want.\n\nApple also has a similar process.\n\nFor Twitter, verified family members or authorised trustees would have to specifically request that the deceased\u2019s profile be deactivated. They would have no access to the person\u2019s dashboard or Direct Messages.\n\nTransferring legal rights to assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from your social media accounts, you have digital assets like the ebooks you bought on your Kindle, your songs on iTunes, your movies on Amazon Prime, and, of course, your savings and investments in cryptocurrency, online apps, among others.\n\nUnfortunately, with digital assets like ebooks or songs, what you have is a licence to use as you do not outrightly own these things; your licence dies with you and is non-transferable. Platforms like Amazon only go dormant if the account is inactive. However, it can be reactivated by logging in again.\n\nYou can also choose to set up a digital will. This would involve you bequeathing whatever assets you deem necessary to anyone you want. It could also contain a link to a password to an account containing all your digital assets, username, and password. The will could also determine how your data is used after you die.\n\nIn the Lolade example, she could have had her lawyer draw up a will setting out how she wanted her data to be used after her death. She could also have added how she wanted her investments to be shared and the access code or password to the document(s) or cloud where she stored them. These digital assets constitute choses in actions.\n\nSide note: A chose in action is a personal right in property that can only be enforced by taking legal proceedings and not by taking physical possession.\n\nStill wondering what could happen to your data after you die if you don\u2019t take action now? This story about a lady who made a chatbot to chat with her dead friend is equal parts heartwarming and concerning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

At the time, the loot was worth about $76 million, but now it\u2019s worth well over $4 billion.\n\nThe good news is the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has seized 94,000 BTC ($3.6 billion) of the money, and the suspects arrested.\n\nHowever, the suspects are far from the criminal masterminds you\u2019d imagine would orchestrate a heist worth billions of dollars. One of the suspects, Heather Morgan, is an amateur rapper. I listened to her rap, and I do not doubt that Chimgozirim (who knows next to nothing about rap) could do lots better.\n\nDepending on who you are rooting for, there\u2019s even more good news. When the assets were stolen in 2016, Bitfinex paid investors the $76 million. Now, the exchange is getting billions back \u2014 isn\u2019t crypto wonderful?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nHow to crowdfund your wedding?\n\nOn-demand mechanics\n\nA fintech Incubation programme in Rwanda\n\nHow to crowdfund celebrations\n\nIn a few days, Emmanuel and our designer, Daniel, will be celebrating their birthdays. We want to gift the former a massive gaming setup, while we\u2019ll give the latter a massively decked-out workspace.\n\nThe budget for this pre-seed-type wishlist is $500k. We thought it would be impossible to raise this amount. Until we discovered Unboxd.\n\nUnboxd is a fintech startup that enables users to share a wishlist for birthdays, weddings, and other celebrations with friends and family.\n\nAccording to one of the platform\u2019s founders, Ridwan Egbeyemi, \u201cOne major thing with gifting is that people fall under the pressure of wanting to give really expensive gifts. With Unboxd, we\u2019ve been able to simplify that. So you don\u2019t have to be the one to pay for that \u20a6400,000 TV. You can just drop your own \u20a65,000 or \u20a610,000.\u201d\n\nOgheneruemu had a chat with the founders of Unboxd, and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be able to raise $500k for Emmanuel and Daniel\u2019s birthday.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m so sure, read the story here: Fintech startup, Unboxd, helps crowdfund celebrations, no matter how much you have\n\nMechanic on-demand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Nigeria and most parts of Africa, the road is the most popular form of transportation. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), road transport accounts for more than 90% of the transportation sector\u2019s GDP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith most people travelling by road, Nigeria\u2019s annual vehicle demand is around 720,000. That\u2019s $8 billion spent on vehicle importation annually.\n\nHowever, 95% of the vehicles in Nigeria\u2019s auto market are second-hand, due majorly to the purchasing power of Nigerians.\n\nA second-hand vehicle means more trips to the mechanic\u2019s workshop, and there are three options: original equipment manufacturer (OEM) mechanics, aftermarket mechanics, or roadside mechanics.\n\nMost vehicle owners go for the most affordable \u2014 roadside mechanics. And while they might be inexpensive, they lack the tools and formal training required to repair vehicles properly.\n\nInterestingly, Mecho Autotech has raised a $2.15 million seed to solve this problem. It operates a digital platform that connects B2B and B2C customers with mechanics that are either in-house or third-party.\n\nThe Y Combinator-backed startup has over 7,000 third-party mechanics on its platform and three Mecho Shops across Lagos. The seed round, which saw investors\u2019 participation, including Future Africa and V8 Capital, will help the company expand its engineering team and marketing budget for B2C acquisition.\n\nWhile having better mechanics is good, a better way to prevent the round trips to the mechanic workshop is to get new vehicles, a luxury that\u2019s unfortunately out of the reach of most Nigerians. Local production could also be an alternative, but the country only produces 14,000 of the 720,000 demanded annually.\n\nA Fintech Incubation Programme in Rwanda\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, December 11, 2021, Co-creation Hub (CcHUB) collaborated with Google, the Mojaloop Foundation and the Rwandan government to launch a Fintech Incubation Programme to support early-stage fintech startups in Rwanda.\n\nThe programme will support 15 fintech startups to the minimum viable product stage (MVP) and give a $10,000 grant to each.\n\nThe startups also gain access to more funding through connections the programme will provide. With applications closing on February 20, 2022, eligible companies are implored to apply for the programme in time.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nTeen Who Demanded $50,000 From Elon Musk Is Now Targeting More Billionaire Jets.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese days, people seem to have a wishlist for every celebration. From birthdays to weddings to graduation ceremonies, you name it; someone has a list of what they need to get.\n\nSometimes you might find some unreasonable \u2014 cough cough, expensive/extravagant \u2014 items on the list. At other times, these lists contain little or no monetary gifts. Some others strike a balance between two extremes.\n\nBut what if friends and family members could crowdfund these wishes? What if you could get exactly what you wanted as a wedding gift without your friends breaking the bank or getting you unnecessary items?\n\nWell, Ridwan Egbeyemi, Tolu Adesina, and Gloria Agboifoh\u2019s Unboxd provides a way out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnboxd founders. L-R: Ridwan Egbeyemi, Gloria Agboifoh, Tolu, Adesina\n\nFrom personal solution to MVP\n\nThe year is 2020. Egbeyemi is planning his wedding. He is about to marry the absolute love of his life, and everything is set for the ceremony proper. But there\u2019s just one problem: how to get the gifts he and his wife would need as they begin their marriage journey.\n\nAnd so, the search for a platform where they can share their wishlist begins. Their number one criterion is to have friends and family contribute as little or as much as they can without breaking the bank. The first stumbling block is they can\u2019t find any platform to do what they want.\n\nBut there is still a silver lining in this cloud that Egbeyemi and his friend, Adesina, take advantage of. Egbeyemi\u2019s design knowledge and Adesina\u2019s web development and product design expertise come in handy. They build a \u201cscrappy looking but functional MVP\u201d in one weekend and share a wishlist with friends.\n\nOn November 1, 2020, about one month after sharing their wishlist, Egbeyemi and his wife get married. The wedding is a success, and they raise enough money for the essentials they need.\n\nEgbeyemi and Adesina move on from their product, but friends and family keep returning.\n\n\u201c\u2018What platform did you guys use?\u2019 \u2018My birthday is coming up, and I don\u2019t want my friends to gift me something I don\u2019t want or something I already have; can I use it?\u2019 That request continued to mount, and since we had a ton of people asking to use it, we decided that we should sit down and take this thing seriously,\u201d Egbeyemi says.\n\nThey spend six months working on the product, sharing it with a closed beta group before finally launching it to the public in September 2021.\n\nWishlists for every celebration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Adesina, Unboxd is a fintech brand, \u201cbut we are currently offering a gifting solution with a crowdfunding component. We are still handling money \u2014 inflows and outflows \u2014 but our entrance into the market is people coming to crowdfund gift items.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnboxd offers a service that enables users to share a wishlist for birthdays, weddings, and other celebrations with friends and family. Contributors can pay any amount they can afford \u2014 whether part or full \u2014 without worrying about their account balance.\n\n\u201cOne major thing with gifting is that people fall under the pressure of wanting to give really expensive gifts. With Unboxd, we\u2019ve been able to simplify that. So you don\u2019t have to be the one to pay for that \u20a6400,000 TV. You can just drop your own \u20a65,000 or \u20a610,000.\u201d\n\nIt gives celebrants a single place to create a wishlist for their celebrations with sub wallets (or pockets) \u2014 available through a Flutterwave integration \u2014 for each list. Apart from this, there\u2019s also another interesting feature to attract users.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made sure that there\u2019s no deduction from the money you\u2019re going to get. If I add an item that costs \u20a6400,000 to my wishlist, we\u2019ve been able to get very creative with our engineering and business model such that, at the end of the day, by the time you are requesting payout, you get that exact \u20a6400,000 without \u20a61,000 removed from your wallet for transaction fees. This can change in the future, but for now, that\u2019s how we are handling it.\u201d\n\nAlthough there\u2019s a flat rate of \u20a6100 for each payout after your first free payout request for each wishlist, transaction costs are borne by the contributor and not the celebrant. The company also makes a 2% commission on each transaction on the platform.\n\nThe wishlist creation is also simple. All the celebrant has to do is include the name, image, and price of the gift and the item is added to the list. You can also add items from your favourite Instagram vendor. Last year, Unboxd started a test run on this feature, onboarding bCODE \u2014 Adidas\u2019s exclusive partner in Nigeria for sneakers sales \u2014 onto the platform.\n\nFor the gift-giver, apart from the ability to give what they have, they can also choose to remain anonymous.\n\nEgbeyemi believes these features help separate them from competitors like Showlove and Suregifts.\n\nFighting the fear of failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch shows that humans are far more afraid of failure than ghosts. In 2015, Linkagoal surveyed 1,083 adults on fear. And according to the social network, 31% (338) of the respondents revealed a fear of failure over the fear of ghosts, spiders, and being home alone.\n\nHaving worked with companies like Decagon and founded Lagos-based Rewrite Agency, the trio wanted everything to be perfect.\n\n\u201cOur background has been in developing products for people, and we\u2019ve been able to do that on different successful products that are currently in the market that people are using. We\u2019ve worked with those founders and seen the different challenges they\u2019ve been through, and because of that, we\u2019ve been our own biggest critic.\n\n\u201cBefore we were able to take Unboxd to the public and open it up for people, we spent months trying to avoid problems. Trying to avoid situations where we would get into the market and people would say, \u2018Oh, this thing is not working\u2019, or \u2018That thing is not working.'\u201d\n\nEventually, the Unboxd team had to ask themselves the golden question, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to learn to make failure acceptable,\u201d Egbeyemi shares.\n\nCurrently, from 40 users in September 2021, the platform has over 400 active users and 320 active wishlists. All with no marketing or PR and just word of mouth and recommendations.\n\nThere are also plans to raise pre-seed funding and leave the arduous life of bootstrapping behind.\n\n\u201cEverything we\u2019ve been able to build with Unboxd has been with our own money, and we\u2019ve had to hire on contract. But we want to move from that to being able to have designers, developers, devops on the ground, fully, working on the product.\u201d\n\nThe company also plans to expand and conduct tests in the US, UK, and Canada.\n\nFrom what Adesina shares, there are also plans to take advantage of the owambe market and give users the ability to turn a wedding wishlist into a wedding website complete with a gift registry and pictures.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of weddings going on, and we want to be that brand that event planners and intending couples would want to use. We are basically trying to create a sub-branch of our system and design it specifically for weddings.\n\nThis is backed by a flexible customer-centric approach to understanding the market and building for the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "From haulage to consumer goods, retail outlets, and small businesses, all are coming under pressure as the retail cost of diesel at various filling stations jumped by 24 percent to N410 per litre in February, findings by BusinessDay reveals.\n\nThe price of diesel, which is not regulated by the government, has surged by over 24 percent on the back of the soaring price of Brent crude, dollar price, and the forces of demand and supply, sources said.\n\n\u201cUnlike petrol, diesel is deregulated, which means the increase in the international price of crude oil is responsible for what we see across Nigerian filling stations,\u201d Mike Osatuyi, national operations controller of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), said.\n\nCrude oil price accounts for a large chunk of the final cost of petroleum products such as diesel, kerosene, and such associated products.\n\nRemoval of subsidy on kerosene and diesel by former President Olusegun Obasanjo means that the pump prices of the products will reflect changes in the international oil market.\n\nBrent crude, the benchmark for Nigeria\u2019s crude oil has gained more than 28percennt to $91 on February 09, 2022.\n\n\u201cWe bought diesel at N410 today and this has affected the cost of checking-in to our hotels and short let apartments,\u201d Azeez Raji, Manager of Urban Metro Inn, who runs on diesel to sustain his business.\n\nEsu Olumba-Obu, the Group managing director of Royal Farms Ltd says the high cost of diesel is posing serious threats in sustaining the group business.\n\n\u201cThe high cost of diesel most businesses are now faced with the option of closing down or retrenching staff to survive,\u201d Olumba-Obu told BusinessDay.\n\nData gleaned from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed the average price paid by consumers for diesel increased by 4.15 percent from N277.83 in November to an average of N289.37 in December 2021.\n\nIt said states with the highest average price of diesel were States with the highest price Enugu (N349.29), Borno (N340.00), and Oyo (N326.25).\n\n\u201cStates with the lowest average price of diesel were Kebbi (N232.36), Yobe (N226.61), and Katsina (N225.00),\u201d the NBS noted.\n\nObservers believe that, while businesses are feeling the pinch, the government is powerless because the downstream diesel sector is deregulated.\n\nDiesel is mostly used by businesses, especially manufacturers, to power their generators amid a lack of reliable power supply from the national grid. Many vehicles transporting goods and people across the country also use diesel.\n\nRead also: Despite oil price at $90 barrel, naira may fall to N450 \u2013 RenCap\n\nMore than 70 percent of Nigerian firms rely heavily on diesel-powered generators. The machines guzzle cash and spew pollution, but they are reliable in a nation where nearly 85 million people \u2013 some 40 percent of the population \u2013 have no access to grid power.\n\nWhile many Nigerian households and small business generators are powered by price-capped petrol, the big generators for larger firms, apartment complexes and more substantial homes can run on diesel.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the price of the product keeps increasing and nothing is being done about it. The high inflation rate in the country means that people have less money to buy things, and when prices are going up and the masses have less money to buy those products, we are going to have a lot of joblessness in the country,\u201d the President, Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria, Femi Egbesola said.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s largest oil producer, relies largely on importation for petrol and other refined products as its refineries have remained in a state of disrepair for many years.",

          "title": "Dirty petrol saga questions NNPC role as sole importer",
          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) was never meant to be the country\u2019s sole importer of refined products, stakeholders note. Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer shouldn\u2019t even be importing refined petrol. The panic around dirty petrol, analysis shows, is symptomatic of the country\u2019s unwillingness to reform, they state.\n\nThe NNPC gradually became the sole importer of petrol because the retail price capped at N162 per litre will not guarantee commercial returns to marketers who will pay a higher landing cost.\n\nThis aberration may have morphed into law as the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) named the NNPC, the supplier of last resort. Legal experts say this makes it a licensed supplier appointed by an authority under the last resort direction. This description implies national interests will always override its commercial interest.\n\n\u201cIt is really not in our interest to be the sole importer of PMS in the country. We have taken definite steps to exit the situation,\u201d said Mele Kyari, CEO of the NNPC, during a meeting with downstream stakeholders at NNPC Towers in Abuja in 2020.\n\nRising oil prices with the attendant burgeoning landing cost may have proven him right. Some of the factors that go into determining the fuel price include the product cost, freight cost, lightering (ship-to-ship transfer) expenses, insurance, port charges, jetty throughput charges, storage charges, financing, wholesale distribution margins, and administrative charges.\n\nThe addition of the first nine items sums up the product\u2019s landing cost, or the cost of product sold at the depot. When all charges are included, at the current oil prices, the landing cost of petrol is estimated at over N282.\n\nThe NNPC currently operates a DSDP programme, where it swaps its crude oil for European fuel refined mainly in Belgium and the Netherlands. Nigeria receives petroleum products from Ex-Rotterdam for delivery to Lagos Offshore, this is known in the industry as Coastal price. This Coastal price, which is the amount of money equivalent to the actual cost of importing finished petroleum products, is usually anchored at full cost recovery.\n\nThe cost of transporting the product is a function of the prevailing benchmark price (Rotterdam) and prevailing exchange rates, cost of procuring vessels at prevailing exchange rates, insurance cost and blended cost (the cost to transform gasoline to Nigeria\u2019s specifications), which costs on average about $5/ton. Then there is a trader\u2019s margin, which is on average about $10/ton.\n\nAll these costs are factored into determining the landing cost of petrol for the pricing template since 2020. Variations in exchange rate may affect the exact price.\n\nSome of the costs though are borne out of Nigeria\u2019s inability to equip its ports. Lightering is the cost associated with the transfer of petrol from one large vessel to a smaller one. This is typically done in the open sea with the vessels positioned alongside each other.\n\n\u201cIn the case of the NPSC owned Apapa jetty in the Lagos area, infrastructure deficit is the major reason why lightering of vessels is done. With a draft of only 7.5m, the implication is that the maximum of a 30KT vessel, depending on the vessel specification, can be berthed at the jetty,\u201d states Ogechi Nkwoji, a research analyst with Major Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) in the organisation\u2019s newsletter.\n\n\u201cSo, for every large vessel, for example, a 47KT vessel that plans to berth at the Apapa jetty, the product must be lightered into a daughter vessel with the marketers incurring costs of approximately $245,000 per lightering operation,\u201d she states.\n\nSome of these costs may have since increased but apart from these costs, petrol landing price is further determined by charges such as Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) charges and the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) charges.\n\nThese charges are meant for cargo dues (harbour handling charge) charged by the NPA for use of Port facilities. This includes VAT and Agency expenses. NIMASA charges include provision for marine pollution prevention and control, and cabotage enforcement.\n\nThese landing costs, which are dollarised, are high and could easily cripple a business if there were no mechanism for cost recovery. Investments in the different aspects of the business involve huge capital outlay. For example, as at 2019, the average cost of building a standard jetty (land included) was approximately N36.5 billion with an annual operating expense approximately N5.3 billion, according to the MOMAN newsletter.\n\nCapping petrol prices at the pump provides the biggest source of disincentive for any investor to go into importation and retailing of petrol, which is highly capital intensive and guarantees small margins on volumes.\n\nNNPC under the new PIA is meant to function as a commercial entity. However, the burden of being a sole importer will continue to weigh on its books.\n\nThe net effect is that it will operate inefficiently, turning over scrappy revenue and manicured profits when its peers are hurling home profits from an oil price boom.\n\nAramco\u2019s net income jumped to $30.4 billion for the third quarter of 2021, from $11.8 billion a year earlier, the same year NNPC claimed it earned N287 billion as profit.\n\nSince the landing cost of petrol is much higher than the pump price, Nigerians bear the cost of this difference, which is known as subsidy, but benefits mostly the well-off in a handful of cities. The true cost of cheap petrol is bad roads, broken schools and ramshackle hospitals.\n\nBusinessDay has reported extensively on how wasteful subsidies hurt the economy. Oil prices have climbed over $90 per barrel for the first time since 2014, but a N3-trillion planned spend on subsidies this year will cancel out any potential gain.\n\nThe N3 trillion subsidy price tag can fully equip 100,000 primary health centres across the country at the cost N30 million each. It could build Nigerians 200,000 mortgage homes valued at N15 million each. It could empower 3 million entrepreneurs with a N1 million loan. If education was a priority, at an estimated cost of N17 million, it could build over 176,000, three-classroom blocks across the nation.\n\nThe labour unions\u2019 gambit of holding the decrepit refineries over the head of government has become a barrier to reasoned dialogue on the way forward.\n\nTo appease labour leaders, the Buhari-led government is spending billions of naira to resuscitate the refineries but there is no guarantee it could run them any better than it had always done. The trouble managing the Kaduna-Abuja rail efficiently makes the best case for a private sector-led business approach.",

          "text": "The flurry of new investments into the food market since last year is giving Nigeria\u2019s struggling retail sector a new lease of life after a four-year lull in growth, BusinessDay\u2019s analysis shows.\n\nIn October, Africa Capital Alliance (ACA), a pan-African alternative investment firm focused on managing investments across sub-Saharan Africa, with $1.2 billion assets under management, acquired a 31 percent stake in Food Concepts.\n\nFood Concepts is the leading Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) operator in West Africa. The business is focused on the mass market and operates three of the fastest-growing brands, Chicken Republic, PieXpress, and Chop Box across 25 Nigerian states, as well as in Ghana, and an online delivery business growing at over 140 percent year-on-year.\n\nThis was followed by Burger King, the world\u2019s second-biggest burger chain, berthing in Nigeria in November 2021. It has since set up two outlets in Lagos and is expected to expand further.\n\nIn November, Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN) and Honeywell Group signed a merger and acquisition deal valued at N80 billion.\n\nRecently, BUA Foods listed its 18 billion shares by introduction on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX).\n\nAnalysts say these deals can lift the sector \u201cAs a result, niche segments like fast foods aim to take advantage of economic recovery, steady adoption of a westernised lifestyle and the rising urbanisation rate to tap into the middle and high-income groups,\u201d notes Christele Chokossa, a consultant at Euromonitor International.\n\nHarping on the importance of the food market, Uchenna Uzo, a consumer expert and faculty director at the Lagos Business School, says it has become a linchpin for innovation.\n\n\u201cWe have seen people designing platforms, especially in the tech and the e-commerce areas that are now making it possible to scale food delivery and service concepts faster than before,\u201d Uzo notes.\n\nThe resilience of Nigerian businesses has shone through the economic recessions, a challenging business environment, and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cHowever, from a business perspective, the challenging operating environment has benefited those involved in local sourcing and production since it allowed them to mitigate additional expenses, like rising import costs while providing more competitive prices,\u201d Chokossa states.\n\nWithin the retail space, food retailing holds key to quick growth. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) ranks Nigeria as the largest food market in Africa, with significant investment in the local industry and a high level of imports.\n\nThe food and beverage sector is estimated to contribute 22.5 percent of the manufacturing industry value, and 4.6 percent of the country\u2019s GDP. The combined value of food and drinks is estimated at N16 trillion, according to data from Euromonitor International.\n\nNigeria\u2019s young population represents a promise for the food market and the retail sector in general.\n\n\u201cAn emerging urban middle-class is accelerating demands on the retail sector\u2014online and in-store\u2014prioritising realigning assortment and omni-channel strategies,\u201d note analysts at Kearney, a global management consultancy firm.\n\nIt gets better \u2013 the World Bank predicts that 74 percent of youth population (18-23yrs) growth will be in Nigeria and nine other countries by 2035.\n\nAntoine Zammarieh, the managing director of Allied Food and Confectionery Services Limited says Nigeria with 210 million people, 60 percent of whom are youth, is a good market.\n\n\u201cYou cannot say that this is not a good market, especially for this kind of business,\u201d he states.\n\nRead also: How FMN\u2019s Food for Innovation Prize helps SMEs tackle food loss, waste\n\nBut the Nigerian market has not always lived up to its promise. In 2013, Mckinsey & Company projected a $40 billion growth opportunity in food and consumer goods between 2008 and 2020.\n\nThis was not realised as the economy was challenged by two recessions, macroeconomic volatility, rapid naira depreciation, weak purchasing power, and household incomes.\n\nThe retail sector along with others suffered a decline. Sales fell consecutively for seven years. According to the 2021 Global Retail Development Index (GRDI), Nigeria\u2019s total sales fell to $105 billion in 2019 from $109 billion in 2017, $125 billion in 2016, and $135 billion in 2015. But in 2021, it rose to $108 billion.\n\nAnalysts say building on this growth is fundamental to the sector\u2019s recovery. Bismarck Rewane, CEO of Financial Derivatives Company Limited, says increased adoption of electronic payment systems, easing capital and exchange controls, business-friendly environment, improving infrastructure, and making the naira an easily convertible currency will transform the sector in five years.",

The Special Adviser is James Babatunde Agbogun Esq.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cYou have now taken the oath and allegiance of office; your allegiance is to the people of Edo State and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, not to any other individual. Yes, our party nominated us, but we are responsible to every citizen in Edo State, and should not be partisan in discharging our duties.\u201d\n\nHe noted: \u201cThis exercise today effectively formalizes the harmonization of our party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). We have to come together to work for the interest of Edo people first, above everything else.\n\n\u201cYou attended the state\u2019s executive retreat and know the emphasis of our government. You know what we have promised to deliver to Edo people, and by God\u2019s grace, we will deliver them.

Our party, the PDP, is the party in power and wouldn\u2019t condone opposition within the party.\n\n\u201cThere must be party discipline going forward. We can\u2019t tolerate indiscipline and disloyalty to the party. If you can\u2019t get what you want, it doesn\u2019t mean the party must be disunited. We have been patient enough and want to know who the real opposition is and can\u2019t tolerate disloyalty within the party.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure our loyal party members that we are truly proud of what is going on in terms of the registration which is inching towards half a million members. Our leaders are working diligently, going round the state. By the grace of God, before the end of this month, 10 percent of the population of the state will be PDP members.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see how PDP will lose power again in Edo State provided we continue to provide services for Edo people,\u201d he noted\n\nReassuring that his government will sustain policies and programmes to engender sustainable growth and development in the state, the governor added, \u201cAs a government, we are focused on optimising every resource that we have. Edo is ahead of other states, as we have retired godfathers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis appointment is earned based on your contribution to the development of the state, as no godfather pushed us to appoint you; you owe nobody this appointment but God,\u201d Obaseki said.\n\nIn his response on behalf of other appointees, Chris Nehikhare hailed the governor for finding them worthy, promising that they will put in their best to effectively contribute to the development of Edo State.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Re-amended Electoral Bill: Why Buhari must avoid conspiracy by power interests \u2013 IPAC",
          "text": "The leadership of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) Wednesday expressed worry over the continued delay of assent to the Electoral Act 2010 Amendment Bill 2021, calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to do the needful and assent to the reworked Bill.\n\nAccording to IPAC, certain forces presently holding political offices, in league with others with shared interests against the Bill, have since engaged in overt and covert activities aimed at scuttling the Bill from becoming an Act.\n\nIn a statement by its National Chairman, Engineer Yabagi Yusuf Sani, IPAC said if opponents of the Bill succeeded in winning over the president, \u201cthe implication is that none of its series of innovative guidelines and provisions will be applied by INEC in the conduct of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cLike most enlightened Nigerians, we in IPAC had expected that following the withholding of assent by the President when the Bill was first transmitted to him by lawmakers, the reworked version submitted afterwards, would have been such that possible areas of conflicts were avoided.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Federal Legislators in their wisdom, decided to introduce new clauses among which, is the one that makes it mandatory for appointed political office holders who are interested in contesting elective positions, to resign before doing so. Expectedly, the Bill has generated a new round of controversy with vituperation from those interest groups that perceive the clause to be targeted at them.\n\n\u201cThe greatest fears of Nigerians and those of us at IPAC, is that in the event of such a scenario, the widely hailed Biometric Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) as well as the electronic transmission of results along with other cardinal components of the Bill, will not be mandatory for use by INEC in the elections,\u201d the group said.\n\nIt urged President Buhari not to throw away the grains with the chaff, which would be the case if the Electoral Act, for reasons of some clauses in it, is thrown away in its entirety.\n\nThe statement further said: \u201cThe leadership of IPAC is loathe to buy into the opinion held in many quarters that all the controversies over the electoral bill might have been a deliberate and conscious conspiracy by power interests in the Executive and the Legislature who are averse to positive changes that make it difficult for them to continue in their old game of manipulating the electoral process. If that is the case, all democrats and patriotic Nigerians owe it a duty to stand up against these retrogressive forces, who are bent on retarding the progress of our hard-won democracy.\n\n\u201cThe IPAC is calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to go ahead and give his assent to the Bill as presently transmitted by the National Assembly. This will be demonstrating his avowed commitment to bequeathing a culture of transparent and credible elections to the country.\n\n\u201cThe Bill can afterwards, be revisited and amended again if, compelling reasons emerge to do so either before or after the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nCSOs\n\nIn a similar reaction, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Albino Foundation, Mr Jake Epelle called on the president to assent the re-amended Electoral Bill on his desk and save the nascent democracy that Nigeria is struggling to keep afloat.\n\nHe said this is the most inclusive electoral bill capturing the inclusion of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), Women and the Youth in the general elections.\n\nJake said a lot is at stake and that people whom the president and other politicians represent were yearning for a reformed electoral process.\n\n\u201cThis is another opportunity for the president to plainly write his name on golden table of democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the Executive Director, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) and Transparency International, Nigeria, Auwal Rafsanjani said the president had made the commitment to the nation and he shouldn\u2019t waste a day in signing the bill.\n\n\u201cHe should also know that there are implications for delaying the re-amended bill which will obviously affect the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIt is a test for integrity and we don\u2019t expect that he waste a day. He should stick to his words else Nigerians will have an issue with that.\n\n\u201cWe hope that he quickly ascents the bill so as to also allow INEC make adequate preparations ahead of the coming general elections. Without the Bill, INEC will be constrained.\n\n\u201cAnd the only way to ensure free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria is to put in place adequate legal framework in that regard,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Executive Director of Young People\u2019s Initiative for Credible Leadership, Comrade Abdulawahab Ekekhide, said assenting the Bill would enhance more credibility in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cI think Nigerians are looking out for Electronic transmission of results during the general elections when the bill is passed into law. President Buhari has no reason not to assent the Bill because the Bill will deepen the Electoral processes,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Convener Take Back Nigeria Movement and Co-Convener Say No Campaign, Jaiye Gaskia said \u201ctime is of essence, and time is in fact running out on the electoral act.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything beyond end of February, or early March for enacting the bill into an act either through presidential assent, or through override of presidential veto, will be practically too late for the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWe are signatory to ECOWAS and AU conventions that more or less prohibits amendment of electoral laws six or less months to the general elections.\n\n\u201cIt is important that the President gives the Bill transmitted to him utmost priority, and make his decision known immediately, without further delay.\n\n\u201cAnd if the National Assembly is indeed serious about giving the country a new and appropriate electoral law, and in time, then it should be prepared to immediately override any potential presidential veto as soon axe such a veto is announced.\n\n\u201cBottom line, we either have a new electoral act by March of this year, or we forget about it until after the general elections,\u201d he said.\n\nOsinbajo explains delay\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said the Electoral Act Amendment Bill now in progress is a testament to the current administration\u2019s commitment towards improving Nigeria\u2019s electoral system.\n\nOsinbajo stated this Tuesday at the 53rd Conference of the National Association of Law Teachers, held at Bayero University, Kano (BUK), with the theme: \u201cLaw, Democracy and the Electoral Process.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThe bill itself has been the subject of robust engagement between the government and civil society. While some have expressed reservations about the time it is taking to enact the new law, we should remember that a truly inclusive democratic, deliberative process often takes time.\n\n\u201cI am confident that the legislation that emerges will be one that reflects a broad consensus between all the stakeholders.\u201d\n\nThe vice president added that \u201cwhile INEC continues to improve its capacity to conduct credible elections, particularly through the deployment of technology; we recognize that democracy is about much more than voting. It is also about constitutionalism, rule of law and respect for civil liberties. We must diligently work to uphold these principles.\n\n\u201cOur progress as a democracy must therefore also be prosecuted in terms of the struggle to reduce the basic problems of ill-health, malnutrition, illiteracy, and famine which afflict our people. Where social and economic rights are unsecured, people are unable to fully maximize their civil and political rights.\u201d\n\nWhile declaring the conference open earlier, Osinbajo noted that democracy and social justice were closely linked, adding that the cornerstone of democracy is the insistence that \u201cour society must be governed by the rule of law and not the whim of man.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs law teachers and legal practitioners, we are custodians of this truth. However, democracy cannot endure without social justice,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cthe pursuit of justice lies at the heart of the quest for the good of society.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cthis makes the legal profession one of the cardinal vocations upon which civilization rests. Indeed, law is an instrument of pacific social engineering, the end of which is justice. When it is rooted in this postulate, it follows that the law and therefore democracy, are meant to serve beneficial social ends.\u201d\n\nOn the essence of democracy and the need to preserve democratic institutions in Nigeria and other parts of Africa, the VP noted that even as Nigeria has enjoyed 22 years of unbroken democracy, the country is still a young democracy.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed a series of peaceful transitions of power. This is a huge credit to the democratic sensibilities of our people. Along the way, we are learning valuable lessons that can only make us better practitioners of liberty.\n\n\u201cMany of our institutions are still in their infancy, and we must carefully guide them into maturity. We recognise that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance,\u201d Osinbajo further stated.",

And those are the issues that we have been talking about: that you cannot have the whole chunk of money generated from our land here and taken to the federal and shared to the states, and in the end you now say Bayelsa State is insolvent.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we are talking about restructuring, that\u2019s why we are talking about the amendment of our country\u2019s constitution. A constitution that says land surface rights belongs to the people, and what is under that land belongs to Federal Government. There is no justice in it. And anybody who bandies these figures, you are annoying the people of Bayelsa State, and indeed the people of the Niger-Delta.\n\n\u201cSo, for us, we need to rework our constitution; we need to restructure our country, in a way that we can approximate our own resources here and pay tax to the Federal Government. And nobody will be talking about Bayelsa State being insolvent or any other state in the Niger Delta for that matter.\n\n\u201cIf Bayelsa state is insolvent, then it means Nigeria is insolvent. From where you get all your resources, and the resources are not ploughed back here. And you say the state is insolvent?\u201d\n\nCocoa money?\n\nMr Diri also explained that oil wasn\u2019t developed in Nigeria by money made from cocoa farming.\n\n\u201cA lot of people make a mistake and say we used cocoa money to developed oil, that\u2019s not true.\n\n\u201cMultinational, international oil companies came with the capital in oil exploration and exploitation,\u201d Mr Diri said.\n\n\u201cThere was no money from Nigeria, every money that came was monies from those who came to develop oil here. These are the issues Nigeria needs to resolve.\u201d\n\nFocus on farming\n\nThe Governor noted that despite Bayelsa\u2019s oil wealth, his administration is working to re-orientate youths to go into farming.\n\nAccording to him, farming is a priority and everyone in the state is encouraged to key into it.\n\n\u201cAgriculture is a priority for this government, we are working hard to have a change of mindset of our youths to key into Agriculture.\n\n\u201cTomorrow, the Akwa-Ibom Governor is coming into Bayelsa to flag off the farming season. He will also superintend over the made-in-Bayelsa Agriculture show.\n\n\u201cOil is almost going; we cannot continue to live (dependent) on oil. The focus of this government is agriculture.

          "text": "Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (rtd) has asked all tertiary institutions in Nigeria to make drug integrity tests an institutional policy for both new and returning students as part of efforts to fight the menace of drug abuse among Nigerian youths.\n\nGen. Marwa who made the call at the University of Abuja while launching the \u2018drug-free university campaign\u2019 on Wednesday, February 9, 2022, also called for a partnership between the NDLEA and the university system that will allow the agency set up outposts on campuses to further strengthen the authorities in fighting the scourge.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cpart of the measures to reduce drug use in the university is the proposed introduction of the Drug Integrity Test for both new and returning students.\n\nRead Also: Troops Neutralise Notorious IPOB Gunman, Three Others In Anambra\n\n\u201cThe Drug Integrity Test is anticipated to metamorphose into an anti-drug policy for all higher institutions of learning in Nigeria. It is expected that the University of Abuja, being the \u201cUniversity of National Unity\u201d, will be the first public university in Nigeria to adopt the Drug Integrity Test for fresh and returning students of the institution\u201d.\n\nMarwa added that \u201cthe Drug Integrity Test is not a punitive measure; rather it is an early detection tool to ascertain an individual\u2019s drug use status for appropriate intervention, and timely treatment and care.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\u201cThis will also entail that the university will develop a drug policy and make such available to each student. Equally important is the need to create an NDLEA outpost on the campus where we\u2019ll deploy our men to assist the authorities, deter drug dealers and users within the university.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the management of the University of Abuja for collaborating with NDLEA to organise the launch, he said \u201cthe theme, \u2018Drug-Free University and Tertiary Institutions,\u2019 is apt and timely as there is no better time than now to combat the drug challenge in the university community and among students.\n\nHe said the menace of drug use in the country is of worrisome dimension, especially among the youth population.\n\n\u201cThe truth on the ground indicates that our society needs to do more. The National Drug Use and Health Survey of 2018 showed that Nigeria has a peculiar drug use prevalence. And it is instructive and worrisome to know that drug use was common among those aged 25-39 years, while the age of initiation was 22 years for heroin and 19 years for cannabis.\n\n\u201cNote that these age groups comprised of young people who are either in secondary or tertiary institutions or are on the cusp of graduation. To simplify the report of the survey: young people are overwhelmingly the majority of drug abusers in Nigeria. That is a jolting reality because youths are the building blocks of every developed nation and anything that affects the youth population affects the nation.\n\n\u201cThe youth population constitutes the country\u2019s workforce and the stronger the youth of a country, the more developed that country would be. One, then, wonders what will become of Nigeria with about 70% youth population, if the future of its youths is ravaged by drugs.\n\n\u201cTo aggressively reverse the trend, His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari, the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces, GCFR, launched the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA) campaign on 26th June 2021 to commemorate the United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking.\n\n\u201cThe goal of WADA is to mobilize all Nigerians, especially the youth population, for active participation in the process of ridding our society of the drug menace. As one of the worst-hit age groups by the drug menace, Nigerian youths are critical stakeholders to the attainment of the laudable goals of WADA.\n\n\u201cSince the launch of WADA, the Agency has initiated evidence-based prevention activities, which include focused advocacy, drug awareness campaign, sensitization, treatment and care of People Who Use Drugs (PWUD). We have launched a renewed campaign and intensive sensitization, targeting youths in schools at all levels as well as youths out of school,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe NDLEA also asserted that \u201csome years ago, the Agency opted to address the drug problem among youths by setting up in schools the Drug-Free Clubs. The pervasiveness and magnitude of the drug use problem has necessitated the change in the name of the club from Drug-Free Club to War Against Drug Abuse Club\u2015WADA Club for short\u2015to inject a renewed vibe and vigour into the club and its members.\u201d\n\nHe said the essence of the event was to officially launch the WADA Club in the University of Abuja and to formally inaugurate the War Against Drug Abuse Ambassadors (WADA Ambassadors) among the staff of the institution.\n\nMarwa charged the students in the spirit of true patriotism to desire and work towards a country devoid of drugs and its attendant consequences.\n\nOthers who spoke at the ceremony included representatives of the Minister of Education, National Universities Commission, and the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Abdul-Rasheed Na\u2019Allah.\n\nThey commended the collaboration between NDLEA and the university as part of renewed efforts to stamp out the problem of drug abuse in the country.",

          "text": "RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat and the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), on Wednesday in Cairo, signed an agreement on the management of the AfCFTA Adjustment Fund (ADF) that would require $10 billion over the next five to 10 years.\n\nThe base fund is a facility that would support African countries to cope with the loss of revenues from import tariffs and the private sector to effectively participate in the new trading environment established under the AfCFTA.\n\nAlready, Afreximbank has committed $1 billion towards the ADF, which is made up of a base fund, a general fund and a credit fund.\n\nThe AfCFTA Secretariat and the Afreximbank stated that base fund would consist of contributions from state parties (which is AfCFTA member countries), grants and technical assistance funds to address tariff revenue losses as tariffs are progressively eliminated.\n\nThe base fund, according to the two continental institutions, would also support countries to implement various provisions of the AfCFTA agreement, its protocols and annexes while the general fund would mobilise concessional funding.\n\nThey added that the credit fund, \u201cwill mobilise commercial funding to support both the public and private sectors, enabling them to adjust and take advantage of the opportunities created by the AfCFTA.\u201d\n\nThe agreement was signed yesterday by President/Chairman of the Afreximbank, Prof. Benedict Oramah, and the Secretary General of the AfCFTA Secretariat, Wamkele Mene, in the presence of Minister Plenipotentiary (Trade) of the Arab Republic of Egypt, Mr. Aly Basha, as well as some leading African bankers and captains of industry.\n\nThe two continental institutions said the general fund and credit fund would be launched very soon to address the needs of the private sector including the small and medium enterprises, women and youth.\n\nThe signing of the agreement was in furtherance of the mandate given to the AfCFTA\u2019s Secretariat and the Afreximbank by the African Union Summit of Heads of State and Government and the AfCFTA Council of Ministers responsible for Trade to establish the ADF, \u201cto support AfCFTA state parties to adjust to the new liberalised and integrated trading environment established under the AfCFTA Agreement.\u201d\n\nMene stressed the importance of the Adjustment Fund as one of the instruments designed to support the implementation of the AfCFTA agreement and assist AfCFTA member countries to deal with short term tariff revenue losses as they dismantle tariffs and implement the Agreement.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we make significant progress in establishing schedules of tariff concessions, the finalisation of the adjustment Ffund will enable us to maintain and even accelerate the momentum. We now have an excellent tool to provide support to our state parties (member countries) and their private sector through financing, technical assistance, grants and compensation funding.\n\n\u201cIt will help them mitigate revenue losses and competitive pressures that may result from reduction in tariffs and liberalisation of markets in order to tap into the opportunities of the AfCFTA. This is another important step towards the successful implementation of the continental free trade agreement.\u201d\n\nOramah, in his remarks said that the funds would be used to support both the public and private sectors to address short term disruptions, while enabling the private sector to retool, reskill, and develop capabilities to produce value added goods and services that could be traded competitively within the continent and catalyse the emergence of AfCFTA-led regional value chains.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis Adjustment Fund, which is taking shape, comes on top of the Pan African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which was commercially launched on 13 January 2022 in Accra, and the resoundingly successuful second edition of the Intra-African Trade Fair, which held in November 2021 in Durban.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the initiatives that we are proud to implement in close collaboration with the AfCFTA Secretariat, setting the conditions that will undoubtedly lead to a smooth implementation of the AfCFTA.\n\n\u201cToday we have launched the base fund of the ADF to address urgent needs of State Parties relating to tariff revenue losses and the transposition costs to enable them to implement the AfCFTA agreement. We will be launching the general fund and credit fund very soon to address the needs of the private sector including the small and medium enterprises, women and youth.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with all development partners, development financial institutions, commercial banks, export credit agencies and other investors and strategic partners to mobilise resources for the Adjustment Fund to enable the continent to implement the AfCFTA.\u201d\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",

          "text": "RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe Second Circuit, a United States Court of Appeal has revived Nigeria\u2019s bid for discovery aimed at propping up bribery allegations relating to a nearly $10 billion arbitral award, ruling that a lower court wrongly found that the country seemed to be trying to avoid US Department of Justice scrutiny in the Process and Industrial Developments Limited (P&ID) case.\n\nThe appeals court vacated US District Judge, Paul A. Engelmayer\u2019s late 2020 decision denying Nigeria\u2019s petition to subpoena VR Advisory Services Limited for information the country hopes would bolster criminal proceedings in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to New York-based Law360.com, the panel then remanded the case, saying Judge Engelmayer had improperly analysed whether the country should have gone through its mutual legal assistance treaty with the US before turning to a US foreign discovery statute.\n\nVR Advisory is a Manhattan asset manager that acquired a 25 per cent stake in P&ID in 2018.\n\nNigeria had accused P & ID of paying bribes to secure a lucrative government contract that led to the arbitral award, said to be worth more than $10 billion with interest.\n\nJudge Engelmayer had concluded in his decision that Nigeria\u2019s petition appeared to be an attempt to avoid US DOJ scrutiny of its request. He wrote that Nigeria hadn\u2019t given a good reason why it had opted to use Section 1782 of the US Code, which authorises courts to order discovery for certain foreign proceedings, rather than a mutual legal assistance treaty for criminal matters, under which the DOJ would decide whether to approve the request.\n\nBut the Second Circuit agreed with Nigeria that the judge had, through his opinion, \u201ceffectively erected an impermissible \u2018extra-statutory barrier\u2019 to discovery,\u201d according to the decision.\n\nThe mutual legal assistance treaty in question expands access for Nigeria and the US to criminal evidence within their borders, and it specifically states that the assistance it provides, \u201cshall not prevent or restrict\u201d either of the two countries from granting assistance under other agreements or laws, the panel wrote.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, parts of the United States-Nigeria MLAT do impose limits on the assistance that the Department of Justice or Nigerian attorney general will provide in response to an MLAT request,\u201d according to the decision, which provides as an example a section of the treaty authorizing the relevant authorities to deny certain requests, such as those relating to political offenses.\n\n\u201cBut reading those limiting provisions together with Article [19]\u2019s rule of construction, it is clear that they are intended only as internal limits applicable to MLAT requests, not as restrictions on proof-gathering means external to the treaty,\u201d the panel added.\n\nThe judges later noted that it is, \u201chardly surprising\u201d that there would be greater limits on information available under the treaty since it obligates the DOJ to assist the Nigerian authorities in their search for information.\n\nThe appeals court said neither the US Supreme Court nor any federal appellate court had previously\n\nconsidered whether a foreign sovereign that has a mutual legal assistance treaty with the U.S. circumvents that treaty by filing a Section 1782 application in the district court.\n\nMoving on to Judge Engelmayer\u2019s conclusion that it would be \u201cimproper\u201d for Nigeria to use the materials being sought in a related proceeding in England focusing on the corruption allegations, the panel agreed with Nigeria that this was an error since the English proceedings clearly qualify as a \u201cproceeding in a foreign or international tribunal\u201d within the meaning of Section 1782.\n\nCounsel for VR Advisory declined to comment. Counsel for Nigeria did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn its petition, Nigeria said it was seeking information that would aid its prosecution of former government officials who allegedly accepted the bribes from P & ID in exchange for the contract for a lucrative gas supply and processing agreement, which later led to the massive arbitral award.\n\nThe dispute between the parties has lasted for nearly a decade, arising out of a contract P & ID signed with Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Petroleum Resources in 2010. Under the pact, Nigeria had agreed to supply the company with natural gas for a gas processing facility that was to be built on Nigerian coastland with the goal of resolving the country\u2019s growing electricity crisis.\n\nBut the project never materialised, falling apart after the government failed to uphold its end of the bargain.\n\nProcess and Industrial Developments took the dispute to arbitration in 2012, and the tribunal concluded that Nigeria was liable for breaching the agreement. It awarded the company $6.6 billion in early 2017, an amount that had ballooned to more than $10 billion with interest as of early 2021.\n\nIn recent years, however, Nigeria has been pushing courts in the United Kingdom to set aside the award on the basis of recently uncovered evidence of alleged fraud. The country argues the facility would not have been built anyway, since P&ID lacked the infrastructure or ability to perform under the deal, and that the contract had been obtained through bribery.\n\nIt has also accused the company of building its case before the arbitral tribunal on fabricated evidence and perjured testimony from its co-founder Michael Quinn, \u201ca notorious music promoter and weapons dealer,\u201d according to Nigeria.\n\nA UK court is expected to hold a trial on these allegations in early 2023.\n\nP&ID, for its part, has strenuously objected to any allegations of wrongdoing, calling criminal investigations and prosecutions in Nigeria \u201cpart of an illegitimate and abusive campaign designed to evade a politically damaging commercial debt.\u201d\n\nSenior Circuit Judge Gerard E. Lynch and Circuit Judges Susan L. Carney and Richard J. Sullivan sat on the panel for the Second Circuit.\n\nVR Advisory was represented by Michael S. Kim, Zachary Rosenbaum, Josef M. Klazen and Darryl Stein of Kobre & Kim. On the other hand, Nigeria was represented by Alexander D. Pencu, Christopher J. Major and Austin D. Kim of Meister Seelig & Fein LLP.",

          "text": "President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, has painted a gloomy picture of Africa, saying dwindling economic fortunes in 2020 resulted in $165 billion decline in the continent\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Adesina said in the same year, over 30 million jobs were lost while 26 million persons fell into extreme poverty.\n\nThe former Minister of Agriculture made the assertions in a paper titled, \u201cMobilising Financing for Africa\u2019s Accelerated Economic Recovery, Development and Integration,\u201d which he delivered to African leaders at the 35th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, recently.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt has been a global economic cyclone. Africa witnessed a decline in GDP growth of 2.1 per cent in 2020, its lowest in 20 years. Africa\u2019s GDP fell by $165 billion. Over 30 million jobs were lost and over 26 million people fell into extreme poverty.\u201d\n\nThe AfDB boss, however, praised African leaders for their effort to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI wish to commend the leadership efforts of the African Union, and our Heads of State and Government, for the critical roles you have played in dealing with the pandemic and the socio-economic challenges in its wake. Today, thanks to these efforts, 11 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated, and another 16 per cent has been partially vaccinated.\n\n\u201cHowever, while developed countries have moved to booster shots, Africa is still struggling with basic shots.\u201d\n\nAdesina warned against outsourcing Africa\u2019s security to foreigners, as he stressed the need for Africa to protect African lives by investing in healthcare infrastructure and vaccine manufacturing.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe must learn from this experience. Africa can no longer outsource the security of the lives of its 1.4 billion people to the benevolence of others. We must secure African lives!\n\n\u201cIt is time to build Africa\u2019s healthcare defense system. This must be based on three strategic priorities. First, building Africa\u2019s quality healthcare infrastructure. Second, building Africa\u2019s pharmaceutical industry, and third, building Africa\u2019s vaccine manufacturing capacity.\n\n\u201cAfrica needs $600 million to $1.3 billion to meet its goal of attaining 60 per cent vaccine production by 2040. Investing in health is investing in national security. The African Development Bank plans to invest $3 billion to support pharmaceutical and vaccines manufacturing capacity for Africa.\n\n\u201cTo address the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic and support economic recovery, Africa will need some $484 billion over the next three years. To eliminate extreme poverty by 2030, the continent will need $414 \u2013 $784 billion per year. Africa will need $7-$15 billion a year to deal with climate change. The continent will also need between $68 \u2013 $108 billion per year to fix the infrastructure financing gap.\u201d\n\nAdesina said Africa must drastically increase its resource base, adding that with the help of the continent\u2019s leaders, AfDB\u2019s general capital increased in 2019 by 125 per cent, rising from $93 billion to $208 billion, the highest since its establishment in 1964.\n\nHe said these resources had enabled the bank to scale up support to African economies to tackle the pandemic.\n\nAdesina said, \u201cThe Board of Directors of the Bank approved a Crisis Response Facility of up to $10 Billion. The Bank also launched a $3 Billion Fight COVID-19 Social Bond on the international capital markets, which was the largest ever US-dollar denominated social bond in world history. The Bank provided $ 27 million as grants to the African Centres for Disease Control.\n\n\u201cOver the past six years, the African Development Bank has provided about $39 billion in financing to the continent in support of its High5 priorities to: light up and power Africa; feed Africa; integrate Africa; industrialise Africa; and improve the quality of life of the people of Africa. These High5s are the accelerators for achieving Agenda 2063.\u201d\n\nAdesina assured that with $25 billion in equity, the African Development Fund could leverage up to $33 billion of additional financing for low-income countries.\n\nAccording to him, the bank requires the support of the leaders to change the article in the charter of the African Development Fund that bars it from going to the market to leverage resources, and this is top priority.\n\nHe said the bank was also leveraging private investments into Africa, in innovative ways, stressing, \u201cThe Africa Investment Forum, established by the African Development Bank and its partners, has helped to secure investment interests worth more than $78 billion.\n\n\u201cThis spectacular level of interest includes a $24 billion transaction for the liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique. We are proud that that this project will make Mozambique the third-largest producer of liquefied natural gas in the world.\u201d\n\nAdesina urged African leaders to link security, investment, growth, and development closely together.\n\nHe added, \u201cTo enhance the security of Africa, the African Development Bank is currently developing Security Indexed Investment Bonds. Proceeds from these bonds, when developed, will support countries and regional economic communities to do four things.\n\n\u201cFirst, to upgrade security architecture. Second, to repair damaged infrastructure in conflict-affected zones. Third, to rebuild social infrastructure. And fourth, to protect zones with strategic investments.\n\n\u201cWe must build a better future for our youth. It is time to create youth-based wealth all across Africa. To boost financial support for the businesses of our youth, the African Development Bank Group is exploring with countries the establishment of Youth Entrepreneurship Investment Banks. They will be first rate financial institutions run by the youth for the youth.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: NNPC Names MRS, Oando, Duke Oil as Culprits in Importation of Dirty Fuel, MRS Blames NNPC",
          "text": "The Nigerian National Company Limited (NNPC) on Wednesday stated that its investigation has revealed the presence of Methanol in four petrol cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, Oando and Duke Oil.\n\nGroup Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, who disclosed this during a media briefing however said he has since ordered the holding back of all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine).\n\nIt was also gathered on Wednesday that the NNPC has asked oil trading firms to embark on emergency supply of petrol to replace cargoes that were rejected because of their poor quality, Reuters quoted two sources as having disclosed on Wednesday.\n\nApparently disturbed by the development, the federal government yon Wednesday ordered investigation into the bad fuel that had damaged the engines of some vehicles.\n\nIn addition to disrupting the country\u2019s fuel supply chain, the product which led to the damage of several cars, the NNPC disclosed, was imported from Antwerp in Belgium.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja, Kyari, argued that petrol brought into Nigeria usually does not include the test for the level of methanol content.\n\nThe NNPC helmsman maintained that cargoes\u2019 quality certificates issued at the loading port in Belgium, by AmSpec Belgium, indicated that the product complied with Nigerian specification.\n\nFurthermore, he said the NNPC quality inspectors including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G conducted tests before discharge, which showed that the cargo also met the country\u2019s standard.\n\n\u201cAs a standard practice for all PMS import to Nigeria, the cargoes were equally certified by inspection agent appointed by the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) has met Nigerian specification.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the usual quality inspection protocol employed in both the load port in Belgium and our discharge ports in Nigeria do not include the test for per cent of methanol content and therefore the additive was not detected by our quality inspectors,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari disclosed that the NNPC had ordered the quarantine of all un-evacuated volumes of the contaminated fuel that led to the disruption of the petrol distribution value chain, in order to prevent further distribution.\n\nHe stressed that the NNPC and other stakeholders were making serious efforts to resolve issues generated by the supply and discharge of methanol blended product in some Nigerian depots.\n\nKyari noted that the NNPC first received a report on January 20, 2022, from its quality inspector of the presence of \u201cemulsion particles\u201d in petrol cargoes shipped to Nigeria from the European country.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn order to prevent the distribution of the petrol, we have ordered the quarantine of all un-evacuated volumes and the holding back of all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine).\n\n\u201cAll defaulting suppliers have been put on notice for remedial actions and NNPC will work with the authority to take further necessary actions in line with subsisting regulations.\n\n\u201cNNPC wishes to reassure Nigerians that we are currently sourcing additional cargoes to ensure product sufficiency.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the NNPC has ordered that all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine), should be withheld.\n\nBut the NNPC GMD\u2019s explanation ran contrary to an earlier press statement released by MRS, where the company denied culpability.\n\nIn its statement MRS had stated that it remains a responsible corporate citizen and will not be involved in the purchase, importation, distribution or marketing of substandard petroleum products in the country, coming short of directly accusing the NNPC of complicity.\n\n\u201cDue to current subsidy regime, NNPC is the sole supplier of all PMS in Nigeria. Consequently, the NNPC through their trading arm Duke Oil, supplied a cargo of PMS purchased from international trader Litasco and delivered it with Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer. This vessel discharged in Apapa between the 24th and 30th of January, 2022,\u201d it had alleged.\n\nAs one of the beneficiaries, MRS said it received the product in its depot and distributed the product to only eight of its stations in Lagos.\n\nThe company described the allegation trending at the time as mischievous, false and untrue.\n\nBut the NNPC boss maintained that the methanol blended petrol was imported into the country by the suppliers, including MRS, through its Direct-Sales-Direct-Purchase arrangement.\n\nThe arrangement allows the national oil company to deliver monthly crude oil lifting on Free on Board (FOB) basis to suppliers who in return are supposed to deliver petroleum products of Nigerian standard specification to NNPC.\n\nThe petroleum products delivered are usually equivalent in value to the crude oil received from NNPC subject to the general terms and conditions as advised.\n\nBut according to the NNPC, the companies that supplied the methanol blended petrol included MRS which made the importation through a vessel named MT Bow Pioneer.\n\nHe said while Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium brought in the fuel through a vessel identified as MT Tom Hilde, Oando allegedly brought in the product through a vessel named MT Elka Apollon, while Duke Oil came through MT Nord Gainer vessel.\n\nFuel queues had been building in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, due to fuel shortages caused by the withdrawal of the contaminated petrol from the market. But NNPC was said to be seeking thousands of tonnes of the product to ameliorate the situation, the report said.\n\nThe Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) had said it found fuel with methanol above national specifications in the supply chain and removed the fuel from circulation. Although methanol, in small amounts, is a regular gasoline additive, the regulator said the supplier of the off-specification gasoline was known but did not name the firm.\n\nNigeria depends almost entirely on imports to meet its domestic fuel needs after many failed attempts to revamp the dilapidated refineries, with daily consumption exceeding 60 million litres.\n\nNNPC handles nearly all the imports through crude-for-fuel contracts, known as Direct Sale, direct Purchase (DSDP), with consortia of local and foreign oil firms.\n\nEach consortium receives 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in exchange for products, making the combined total about 320,000 bpd of Nigeria\u2019s output.\n\nNigerians feel that cheap fuel is one of the few benefits the average Nigerian gets from the government, which sets price caps at the pump through a controversial and patchy subsidy scheme.\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Executive Officer of NMDPRA, Farouk Ahmed, on Wednesday stated that NNPC had received delivery of 300 million litres of petrol to close the supply gap created in the country by the withdrawal of the off-spec petrol.\n\nSpeaking in Lagos, when he met with marketers in a bid to raise distribution and remove the substandard fuel from supply chain, Ahmed said the 300 million litres arrived through six vessels ordered by NNPC. He noted that with the latest delivery, the fuel queues being witnessed in the country should disappear by Friday.\n\nAhmed said, \u201cToday, I am happy to say that loading has been going on in most of the depots because we have been able to identify, isolate and quarantine the limited amount of gasoline that was affected by the methanol volume that was discovered.\n\n\u201cWe have vessels that have arrived in the country recently. At least six arrived in the last few days, ordered by the NNPC, carrying a total volume of close to 300 million litres, just to close the gap created by those vessels we have withdrawn from the system.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Ahmed disclosed that there was a 9,000-metric tonne vessel that was being discharged at the Apapa Port to major marketers, including OVH, TotalEnergies, 11 Plc, Conoil, and Ardova Plc.\n\nAccording to him, as soon as the vessels complete discharging and start pushing products to oil marketers, the fuel queues in Lagos should fully disappear by Friday.\n\n\u201cSo, once these vessels complete discharging and start pushing the products to marketers, I believe Lagos will be cleared by Friday,\u201d Ahmed stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have got that assurance from the marketers. Also, most of these vessels will be providing volumes to most of the key members of DAPPMAN.\u201d\n\nBut the NMDPRA boss stated that the country currently had petrol that could last for 20 days, 10 days short of the usual 30-day reserve.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur ideal days of sufficiency is 30 but this happened because of the concern that made us withdraw the vessels, which created the gap in our 30 days sufficiency.\n\n\u201cAgain, with aggressive importation by the NNPC, this will be closed in a few days, according to the data we got from the NNPC\u2019s import programme.\n\n\u201cLoading is also on-going in most of the depots that have confirmed spec products; so, there is no need for panic. Hopefully, by tomorrow, Lagos will be cleared.\u201d\n\nThe regulatory agency said it was also working to address the challenge thrown up by the importation of substandard petrol into the country.\n\nOther attendees at the meeting included top officials of NNPC, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), and members of the Depots and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN).\n\nFG Orders Investigation\n\nBriefing newsmen at Abuja, after the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said government had initiated moves to investigate the supply and circulation of adulterated petrol in the country. Sylva said the federal government wanted to get to the root of the matter, and warned against hasty conclusions.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to draw any conclusions yet,\u201d the former Bayelsa State governor said. \u201cThere will be a major investigation to unravel everything and then let us really get to the bottom of it before we can come back and tell you what is going to happen to the culprits,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister assured that the government would consider compensating those who might have been adversely affected by the bad fuel.\n\n\u201cWe know that some people\u2019s vehicles must have also been damaged, that is also going to be taken into consideration in dealing with the situation,\u201d he stated.\n\nAsked whether the issue was discussed at the FEC meeting and whether the suppliers would be punished, Sylva said, \u201cThe issue did not come up in council, but, of course, you will recall I was here yesterday to brief Mr. President on the issue. I\u2019m not in a position to disclose the identities of the companies, but there are some issues and we are actively tackling it.\n\n\u201cNobody has, before now, checked for methanol in our fuel, it\u2019s not very usual and this is the first time this is happening and the NNPC is up to the task.\n\n\u201cI will also convey your question to the NNPC and maybe the Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, but we are actively handling it and I want to assure you that the problem will be a thing of the past very soon.\u201d\n\nMRS had in a newspaper advertorial on Wednesday said Duke Oil supplied a cargo of the adulterated petrol, which it purchased from an international trader, Litasco, and delivered with Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer. MRS further stated the vessel was discharged in Apapa, Lagos, between January 24 and 30, 2022, explaining that major marketers received the following quantities: OVH \u2013 10,000mt; MRS \u2013 5,000mt; NIPCO \u2013 5,958mt; ARDOVA \u2013 6,000mt; and TOTAL \u2013 10,000mt\n\nSylva also spoke on the approval granted to his ministry by the council, saying FEC okayed the contract for the construction of the 17-storey local content building in Yenagoa at the cost of N1.817 billion.\n\nHe explained, \u201cYou will recall that in 2020, Mr. President already commissioned that project. There were some ancillary works that had to be done to connect some of the buildings and that was now presented to council for the sum of N1.817 billion and this now closes out this contract and we have told the contractor. This is the full and final payment for everything.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the end of this project and we have completely delivered this to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) engaged the services of the Association of Distributors and Transporters of Petroleum Products (ADITOP) to ensure uninterrupted distribution of petroleum products and maintain sanity in the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry.\n\nIPMAN President, Mr. Chinedu Okoronkwo, who disclosed this to journalists yesterday said the strategy would weaken the threat by the National Association of Transport Owners (NARTO), which recently issued a threat to embark on industrial action.\n\nOkoronkwo said IPMAN was not part of any trade association and would not embark on industrial action to further compound the predicament faced by Nigerians. He said members were already heavily indebted to banks and could not afford to stagnate their businesses, adding that already, many have shut down operations as a result of harsh operating environment.\n\nThe president said IPMAN was ready to confront the excesses of the NARTO and Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD), who he alleged illegally fleeced marketers.\n\nOkoronkwo stated, \u201cThey are not registered under oil and gas, but as dry dock. But today they are gradually redefining operations of marketers who have signed bulk purchase arrangement with the NNPC.\n\n\u201cWe have lost over N27 billion over time from illegal fees they collect from marketers. They collect about N45,000 per truck and taking in millions that ought to be part of our margins and are building stations and purchasing trucks at the expense of duly licensed marketers.\u201d\n\nOkoronkwo raised concern about the dwindling margins of marketers and the heavy debts hanging on the necks of IPMAN members.\n\n\u201cThe products we purchased with N1 million in the past is now about N7 million without additional margin to operators,\u201d he said.\n\nNARTO had threatened to stop haulage of petroleum products across the country over the hike in the price of diesel to N430 per litre and other operational challenges. The association had earlier decried the delay in the payment of about N45 billion bridging cost, and demanded an increase in the transportation allowance factored into the pump price of petrol.\n\n-Deji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos with agency report",
          "summary": "But the NNPC GMD\u2019s explanation ran contrary to an earlier press statement released by MRS, where the company denied culpability.\nThe petroleum products delivered are usually equivalent in value to the crude oil received from NNPC subject to the general terms and conditions as advised.\nAccording to him, as soon as the vessels complete discharging and start pushing products to oil marketers, the fuel queues in Lagos should fully disappear by Friday.\nOther attendees at the meeting included top officials of NNPC, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), and members of the Depots and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN).\nNARTO had threatened to stop haulage of petroleum products across the country over the hike in the price of diesel to N430 per litre and other operational challenges.",

          "text": "RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe 2022 Committee has resolved to mobilise Nigerians across party lines and social strata for quality leadership of the country at all levels as the elections to choose new leaders in 2023 draw near. The Conveners of a meeting of 100 leading business, political, civil society, and thought leaders, which held last week in Lagos, on Wednesday explained that the gathering should not be linked to the 2023 presidential election but a platform to chart a new consensus for national rebirth.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by the coordinators of the group, Chairman of THISDAY/Arise Media Group, Nduka Obaigbena, and former Presidential Liaison Officer to the Senate, Kashim Imam, the eminent persons noted that the gathering was meant to build consensus towards national rebirth.\n\nThe meeting, which held from February 4 to 6 under the aegis of \u201cThe 2022 Committee\u201d, the conveners pointed out, remained non- partisan. They said the retreat to chart a new consensus for national rebirth was attended by 14 incumbent governors, 13 former governors, and three former senate presidents.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Committee\u201d conveners stated, \u201cWhilst the 2022 committee is interested in the quality of leadership that will emerge in Nigeria at all levels, we consider attempts to link the committee with candidates or political parties for the 2023 elections as an unwarranted and unnecessary distraction. Candidates are only chosen by political parties and we are not a political party.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the group stressed that participants, working in three sub-committees, namely: national security, the economy, and Nigeria in transition, recognised that there was an urgent need to seek common ground and irreducible minimum actions to stabilise the polity at this critical time of transition.\n\nThe statement came against the backdrop of speculations that the well-attended event was to select a presidential candidate among the attendees.\n\nBut the coordinators of the meeting stated that although all the 100 leading lights of the 2022 committee had the capacity for national leadership, it should not be linked to the politics of 2023.\n\nThe conveners said among the active participants in the work of the committee were over seven persons, from three or more political parties, who had already publicly declared their aspirations to lead the country but were desirous of working with other patriots for non-partisan greater national goals.\n\n\u201cWe must have a secure, peaceful and united nation before we can have candidates for political offices,\u201d it added.\n\nThe statement further said the committee was of the view that what Nigeria needed today was for all patriots to come together to rescue the country from all political, economic and security threats, and promote the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cThe meetings will continue as we work with federal and state governments, current and future political leaders of all political persuasions, as well as other eminent patriotic citizens, for the greater good of the Nigerian people,\u201d the group maintained.\n\nThe group of eminent Nigerians called on all patriotic volunteers, willing and able, to join the collective effort to stabilise the country so that a new Nigeria that all could be proud of, could be built.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
