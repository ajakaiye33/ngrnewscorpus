          "text": "Lionel Messi and Barcelona have reached an agreement for the forward to sign a new five-year deal with the Catalan club, sources have confirmed to ESPN. Sources added Messi has accepted a significant wage reduction to prolong his stay.\n\nMessi was a free agent after his contract at Barca expired and he had courted interest from Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City since first revealing a desire to end his 20-year relationship with Barca last summer. The 34-year-old\u2019s previous contract was worth over \u20ac500m and that expired at the stroke of midnight on July 1.\n\nHowever, with the return of Joan Laporta as president in March, Messi grew more open to staying at Camp Nou. An official announcement is expected in the coming days.\n\nLaporta had hoped to finalise an agreement before Messi\u2019s previous terms expired. Barca\u2019s financial problems made that impossible, though, with their gross debt over \u20ac1bn. Cutbacks have been essential, in terms of transferring players out, reducing the wage bill and getting Messi to accept a lower salary.\n\nLa Liga president Javier Tebas had warned Barca they would not be allowed to register Messi\u2019s new deal if they were unable to reduce spending to comply with the league\u2019s financial fair play rules. Barca\u2019s spending limit has been reduced from over \u20ac600m to \u20ac347m since the coronavirus pandemic, with further reductions expected to be imposed for the upcoming season.\n\nMessi is on holiday with his family following his Copa America glory with Argentina last weekend, which was his first senior trophy with his national team.\n\nHe will link up with Ronald Koeman\u2019s squad later in the summer, with Barca\u2019s league campaign kicking off on Aug. 15 against Real Sociedad at Camp Nou.\n\nMessi had first expressed a desire to leave Barca last August after the 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. His relationship with then-president Josep Maria Bartomeu had reached a breaking point. In a September 2020 interview with Goal, after Barca had blocked his departure, Messi called Bartomeu a \u201cliar\u201d and said the board had been \u201cmaking things up as they go along\u201d and \u201cplugging holes\u201d for years.\n\nBartomeu, facing a vote of no confidence, resigned last October and was eventually replaced by Laporta in March. Laporta has a good relationship with Messi and his family. He was Barca\u2019s president when Messi made his first-team debut and when he signed his first professional contract with the club.\n\nSources told ESPN in April that Laporta was working on a contract renewal for Messi that included the option of playing in Major League Soccer before returning to Barcelona.\n\nIn public and in private, Laporta had always maintained that he was \u201cconvinced\u201d he could persuade Messi to stay. The club have already made a series of signings this summer, bringing in Sergio Aguero, Memphis Depay and Eric Garcia, as well as recalling Emerson Royal.\n\nMessi first joined Barca\u2019s academy in 2000 and has gone on to play 778 games for the club, breaking Xavi Hernandez\u2019s appearance record last season. He has scored 672 goals, another club record, and has helped Barca win, among other trophies, 10 La Liga titles and the Champions League on four occasions.",

          "text": "The Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, on Wednesday, signed four bills into law including those that will pave way for the implementation of legislative and judiciary autonomy respectively.\n\nThe four bills signed into law by the Governor were the State Legislative Funds Management Law, Plateau State Judiciary Funds Management Law, Plateau State Property and Land Use Charge Law and the Plateau Geographic Services Law.\n\nA statement signed by the Governor\u2019s Director of Press and Public Affairs, Macham Makut, Confirmed the signing of the four new bills in Jos on Wednesday\n\nThe statement said, \u201cPlateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong on Wednesday 14th July 2021 signed four bills passed by the Plateau State House of Assembly into law at the New Government House, Little Rayfield Jos.\n\n\u201cWhile signing the bills into law, Governor Lalong said the new Funds Management Law for the Judiciary and Legislature will guide the implementation of the recently granted autonomy for the two arms of Government particularly in terms of financial management.\n\n\u201cAccording to Governor Lalong, the laws will guide the Judiciary and Legislature on the implementation of autonomy with regards to funds disbursement, approvals and expenditure in line with extant financial regulations.\n\n\u201cThese laws will further strengthen the two institutions by ensuring that funds are judiciously applied to the various needs of the Judiciary and Legislature. It will also assist the two arms to work within the framework of the MOU for the autonomy which was arrived at after thorough engagement between the three arms.\u201d\n\nOn the new Property and Land Use Charge and the Plateau Geographic Information Services (PLAGIS) laws, Governor Lalong said they are significant in improving land administration in the state as well as boosting revenue generation.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs we sign the law on autonomy, there is greater demand for resources which must be sourced locally. One of the things that will give us financial freedom as a state is for people to pay charges on their properties which hitherto have not been collected. That way, we can get resources to develop the state and provide services. This law will also enable us to enumerate all properties as well as name streets and number houses across the state\u201d.\n\nThe Governor said the new laws are not meant to burden the citizens but to enable each property owner to contribute to the development of the state. He said the PLAGIS law will make land administration more secure, flexible and reliable as well as ensure that all land data is captured, transformed and maintained in electronic format.\n\nAttorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Barr. Chrysanthus Ahmadu said the four laws are crucial for the good governance and economic development of the state particularly as they border on revenue generation and land management.\n\nHe said with the new Property and Land Charge Law, all owners of developed landed properties whether with titles, building plan approvals or not, will be required to comply with all stipulated charges. While failure will attract sanctions, compliance will attract incentives\n\nAhmadu said the law harmonises the collection of all land charges including tenement rates that local Ggvernments are empowered to enforce. This he said is captured in the new collection and sharing arrangement between the state and local governments done in line with the provisions of the Constitution that empowers such arrangement. He assured that all tenement rates will be centrally collected and shared in line with the formula agreed upon.\n\nHe also said the issues of delay, missing files, corruption and other leakages will be blocked once the implementation of the new PLAGIS law commences.\n\nThe PLAGIS law provides for a Director-General, Company Secretary and other supporting staff who will manage the agency.",

          "text": "\u2026direct institution to suspend the pre-screening exercise of shortlisted candidates\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu\n\nHouse of Representatives, Wednesday, fingered lopsidedness in the Nigerian Navy recruitment and directed the institution to suspend forthwith the forthcoming pre-screening exercise for the shortlisted candidates.\n\nThe House also asked the Navy to provide details of all recruitment from 2014 to date showing the geographical spread.\n\nThe parliament said the essence was to help strengthen the federal character law as well as to ensure better and more vigorous enforcement and implementation.\n\nIt added that every Nigerian deserved to be treated with dignity and rights irrespective of where they may be located physically in the country.\n\nAlso Read: Gunmen abduct traditional ruler in Kogi\n\nThe resolutions followed the consideration of a motion to \u201cinvestigate the process of the Nigerian Navy supplementary recruitment of 44 candidates for being against the principle character and in gross violation of section 14 of the 1999 constitution\u201d, moved under matters of urgent public importance at the plenary by Hon. Ben Rollands Igbakpa representing Ethiope federal constituency of Delta State.\n\nMoving the motion, Igbakpa noted that the Nigerian Navy Shortlisted 44 Candidates for the 2021/2022 recruitment exercise and have scheduled a pre-screening exercise for the candidates before their full induction into the Nigeria Naval Service.\n\nHe said that all the successful candidates that were to report for training in 2 batches at the Nigerian Navy Basic Training School Onne, Port Harcourt, Rivers State hailed from a particular part of the country which, he said negated the Federal Character principle of all-inclusiveness, equity and fair play.\n\nHe said: \u201cSection 14(3) of the 1999 Constitution provides that all appointments must reflect Federal Character.\n\n\u201cThe Section provides thus: \u201c4(3) The composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, and also to promote national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few states or a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that government or any of its agencies\u201d.\n\nThe lawmaker argued that the underlying purpose of the principle in a multi-ethnic society like Nigeria was to ensure equal participation of the various ethnic extractions in the governance of the country.\n\n\u201cThe Principle is also aimed at preventing the domination by one or some ethnic groups in the affairs of the country and the exclusion of other ethnic groups.\n\n\u201cIn practice, the principle appears to have been observed more in breach. Appointments and recruitments into the various ministries, departments and agencies both at the federal and state levels by successive administrations seems to be treated as a matter of political discretion, and those with the appointment and recruitment powers do not feel a legal duty to ensure an equitable spread of appointments and recruitments into the various government bodies.\n\n\u201cThis recruitment Supplementary list of 44 candidates since it became public knowledge has created a lot of tension, apprehension and discourse within the young and old from the deprived section.\n\n\u201cAdequate observance and implementation of the federal character principle will in no small measure allay fears of domination and denial by the ethnic minorities, and invariably foster national unity\u201d, Igbakpa said.\n\nAdopting the motion after securing favourable support of the majority of the members, the House mandated its committee on Navy to investigate the exercise and recommend appropriate measures to avoid similar constitutional violations in all future government recruitment.\n\nThe committee was given 12 weeks within which to conclude the assignment and report back to the House for further legislative action.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Ogun State House of Assembly has told traditional rulers in the state that it will not allow the use of human beings for rituals during the installation or burial of a monarch.\n\nThe Speaker of the Assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, said this on Wednesday while declaring open, a public hearing on the traditional council law of Ogun State 2021 at the Assembly Complex, Oke- Mosan, Abeokuta.\n\nOluomo stated that the lawmakers are not against traditional rites for installation and burial of Obas in the state, saying, however, that the use of humans for the purpose is barbaric and no longer allowed.\n\n\u201cNobody is saying they should not do traditional rites for installation and burial of Obas, but we are not going to support the usage of human being for rituals, as the world has moved away from that barbaric practice, which is even against the right to life and human dignity as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\u201d, the speaker declared.\n\nThe speaker clarified that the bill does not set out to specifically tinker with the burial rites as being speculated.\n\nRather, Oluomo explained that the legislation was initiated to correct many existing anomalies in the traditional institution, especially the conduct of installation without following due process including absence of declaration for some traditional stools, which, he said, has been creating difficulty on how to determine those entitled to the throne.\n\nThe speaker submitted that such \u201cunethical practice\u201d had made it easy for unqualified persons and strangers to lay unmerited claims to the stool, thereby creating distortions in historical records in recent times.\n\nOluomo mentioned that the Assembly would pass a bill that would put a stop to the attendance of political rallies by monarchs, thereby returning the institution to its pride of place and honour.\n\n\u201cWe have equally seen where a town or village is in existence (as orile) and the Baale is there, but in their developed area, where plots of land were sold to strangers to erect residential structure, such strangers were later allotted a traditional stool illegally, instead of promoting the existing Baale to the status of a coronet Oba. It has been the new norm of short-changing the original inhabitants of the area in the selection of monarchs to the advantage of strangers which must stop.\n\n\u201cThese are part of the things we are trying to correct and if you look at the number of petitions before the House and litigations going on in the various courts of law in the State, over 70% of such court cases are based on Obaship issues because of the lacuna and errors of application of the existing traditional council laws\u201d, the speaker stated.\n\nIn their contributions, other stakeholders including the representatives of Egba Traditional Council and Towulade of Akinale Kingdom, Oba Olufemi Ogunleye; National Secretary, Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, Comrade Yinka Folarin; Chief Imam of Gbagura, Prof. Kamaldeen Balogun; harped on the essence of peaceful co-existence among religious groups and commended the Assembly on the proposed bill with an assurance of conveying their positions through memoranda in due course.\n\nAlso, the representatives of the traditional worshipers\u2019 group, Fagbemi Ifakorede from Ota and the State Secretary of Ifa worshippers, Faniyi Awoyemi, noted that the traditional belief remained essential in the running of traditional institution, stating that monarchs were to be buried in line with the traditions and customs of their people.",

          "text": "Agency Reporter\n\nA Federal High Court, Abuja, on Wednesday, rejected the request by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to play video evidence in the ongoing trial of Andrew Yakubu, former Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nJustice Ahmed Mohammed, in a ruling, dismissed the application on the grounds that Yakubu was not the maker of the exhibits and as such, he could not be cross-examined based on those documents.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Justice Mohammed had, on June 30, fixed today for ruling on the anti-corruption agency\u2019s application.\n\nThe agency\u2019s lawyer, Farouk Abdullah, had sought an order of the court to play video documents which were tendered while taking the evidence of the sixth prosecution witness (PW6) on Oct. 17, 2018, and admitted in evidence by the court in cross-examining Yakubu, who was in the witness box as the first defence witness (DW1).\n\nThe court had marked the documents tendered as Exhibits \u201cM,\u201d \u201cN\u201d and \u201cN1.\u201d\n\nWhile Exhibits \u201cM\u201d and \u201cN\u201d were compact discs, Exhibit \u201cN1\u201d was a memory card.\n\nHowever, Counsel to the defendant, Ahmed Raji, SAN, opposed the EFCC\u2019s application.\n\nRaji had argued that Yakubu was not a maker of the exhibits which in the eyes of law were documented.\n\n\u201cThis ought to have been done through the witness who produced the document (PW6) and who is the maker and who tendered exhibits in them,\u201d he had said.\n\nThe senior lawyer also argued that allowing such application would be going contrary to \u201cthe directives of the Court of Appeal as to what is to be done in the suit.\u201d\n\nThe EFCC lawyer also disagreed with Raji.\n\nAbdullah had enjoined the court to look at the provisions of the Evidence Act as to whether a counsel in a trial has a right to make use of exhibits already before the court at any stage of proceedings in determining an issue, particularly in cross-examination.\n\nHe submitted that an exhibit already before a court could be used to either establish a fact or dispel a fact at any stage of a proceeding.\n\n\u201cIt is a right that can be enjoyed by both prosecution and defence.\n\n\u201cWe urge my lord to so hold and answer this in affirmative,\u201d he had said.\n\nThe Judge, however, disagreed with the EFCC in his ruling.\n\nJustice Mohammed also deferred the agency\u2019s fresh application to recall two prosecution witnesses (PWs) for a re-examination pending when Yakubu\u2019s cross-examination is completed.\n\nAbdullah had applied for a recall of two of the agency\u2019s PWs in the trial following the court\u2019s rejection of his request to play the video evidence.\n\nBut Raji opposed the prayer, arguing that since the EFCC had called all its witnesses and closed its case, \u201crecalling those witnesses when the defendant had already opened his defence and he is in the witness box will only interrupt the proceeding.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that allowing the prayer would not be doing justice to the defendant who had been in the witness box for over a year.\n\nHe urged the court to defer the anti-graft commission\u2019s application until his client\u2019s cross-examination is completed.\n\nRuling, the judge noted that Yakubu, who had been in the witness box as DW1 (first defence witness) since July 8, 2020, had already given his evidence before the court.\n\nMohammed held that it would be unfair to keep the defendant in the witness box for over a year and grant such prayer when the cross-examination was yet to be completed.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the application to recall two witnesses is defer until the DW1 cross-examination is completed,\u201d he ruled.\n\nAbdullah then applied for a short adjournment to enable him to produce some documents which would be relevant in cross-examining Yakubu.\n\nRaji described the application as \u201ca deliberate attempt to prolong the proceeding for reason known to the prosecution.\u201d\n\nHe said in order to delay processing, the EFCC lawyer had been coming up with one application or another.\n\n\u201cMy lord, I want it to be on record because if a defence counsel does this, especially senior lawyers, the same song will be \u2018oh, they don\u2019t allow criminal trials to move.\n\n\u201cMy lord, a diligent prosecution would have come with everything,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRaji, who said the application for adjournment was lacking in merit, urged the court to refuse it.\n\n\u201cIt is against the spirit of justice and Administration of Criminal Justice Act),\u201d he said.\n\nThe judge said though the court was not inclined to granting the plea considering the time the exercise had taken, he adjourned the case until July 29 for the continuation of the cross examination of Yakubu.\n\nNAN reports that the anti-graft agency had, in 2017, raided the residence of the ex-NNPC boss in Kaduna and found 9, 772, 800 dollars and 74, 000 pounds (9.7 million dollars and 74, 000 pounds) in a safe.\n\nYakubu was, however, arraigned on March 16, 2017, on six counts but the trial court struck out counts five and six.\n\nThe Court of Appeal also ordered the former GMD to defend only counts three and four which bordered on failure to make full disclosure of assets, receiving cash without going through a financial institution.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has said Nigerians should congratulate themselves for remaining one despite ongoing challenges that could have torn us apart.\n\nA statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, said Buhari stated this when he received the report of the National Security Summit held on May 26, 2021by the House of Representatives. The report was submitted by a team of House members led by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the President urged leaders to respect the wishes of people and allow them \u201cto choose who they like as their leaders, irrespective of political party or religion.\u201d\n\nHe also restated his determination to serve the country to the best of his ability, recalling his visits to the 36 states during the campaign for 2019 elections.\n\n\u201cThe number of people that turned out to see me, some waiting for 10 hours in the sun, was more than anyone could buy, or force. They just wanted to see who this Buhari was. People wonder why Nigerians accept me, despite not being rich. I wonder, too. I felt I just have to serve Nigeria and Nigerians to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nCommending the 9th National Assembly for its cooperation with the executive, he said he tried very hard to get the 8th Assembly to do same for the sake of the country, \u201cand I didn\u2019t succeed much. But time has proved me right.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila thanked the President for endorsing the security summit conducted by the House, adding: \u201cYou were part of it from the beginning, and you were to have declared it open, if not for the exigencies of duty.\u201d\n\nHe said the summit became imperative after lawmakers were bombarded daily by their constituents on the security challenges facing the country, \u201cand motions after motions were moved by lawmakers.\u201d\n\nA committee of 50 lawmakers, across party, religious and ethnic lines, he said, was set up to plan the summit.\n\nGbajabiamila said the report was a product of inputs by traditional rulers, scholars, independent thinkers, and security chiefs, noting that it contains seven recommendations that require legislative action, and about 19 that would be implemented by the executive.\n\nSpeaking to State House Correspondents after the event, the speaker said the report suggested the creation of regional development commissions for all regions of the country and also proffered resolutions to military complexities.\n\n\u201cThere are several recommendations; we\u2019ve agreed to establish zonal commissions in all the zones like the North East Development Commission. We\u2019ll have the South West, South-South, South East, North West, and that goes a long way in resolving issues, regional and zonal issues,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo, Sunday Ani, Chukwudi Nweje and Doris Obinna\n\nNigerians have told the National Assembly to throw out the controversial Nigerian Press Council (NPC) and the Nigeria Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Acts amendment in its entirety.\n\nThis followed the disclosure by its sponsor, Olusegun Odebunmi, yesterday, that legislative process on it has been suspended.\n\nThe federal lawmaker from Oyo State, said on a live television programme, that he initiated the suspension to allow for consultation with stakeholders in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe have suspended the process for more consultation to happen on it. They demanded for a lot of time and I said \u2018no problem, we have given you; even if you spend three, four to five weeks\u2019. So far, more consultations from critical stakeholders, and many people have been submitting their memoranda to the National Assembly even within the industry.\u201d\n\nOdebunmi said his intention is not to gag the press, saying he recognises the lapses in the practice of journalism in Nigeria, and that the amendments are aimed at fixing those problems.\n\n\u201cMy intention is not to gag the press, and unless all the practitioners can say all is well with the industry, to the best of my knowledge I know all is not well, and I know the National Assembly has the power to look into the existing Act. All is not well with the NPC agency, it is an agency of government, and you\u2019re expecting something to be given back to the society, but until now nothing has been coming from the agency.\u201d\n\nReacting, National President of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Chris Isiguzo, told Daily Sun that the body was not interested in the suspension but its outright cancellation.\n\n\u201cWe do not support a suspension. What we want as a body is for the bill to be completely thrown away, and if a new bill is to be made, all the relevant stakeholders must be carried along from inception.\u201d\n\nFormer national chairman of the defunct Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), Chekwas Okorie also called for the abolition of the bills.\n\n\u201cIt should be dropped completely because whatever was the intention for proposing the bill is definitely in very bad taste and has been rejected not just by the media practitioners, but Nigerians. The National Assembly should withdraw it completely without waiting for it to be rejected.\u201d\n\nNational President, Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Mustapha Isa, said the National Assembly, in the first instance, has no right to amend a bill being challenged in the Supreme Court and insisted that suspension is not enough.\n\n\u201cWhat we want is outright dropping of the bill, not suspension. If they want to do another one, let them start by first having a meeting with stakeholders, so that we would collectively decide on what should be in the bill. You don\u2019t first put such a bill together before you start discussing with stakeholders. If you mean, before you put a bill together, ensure that you meet with us and not after.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the bill is anti-people and should be dropped completely.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Sun, spokesperson of the party, Kola Ologbodiyan, said it did not come as a surprise that the Senate suspended further deliberations on the bill.\n\n\u201cIt portends danger for our collective freedom of speech and our constitutionally guaranteed access to information. It is very relieving that the Senate has suspended further deliberations on the satanic Bill, but we want it to be dropped permanently.\u201d\n\nPresident of the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF), Yerima Shettima, commended the legislators for the suspension but demanded it should be thrown away because it is evil.\n\n\u201cWe should be making progress and doing the things that other developed nations are doing. We cannot go back to the analogue era when the world is going digital. We are in a global community. So, I commend them because they did well.\u201d\n\nFormer governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, praised the Senate for suspending the bill but said they should move a step further to drop it completely.\n\n\u201cWe are suffering from all kinds of problems so much that to silence us or beat us and not allow us to cry is worsening our situation. So, the suspension is a good thing, but they should think of dropping it entirely.\u201d\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Alex Ogbonna, said the suspension is to enable them gather more public opinion about the bill to know the next line of action. \u201cSo, what they did is in order. I commend them for that.\u201d\n\nPublicity Secretary,Middle Belt Forum, Dogo Isuwa, said instead of rejoicing over the suspension, the media should first identify those areas in the Bill that are not making sense and enlighten Nigerians on the negative effects of those clauses, otherwise the National Assembly could still reintroduce the bill and pass into law in future.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, welcomed the suspension.\n\n\u201cThough the Senate said the bill is intended to regulate the media, the real intention is to gag the media. Afenifere believes in the freedom of expression, especially in a way that reflects the right of people to express their mind, but not in a scandalous or libelous manner. The bill should not have come up in the first place because there are various bodies that regulate the media.\u201d\n\nFormer chairman, Lagos NUJ chairman, Dr. Quasim Akinreti, said the voice of reason has prevailed with the suspension.\n\n\u201cThe initiator of that Bill jumped the gun without consulting stakeholders. For me, what the government is doing is not in the interest of the people.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe N15 trillion Infrastructure Company Limited (InfraCo), created by the federal government to bridge the nation\u2019s huge infrastructure gap is to take off in the third quarter of the year, the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has said.\n\nEmefiele spoke yesterday at an investors\u2019 webinar designed to showcase the investment opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s privatisation and economic reforms programmes, organised by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) in collaboration with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX).\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo also said at the event that although the government\u2019s economic reforms had paid off in telecommunications, pension and maritime sectors, the current administration was making efforts to address the challenges in the power sector privatisation.\n\nInvestors in the N15 trillion InfraCo include the CBN, Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and Africa Finance Corporation (AFC).\n\nIn his goodwill message at the webinar, Emefiele said the federal government had approved KPMG as the financial adviser to InfraCo, adding that the firm is expected to commence operations in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nHe stated that for Nigeria to attain meaningful growth, there must be huge investments in key sectors of the economy, including infrastructure such as rail and power, among others.\n\nAccording to him, InfraCo has generated huge interest in deploying private capital to for infrastructure, adding that the approval of the vice president has been secured to appoint KPMG as transaction advisers.\n\nEmefiele stated that over the past 18 months, the COVID-19 pandemic and developments in the global crude oil market had created negatively affected not only the global economy but also the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor Nigeria, we witnessed a drop in foreign exchange earnings, government revenues along with supply chain disruptions which ultimately led to the economy falling into a recession during the third quarter of 2020. Significant interventions by the monetary and fiscal authorities in key sectors of our economy such as in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors eventually helped and led to the rebound of growth during the fourth quarter of 2020 as gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.11 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe sustenance of these measures have also helped to support growth of 0.51 per cent during the first quarter of 2021. Nonetheless, we consider this growth as fragile and therefore seek the support of those of us here at this webinar to continue to work with us to grow our economy.\u201d\n\nHe stated that in June 2021, investments in the Importers and Exporters (I&E) window stood at over N3 trillion at an average rate of N412 to the dollar, adding that this meant that on an average working day of 20 working days, close to $150 million was posted in that market.\n\nIn their goodwill messages, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, said Nigeria had huge gas investment potential waiting to be exploited.\n\nShe stated that despite the numerous challenges confronting the country, it still remains the premium investment destination in Africa.\n\nAhmed said the COVID-19 pandemic had provided greater need for the federal government to forge a more robust partnership with the private sector.\n\nIn his keynote address, Osinbajo said the investors\u2019 webinar was organised to showcase investment opportunities arising from Nigerians economic reforms and privatisation activities.\n\nHe said: \u201d I think that many who have observed the current Nigerian government would agree with me that an article of faith for this government is the importance of mobilising private capital and participation for improving efficiency and driving economic growth and this really explains why we have this collaboration today between the Bureau of Public Enterprises (which you know is in charge of our sectoral reform programme) with the Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission and the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX) to host this seminar as an important platform drawing attention to investment opportunities to both our local and foreign friends and collaborators.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, privatising utilities of the size of the former PHCN simply calls for deeper intentional consideration of the right models and the right type of investors and also looking at funding for these investors over an extended period of time.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the challenges that we have seen, but I think that it\u2019s an excellent lesson and there is so much that we are learning in approaching privatisation, especially our utilities, going forward,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his welcome, address, the BPE Director-General, Mr. Alex Okoh, said the BPE had listed over 36 assets for sale and giving them out to concessionaires under its 2021 work plan.\n\nHe stated that about N500 billion is expected to be contributed into the federal government coffers from the privatisation proceeds this year.\n\nAccording to him, 234 public assets have been sold in the last 32 years while N1 trillion was generated by the agency.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Says 542,576 Nigerians have completed online voter registration\n\nChuks Okocha\n\n\n\nThe Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, yesterday expressed the determination of the commission to deepen democracy through the use of technology.\n\nHe also put the number of Nigerians who have completed online voters\u2019 pre-registration at 542,576.\n\nYakubu, at a meeting yesterday in Abuja with the resident electoral commissioners, said: \u201cI would like to reassure Nigerians that the commission will continue to spare no effort in deepening the use of technology to ensure electoral transparency and credibility.\u201d\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of the clamour for the inclusion of electronic transmission of election results in the 2010 Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, amidst efforts by the leadership of the National Assembly to delete the provision from the bill.\n\nYakubu said the voters\u2019 register remained at the heart of any credible election.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are working hard to ensure that just as we had a smooth take-off of the online pre-registration, the commencement of the physical registration will similarly be hitch-free.\u201d\n\nHe said the first quarter of the physical registration would commence between June 28 and September 30, while the second quarter of the exercise will start October 4 to December 30.\n\nAlso, the third quarter of the physical registration will start from January 3, 2022, to April 1, 2022, and the fourth quarter will kick off on April 11 to June 30, 2022.\n\nGiving update of the exercise, Yakubu said two weeks since the exercise began, a total of 542,576 Nigerians have completed the online pre-registration.\n\nAccording to him, out of this figure, 456,909 are fresh registrants while 85,667 have applied for voter transfer, replacement of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and update of voter information record among others.\n\nHe added that the commission is able to provide Nigerians with information on the distribution of registrants across the states and by age, occupation, gender and disability.\n\n\u201cOut of 542,576 online registrants so far, 356,777 (or 66 per cent) are young people between the ages of 18 and 34 years.\n\n\u201cThis is followed by 134,719 middle-aged registrants who fall between 35 and 49 years. The third category is elderly persons aged between 50 and 69 years of which 44,896 Nigerians have registered. Interestingly, some 6,184 senior citizens (aged 70 years and above) have taken advantage of the new online opportunity to register,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn the occupational distribution of registrants, the INEC chairman said: \u201c156,446 are students; 38,217 artisans; 24,421 farmers and fishermen; 150,145 businessmen and traders; 35,831 employed as civil and public servants and 8,334 housewives.\n\n\u201cThe remaining 129,182 registrants did not specify their occupations. On gender, 321,781 are males while 220,795 are females. In our effort to serve all Nigerians better, the commission has requested registrants to indicate their disability (if any).\u201d\n\nHe explained that the essence of this will enable INEC to efficiently deploy assistive voting devices such as Braille ballot guide and magnifying glasses for persons with special needs at polling units on election day.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe have data for 6,558 registrants who have clearly indicated their type of disability.\u201d\n\nYakubu said a detailed information, including state and occupational distribution, had been uploaded on the commission\u2019s website and social media platforms, while the commission shall also continue to provide the weekly updates throughout the duration of the CVR exercise.\n\nAccording to him, the commission is aware that not all Nigerians have access to computers, smart phones or internet connectivity to register online.\n\n\u201cWe have repeatedly assured every eligible registrant that there will also be an opportunity for physical or in-person registration at designated centres. Even the online registrants will have to complete their registration physically at those centres.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to activate some 2,673 centres to which we intend to deploy 5,346 officials for in-person registration,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By John Shiklam\n\nA total of 222 people have been killed while 774 others have been kidnapped by bandits in Kaduna state in the past three months.\n\nThis was contained in the second quarter security report, presented to Governor Nasir El-Rufai by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan on Tuesday at the Government House Kaduna.\n\nAruwan said the report covers the period between April 1 to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe report showed a slide reduction in the number of deaths and the number of people abducted.\n\nIn the first quarter report, present in April, a total of 323 persons were killed while 949 others were kidnapped by bandits across Kaduna State.\n\nAruwan also disclosed that a total of 8,553 heads of cattle were rustled in the period under review with most stolen from the Kaduna Central Senatorial District, which accounted for around\n\n5,715 stolen cattle.\n\nAruwan said the 222 deaths were caused by banditry attacks, communal clashes and reprisals across the state.\n\nAccording to him, 159 of the deaths, were recorded in Kaduna Central Senatorial District while Southern Kaduna Senatorial District and Northern Senatorial District recorded 54 and nine deaths respectively.\n\nThe commissioner said of the 774 people kidnapped, Kaduna Central Senatorial\n\nDistrict topped the list with 555 people abducted.\n\nBirnin Gwari, Chikun, Kajuru, Giwa and Igabi LGAs, where there are rampant cases of killings and kidnappings are in the Kaduna Central senatorial zone.\n\nHe said, \u201cSouthern Kaduna Senatorial District recorded 164 kidnapped persons, with Kachia LGA reporting the highest number of 111.\n\n\u201cThe Northern Senatorial District recorded 55 kidnapped persons, with 37 of these from Zaria LGA.\n\n\u201cIn total, 239 women, and 32 minors were kidnapped in the second quarter across the state\u201d.\n\nThe commissioner also disclosed that 20 persons were reported to have been raped across the state during the period, adding that a total of 266 were injured as a result of banditry, violent attacks, reprisals and communal clashes.\n\nAruwan also raised the alarm over looming food insecurity, threat to education and attack on health facilities in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cBanditry has hampered farming activities in the frontline areas of the state.\n\n\u201cBandits attack and abduct farmers working on or on their way to their fields. Several farmers have similarly been killed.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, bandits have begun to extract protection levies from some communities in return for permission to cultivate their fields.\n\n\u201cMany farmers in these areas, fearing for their lives and safety, have abandoned their\n\nfields altogether.\n\n\u201cThis has already begun to affect crop yields, and the threat of food insecurity looms large.\u201d\n\nHe said the most affected communities are in the frontline Local Government\n\nAreas of Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Giwa, Zaria, Chikun, Kauru, Kajuru, Kachia,\n\nKagarko, Zangon Kataf, Jema\u2019a and Sanga.\u201d\n\nAruwan said attacks on some schools and mass abduction of students portends dire consequences for education in the state.\n\nHe said hospitals and other health facilities in frontline locations are equally under grave threat by armed bandits.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cBanditry has led to the near-total collapse of the local economy in frontline areas, which is mainly sustained by crop and livestock farming. \u201cThe activities of bandits in these areas have dispossessed residents of their foremost means of sustenance and disrupted the\n\noperation of the usually dynamic weekly markets.\n\n\u201cBesides the rustling of cattle, the previously highlighted targeting of farmers by armed bandits has generally eroded the economic viability of rural communities, in addition to precipitating a food crisis.\n\n\u201cThis has translated to losses running into billions of naira from the rural economy.\u201d\n\nHe said the State government\u2019s strategies to address the security challenges were being sustained.\n\nThe commissioner decried the politicization of insecurity saying \u201cpolitical mappings and strategies are now frequently being built around the unfortunate scenarios of insecurity, while real people and real communities suffer\n\ndevastation at the hands of sheer criminals.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cEthnic and religious narratives are also being built around banditry, to the further complication of security management.\n\n\u201cToo often, attacks by bandits are portrayed to the public by some quarters as ethnically or religiously motivated.\n\nSuch groups manipulate religious, ethnic and political sensitivities for their own advantage, simply to advance a cause inimical to peace and stability of the state.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks after receiving the reports, Governor Nasir El-Rufai said an unconventional approach is required to enable the state government protect its citizens.\n\nA Government House statement issued after the presentation of the report, quoted the governor as\n\ncalling on the federal government to empower the state government to make up for the manpower deficit in the security sector.\n\n\u201cThe state government must be empowered and supported by the federal government to make up the manpower deficit in the security sector\u201d, the statement quoted the governor.\n\nAccording to him, \u201ccitizens who have been affected by crime and insecurity are not interested in the distinctions between the federal and state governments in terms of their powers over security.\n\n\u2018\u2019As a state government, we have also seen at close quarters how the federal security agencies are limited by manpower deficits.\n\n\u201cThere are simply not enough boots on the ground to have credible deployments in most places to protect communities, deter crime and enforce law and order.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2019an unconventional approach is required to enable us better to protect our communities and we are engaging with the federal government and the leadership of the security agencies on this.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says people should be free to choose leaders of their choice irrespective of party, religion\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has disclosed that Nigeria is lucky to have remained as one indivisible entity notwithstanding the myriad of problems incuding security challenges facing the nation.\n\nThis is just as he also canvassed for the citizens right to choose a leader of their choice at elections irrespective of party affiliation or religion.\n\nThe President made this disclosure Tuesday at the State House, Abuja while receiving the report of the National Security Summit of the House of Representatives from the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nPresident Buhari declared, \u201cwe are a lucky country and should congratulate ourselves, despite challenges that could have torn us apart.\u201d\n\nHe urged leaders to respect the people, from the lowest to the highest, \u201cso that it becomes a duty to them (the people) to pay back to the leadership.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, repect for the people should come in allowing them \u201cto choose who they like as their leaders, irrespective of political party or religion.\u201d\n\nDescribing the event as \u201ca remarkable occasion,\u201d President Buhari restated his determination to serve the country to the best of his ability, recalling his visits to the 36 States during the campaign for 2019 elections.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number of people that turned out to see me, some waiting for 10 hours in the sun, was more than anyone could buy, or force. They just wanted to see who this Buhari was. People wonder why Nigerians accept me, despite not being rich. I wonder, too. I felt I just have to serve Nigeria and Nigerians to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nCommending the Ninth National Assembly for its cooperation with the Executive, the President said he tried very hard to get the Eighth Assembly to do same for the sake of the country, \u201cand I didn\u2019t succeed much, but time has proved me right.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Gbajabiamila thanked the President for endorsing the security summit conducted by the House, adding: \u201cYou were part of it from the very beginning, and you were to have declared it open, if not for the exigencies of duty.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker said the summit became imperative after lawmakers were bombarded daily by their constituents on the security challenges facing the country, \u201cand motions after motions were moved by the lawmakers.\u201d\n\nA committee of 50 lawmakers, across party, religious and ethnic lines, he said, was set up to plan the summit, \u201cand Mr President was very eager and enthusiastic about it, showing the importance you place on security.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila said the report was a product of inputs by traditional rulers, scholars, independent thinkers, and security chiefs, noting that it contains seven recommendations that require legislative action, and about 19 that will be implemented by the Executive.\n\n\u201cThank you Mr President for what you have done so far to douse tension and for Nigeria to remain one. It\u2019s about all of us, not just the Executive, the legislature or the judiciary. And Nigeria will work, by the grace of God\u201d, the Speaker further said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

So it remains 15 copies with me, if you still have interest in it, message me. Once you get one, the man promised to give you 15 marks,\u201d the course representative told the students.\n\n\u201cWe were to write (sic) the PSB 418 test. But the department does not have papers to print the test sheets. So, we were asked to contribute N20 each to enable the department to buy a pack of paper which costs N2,500,\u201d another student shared.\n\n\u201cI bought two handouts this semester. I have three more to buy. The lecturers even made it compulsory. Two handouts I bought this semester; one of the lecturers said we should go and read till we meet during our examination. He did not teach us anything. The same was for the other handout. We only did presentations,\u201d a student told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cIt was not like this in the past. Between 2015 and 2019, the sale of handouts and textbooks was not allowed. But things have gone upside down in Ondo State; workers are owed salaries, pensions are not forthcoming. University workers have also not been paid in the last six months. The students have to bear the brunt. The university is handicapped; it is when salaries are regular that you can maintain standards and give rules to your lecturers. We don\u2019t have a governor, unfortunately,\u201d a university worker said.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the university is nearing the second-semester examination and more lecturers are churning out textbooks and handouts to rake in money from many of the struggling students.",

          "text": "Some students of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, Ondo State, have cried out over the unending expensive handouts they are forced to buy from lecturers every semester.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that buying of handouts attracts good marks in some of the courses so students, therefore, pay through their nose to obtain them.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that it has been six months since the AAUA lecturers were paid by the Ondo State Government \u2013 a situation which has forced many of them to turn students into cash cows and impose irrelevant handouts on them.\n\nSome of the students who spoke with SaharaReporters on Tuesday confirmed that some of the lecturers sell handouts to them, and ask them to read, adding that that was the end of the course for the semester.\n\nOther students pointed out that the university authorities had deliberately refused to wade in because the lecturers also complained that they have to find a means of survival.\n\nSaharaReporters obtained the voice note of the Faculty of Social and Management Sciences (FSS) course representative asking students to buy the handout for N1, 500 and get 15 marks as promised by the lecturer.\n\nHe did not mention the name of the lecturer.\n\n\u201cHello, so please concerning the FSS textbook; so far, it is 50 copies they gave our department and so far, 35 people have booked their own and got their own copies. So it remains 15 copies with me, if you still have interest in it, message me. Once you get one, the man promised to give you 15 marks,\u201d the course representative told the students.\n\n\u201cWe were to write (sic) the PSB 418 test. But the department does not have papers to print the test sheets. So, we were asked to contribute N20 each to enable the department to buy a pack of paper which costs N2,500,\u201d another student shared.\n\n\u201cI bought two handouts this semester. I have three more to buy. The lecturers even made it compulsory. Two handouts I bought this semester; one of the lecturers said we should go and read till we meet during our examination. He did not teach us anything. The same was for the other handout. We only did presentations,\u201d a student told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cIt was not like this in the past. Between 2015 and 2019, the sale of handouts and textbooks was not allowed. But things have gone upside down in Ondo State; workers are owed salaries, pensions are not forthcoming. University workers have also not been paid in the last six months. The students have to bear the brunt. The university is handicapped; it is when salaries are regular that you can maintain standards and give rules to your lecturers. We don\u2019t have a governor, unfortunately,\u201d a university worker said.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the university is nearing the second-semester examination and more lecturers are churning out textbooks and handouts to rake in money from many of the struggling students.",

This partnership will enable Somalians to enjoy both global and local cashless payment opportunities.\n\n\u201cFor Visa to come to Somalia, it means that we are on the right path of growth and progress. We will continue to make partnerships and bring convenient and innovative financial solutions to the people,\u201d said Mahat Mohamed, the CEO of IBS Bank.\n\nSomalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headways in reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nIn 2014, 47 years after the Automated Teller Machine was invented and 25 years after it was introduced in Nigeria and Kenya, Salaam Bank installed the first-ever ATM in Somalia in Mogadishu, the capital state. The ATM was to facilitate cash withdrawals (dollars) for only diaspora returnees and foreigners.\n\nThen a year later in June 2015, MasterCard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market in partnership with Premier Bank and issued 5,000 debit cards to be used by Premier Bank account holders, for domestic transactions.\n\n\u201cNew players are coming on board now. Two years ago, we had about five licensed banks, and today we are talking of 13 licensed commercial banks.

          "text": "With cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, central banks across the world have been working towards developing digital currencies of their own.\n\nOnly two countries have officially launched digital fiat currency. The Bahamas became the first in 2020 followed by China, which began issuing its digital yuan about three months ago.\n\nOther countries where trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden, and South Korea. In Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Morocco, and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nNigeria and Ghana plan to pilot an official digital currency (e-naira and e-cedi respectively) later this year.\n\nWhat are CBDCs and how do they work?\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. Instead of paper money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government.\n\nCBDCs are similar to existing cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc) in the sense that both are transferred electronically and blockchain-based. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology.\n\nHowever, one of the major differences is that while cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralised (that is, not regulated), digital fiat currencies are deployed on centralised and private blockchain networks that are supervised by a central bank.\n\nThe digital fiat currency will be issued by the banking regulator to banks, which in turn will make it available to their customers. Every bank will be connected to the government-run blockchain system. Through the system, banks can aggregate transaction data that will be relayed to the central bank.\n\nWhether traditional bank accounts will work for a digital naira, for instance, is unknown. Users may be required to open special accounts similar to mobile money wallets currently being used for cryptocurrencies, which will enable seamless transactions.\n\nThere is also a difference in currency value and volatility. An e-naira, for instance, will be pegged to the paper naira at \u20a61 : \u20a61. Compared to the extreme volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are relatively stable. With their values pegged, a digital currency will fall and rise in line with general swings in the value of the national currency.\n\nOn paper, the transition to digital currency is an exciting prospect and should help reduce cash dominance but it won\u2019t be an easy one, especially in African countries. This is down to the same challenges that have slowed down the full adoption of digital technologies.\n\nIn Nigeria, for instance, smartphone penetration remains low, estimated at less than 20% of the population in 2019 compared to almost 60% in China, according to a Newzoo report.\n\nThe CBN and banks will have to consider feature phone users and make transacting with the digital naira accessible via USSD codes, which would also help advance financial inclusion goals.\n\nThere are also cybersecurity risks to be taken into account as well as internet penetration.\n\nMeanwhile, it remains to be seen if the launch of digital currencies will see regulators attempt to phase out cryptos entirely as China has done.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Several studies have confirmed the correlation between how a space looks and how a person lives or works. With changes in how we view our environment, there is now an increasing demand to put much thought into space designs. But this has not always been the case.\n\nPitching space designs, in Africa for instance, is more commonplace today than it was a decade ago, with more people now interested in how their spaces look. Interestingly, we are talking about a $115 billion industry projected to hit $121 billion by the end of 2021. And it gets more exciting with the various options available with innovation.\n\nThe acceptance of space design in Nigeria coincided with the coming of interior design startups like Spazio Ideale \u2014 an Italian expression loosely translated as \u2018Ideal Space\u2019.\n\nTomi Bamgbelu, Founder and Creative Director of Spazio Ideale, has always had a flair for architecture and computers. She studied computer science for her first degree, with a masters in interior design coming after as she followed her love for designing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nIn what started as a passion, she soon decided to turn interior designing into a business. Her entrepreneurship journey started by chance.\n\nThe rise of Spazio Ideale\n\nAfter her postgraduate studies in Italy in 2014 and a stint in Ghana, she couldn\u2019t find any suitable design company to join when she returned to Nigeria. They all didn\u2019t fit into the designs she liked, among other concerns. So she started telling people about what she does.\n\n\u201cUsually, when you go to a design school, you have to create a design portfolio of your work. And when I got back, I distributed it to a few people to see. They got to see what I love to do and how I love to create.\u201d\n\nAnd she eventually convinced some of the people in her circle to patronise her.\n\nIn June 2015, she did her first project, a living space, for a friend. The startup has since grown in its scope of coverage and is currently more of a commercial space design company.\n\nProud of the progress the company has made so far, Bamgbelu reveals that it has done more than 50 projects cutting across residential, commercial, hospitality, and school facilities.\n\nHowever, most of them are in commercial spaces \u2014 over 30 clients \u2014 particularly the tech space. With most projects gotten from referrals, the startup touts itself as the first in the tech space, boasting of designing office spaces for popular startups in Nigeria.\n\nNotable mentions include Kuda Bank, Softcom, Heritage Bank, Paystack, Reliance HMO, uLesson, Techpoint Africa, and Max.ng.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterior photos of ISN Medicals at Ilupeju, Lagos. Designed by Spazio Ideale. Source: Supplied\n\nBamgbelu relives with fondness how the team came up with Paystack\u2019s iconic workspace design.\n\n\u201cIn our initial conversation with Paystack, we tried to understand how they are and what they do, and we realised that they have a friendly organisation, although small then, but they were like a family and a fun environment to work in. And we designed the space to reflect this.\u201d\n\nA customer-centric approach\n\nBetween initial contact to delivery, there are five steps the team goes through to satisfy a client \u2014 this is called the Spazio Way. First, a 60-minute meeting, then a conceptual design, detail, execution, and after-sales care.\n\nHowever, the delivery time depends on the scope of the project.\n\nAlthough Bamgbelu personally handled the startup\u2019s first set of projects, the founder\u2019s current responsibility is to provide overall creative direction from design to execution.\n\nThis is easy because she has a reliable team of 14 highly skilled individuals consisting of interior designers, architects, civil engineers, and building technologists. This fills her with confidence as they all work together to deliver on every project.\n\nSpazio Ideale team. Source: Supplied\n\nThe startup also engages partners like muralists, furniture makers, and plumbers, among others. In essence, Spazio Ideale\u2019s work can sometimes require completely changing the entire structure of a space, from ceiling to floor.\n\nBamgbelu highlights how the team comes up with the design for any project.\n\n\u201cIt depends on a few things; we design based on what the client is trying to achieve. The first thing we ask is, why aren\u2019t you doing this yourself? Why do you need an interior designer to do it for you? That\u2019s the only way we can add value.\u201d\n\nBamgbelu gives her take on why people reach out to Spazio Ideale.\n\n\u201cFor some people, it\u2019s in trying to save cost because they don\u2019t know where to get the things they want. Others are looking for expertise because they have this idea in mind but don\u2019t know how to go about it. Some others are looking to improve employee experience or brand association.\n\n\u201cSo, every design is usually different, although they might have the same elements. Sometimes, it depends on the company\u2019s culture \u2014 fun or reserved, or the functional and aesthetic needs of the organisation.\u201d\n\nThe founder believes that the most challenging project in the past six months was creating uLesson\u2019s Abuja office with less than two months given for the design and implementation.\n\n\u201cWe did deliver it within two months. So, it was challenging to make sure that happened because of the size of the project, which is 1,000 square metres, and there were so many unique pieces.\u201d\n\nCost depends on a client\u2019s budget; however, quality is not compromised in the process. Bamgbelu is often encouraged because customers are satisfied that the projects are completed without them needing to step in after the initial discussions. And this makes the startup have repeat clients seeking a redesign or who\u2019ve either moved offices or opened new ones.\n\nIf anything, this has helped the company grow. Before 2019, the startup experienced a 50-70% revenue growth. Between 2019 and 2020, the revenue increased by 150% while working towards an equally successful 2021.\n\nThinking outside the box\n\nIn a space with other interior designing businesses like Space Finish, the founder believes Spazio Ideale stands out as it doesn\u2019t set out just to make a space look good.\n\nBesides excellent execution, there is conceptualising and designing. The team comes up with unique designs that blend perfectly into the client\u2019s company structure and aid proper communication and interaction while creating an unforgettable impression on visitors.\n\nTo explain Spazio Ideale\u2019s competitive edge, Bamgbelu speaks of how Spazio Ideale got the job to design Paystack\u2019s first office in 2016, a year after the payments company launched in 2015.\n\nAlthough uncommon at that time, the founder decided to do something different with the office space design.\n\n\u201cWhat you usually expect in a reception is to see the company logo, lights, probably made of acrylic or glass. Understanding Paystack\u2019s culture, we saw that these guys aren\u2019t rigid. So, their first point of contact, as people enter into the reception, should reflect them. And that is why we came up with that \u2018Welcome\u2019 wall where we wrote welcome in different languages.\u201d\n\nPaystack \u2018Welcome Wall\u2019. Designed by Spazio Ideale\n\nThis decision would create an unforgettable story in Paystack\u2019s history and influence the decision to invite Spazio Ideale to design its second office.\n\nBamgbelu relates how the wall made some foreigners who visited the office see them as welcoming and heartwarming people because they felt at home after seeing \u2018Welcome\u2019 in their languages.\n\nDespite similar success stories, the startup has had its challenges, many of which are peculiar to Nigeria.\n\nBamgbelu looks forward to a time when electricity and Internet, inflation, and talent development will no longer be a clog in the wheel of creative businesses seeking to remain competitive.\n\nOther problems that come with playing in the creative industry \u201cinclude access to good quality partners that help us achieve our projects. For example, it\u2019s difficult to access very good artisans and workmen. And because we pride ourselves on excellence, we sometimes have to redo things until they are right. But regardless of all these, we\u2019re clear on what we want to deliver to our clients.\u201d\n\nChanging seasons and what the future\u2019s like\n\nWhen campaigns for social distancing and working from home (WFH) became pronounced at the peak of the coronavirus in 2020 \u2014 with the idea of having a physical office often debated \u2014 Spazio Ideale had a relatively good run, although it lost a few clients.\n\nBamgbelu reiterated how the startup experienced a 150% revenue growth. One wonders what was there to do during a lockdown and office closures.\n\n\u201cAll the time we were working from home, we had designs to churn out. And the design phase takes time,\u201d she clarifies.\n\nSpazio Ideale Founder and Creative Director, Tomi Bamgbelu. Source: Supplied\n\nEssentially, interior designing is a highly creative business that is yet to be fully appreciated in this part of the world because of how little people know about its influence on living and working.\n\nBamgbelu explains it this way.\n\n\u201cOrganisations provide tools, and people tend to have tools that make them productive. The space where people work is a tool to make sure the organisation achieves its objectives. So, if the staff is happy with the space, it helps them make profit.\u201d\n\nHence, she recommends educating people and organisations to see its importance. Still, only interested people approach interior designers for consultation or design and execution.\n\nBamgbelu states that the concept of remote work does not threaten the growth of the business, especially in Nigeria, pointing out that the particular challenges associated with WFH \u2014 electricity and Internet \u2014 would only encourage companies to run a hybrid model.\n\nInterestingly, Spazio Ideale\u2019s client base is still made up of mostly commercial spaces.\n\n\u201cThe truth is organisations want to get their spaces up and running. Everybody is thinking past COVID-19. Yes, there\u2019s the work from home strategy, which we recommend. But we believe the office is not going away,\u201d she submits.\n\nThe startup plans to reach more African and international markets by Q4 2021. Even though there\u2019ve been projects from foreign organisations with offices in Nigeria, getting jobs from these companies for their offices outside Nigeria would be a major step forward.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s new appointment\n\nVerifyMe\u2019s VeriFind launch\n\nMobile app downloads skyrocket\n\nFlutterwave appoints Oluwabankole Falade as Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s new Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer, Oluwabankole Falade. Source: Supplied.\n\nThe story: Nigerian fintech unicorn, Flutterwave, has announced Oluwabankole Falade as its Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer. The University of Ibadan alumnus brings 18 years of experience in law, regulatory affairs, and government relations.\n\nBefore his appointment, he was the Director, Regulatory Affairs and Government Relations at IHS Towers. He has also held key leadership roles at MTN and Visa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is this important? The fintech space where Flutterwave operates is one of the most regulated sectors of Nigeria\u2019s tech industry. In the past, government policies have affected their operations, and Falade\u2019s appointment would go a long way to strengthen the relationship between the startup and the government.\n\nSetting the pace? With the Nigerian government frequently springing policy surprises on startups, we could see similar appointments to anticipate them and engage proactively with the government.\n\nFor more context: Flutterwave appoints Oluwabankole Falade as Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer.\n\nVerifyMe launches VeriFind\n\nEsigie Aguele, CEO, VerifyMe. Source: Supplied\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had to fill out a form when opening a bank account, then you\u2019ve provided your home address. Like me, you may have wondered why they bothered since they probably never verified the address.\n\nWell, VerifyMe Nigeria, an identity verification startup, wants to change that with its geotagging solution, VeriFind. Backed by a network of 13,000 agents across the country, the product is also Anti-Money Laundering Compliant.\n\nAccording to Esigie Aguele, Co-founder and CEO of VerifyMe, \u201cMany organisations see the address verification component of KYC as a chore and the 24 to 48 hour wait period for traditional processing is simply unsuitable to the demands of today\u2019s fast-paced businesses.\u201d\n\nVeriFind was not the only product that VerifyMe unveiled as they also revealed a Nigerian Uniform Bank Account Number (NUBAN) verification service and a Facial Liveness Tool.\n\nWith the Facial Liveness Tool, the startup will draw on national databases such as the National Identification Number and driver\u2019s license to authenticate identities. At the same time, the NUBAN verification service will allow for the verification of financial transactions by cross-referencing datasets such as account name, mobile number, and gender.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIdentity verification in Nigeria remains a problem for businesses and individuals. Because of the stress involved in obtaining official identities, many Nigerians only bother with getting official identity documents when they need them.\n\nSince registration for the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) began in 2012, the body reports that it has registered 54 million people, which is a long way off from Nigeria\u2019s population of 200 million. With the government not capturing enough citizens, private companies have stepped up to bridge the gap.\n\nFor businesses, especially eCommerce businesses, finding locations is difficult, and this means that delivery is rarely done in rural areas.\n\nThis is not the first attempt to solve the location problem in Nigeria with the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) partnering with What3words \u2014 a British startup \u2014 to extend delivery to 90% of Nigerian homes.\n\nLast year, Google launched Plus Codes to identify locations without defined addresses.\n\nHowever, unlike these solutions, VeriFind uses a combination of software and human agents to verify addresses.\n\nNigeria leads mobile app downloads in Africa\n\nSmartphone user\n\nMobile app installs in Nigeria grew by 43% between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, according to a report by Appflyer and Google. South Africa came second with 37%, and Kenya third with 29%.\n\nA word of caution: With the report focusing on app installs in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, it might not be representative of the entire continent especially when you consider that these are some of Africa\u2019s largest markets in terms of smartphone penetration.\n\nThere\u2019s probably no aspect of our lives that the coronavirus pandemic did not affect. From working arrangements to the way we shop, the pandemic changed the way we live.\n\nThe way we use our mobile phones were also affected, as this report shows. Tracking data from 6,000 apps and 2 billion installs in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, the report indicates that installs increased by 41% across the three countries.\n\nWith more people on their phones due to the lockdown, the report reveals that in-app advertising revenue increased significantly, with 213% in South Africa, 141% in Nigeria, and 74% in Kenya.\n\nIn terms of in-app purchasing revenue, Q3 2020 saw the biggest increase resulting in 33% of 2020\u2019s in-app purchasing revenue. In-app purchasing revenue increased by 136% between July and September when compared to the previous three months.\n\nUnsurprisingly, fintech apps saw an increase in downloads, with South Africa and Nigeria seeing year-on-year growth rates of 116% and 60%, respectively.\n\nWhile the pandemic undoubtedly influenced this growth, it is unlikely that the mobile app market in these countries will experience a decline provided fintech startups continue providing excellent service. This could also accelerate the move to a cashless economy.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nStop Saying You Want To Bank The Unbanked.

          "text": "Residents of at least seven communities in Jalingo Local Government Area of Taraba State have been counting their losses since floods on Sunday devastated their communities.\n\nSome of the worst hit areas are Mayo Gwoi, Abuja Phase 2, Nukkai, Barade and part of Abuja Phase 1.\n\nApart from washing away many homes and rendering many homeless, the floods also washed away farm crops and livestock.\n\nResidents who spoke to PREMIUM TIMES blamed the disaster on a poor drainage system in many parts of the state capital, caused by uncontrolled physical development.\n\nMany of the victims who are yet to relocate despite signs of more rains said they need government support to get new homes.\n\nThough no life was lost in the disaster, Dauda Sani, a community leader in Abuja Phase 2, said the flood destroyed many houses in his area.\n\nAnother victim who gave her name as Aunty Tobi said she lost valuables such as books, personal documents, animals and foodstuff.\n\nA widow and mother of five who gave her name as Sarah said she sent her children to relatives and friends in different places after her house was submerged on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI need to relocate from this area too but I have no money to do so,\u201d she told Premium Times on Tuesday\n\nBala Sani of Barade community said he could not remove anything from his house after the flood struck .\n\n\u201cWhen we saw the rising water coming like a strong wave, we all ran away leaving our property. I thank God that I did not lose any of my family members.\u201d\n\n\u2018We lost many things\u2019\n\nPhilip Garba, who spoke on behalf of the head of Abuja Phase 2, Thomas Umar, said over 100 houses were destroyed in the community.\n\n\u201cWe lost so many things. We need help and assistance from government and good Samaritans for us to be able to return to normal life.\u201d\n\nHe said people living in homes close to the river banks in the community were willing to relocate but need assistance to do so.\n\nGovernment intervenes but\u2026\n\nGovernor Darius Dickson Ishaku was in Abuja on Sunday when the disaster occurred.\n\nHe flew into the state later the same evening and visited some of the flood-ravaged areas to assess the damages and sympathise with residents. Mr Ishaku said the state government would immediately provide food and other relief materials.\n\nThe governor accused the federal government of abandoning the state to its fate in and failing to assist with relief materials for the flood victims.\n\nHe said the state government would provide relief materials to the affected areas to help cushion their pains.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr Ishaku said though he learnt that officials of the federal Ministry of Humanitarian Services and Disaster Management \u201cclaimed to be in the state the previous week\u201d, he was yet to ascertain the claim.\n\n\u201cThis assistance from the federal government does not get to us. We get assistance from certain proxies but not from the government,\u201d he said but provided no details.\n\nALSO READ: Tears as flood wreaks havoc in Taraba\n\nThe governor also urged those residing in riverine areas to vacate the areas.\n\nMr Ishaku said the state government would send engineers to assess the damage caused to roads and bridges in the areas with a view to carrying out urgent repairs.\n\nPremium Times contacted the humanitarian services ministry and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) on the governor\u2019s claim but got no response.\n\nA special assistant to the minister, Halima Oyelade, when reached by the reporter on the telephone promised to get back after getting details from the department concerned but refused to pick several calls afterwards.\n\nBut the permanent secretary of the state ministry of special duties and humanitarian services, Usman Madu, said \u201cNEMA had reached out to the ministry\u201d and promised to deliver relief materials.\n\nMr Madu disclosed this on Tuesday while presenting the \u201cfirst batch\u201d of relief intervention to the victims of the disaster at the Jalingo local government secretariat.\n\nHe said the food items which include rice, garri, semovita and assorted seasoning were from the state government.\n\nHe said NEMA had promised to intervene through the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) but he could not comment on the matter until the items are received.\n\n\u201cI cannot comment on what we are yet to receive but we were informed that NEMA is bringing some relief materials to the state, which we are waiting to receive.\n\n\u201cThe details of the affected persons have been taken for necessary action. Those who own houses and other properties, we will see how we can give them succour. Cooperate with government officials on ground to carry out the task,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile commending Governor Darius for the prompt response to the situation, the chairman of Jalingo LGA, Nasiru Boboji, said the council would work with the leaders of the affected communities to ensure that all victims benefited from the relief items.\n\nHe said he had earlier visited the affected areas with the member representing Jalingo 1 constituency in the state House of Assembly, Yahuza Abubakar, who was also at the distribution venue.\n\nSpeaking during the distribution, Mr Abubakar said, \u201cthe governor has promised to assist you more after this immediate intervention.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Monday swore in newly-appointed Local Government Caretaker Committees in all the Local Government Areas, Local Council Development Areas, Area Councils and Administrative Offices, in the State.\n\nHe charged them to champion the progressive ideals by being magnanimous in victory and to run the affairs of their respective Councils with the fear of God, transparency, accountability, fairness and equity.\n\nOyetola directed the new Council heads to hit the ground running and ensure that they deliver urgently, the dividends of democracy to the teeming citizens as part of efforts to permanently register the name of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the hearts of the citizens and leave an indelible footprint in the sand of time.\n\nThis is even as the Governor charged them to stretch the hands of partnership to fellow contestants who were not so privileged by embarking on a reconciliatory move to other party members.\n\nSpeaking during the swearing-in ceremony held at Multi-purpose Hall, Local Government Service Commission, Abere, Osogbo, Oyetola noted that his Administration had shun profligacy, corruption and other inimical behaviours that could jeopardise the quest for excellent and inspirational leadership. He enjoined the Council bosses to do same.\n\nHe also urged them to look inward and make their services count in the lives of the people in the best progressive ideals that the party is known for.\n\nWhile congratulating them on their new attainments, Oyetola disclosed that their appointment was based on merit in view of their track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of the ruling party.\n\nHe also appealed to party members who did not make the final list, to put the past behind them and look forward to a brighter future in their quest to serve the people and the party, adding \u201cwe have taken note of your hard work, and I assure you, your own opportunities will come.\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate you all for making it thus far as this is a clear testament to your inherent leadership potential, track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of our Party.\n\n\u201cConsidering that your emergence followed a thoroughly-intense process, you should regard this invaluable opportunity as sufficiently humbling and a lifetime opportunity to not only serve our people but to also leave an indelible footprint in the sand of time.\n\n\u201cWith such defining values as humility, integrity, purposefulness, honesty, transparency, accountability and incorruptibility, you should hit the ground running and ensure that you deliver urgently, the dividends of democracy to our teeming citizens.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the local government institution is the closest to our people. Therefore, your leadership will only be as meaningful and successful to the extent to which you run an administration that is not only truly inclusive, but also one fully committed to meeting the basic needs of our people.\n\n\u201cTo do this, it requires that you lead a united front, working closely with the bureaucracy to run an administration that listens to the deepest yearnings of the people and actively seeking constructive feedbacks that will aid the governance process.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that since our assumption of office, we have run an Administration that is transparent, inclusive, purposeful and absolutely pro-people. This is because ours is an Administration driven by the philosophy that governance is only meaningful to the extent that it serves the needs of our people,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Adebayo Adeleke, lauded Governor Oyetola for appointing men and women of impeccable character to take up the mantle of leadership in all the Local Government Areas of the State.\n\nHe tasked them on dedication, loyalty and service, saying it is a thing of joy that 69 capable persons had been appointed as chairmen to head the helms of affairs at various Councils across the State.\n\nAdeleke added: \u201cToday is special because Mr. Governor was able to bring out 69 out of millions of people of the State to serve. The assignment is that you need to do proper reconciliation in your respective Local Government Areas. You will be assessed based on your ability to resolve contending matters, you must not raise imbroglio.\n\n\u201cYou must mobilise Osun citizens for the ongoing registration exercise for Permanent Voters\u2019 Card. Don\u2019t disappoint Mr Governor. Welfare and security of your people must be your priority. Don\u2019t use it to enrich yourselves.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Acting Chairman, Osun Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prince Gboyega Famodun, urged the newly-sworn-in chairmen to take charge of their councils by being dedicated and committed to good governance.\n\nHe urged them to champion loyalty, dedication, commitment and selfless service to humanity, saying anything short of that will amount to collosal loss.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, one of the newly-sworn-in chairmen, Hon. Samuel Abiodun Idowu, hailed the Governor for counting them worthy to serve their people just as he promised their commitment to deliver.\n\nHe said \u201cI want to appreciate Mr. Governor for counting us worthy for this appointment and I promise that we will work as a team and deliver to your satisfaction.\u201d",

          "text": "The Oyo State chapter of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) has declared that contrary to the accusation that the state governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, was biased against Muslims in the appointment of commissioners in his dissolved cabinet, the governor has, indeed, been fair to the Muslim Ummah in all the activities and programmes of his administration.\n\nIt added that views contained in a recent press statement purportedly authored on behalf of the Muslim Community of Oyo State did not represent the position of the Muslim Ummah in the state.\n\nThe Secretary-General of the NSCIA in Oyo State, Alhaji Shaikh Busairi; the Grand Mufti of the Council, Alhaji Khalifah Yusuf Alagunfon and the Public Relations Officer of the Council, Alhaji Sulayman Seriki, made this position during a visit to the office of the Special Assistant to Governor \u2018Seyi Makinde on Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Imam AbdRasheed AbdulAzeez.\n\nThe trio, who spoke to journalists in Ibadan, the state capital, warned Muslim leaders to avoid hypocrisy and playing to the gallery.\n\nA statement signed by the Special Assistant (Print Media) to Governor Makinde, Moses Alao, quoted the Council as urging those criticising Makinde in the name of the Muslim community to stop being ungrateful to Allah for what he has done for the Muslim Ummah through the governor.\n\nThe statement maintained that contrary to the claim that only five of the commissioners in the recently dissolved cabinet were Muslims, eight of the 16 former commissioners were actually Muslims.\n\nWhile speaking, the Secretary-General of the Council, Shaikh Busairi said: \u201cIt is not wrong to advise the government on any issue. What is wrong is that anyone that intends well or means well should not play to the gallery when advising. That is an erroneous approach. If you actually mean well, there is nothing stopping you from making contact with the government, especially now that we have an SA on Islamic Affairs. You can channel our affairs through that office.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned in the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Oyo State, we have gone into the archives to search into what actually used to transpire in government in Oyo State. We found out that the number of Muslim Commissioners in the previous government were not up to the number we had in the first two years of Governor Makinde.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBut it has been the antics of the people behind that writing; they always cook up stories in the corners of their rooms and use such stories to represent the entire population of Muslims in the state. We in the NSCIA have been critical of that kind of approach. If at all we want to help the cause of Muslims and the cause of Islam, there are better ways.\n\n\u201cAnything that is going to represent the interest of the Muslims in a community, such things should be aired at a meeting of all interest groups. But that did not happen. If it did, then maybe they would have had reasonable information that would have dissuaded them from writing that open letter. So, in a nutshell, they are not representing the interest of Muslims in Oyo State.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned in the NSCIA, there was no bias in the appointments made in the state. In fact, we have been at the vanguard of telling the public that Governor Makinde has been fair to Muslims. In the last two years, he has not been found wanting in terms of doing that which was never in existence in the state before.\n\nHe said that among things, the governor has been identifying with Muslims, stating that Makinde has never been found wanting in terms of fairness to Muslims.\n\n\u201cBut we know the antics of those who signed that statement; they are just trying to cry wolf where there is none just to register that they are still in existence.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow such misrepresentation to go on; that is why we have come to the SA Islamic Affairs to register that what we are reading on the social media is not to our knowledge and that we do not subscribe to what they wrote in that press release and that they are not representing the interests of Muslims in the state. The views they expressed only represent the opinion of their clique and they know what they are gunning for. But they will never realise their diabolical ambition,\u201d Busairi added.\n\nSimilarly, the Grand Mufti of NSCIA, Oyo State, Alh. Alagunfon maintained that the governor has been fair to Muslims, urging those behind the criticism of Governor Makinde to soft-pedal, because \u201cMakinde has done very well for the Muslim Ummah and we should not be ungrateful to him.\u201d\n\nIn his response, the SA Islamic Affairs, Imam AbdulAzeez appreciated the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Oyo State, for visiting his office, urging them to continue to encourage Muslims to support Governor Makinde\u2019s government and to pray for its success.\n\nAccording to AbdulAzeez, Governor Makinde\u2019s government will always be fair to Islam and other religions, adding that the governor is \u201ca lover of Islam and Muslims.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I once said, His Excellency has been a blessing to Islam and the Muslims in Oyo State. His government has undertaken several efforts that demonstrate that the governor believes in fairness and equity.\n\n\u201cWe have the celebration of Mawlud Nabiyy and declaration of Hijrah as public holiday, donation of buses to Islamic organisations including The Central Mosque of Ibadan land, Lanase Central Mosque, Sabo Central Mosque (of the Hausa community) and the maintenance of the use of Hijabs in schools in the state, among others, to show for the governor\u2019s fair disposition.\n\n\u201cMuslims should, therefore, continue to pray for the success of this administration and Oyo state at large,\u201d AbdulAzeez said.",

According to news report and further confirmation by the NAF spokesperson, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, the feat was achieved because the personnel acted swiftly on the information offered by the locals.\n\n\u201cWe herein restate our call to all citizens to report suspicious activities to relevant security agencies. What the security agencies can achieved depends to a reasonable extent the support they receive from the general public\u201d, the group noted.\n\nPRNigeria had reported that an intelligence operative confirmed that a reconnaissance aircraft was deployed for spotting, collection of imagery and observation of the bandits before precision airstrikes were carried out on the targets.\n\n\u201cFollowing an intelligence, on 12 July 2021, that groups of bandits were gathering around Sububu, Jajani and Dammaka, a reconnaissance aircraft was dispatched to recce the area for confirmation before carrying out the airstrikes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the A-Jet conducted air recce over the said locations and observed several bandits arriving in droves and taking cover over large trees at the southwestern part of Sububu settlement. These targets were subsequently engaged and hit.\n\n\u201cThe few surviving bandits were seen fleeing the area. It is estimated that over 125 bandits were neutralized in the attack based on the information we received from our sources around the area,\u201d he said.\n\nNigerian troops under Operation Hadarin Daji, comprising operatives of the Nigerian military, security and intelligences services, are jointly involved in fight against bandits in North-West.",

          "title": "Why police officers now fight over cases -NigPilot",
          "text": "As a human rights activist and public affairs commentator, I see it as my duty and responsibility to fight human rights abuses as well as condemn issues of injustice and other abnormalities via newspaper publications to attract the attention of the concerned authorities with the hope to get justice and right wrongs. My experience with the police has been very bad since they see cases reported to them as opportunities to make wealth from them.\n\nI thank God for the success made so far, knowing how difficult and expensive it is to get justice in this country. Recently, I was at the Force Headquarters in Abuja in respect to my complaint against one Sergeant Iorember Ade who, towards the end of 2016, assaulted my sister, Queen, an assault that led to her death. This same issue was reported to the National Human Rights Commission\u2019s office in Abuja, but nothing reasonable was done to ensure that justice is served.\n\nWhile at the Force Headquarters, the IPO handling my sister\u2019s case, who refused to disclose his real name to me, maintained that I will be addressing him as IK, had a serious argument with his colleagues on who should handle my case. One among the police officers complained he has not been getting money aside from his salary, and that he won\u2019t continue to allow IK to take over cases that come to their unit. I was shocked that they could not even mind my presence.\n\nThe argument lasted for almost an hour before I was attended to by Mr. IK. While attending to me, IK made some funny requests that I would pay for the hotel accommodation for two Police Officers who would be going to Makurdi, Benue State capital to investigate my case since the incident took place there. He also demanded that I would pay for their transport fare and their feeding. Thereafter, he asked me how much I thought I could give to cover all he mentioned. I was not surprised because I knew he saw my case as an opportunity for him to make money and supplement his salary. I told him I didn\u2019t have money, and that was the end of my case.

          "text": "As a human rights activist and public affairs commentator, I see it as my duty and responsibility to fight human rights abuses as well as condemn issues of injustice and other abnormalities via newspaper publications to attract the attention of the concerned authorities with the hope to get justice and right wrongs. My experience with the police has been very bad since they see cases reported to them as opportunities to make wealth from them.\n\nI thank God for the success made so far, knowing how difficult and expensive it is to get justice in this country. Recently, I was at the Force Headquarters in Abuja in respect to my complaint against one Sergeant Iorember Ade who, towards the end of 2016, assaulted my sister, Queen, an assault that led to her death. This same issue was reported to the National Human Rights Commission\u2019s office in Abuja, but nothing reasonable was done to ensure that justice is served.\n\nWhile at the Force Headquarters, the IPO handling my sister\u2019s case, who refused to disclose his real name to me, maintained that I will be addressing him as IK, had a serious argument with his colleagues on who should handle my case. One among the police officers complained he has not been getting money aside from his salary, and that he won\u2019t continue to allow IK to take over cases that come to their unit. I was shocked that they could not even mind my presence.\n\nThe argument lasted for almost an hour before I was attended to by Mr. IK. While attending to me, IK made some funny requests that I would pay for the hotel accommodation for two Police Officers who would be going to Makurdi, Benue State capital to investigate my case since the incident took place there. He also demanded that I would pay for their transport fare and their feeding. Thereafter, he asked me how much I thought I could give to cover all he mentioned. I was not surprised because I knew he saw my case as an opportunity for him to make money and supplement his salary. I told him I didn\u2019t have money, and that was the end of my case. I have not heard from the police since then.\n\nI reported this attitude to the National Human Rights Commission in Abuja official who claimed to be following my case to ensure I get justice but as usual, nothing was done till now. My questions are these: how can we progress in this country with the kind of police we have? How can we get things done with the kind of government agencies that are not functioning?

          "text": "A court filing has revealed that Britney Spears\u2019 request to remove her father from his role of overseeing her conservatorship has been denied by a US judge The singer\u2019s lawyer, Samuel Ingham, asked a court in Los Angeles to oust Jamie Spears from his position managing the multimillion-dollar estate. When calling for Mr. Spears to be removed in November last year, Mr. Ingham said Ms. Spears, 39, was scared of her father and wanted him gone from the conservatorship that has controlled her life since 2008.\n\nIn court filings, Ms. Spears said she wanted private wealth management firm the Bessemer Trust appointed as \u201csole conservator\u201d. However, documents filed in Los Angeles show Judge Brenda Penny refused the request while rubberstamping Bessemer Trust\u2019s role as co-conservator of the estate. The legal document states: \u201cThe conservatee\u2019s request to suspend James P Spears immediately upon the appointment of Bessemer Trust Company Of California, N.A. as sole conservator of the estate is denied without prejudice.\u201d The filing was dated June 30 \u2013 a week after the pop superstar delivered dramatic testimony calling for the end of the conservatorship.\n\nShe was placed under the complex legal arrangement \u2013 usually reserved for the very old and infirm \u2013 after suffering a series of mental breakdowns. Ms. Spears told a court on June 23 the conservatorship was \u201cabusive\u201d and she wanted it to end without the need for a medical assessment. The mother-of-two said she was required to use a contraceptive device and was barred from marrying boyfriend Sam Asghari. Earlier, Mr. Spears, 68, filed court documents of his own, denying he was responsible for the restrictions apparently placed on his daughter\u2019s private life.\n\nHe has overseen her estate for 13 years but has not been in charge of her personal affairs since September 2019, when he stepped down from that role due to ill health. Mr. Spears was replaced as conservator of Ms. Spears\u2019s person on a temporary basis by Jodi Montgomery, the singer\u2019s caregiver. In a court filing, lawyers for Mr. Spears said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d by Mr. Ingham\u2019s request to make Ms. Montgomery\u2019s position permanent. It said:\n\n\u201cBased on her statements to the court, Mr. Spears is concerned that the petition to appoint Jodi Montgomery filed by Ms. Spears\u2019 court-appointed counsel Samuel D Ingham III does not reflect her wishes. \u201cMs. Spears told the court on June 23 that she is opposed to being under a conservatorship and revealed her ongoing disputes with Ms. Montgomery about her medical treatment and other personal care issues.\u201d Lauriann Wright, Ms. Montgomery\u2019s lawyer, released a statement in response and said: \u201cI can state unequivocally that Jodi Montgomery has been a tireless advocate for Britney and for her well-being",

Rivers had six, Oyo reported five more infections, Ekiti \u2013 4, Ogun \u2013 4, FCT \u2013 2, Gombe \u2013 2, and Kwara \u2013 1.\n\nAs of the time of this report, Nigeria has confirmed 168,867 cases while 164,623 have been discharged. However, 2,125 people have died so far from COVID-19 complications.\n\nREAD ALSO: Indonesia Imports Oxygen As COVID-19 Batters Hospitals\n\nREAD ALSO: Global COVID-19 Deaths Cross Four Million As Outbreaks Surge In Asia\n\nNigerians Abandon Protocols\n\nAlthough Nigeria detected the first case of the deadly Delta COVID-19 variant about a week ago, the NCDC report does not indicate if the new cases are that of the new strain.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) had earlier raised alarm about the strain, saying it had led to high hospitalisations and deaths in more than 100 nations where it has been confirmed.\n\n\u201cDelta and other highly transmissible variants are driving catastrophic waves of the case, which are translating into high numbers of hospitalisations and death,\u201d the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Ghebreyesus, told a media briefing on COVID-19 at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Geneva on Monday.\n\nDespite fears over the spike in cases and the confirmation of the highly contagious Delta strain, many Nigerians have abandoned safety protocols recommended by health authorities.\n\nTransporters are carrying passengers in full capacity.

          "text": "Nigerian grammy award winning Burna Boy alongside Ed Sheeran will lead a group of artistes to perform at the Global Citizen live concert aimed at uniting the world, defending the planet and defeating poverty.\n\nGlobal Citizen, an International advocacy organization in a statement on Wednesday said the event will be a 24-hour Live broadcast with events and performances filmed across six continents and will air on several networks and as well stream on several social media platforms.\n\nOther top artistes and entertainers expected to perform at the September 25 event are Davido, Femi Kuti, Tiwa Savage appearing alongside Adam Lambert, Doja Cat, Coldplay, Usher, H.E.R., Angelique Kidjo, Andrea Bocelli, Billie Eilish, Demi Lovato, DJ Snake, Duran Duran, Lizzo, Lorde, Ricky Martin, The Weeknd, and more to be announced.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live is powered by citizens around the world who are taking action together with governments, corporations and philanthropists to make change.\n\nThe campaign calls on businesses and philanthropists to contribute resources needed to protect and restore at least 1 billion trees by 2022 to curb climate change; and provide meals for the more than 40 million people on the brink of starvation.\n\nThe 24-hour live broadcast event will feature artists, activists, and world leaders taking the stage at iconic locations across the globe, including: live events in Central Park in New York City, and the Champ de Mars in Paris; live-crosses from London, and Los Angeles; and performances and hosted segments from Lagos, Rio de Janeiro, Seoul and Sydney. Additional locations and location-specific details will be announced in August.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 has drastically reversed the progress toward achieving the United Nations Global Goals, pushing upwards of 160 million people back into extreme poverty and more than 40 million to the brink of starvation. Progress on climate change has halted, as the majority of the Fortune 500 fail to set science-based carbon reduction targets. We must rectify the damage done and hold world leaders accountable for ensuring that the entire world recovers from this pandemic together. \u2018Equitable recovery\u2019 is not an act of charity \u2013 it is the only way we can ensure a fighting chance at achieving a sustainable world free from extreme poverty.\u201d \u2013 Hugh Evans, CEO, Global Citizen said in a press release.\n\nThe release also quoted Nigeria\u2019s minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama as saying, \u201cAs we humans spend billions of dollars in search of newer worlds in outer space, Global Citizen Live brings us back down to earth by reminding the global community that charity should begin at home and we must preserve our earth and be our brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 keepers. We owe it to ourselves and generations yet unborn. Space can wait!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very excited to perform at the Global Citizen Live concert this year. The timing for this call for unity couldn\u2019t be more important,\u201d said Angelique Kidjo. \u201cThere is an urgent need for us to work together across the globe and take action to protect our planet. Mother nature has a way of warning us. We need each other now,\u201d Angelique Kidjo said.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live and the organization\u2019s Recovery Plan for the World are supported by a coalition of many of the world\u2019s leading corporations including its Global Partners: Accenture, Cisco, Citi, The Coca-Cola Company, Delta Air Lines, Google, Live Nation, P&G, Verizon, and campaign partner WW International, who will work together to engage support from the 8private sector in driving new commitments toward the campaign\u2019s policy objectives. Access Bank, will also support the Global Citizen Live campaign as a partner in Nigeria.\n\nFor the past decade, Global Citizen has championed the most pressing social and environmental issues and joined the fight to end COVID-19, most recently with VAX Live: The Concert To Reunite The World in May, which mobilized more than 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses and $302 million to the ACT-Accelerator for equitable health access to countries most in need.\n\nSince March 2020, Global Citizen has mobilized $2 billion in cash grants to fund global pandemic relief efforts, and over 26 million COVID-19 vaccine doses.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",

          "text": "Pope Francis was discharged from a Rome hospital and returned home to the Vatican on Wednesday, 10 days after undergoing surgery to remove half his colon.\n\nFrancis, 84, sat in the passenger seat of the Ford car, which left Rome\u2019s Gemelli Polyclinic around 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT; 4:45 a.m. EDT). He made a stop to pray at Rome\u2019s Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, which has a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary which Francis always visits after returning home from a foreign trip.\n\nAfter the brief stop, Francis\u2019 small motorcade approached a side entrance to the Vatican. The Ford stopped before reaching the gate and Francis got out with the help of a bodyguard. He greeted some Italian security guards \u2014 two army soldiers standing guard and a handful of Italian police motorcycle escorts \u2014 and got back in the car, which then entered the Vatican through the Perugino gate.\n\nFrancis had half of his colon removed for a severe narrowing of his large intestine on July 4, his first major surgery since he became pope in 2013. It was a planned procedure, scheduled for early July when the pope\u2019s audiences are suspended anyway and Francis would normally take some time off.\n\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, confirmed Francis\u2019 return from the hospital and visit to the Rome basilica. Praying before the icon, Francis \u201cexpressed his gratitude for the success of his surgery and offered a prayer for all the sick, especially those he had met during his stay in hospital,\u201d Bruni said in the statement.\n\nFrancis will have several more weeks to recover before beginning to travel again in September. There are plans for him to visit Hungary and Slovakia in a Sept. 12-15 trip, and then make a quick stop in Glasgow, Scotland, in November to participate in the COP26 climate conference. Other possible trips are also under review.\n\nThe Vatican had originally said Francis could be discharged last weekend, but later said he would stay a few days extra for further recovery and rehabilitation therapy.\n\nThe pope appeared for the first time in public since the surgery on Sunday, looking in good form as he delivered his weekly prayer from the 10th floor hospital balcony, surrounded by young cancer patients.

Psaki said the president still supported U.S. athletes traveling to Tokyo for the competition despite the rise in coronavirus cases. President Biden is not attending the Games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well aware of the careful preparations, including the public health measures necessary to protect athletes, staff, and spectators, that the government and international committee has undertaken, which is why, as we said, we support the Games moving forward,\u201d Psaki said.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the president\u2019s chief medical adviser, said last week that he didn\u2019t have any concerns about a trip to Tokyo by the first lady, who is 70 years old and fully vaccinated. He said the protocols to protect her health are \u201crather stringent\u201d and that \u201cthe final choice of what she\u2019d do, obviously, is up to her.\u201d\n\nShe has decided to follow her predecessors who also led U.S. delegations to the Olympics.\n\nHillary Clinton traveled to the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Games and the 1996 Atlanta Games.\n\nLaura Bush led the delegation to the Turin Olympics in 2006.
