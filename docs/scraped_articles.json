          "text": "Major socio-political organisations in Nigeria have demanded what they described as a \u201cnew people-oriented federal constitution\u201d before the 2023 general elections, saying the 1999 constitution does not represent the interest of the masses.\n\nThey also unanimously agreed that the new constitution should provide for a \u201ctrue federalism that heralds a restructured Nigeria,\u201d while the 2023 Presidency should be zoned to the South.\n\nThese were the highlights of a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of the Nigeria\u2019s 2023 Presidential Transition Inter-Ethnic Peace Dialogue, with the theme, \u2018Restructuring and 2023 Power Shift: Nigeria\u2019s make or break factor for political survival.\u201d\n\nThe event which was held in Abuja was convened by Kennedy Iyere, the President of the Youths Off The Street Initiative, and his diaspora partners, in collaboration with ethnic nationalities and local non-governmental organisations.\n\nAmong participants at the programme, attended by over 300 delegates, were the leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo; Chairman, Igbo World Assembly, Dr Nwachukwu Anakwenze; President, Yoruba Council of Elders, Dr Kunle Olajide; a former Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Chief Kofoworola Bucknor; and President of Southern Kaduna Peoples Union, Jonathan Asake.\n\nOthers were Chairman, Pan Niger Delta Forum, Senator Emmanuel Ibok; former Governor of Ondo State, Dr Olusegun Mimiko; former Governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife; President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dr George Obiozor; convener, National Consultative Front and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ghali Na\u2019Abba; a political economist, Prof. Pat Utomi; and a former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode.\n\nWhile insisting that \u201cfederal character should be used in federal appointments\u201d, the elder statesmen charged the Federal Government to \u201curgently address the recurring security challenges in the country as part of the efforts to avert a second civil war and possible disintegration of the country.\u201d\n\nThe United Nigeria Advocacy Committee, which was proposed by YOTSI, was also officially unveiled by Mimiko, under the supervision of the various leaders of ethnic nationalities.\n\nThe mandate of the committee is to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s constitutional restructuring and the country\u2019s return to true federalism, while working to promote national unity, peace, ethno-political integration, religious harmony and national stability.\n\nThe communique reads, \u201cThe meeting asserts that Nigeria needs a \u2018new people-oriented federal constitution\u2019 before the 2023 general elections given that the current 1999 constitution does not represent the interests of the people.\n\n\u201cThe meeting insists that the new constitution should provide for \u2018true federalism\u2019 that heralds a restructured Nigeria (and) calls on the Presidency to live up to its mandate of preserving lives and properties by contending with the current insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe meeting demands the convening of an emergency \u2018national conference \u2019 to take place in the Year 2022 to fashion out a new federal constitution on the way forward for the federating regions. The meeting agrees that the \u20182023 Presidency\u2019 should be zoned to the South.\n\n\u201cWe demand the amendment of the \u2018Electoral Law\u2019 to provide for electronic voting and real-time transmission of results before the 2023 general elections to provide for transparency, accountability and to allow the \u2018sanctity of the ballot box\u2019 and to reduce electorates\u2019 voting apathy.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Well looking at the antecedents of the Governor, his politics dexterity, he too is complicated complex in politics. So time will tell. The issue will be resolved democratically,\u201d the Governor said.\n\nGanduje also said he is not tired neither is he retiring from active politics after his tenure as Governor by 2023.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he (Masari) is tired or not tired. You want me to tell you whether I will also retire as well? Well, I\u2019m not tired but whether I will resign or not, time will tell. But you should know that I have been in politics since 1978. Even if I retire, I think my ears are on what is happening,\u201d he said.\n\nOn agitations for the nation to break up, Ganduje said he is confident that the country will not break up.\n\n\u201cPeople who are urging for splitting the country, calling for secession, of course is democracy but I\u2019m confident that Nigeria will continue to be one indivisible country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on those who are calling for the split because they are young people who did not experience the civil war and I am happy their elders are also making some comments. So Nigeria will continue to be one and there is confidence because just last week Ohaneze Ndigbo revealed a resolution that they are not behind Biafra project they are behind the unity of Nigeria. That is very encouraging and we are hearing it from an important regional association.\n\n\u201cAlso the Arewa Consultative Forum, of course is behind one Nigeria and has not been advocating for the fragmentation of Nigeria. Afenifere also made a resolution that they are behind one Nigeria, they are not behind those who are calling for the split of the country. The same thing with the National Coalition of the Middle Belt People, they too say they believe in one Nigeria. So else will succeed in splitting the country?\n\n\u201cInfact, I made a call to these regional associations, since they all believe in one Nigeria let them come together and fashion out our diversity, identify our differences, identify our similarities and ensure that our diversity which is our source of problem and a challenge, they should convert challenge into an opportunity. It is possible.\n\n\u201cSo these regional bodies should meet and find out how they can convert our differences into opportunities for the unity of this country. Some of us believe oir diversity is a blessing. Individual ethnic nationalities have some inherent trends that if properly hernessed willobe Nigeria forward.\n\n\u201cAll that we require is that we should respect our differences and convert our challenges into opportunities.\n\nAs I have been saying, we are all creatures of God, we are all created by God. If God wants us all to be of one tribe, all of us will be of one tribe. Of God wants us to be of one religion, all of us will be of one religion. In fact if God wants us created as birds flying all over the place, all of us would have been flying all over the place. But God in His wisdom made us human beings and made some animals, made some insects, made some birds, made some plants, in order to have a complete equal system. So you can see the wisdom of God by creating us as different creatures.\n\n\u201cSo we as Nigerians, our diversity is an advantage and we should convert our diversity to our source of strength. That is my dream about Nigeria,\u201d Governor Ganduje however stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Gen. Bashir Magashi(rtd.), as part of measures towards addressing the insecurity and other challenges facing the southeast region.\n\nThe meeting was held inside Enugu Government House with the southeast leaders reaffirming their commitment to the sustenance of a united Nigeria where there is justice, equity and equality of all Nigerians.\n\nIgbo youth groups call for investigation of Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, OYC\n\nThe leaders also stated that the people of the southeast region are not disposed to the call for secession from Nigeria.\n\nHowever, the Ohanaeze Secretary-General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro while reacting during a telephone interview with DAILY POST on Monday, said the purported security meeting fell short of the expectations of the people as it failed to proffer the needed solutions to the economic, infrastructural and security problems facing the southeast.\n\nHe regretted that the security parley excluded critical stakeholders and the agitators, declaring that with the alleged exclusion, all resolutions adopted in the purported southeast security meeting is null and void.\n\nIsiguzoro opined, \u201csoutheast leaders are playing to the gallery. There are trying to impress President Muhammadu Buhari who they have cordial relationship with. We don\u2019t have problem with that. But, the most important thing is that, a meeting that tends to bring solutions to the challenges, without the component of those who are the real cause of the insecurity in the southeast or those who are being labelled, to get involve in the meeting.\n\n\u201cThe meeting was just a tea party and jamboree of those who are trying to use cosmetic approach to address the real problems we are facing in the southeast. Because, irrespective that we have so much confidence in the southeast governors led by the Governor of Ebonyi State, the absence of real people, the agitators not being part of that meeting nullified the primary objective to achieve the reality it suppose to achieve. So, the gathering is a tea party meeting, it is not something that will bring necessary steps to enforce peace back to southeast.\n\nDoyin Okupe warned against incisive comments against Igbo nation\n\n\u201cThe southeast leaders should as a matter of urgency, consult with the leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo ably led by Engr. Chidi Ibe to assist them in ensuring that the agitators are being brought in for genuine discussion towards ending the insecurity in the zone\u201d.\n\nThe Igbo chieftain insisted that only a geniune dialogue involving major actors would assist in coming up with far reaching remedy to the insecurity and other challenges ravaging the southeast.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cgovernment should call for geniune dialogue including all agitating groups and critical stakeholders. They should come to a roundtable and review the coexistence of the country called Nigeria, and as well fine-tuning best approach to solve problems bedeviling the region and the country as a whole\u201d.",

The award also encourages excellence and diligence in children.\n\nRead Also: Imo decries rising cases of violence against children\n\nThe search will cut across eight states of Lagos, Osun, Kano, Kaduna, Rivers, Enugu, Kwara, and Abuja, and will last for seven weeks.\n\nHead of Marketing Sukhman Kaur said the initiative is significant as it is rooted in the recognition of children whose best efforts are often overlooked in the society.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe said: \u201cThis initiative is a reflection of the importance and belief of our company in the extraordinary qualities of the Nigerian child which must never be ignored, but rather celebrated.

          "title": "Uproar over plan to reopen grazing route",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s pronouncement last week that his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure herders have free access for their animals have continued to generate flaks\n\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, the president said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas. He then said he has resolved to revive those routes and grazing areas in the country to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cWhat I told the governors was to ask them to go and dig up the gazette. There are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there. But if you allow your cattle to stray into any farmer\u2019s farm, you are arrested and the farmer is invited to submit his claims. Those who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed.\u201d\n\nHowever, in separate reactions, Arewa, Igbo and Yoruba groups roundly condemned the statement saying the move rather than resolve the issue would exacerbate it.\n\nAs far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\nSpokesman forf the group, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a telephone interview, reminded the president that the 1999 Constitution gives state governors powers cover land and to even revoke federal land.\n\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security. I would have said the best way to go is for us to seek legal interpretation beyond the Office of the Attorney General. The Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\n\n\u201cI will reserve final judgment on the president\u2019s position. We caution that there is more to open grazing than availability of land and routes. It is not about opening the grazing routes, it is also about the security of the cattle and herders, and getting the support of communities that they will go through. Our open grazing requires political will. The Federal Government has already adopted the National Livestock Transformation programme to equip the Fulani. We, in the North, are in favour of ban of open grazing but we want it to be done in phases, in an orderly manner that does not harm the cattle and the Fulani. We also support the active intervention of the Federal Government, the northern governors and everybody to make sure that in the next one year or two, open grazing is abolished completely. I think this is the way to go.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Association of South East Town Unions (ASETU) in collaboration with other respected Igbo groups, including Nzuko Umunna, Aka Ikenga, Igbo World Assembly (IWA), World Igbo Congress (WIC), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Ekwe Nche, European Igbo Communities, Igbo Board of Deputies, Council of Igbo States in America, Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo and South East Community Youth Leaders, rose from a one-day emergency security meeting with a vow to resist open grazing in the region.\n\nThe coalition warned that governors in the zone who fail to implement the ban would be treated as foes.\n\nNational President, ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe who made their position known, said the meeting totally condemned the continued attacks by killer herdsmen in Igbo communities and urged governors to rise to the occasion and protect their people.\n\nStressing that the primary purpose of political governance was the security of lives and property, the Igbo groups charged governors who had not kick-started the processes of enacting anti-open grazing laws, to as a matter of urgency, send Executive Bills to their respective Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur position is very clear, which is the stand of Ndigbo; we say no to open grazing and are not making any pretences about that. We insist that any cattle in the South East must be ranched. So, we urge all nomadic herders to leave our land. We also urge our governors to do everything possible to implement the ban on open grazing. In fact, Ndigbo will treat any governor who fails to carry out this heartfelt desire and demand as an enemy. We equally urge each state to have forest guards with legal backing to ensure that our forests do not harbour terrorists and criminals,\u201d Diwe said.\n\nThe groups regretted that President Muhammadu Buhari who had never spoken strongly against the atrocities of Fulani herdsmen and bandits was threatening to visit another festival of blood on the Igbo.\n\nADF recalled that it had been in the forefront of the agitation for the banning of open grazing in Igboland since 2015, hence its insistence on the enactment of anti-open grazing laws as the most potent strategy to prevent armed Fulani herdsmen from overrunning the Southern states.\n\nIts spokesman, Abia Onyike, said the law to be passed in the State Houses of Assembly should be accompanied by clear modalities, instrumentalities and machineries for their enforcement. He added that the effectiveness of this move depended on the synergy between the governors, the legislators and the people, including the civil society organisations.\n\nSimilarly, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the president\u2019s pronouncements fell far short of what was expectation.\n\n\u201cWe have some questions for Mr. President and the Attorney General in this respect. One, who created the so-called grazing routes? At what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019? Two, assuming without conceding, that there were so-called grazing routes, what would now happen to structures that have been built in areas where the so-called routes are to be re-opened? Would such structures, including residences and factories be pulled down so that cows would have places to graze? Compared to what would be lost economically, socially, politically and in security terms if these structures are to be pulled down, is it not better to encourage the building of ranches? We can go on and on.\u201d\n\nAfenifere claimed President\u2019s pronouncement on open grazing and his confession on how he determines who occupy positions at the national level seems to indicate that Buhari\u2019s government is operating a constitution that is different from the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Section 2 of the Land Use Act, the law governing land matters in the country, vests the administration and control of lands in a given state in the hands of the governor of the state. It is such that even when the Federal Government wants to use a portion of land, it has to seek the consent of the governor of the state concerned. Since most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes? Why talking of grazing routes in this age when ranching is the fad in all civilised climes?\u201d\n\nThe group claimed President Buhari seems to derive pleasure in shifting blames and responsibilities when pressed on what his government ought to do.\n\nUnknown persons threaten mayhem in Delta\n\nMeanwhile, unknown persons, yesterday, raised the tension in Delta State as they threatened to attack Asaba, the state capital, and Agbor, if Governor Ifeanyi Okowa does not withdraw his support for the ban on open grazing within 72 hours.\n\nAn unsigned letter containing the threat was pasted in strategic locations in Asaba including the fence of the Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel) at Infant Jesus Road.\n\nThe letter titled \u2018Fulani Jihadist Warning: An Open Message of 2 Paragraphs to Delta State\u2019 dated June 13, 2021 warned that \u201cfailure to adhere to this demand for been the host of the 17 governors, Delta State, most likely the city of Asaba and Agbor, shall encounter severe consequences than that of Bornu, Kebbi, Kastina, Kaduna, Enugu, Benue, Oyo and many more that will not respect the Fulani\u2019s heritage, as we take responsibility for the detonate explosive uncovered in the state capital secretariat, which should serve as warning to the Delta State Government for what is to come, should the governor fail to abide to our demand.\u201d",

          "text": "From Agaju Madugba, Katsina\n\nKatsina Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has faulted President Muhammadu Buhari on reasons for worsening insecurity in the country.\n\nThe president had during a television interview last week attributed the menace to failure of states and local governments across the country to manage security issues in their respective domains.\n\nBut citing Constitutional provisions, Masari said it was wrong for anybody to blame states and local governments.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the Federal Government to ensure protection of lives and property of citizens in all nooks and cranny of the country. When you look at the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the issue of security is under the Exclusive List. So, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government and states can only complement and that\u2019s what we have always done and are still doing.\n\n\u201cFrom the local governments, we assist the police, the DSS, the NSDC. There may be states that do not complement efforts of the security agencies and perhaps those are the states that the president was referring to.\n\n\u201cBut sincerely speaking, based on provisions of the Constitution, the blame should go to the Federal Government for the general state of insecurity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMasari said he was 100 per cent in support of the clamour for restructuring and devolution of more powers to states which should also entail enhanced revenue to the tiers of government to enable them adequately perform their constitutional roles.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of a state police would enhance general security as the personnel will be expected to perform their defined roles without infringing on duties of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of a state police is part of what we are talking about and I am for it. All we need to do is to formalise activities of the vigilance groups and community policing and give them clear definitions on their limits and those of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cWe have the Nigerian police and the NSDC that we currently support their operations and nothing stops a state police from coexisting side by side with the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of security is actually the responsibility of everybody as we all have roles to play. It\u2019s not about the president or the governor or local government chairman or a legislator or minister.\n\n\u201cThese bandits and their informants have addresses. They live within the communities and the people know them and security has no colorations in terms of political party affiliations or religion.\n\n\u201cI am also 100 per cent for restructuring and devolution of powers or whatever you call it. If you devolve, states and local governments will have more financial independence. We should earn resources according to the size and economy of our states.\n\n\u201cDuring the First Republic, Emir of Kano was the highest paid because of the state\u2019s revenue base. What we have today as Katsina State was a province made up of Katsina and Daura emirates. They ran their civil service and police and prisons and judiciary then were under the Native Authority and they did well.\n\n\u201cThey built and managed schools. If it was done successfully then, who says it cannot be done today? We ought to take another look at the Constitution. With the right leadership and proper arrangement, these things are still possible.\n\n\u201cThere are some federal ministries with so many parastatals under each one. How can one person as minister provide effective oversight for these parastatals?\n\n\u201cWe should devolve more power to the states but in such a way that we don\u2019t have to weaken the authority of the Federal Government in terms of performing its constitutional responsibilities.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFormer national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling party to address the separatist agitations in the country through democratic means instead of deployment of military.\n\nHe said the fact that things are bad and people hungry and angry was not questionable, saying that these were worldwide phenomenon.\n\nHowever, Odigie-Oyegun decried the current security challenge in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that we will begin to get control of the security of this nation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe spoke during the public presentation of a book, APC\u2019s Litmus Tests, written by Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman, in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe former Edo governor said the earlier the APC-led government addressed the escalating agitations, the better to diffuse the kind of stresses the nation is passing through.\n\n\u201cLet me refer to just one aspect of what Governor Atiku Bagudu said. That is the document on true federalism which the party put together that passed through all the organs of the party. The executive of the party, the NWC, the Caucus, the NEC which is the highest organ of the party.\n\n\u201cWhy did we do it at that time? We did it because like, it is happening today, there was this cacophony of voices. Two people in the party could not agree on what they meant by restructuring. So, the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went so far as to have some drafts legislation. It is not by any chance a perfect document.\n\n\u201cBut it reflects then the thinking and the desires of the Nigerian people. Everybody kept quiet after we brought that document out, publicised it, held press conferences over it and most Nigerians were very, very happy. But once again, we did not make the kind of progress that we could have made and it has become once more, the topical subject in the Nigerian polity.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond us, we now have one or two things that did not happen before, people now wanting to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child ask for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it\u2019s cake he wants and we must not, as political party, we must not as the government of the federation, give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d",

          "text": "Says terminal operators to contribute to reconstruction of Apapa port\n\nSays deep blue project to solve maritime insecurity, boost revenue, reduce oil production cost\n\nBy Kasim Sumaina\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Rotimi, has said the problem of Apapa seaport is efficiency, citing the drastic changes in the Port on the day the President visited to commission the Deep Blue Project.\n\nHe also said that terminal operators must contribute to the total reconstruction and reorganisation of the Apapa Seaport.\n\nThe Minister stated this Monday when he appeared as a guest on The Morning Show on Arise TV, THISDAY broadcast arm.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI was in the train with the President on that day and noticed that everything had disappeared, even inside the Port that looked like a market place was very well organised, no persons were found loitering about, no trucks. What it shows is that the problem of the Seaport is the problem of efficiency.\u201d\n\nHe observed that if they had the capacity in just one night, \u201cbecause I was there the previous evening, and when I came back in the morning, everything had disappeared; If that can happen in one night, it means that the problem is management, nothing else. Do we need to wait for the President to come before we can be efficient?\u201d Amaechi queried.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done, was to have a meeting with the terminal operators, and I told them that they have to contribute to the reconstruction of the Apapa Seaport. We must rebuild the Apapa Seaport, taking into cognisance all the issues that we are seeing now that is frustrating the Seaport, like where do you park the trucks, how many trucks are coming into the Seaport at what point in time?\n\n\u201cHow can a person come into the seaport who has no business being there, what is he doing at the Seaport? The Seaport is a security area and it\u2019s not for everybody, even me, after my tenure as Minister, I\u2019m not entitled to go into the Seaport unless I have business in the seaport\u201d, he added.\n\nAmaechi noted that the Ministry of Transportation will partner with the Customs and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to solve the problem, adding thatt freighting of cargoes from the Seaport through the rail, when it begins, will also help in arresting the situation at the Port.\n\n\u201cWe are going to partner with customs because they are largely involved. Between them and the NPA, they are the operators (or regulators) of the Seaport, and see how to arrest this situation. I believe that when we begin to freight cargoes from the seaport through the rail, we\u2019ll reduce some of the challenges that we have at the seaport\u201d, he said.\n\nAmaechi also spoke on the recently launched Deep Blue Project being overseen by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) in partnership with the Ministry of Defence, stating that the project will not only boost security in the country\u2019s waters, but will also improve trade in the Gulf of Guinea and reduce cost of production for the Oil industry, while improving revenue for Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nHe stressed that, \u201cbefore we came, various contractors were contracted to provide security for oil companies in the water. There was a case between the government and OMSL in which the company provides about 3 or 4 boats to the Navy and they collect $2500 per vessel for the first day and $1500 for about 30 days. In a year, like in 2020 they made about $67m, and when you hand over the security of a country to individuals, it becomes very challenging and irresponsible.\n\n\u201cSo, the President kindly approved that the Police, Army, Air force and other security agencies should be involved in providing security with the equipment that we have provided.\n\n\u201cWe have about 3 helicopters, 2 fixed-wing planes, 17 interceptor boats, 2 vessels, drones, and more; what it does is that it gives you information about where the criminals are, those who go and destroy pipes just because they are looking for oil to bunker.\n\n\u201cIt provides you that information, then you deter them or arrest them. So, we are able to provide security in the coastal region, both on land and on the sea. Now, those who provide the coastal security on land will be the Nigerian Army and the Police, and we\u2019ve provided them with all the necessary tools they need.\n\n\u201cWe have ammunition, we have vehicles, like Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and all that for patrol by the coast. All that, we believe will begin to yield fruits between now and next year.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, Amaechi said, \u201cWhat , we\u2019ve done with Deep Blue project is that we will reduce the cost of producing oil in Nigeria, because in producing oil, they also build-in the cost of security. By the time we provide this security in the water, the economy will be improved because there will be more money coming into the economy. That\u2019s the impact it will have when it comes to the Deep Blue project.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the Israelis who did the training said in six months to one year, if there is no improvement in the economy in terms of how much comes in, both to NIMASA, NPA and the oil industry, \u2018come back to us and we\u2019ll be willing to refund.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut you know it is simple mathematics; It is true that the moment you can take away the criminals from the water, and the contractors from the water, then the cost of security which is borne either by NNPC or the Oil Companies will be part of what will come back to us as income. Then on land, in all our rail and train coaches, you have enough armed policemen in any trip we are making to withstand any criminal attack.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Idris Wase, had in May held public hearings in 12 cities, at the rate of two per each of the six geo-political zones.\n\nTHISDAY findings revealed that the outcome of the zonal public hearings are to be put together by the committee members with the assistance of consultants engaged for the exercise.\n\nA senator from the North-central geo-political zone and member of the Constitution Review Committee told THISDAY on condition of anonymity that the collation of the aggregate views at the zonal hearings will be worked on at a retreat to be held shortly for the committee members to take a holistic look at the presentations at the public hearings before putting them together into a draft bill for presentation to the federal lawmakers by July.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur committee, which is also in liaison with the House committee, will any time from now go into a retreat to look at all the submissions at the public hearings and put them in a draft form for the Senate to consider and ensure clause-by-clause consideration before going on recess next month.\u201d\n\nHe listed 16 thematic areas, which will be the guide of the committee while preparing its report to include gender equality for women and girls, federal structure and power devolution, local government and its autonomy, public revenue, fiscal federalism and revenue allocation, Nigerian police and Nigerian security architecture as well as comprehensive judicial reforms, electoral reforms and socio-economic and cultural rights as contained in Chapter 2 of the constitution.\n\nHe listed other areas as strengthening the independence of oversight institutions and agencies created by the constitution or pursuant to an act of the National Assembly, residency and indigene provisions, immunity, National Assembly and state and local government creation, FCT administration, the legislature and legislative bureaucracy and constitutional role for traditional rulers.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the bill will be ready for clause-by-clause consideration by the Senate at plenary before proceeding on its annual vacation in July.\n\nThe senator also stated that after the clause-by-clause consideration by the Senate and harmonisation with the House of Representatives, all those clauses that get through will be sent to the 36 state Houses of Assembly for consideration and approval.\n\nAccording to him, two-thirds of the Houses of Assembly, which is 24 states, must concur with the position of the National Assembly after which the bill will come back to the National Assembly for further legislative action.\n\nHe said: \u201cOnce we scale that hurdle, the bill will now be properly vetted to confirm the clauses that made the threshold after which it will be sent to the executive for assent.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the current constitution amendment process will see the light of the day as both the executive and the state governments are being carried along in all the moves by the legislative arm to further amend the constitution.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet us keep hope alive that the process of amending the constitution, which is now at its peak, will turn out well as I know that the leadership of the two chambers of the National Assembly is carrying along the executive arm as well as the state on what we are doing to further amend the 1999 Constitution.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022OPEC: Nigeria\u2019s oil production hit record low in May\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nA new report by Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC) has indicated that Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry loses as much as $15 billion in investments annually due to the delayed passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), currently before the National Assembly.\n\nThe bill, which seeks to overhaul the oil and gas industry and offer new fiscal incentives to investors, according to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, and Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, is set to be passed this month.\n\nHowever, FDC in its latest bi-monthly publication stated that even if the PIB is passed today, the country has already lost investment opportunities due to the lack of urgency attached to the passage of the legislation which was first transmitted to the lawmakers over 14 years ago.\n\n\u201cIts delay has sparked a great deal of uncertainty and led to an estimated loss of over $15 billion annually in lost investments to Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry. With the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy picking up pace, the passage of the PIB may just be too little, too late,\u201d the FDC report added.\n\nIt said it was unlikely that Nigeria would be able to make up for either the lost time or the lost investment, adding that information available to it suggests that the bill is currently undergoing last-minute modifications in three key areas to enhance its effectiveness.\n\nIt listed the areas as the deregulation of the price of gas supplied to power plants, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s (NNPC\u2019s) public offer and the adoption of a single regulator for the industry.\n\nAccording to the report, price deregulation of gas supplied to power plants is a key ingredient in incentivising power output in Nigeria.\n\nHe added that while this is likely to translate to increased tariffs for electricity, it is needed to attract investment in both the gas and electricity generating industry.\n\nOn the NNPC\u2019s public offer, it stated that selling shares to the public will mean that the corporation will be able to source its own funding and come under a higher level of corporate governance and scrutiny.\n\nBesides, it said while the adoption of a single regulator would ensure more efficiency and allow for enhanced cohesion in regulating the entire industry value chain, the PIB as currently constructed, recommended two regulators-one for the upstream and another for the midstream and downstream sectors.\n\nFDC said it envisaged a situation where the PIB could also become a source of acrimony as it gives legal backing to the complete price deregulation of the downstream segment of the oil and gas industry.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), made up of the governors of the 36 states, has proposed the implementation of the full deregulation of the downstream oil industry and determined that the pump price of petrol will be somewhere around N385/litre (137.65 per cent above the current fuel pump price of N165/litre).\n\n\u201cWhile this will bring relief to the state governments that have been grappling with lower revenues, the chance of the federal government allowing such a spike in the near term is slim because of the negative impact on the poor.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy will cripple the government\u2019s finances if sustained, but deregulation is the only way to unlock domestic refining. There is simply no easy way around or through the dilemma. Something is going to have to give.\u201d\n\nThe report said the International Oil Companies (IOCs) were already squarely in the thick of the energy transition, while some were on well laid-out paths that would see them fully evolve to clean-energy companies.\n\nFor instance, it stated that Royal Dutch Shell is in talks with the federal government to divest from its onshore oil fields and focus on its offshore and gas operations citing recurring incidents of theft, sabotage, and oil spillage.\n\n\u201cThe IOCs have stated that Nigerian onshore business is incompatible with their long-term strategy, which focuses on climate change and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,\u201d the FDC document said.\n\nFDC added that foreign oil companies have been gradually disposing of their onshore assets over the last decade, emphasising that beyond the obvious reasons of insecurity and unrest in the Niger Delta stated by Shell, the protracted stalemate in passing the PIB remains a major factor in the oil giant\u2019s decision to exit its onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nWith slightly under 40 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s crude and condensate production capacity, FDC stated that while Shell\u2019s move to offload its onshore oil fields could have implications on Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas output, it could also send wrong signals to international investors considering doing business in Nigeria.\n\nIt added: \u201cOther IOCs, Chevron and Mobil, have also begun to gradually dispose of their Nigerian assets in response to their changing goals and strategies, which have been influenced by climate change and the need to go green. A number of questions arise.\n\n\u201cWhat will happen to Shell\u2019s onshore assets? Are they going to be acquired by the NNPC through its upstream arm, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) or does the government invite bids from indigenous and foreign producers?\n\n\u201cDo the indigenous producers have the capacity to acquire these assets even as we expect more divestments in the future across the continent? Does this create an opportunity for indigenous players in the oil and gas sector to grow the continental footprint?\u201d\n\nThe report noted that it remains uncertain how the events will play out, adding that what is certain is that the passage of the PIB should have happened at least a decade ago and would have been crucial in the federal government\u2019s drive to achieve production of 4mbpd and domestic oil refining for regional exports.\n\nOPEC: Nigeria\u2019s Oil Production Hit Record Low in May\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria\u2019s crude oil production output hit record low levels in May, the June Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has shown.\n\nThe monthly report indicated that in the first quarter of 2021, Nigeria\u2019s average production was 1.410 million barrels per day.\n\nApril production stood at 1.460mbpd and it was 1.388 barrels per day in May, leading to the loss of 72,000 daily barrels during the month.\n\nBut based on direct communication with OPEC, the cartel put the figure at 1.429 million barrels per day in March, 1.372 barrels per day in April and 1.344 mbpd in May, resulting in a shortage of 28,000 barrels between April and May.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear why production has remained low even after the country announced earlier in the year that it had fully complied with the OPEC cuts after defaulting initially and the cartel\u2019s decision to gradually open the taps since April.\n\nThe country\u2019s average crude oil production based on secondary sources was 1.78 Mbpd in 2019 and 1.57mbpd in 2020, while total OPEC 13-member crude oil production averaged 25.46 mb/d during May.\n\n\u201cIn May 2021, production was up by 0.39 mb/d m-o-m. Crude oil output increased mainly in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran, while production decreased primarily in Nigeria and Angola,\u201d OPEC said.\n\nIn terms of oil rig count, Nigeria\u2019s total was 13 in 2018, 16 in 2019 and 11 in 2020, according to the report, but the number of operational rigs fell to five in April and rose by one to six rigs last month.\n\nThe OPEC report showed that Africa\u2019s demand for crude oil was 3.43 million bpd in 2019, which fell to a 4.37million bpd in Q1, 2020. It further fell to 3.76 million bpd in Q2,2020, was 3.94 mbpd in Q3,2020 and 4.27 mbpd in Q4, 2020.\n\nThe MOMR indicated that Nigeria\u2019s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) advanced 0.5 per cent y-o-y in Q1, 2021, following a 0.1 per cent y-o-y rise in the last quarter of 2021.\n\nIt said the country registered the second consecutive quarterly growth since Nigeria\u2019s economy faced recession in the third quarter of 2020, amid the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and an improvement in oil prices.\n\nOPEC added: \u201cNon-oil sector expanded 0.8 per cent y-o-y in 1Q21 following a 1.7 per cent y-o-y growth in 4Q20. The current growth was powered by the agriculture sector, which expanded by 2.3 per cent y-o-y.\n\n\u201cIndustrial activity moved back into the growth of 0.9 per cent y-o-y, after dropping by 5.6 per cent on average in 2020. Moreover, the annual inflation rate declined to 18.12 per cent in April 2021, from a four-year high of 18.17 per cent in March, but producer inflation accelerated to a significantly high level, amid raw material shortages and unfavourable exchange rate depreciation.\u201d\n\nThe report said Nigeria\u2019s business sentiment remained optimistic, driven by the current expansion in manufacturing operations as well as higher oil prices.\n\nBut OPEC stuck to its prediction of a strong world oil demand recovery in 2021 led by the United States and China despite uncertainties stemming from the pandemic, pointing to a need for more oil from the producer group.\n\nThe cartel said demand would rise by 6.6 per cent or 5.95 million barrels per day this year, remaining unchanged for a second consecutive month, despite a slower-than-expected recovery in the first half of this year.\n\n\u201cGlobal economic recovery has been delayed due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and renewed lockdowns in key economies, including the Eurozone, Japan and India.\n\n\u201cOverall, the recovery in global economic growth, and hence oil demand is expected to gain momentum in the second half,\u201d OPEC said in the monthly report.\n\nThe cartel stated that it sees 2021 world economic growth at 5.5 per cent, unchanged from last month, assuming the impact of the pandemic will have been \u201clargely contained\u201d by the beginning of the second half.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing vaccination efforts, a growing share of recovered cases leading to increasing herd immunity, and the easing of lockdown restrictions lend optimism that the pandemic could be contained in the few months to come,\u201d OPEC said.\n\nIn April, OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, had agreed to gradually ease oil output cuts from May to July and confirmed the decision at a meeting on June 1.\n\nThe report showed higher OPEC oil output, reflecting the decision to pump more and gains from Iran, which is exempted from making voluntary cuts due to U.S. sanctions, increasing May output to 390,000 bpd to hit 25.46 million daily production from the oil cartel.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Public perception of Buhari changed after ARISE Television interview, says Tinubu\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nA former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has said that the federal government must restructure the country in the interest and the survival of the nation.\n\nOyegun spoke in Abuja on Saturday night at the public presentation of a book titled, \u2018APC\u2019s Litmus Tests\u2019 written by the Director-General of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman.\n\nThe former Edo State governor said it was vital that these issues should be addressed as the country cannot continue to allow the subject to become a recurring threat.\n\nAlso, National Leader of APC, Senator Bola Tinubu, said the public perception of President Muhammadu Buhari had changed after his interview with ARISE NEWS Channel. He added that the face-off between Odigie-Oyegun\u2019s successor, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole, and Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, was a collateral damage for the party.\n\nOdigie-Oyegun stated that there was no question that the nation and its political parties were going through difficult times, adding that all those at the formation of the APC knew the uniqueness of the party\u2019s constitution and its manifesto that promised change.\n\nAccording to him, the forces of economics have made things, not quite the way the party wanted them to be.\n\nHe said the document the APC produced on true federalism, which passed through all the organs of the party was produced because there was a cacophony of voices over the issue of restructuring.\n\nHe said at that time, just as it is happening now, two people could not agree on what they meant by restructuring and the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went as far as having some drafts legislation.\n\nOdigie-Oyegun said it was not by any chance a perfect document, but it reflected the thinking and the desires of Nigerians.\n\nHe stated: \u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond that. We now have one or two things that did not happen before. People now want to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child asks for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it is cake he wants and we must not as a political party, we must not as the government of the federation give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAs a progressive government, it is proper that we show the nation that when the people want some degree of change, the party should be responsive to it and should address it.\u201d\n\nOdigie-Oyegun added: \u201cCompromises have to be made, there\u2019s no question about that. The report itself is not final. It still has to go through the litmus test of compromises. The ideas of people from different parts of the country will be different up to the extent they want to go with the proposals in the document, but it is necessary. It must be mandatory in the interest of the survival of our nation, that these issues be addressed. We cannot continue to allow the subject to become something that threatens our nation at any turn.\u201d\n\nChairman of PGF and Governor of Kebbi State, Senator Atiku Bagudu, said the party was not shy to acknowledge that the country\u2019s constitution was not perfect hence the setting up of Governor Nasir el-Rufai Committee on true federalism.\n\nHe said: \u201cAPC believes in letting us amend the constitution because society is dynamic not because somebody has been wronged and cheated. If that is the basis for correction, then the agitation will never stop but if it\u2019s based on let us make it better.\u201d\n\nBagudu stated that there are fundamental challenges to be addressed, stressing that the ruling party will not shy away from acknowledging them and providing transparent leadership.\n\nHe said there was a need to increase Nigeria\u2019s budget to $300 billion or $500 billion to be able to fix the nation\u2019s challenges in the various sectors.\n\nComparing Nigeria\u2019s budget with the United States, a country with 331 million people, Bagudu said you would find that in 2019, the US budget was over $3.5 trillion and one per cent of $3.5 trillion is $35 billion.\n\nAccording to him, that means Nigeria\u2019s budget is less than one per cent of the US\u2019 budget despite having a population that is about 70 per cent of the United States population.\n\nThe governor added: \u201cIf one considers the actual distribution of revenue, it even reflects the truth. For example, from January to May, the Federation Allocation Account Committee meetings, there is no month yet, where the equivalent of $2 billion has been distributed. So, if things go this way that means $24 billion will be distributed by the three tiers of government.\n\n\u201cBut our quest includes expanding our horizon so that we can see how we will move the $35 billion federal budget to $300 billion or $500 billion federal budget because only then, can we meet some of our expectations, some of our aspirations in all sectors.\u201d\n\nThe governor said that before then, the country would continue to struggle to find enough money for security, health, education, stressing that part of APC\u2019s litmus test was to communicate this properly to Nigerians so that in making choices, they would not be blinded by promises.\n\nRepresented by former National Legal Adviser of APC, Mr. Babatunde Ogala (SAN), Tinubu said the public perception of the president had changed since last Thursday\u2019s interview aired by ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers.\n\nHe stated: \u201cAfter the interview of the president with ARISE NEWS, the perception of the public has changed. Yet those who will not see good will never see it.\n\n\u201cHave we sold our party and the achievements of this government enough \u2013 I think not.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 devastated the whole world. It\u2019s even a bigger form of insecurity than even the banditry that we have made a big issue of. We all saw India, we saw Ecuador where people were counting corpses of their relatives as their own luggage. We all knew their predictions for Africa, how well have we sold these achievements to the public.\u201d\n\nOn the clash between Oshiomhole and Obaseki that cost APC Edo State in the last governorship election in the state, Tinubu said he was one of those who facilitated behind-the-scene visits to Lagos \u2013 by Obaseki and by APC governors \u201cbecause we knew the consequences for our party. Whether you like it or not, it was collateral damage for all of us.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhatever our party has gone through in the last eight years, we are still facing a lot of challenges. They\u2019ve called our party different names, some even predicted that we are not going to have 12 months or 24 months.\n\n\u201cAnd if I must say, a party that has gone through eight years, it\u2019s still an infant. There will still be more of these tests \u2013 disagreement, misunderstanding, realignment but one thing is that you are part of the intellectual content of our party.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

For the past few days, I have not been able to eat, let alone sleep. Since I lost my joy last October, life has been miserable for me and the other victims. As you are seeing us all, none of us is happy. Our children asked us for the remains of their fathers almost every day but we kept promising them. We need the corpses of our husbands. Police should release them for us. We cannot feed our children. We have withdrawn them from school.\n\n\"We heard they have sent cheques for entitlements of our husbands but the insurance company handling it has yet to release them for us. We approached the police commissioner but she said she didn't have our files with her because her predecessor didn't leave them. We called her predecessor but he didn't answer our calls.\n\n\"We want police authorities to release them to us, even if it is their carcasses, we shall accept them and bury them. It will serve as evidence for our children when they grow old. We are troubled and Nigeria must not add to our woes. We want the federal government, state government, well-to-do persons in Nigeria and human rights activists to intervene in our matter,\" she said.",

          "text": "Ita Enang, senior special assistant to the president on Niger Delta affairs, says the failure of governors to release funds to local governments is the cause of security challenges in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said this while speaking on Good Morning Nigeria, a programme on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), on Monday.\n\nAccording to him, the efforts of President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle insecurity have been frustrated by governors, who are spending funds that should be allocated to their local governments.\n\nHe added that if the governors allocate the necessary funds and internally generated revenue to their respective local governments \u2014 thereby reaching the people at the grassroots \u2014 there will be peace in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe governors have exercised so much powers that are beyond what the constitution envisaged for them \u2014 beyond what the law gave to them. The president has kept within his powers as president and does not interfere with the funds of the state governments. The governors have interfered and kidnapped the funds of the local governments through what is called the state/local government joint account,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t even give to the local governments the monies that they realise as internally generated revenue, which is why the joint account was made \u2014 internally generated revenue plus the statutory allocation, you add it and distribute to the local governments.\n\n\u201cNow, the insecurity problem we have today, the governors cannot escape the criticism of the people because everybody is a witness. If the governors allow the monies of the local governments to get to the local governments, the local governments would have been able to at least capture within their net, certain persons of certain class at that local government level. They will be seen as a tier of government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf the governors had given the monies meant for local governments, there would be agriculture at that level; there would be some intervention in infrastructure at that level; there would be governance at that level. What happens today is that chairmen of local governments and local government officers only go to work when there is allocation.\n\n\u201cIf governors would take the monies of local governments, and when they face insecurity, they say \u2018President Buhari\u2019. Then-President Buhari will be applying the federal government allocation to fund the armed forces \u2014 the security agencies going to every spot to intervene.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, each of these spots belongs to a local government, or a state, and the states will believe that they can deal with local governments the way they are dealing with them, and then have peace? You cannot have peace.\u201d",

          "text": "Ethiopia has announced a tender process for the sale of a 40% stake in state-owned telecommunications company, Ethio Telecom. That means potential investors can now register their interest starting Tuesday. This is the first stage in a lengthy process that will lead to the selection of a successful bidder.\n\nThe proposed minority sale of the carrier is part of a broader plan to liberalise the country\u2019s monopolistic telecoms sector. In addition, two foreign carriers are to be granted licenses to operate in the hugely untapped market.\n\n\u201cThe government wants state-owned enterprises to be competitive and productive, the authorities\u2019 motivation for selling a part of Ethio Telecom to private operators,\u201d Deputy Director of Public Enterprises, Holding and Administration Agency, Zinabu Yirga, said at a press conference in the capital Addis Ababa on Monday. \u201cAs part of the broader opening up of the sector, Ethiopia is also moving to license private operators to compete with Ethio Telecom.\u201d\n\nAnnounced in 2019 and driven by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the liberalisation plan has been met with several delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic and an internal crisis in the Tigray region.\n\nHowever, the plan has gathered pace over the past six months. In May, the government awarded one of the two available private operating licences to break up Ethio Telecom\u2019s monopoly on the sector.\n\nThe Global Partnership for Ethiopia, a telco-consortium led by Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, was announced as the winner after a successful bid of around $850 million. Meanwhile, a second offer of around $600 million from South Africa\u2019s MTN Group was deemed too low by the regulator, which is now preparing to reauction the final licence.\n\nAccording to Brook Taye, a senior advisor at the finance ministry, the 40% in Ethio Telecom will be sold as a single stake to a single investor. It is however unclear how much the stake would be worth but the tender process is sure to attract significant interest from many telcos around the world.\n\nThis is due to the attractiveness of Ethiopia\u2019s untapped telecoms market. In a population of over 100 million people, only about 20% have access to the Internet, less than 40% have a mobile phone and only 5.8% of the people use social media, according to a report from DataReportal.\n\nFounded in November 2010, Ethio Telecom currently has around 53 million subscribers and has since December generated a revenue of around $600 million. According to reports, the government plans to retain a 55% stake in the operator while the remaining 5% will be offered to domestic investors through an initial public offering.",

          "title": "Here are ten VPNs you can use in Nigeria",
          "text": "Virtual private networks (VPNs) have been around for a long time but have become more popular recently. Whether you want to use it to watch a show that\u2019s not available in your country or access a site that\u2019s been banned by the government, there\u2019s one question that most people have had to deal with: Which VPN should I use?\n\nIt can be daunting to choose from the hundreds, if not thousands, of VPN services available. So we\u2019ve come up with a list of ten reputable VPN services you can use.\n\nExpress VPN\n\nExpressVPN is rated highly because of its very fast speeds across over 3,000 remote servers in 160 locations and 94 countries. It provides advanced security on both apps and servers.\n\nIts high quality comes at a price. The lowest monthly plan is priced at $6.67, making it slightly more expensive than its rivals. It\u2019s also currently unavailable on the Nigerian App Store.\n\nA user TechCabal spoke to said, \u201cI\u2019ve been using ExpressVPN for over a year now, mostly to watch Netflix from other countries. I also use it for HBO Max and Disney+. I\u2019ve had to move to another VPN because I need to use it on my phone \u201d\n\nNord VPN\n\nUnlike ExpressVPN, NordVPN is available on the Nigerian App Store, it has one of the fastest speeds on the market and it\u2019s cheaper than ExpressVPN: Its lowest price is $4.89/month. It has more than 5,200 servers in 62 countries.\n\nNordVPN has a feature that ExpressVPN doesn\u2019t have, it\u2019s called VPN chaining. It routes your traffic through two servers, encrypting data packets twice. A helpful security feature, but it slows down your connection.\n\nProton VPN\n\nProton has the best free subscription in the market. Unlike NordVPN and ExpressVPN, the first subscription tier of ProtonVPN is its free VPN offering, which includes just three VPN server locations (Japan, Netherlands, and the US). It has over 1,246 Servers in 55 countries.\n\nThis free subscription offers unlimited browsing bandwidth but at slower internet speeds. It only allows one device to be connected at a time and also has few server locations compared to most other VPN providers.\n\nTunnelBear\n\nTunnelBear offers its users both free and paid VPN services. However, the free version is only limited to 500MB/month bandwidth.\n\nIt\u2019s not as fast as ExpressVPN and NordVPN but has a decent speed. It has servers in 22 locations, which means fewer options for its users.\n\nA user Techcabal spoke to said, \u201cI started using Tunnelbear, but I\u2019m being very Nigerian about it so I refuse to pay after I exhaust my 500MB limit in a few days.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t do much on the internet, TunnelBear would be a good fit.\n\nWindscribe VPN\n\nJust like TunnelBear, Windscribe VPN has a free version and it gives 10GB free every month. It\u2019s safe and secure to use. It works on most devices and most streaming services. It has 180 servers in over 63 countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve moved to Windscribe. They give 10GB free every month, so that\u2019s nice.\u201d A user TechCabal spoke to said, \u201cThe only thing is it definitely drains my battery. I don\u2019t like the mental stress of having to connect to a VPN before opening Twitter, then having to remember to turn it off before I do other things like open YouTube. I opened YouTube earlier today from Dallas, Texas and it loaded straight into 1080p. I was shocked. Americans are enjoying themselves. I hate this VPN life. Also having to remember to turn off my VPN before I use my bank app. \u201c\n\nIPVanish\n\nIPVanish stands out because it allows unlimited simultaneous connections. It has over 500 servers spread across 55 countries.\n\nIt has no free version. It costs $10 per month, or $77.99 billed annually. You can alternatively opt to pay $26.99 every three months.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t allow for more customisation and it has a confusing privacy policy.\n\nCyberGhost\n\nCyberGhost has been around for a while and it serves more than 15 million users. It boasts 6,700+ servers in 110+ locations across 90 countries. That\u2019s far more than all others.\n\nCyberGhost offers a VPN service for virtually every device out there but it\u2019s more expensive than a few others. It costs $12.99 per month, $47.94 for six months and $49.50 for eighteen months. Additionally, a student discount is available, the cost of the student offering is $2.75 per month, and you\u2019ll have to sign on to a year-long contract.\n\nPsiphon\n\nThis VPN separates itself away from the pack by not needing an email address to use it. You can download the free app (on all platforms except MacOS, Linux, or routers) and start using it immediately. It uses an open-source code which increases transparency\n\nA downside is that because it\u2019s free, it has a very small server network \u2013 a little over 20 countries. It\u2019s slower than other alternatives out there. It doesn\u2019t work with Netflix or torrenting. It explicitly says that it\u2019s not a privacy tool.\n\nPsiphon is supported by ads, and it does share statistics with sponsors so they can see, for example, how often their sites are visited through Psiphon and from which countries. These are further aggregated by date, sponsor and region. All of the data Psiphon collects is discarded after 60 days.\n\nSurfShark\n\nSurfshark has been around for roughly a year now. It offers a safe and private connection. It\u2019s available on many platforms. Its speed is pretty good.\n\nIt has over 1,000 servers in more than 61 countries. For a relatively new service provider, this is a very large network and something that many VPN service providers haven\u2019t achieved even after years in the business.\n\nYou can use SurfShark on unlimited devices and its lowest price per month is $2.49/ for 2 years.\n\nPrivate VPN\n\nPrivateVPN is a great all-rounder with excellent privacy and high speeds. Its reliable connections and ability to unblock sites like Netflix make it ideal for streaming. It can also be used to torrent and works well in China.\n\nWith only around 200 servers, it\u2019s still pretty much a good choice. It\u2019s lowest monthly cost is $2.08.\n\nThat\u2019s all from us. These are our top ten VPNs. Which other VPNs do you use and what do you like or don\u2019t like about them?",

          "text": "When Pearl\u00e9 Nwaezeigwe is not busy creating policies that protect African users on TikTok, she spends most of her time planning for her future, creating inspirational videos targeted at young people with ambitious career goals, and settling into her new community in Ireland.\n\nTikTok\u2019s presence and influence cannot be denied in Africa. The app is perfect for hyper-creative content creators who know their way around editing tools and special effects. But even amateur video creators, dancers, and comedians are also making waves and growing their TikTok following every day. As TikTok\u2019s popularity soars, the company is intentional about creating policies that protect both creators and viewers.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Pearl\u00e9 to Centre Stage because I\u2019m inspired by how dedicated she is to honing her craft, learning more about product policy, and fighting for human rights. As a social activist, Pearl\u00e9 isn\u2019t afraid to speak against policies that harm our fundamental human rights, making her the perfect fit for her role at TikTok.\n\nFor the love of TikTok in Africa\n\nWhat about TikTok\u2019s presence in Africa excites you?\n\nPearl\u00e9: It\u2019s exciting to see how well the creative industry is thriving and booming, especially on TikTok. I feel very inspired when I see creators showcasing their many talents on our platform. And TikTok videos go beyond captions and hashtags \u2013 creators have to bring their A-game and capture multiple viewers\u2019 attention within the first ten seconds and keep them watching for up to a minute. Also, African TikTokers are showing us that we all have shared experiences. They are also showing the world how diverse Africans at home and in the diaspora.\n\nWhat kind of freedom does TikTok give to African content creators?\n\nPearl\u00e9: It gives them the freedom to showcase how rich our culture is and how talented we are as a people. Nigerian and South African creators are especially famous for their dance and comedic videos. TikTok gives them the opportunity to be as expressive as they want to be as long as they stick to our community guidelines.\n\nLet\u2019s get personal\n\nTell me about the last good book you read?\n\nPearl\u00e9: A lot of people find self-help and motivational books very cheesy, but I enjoy reading them.\n\nI recently read \u2018You Are a Badass\u2019. I like the way the book was written because it does not contain a lot of rules and regulations. She uses storytelling to encourage her readers to focus on what matters and the beauty of life. I also love that each chapter ends with a reminder to love yourself and the special parts of you.\n\n\u2018Loud black girls\u2019 is next on my list. It contains a compilation of short stories by different black women living in the UK. The book delves into their experiences with living, working and navigating life in the UK. I\u2019ve always seen the black and POC experience from the lenses of women living in Nigeria and the US, but Loud Black Girls opened my eyes to see how black women deal with racism and microaggression in the UK. \u201c\n\nWhat are some of your favourite accounts on social media?\n\nPearl\u00e9: I tell people that I am obsessed with The Verge because they have a section dedicated to Tech Policy. I\u2019m a policy nerd. I also read TC Daily and I have to say, it\u2019s exciting to see how much innovation is coming out of Africa. For tech policy related news and updates, I follow Wired, MITTech, and Access Now.\n\nWho are your favourite content creators?\n\nPearl\u00e9: Beyonc\u00e9, obviously. I also follow Shesecures, Useshukran, and Fbeinghumble on social media. On TikTok, I enjoy watching King Science. He uses animated videos to address sensitive topics and create content that is easy to digest and understand.\n\nInfusing creativity, learning new skills and making an impact\n\nWhat kind of skills do you need to be successful in your role?\n\nPearl\u00e9: Firstly, you need a fundamental understanding of human rights. We want people to express themselves and feel inspired to create but we also want them to feel safe on our platform.\n\nSecondly, you need to understand the local context. The trends that are peculiar to one region will be different from the rising trends in a different region. We have to pay close attention to gender, religious, and cultural nuances. Most of the popular trends we see on TikTok are fun, but some have potential to be harmful.\n\nLastly, you need to research industry standards. We aren\u2019t as focused on competition as much as we are on collaboration. There are trends that crossover from other social media platforms into TikTok \u2013 which isn\u2019t unusual \u2013 but we have to ensure that crossover trends don\u2019t harm or impede our users\u2019 privacy and rights.\n\nWhat impactful lessons have you learned on the job so far?\n\nPearl\u00e9: My dad calls me an activist because I like (non-violently) fighting for people. When I think about impact, I think about the fact that I see the policies we create getting enacted in real time. The speed at which we push these policies matters because our users need to feel safe at all times. I\u2019m especially excited that the policies we come up with are focused on protecting creators in Sub-saharan Africa.\n\nWhat is your role teaching you about content creation?\n\nPearl\u00e9: I\u2019ve learned that content creation has many layers. When I think about the time that goes into creating a really dope animated video or beauty vlog, I appreciate how much creators put into giving us their best works. You might watch a one minute animated video on TikTok without realizing how much effort went into putting it together. I\u2019d say watching these TikTokers create magic is my favourite part of the job.\n\nWhat makes TikTok stand out from other content creation platforms?\n\nPearl\u00e9: I can\u2019t speak for other platforms but TikTok draws a lot of Gen-Z and millennial creators. Again, people feel safe on our platform. When creators come on TikTok, we give them the tools they need to express themselves without fear of being shut down, threatened, or abused. It\u2019s better to create from a place of freedom than fear.\n\nHow do you infuse creativity into your role?\n\nPearl\u00e9: Watching TikTok videos inspires me to keep going and encourages me to do more at work. When you see the policies you create getting executed and doing what they\u2019ve been designed to do, it inspires a level of creativity within you.\n\nWhy is product policy important to the creative tech industry in Sub-Saharan Africa?\n\nPearl\u00e9: For us, as product policy managers, we are at the centre of every company. People like me are responsible for seeing all sides to the story. Yes, we see the creative side of things, but we also have to consider safety and security. Big tech companies still have a long way to go where product policy is concerned. Our ecosystem is very funding and investment-focused \u2013 which I understand because capital is essential \u2013 but policy and security are equally important.",

          "title": "Top Three Nigerian Stocks for Sustainable Investors",
          "text": "Socially responsible investors put principles before profit. They choose stocks of corporations known for fair and sustainable practices. Environmental protection, animal rights and the absence of workplace discrimination are in the spotlight. Only some companies in Nigeria have praiseworthy policies. So, which stocks are sustainable?\n\nDangote Cement\n\nDangote, a construction and manufacturing giant, follows sustainable procedures throughout its project cycle. Its policies bring benefits to the environment, community, and economy. This is an exception, as the industry, in general, is responsible for massive pollution and depletion of natural resources.\n\nSo, what exactly does the company do? Dangote is committed to green growth \u2014 development through eco-friendly activities. Its corporate culture is data-centric and sustainable.\n\nThe staff collect data via Microsoft SharePoint to ensure its integrity. The group provides full-time study leave for its employees, which is a rare benefit. In 2018, it provided training for almost 10,000 employees across sites and headquarters.\n\nAnother example is the company\u2019s safe work initiative. It reduces the frequency of accidents and near misses. Meanwhile, employees providing customer service commit excellence across value chains.\n\nThe company supports small and medium enterprises. It has paid over 3 billion nairas for 125 trucks for its distributors and provided a 5-year payback period. Finally, the company\u2019s key subsidiary, Dangote Cement, has a range of sustainable operations.\n\nFirst, it repurposes its own waste, which is used to generate power for the kiln. Secondly, fractional mineral traces from waste are used instead of primary minerals in cement production. The shares of Dangote Cement are some of the most sustainable. If you invest through the Forextime Forex trading app, they will make a great addition to your portfolio.\n\nSterling Bank\n\nThe sustainable policies of Sterling Bank allow it to prevent credit fraud and reduce its own carbon footprint. They include systems for environmental management and management of social risks. The company has a range of energy-saving projects.\n\nThe bank recycles its waste in cooperation with a recycling agency and waste management services of Lagos. It abides by the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights. The campaign includes competitions between creative entrepreneurs focused on the use of recycled materials. The winner receives 1 million nairas for their startup.\n\nThe bank has reduced its carbon footprint by turning to renewable energy. Its branches in Nigeria and abroad use more sustainable sources of power. The company has been involved in solar and hybrid power projects. At the moment, such policies have been implemented by 10 branches.\n\nAside from environmental sustainability, the bank has improved its social and financial impact. All stakeholders receive regular updates, and the company boosts engagement through social media. Sterling Bank has an impressive 3.1% deposit market share and a 12.6% capital adequacy ratio.\n\nFidelity Bank\n\nFidelity Bank abides by the international bill on human rights. It also complies with the principles of banking sustainability of the Central Bank of Nigeria. These include promotion of financial inclusion, women\u2019s empowerment through inclusive workplace culture, and minimization of environmental impact.\n\nThe bank\u2019s mission is to make financial services accessible to all groups of customers. Its operations contribute to the reduction of poverty in Nigeria and sustainable economic development overall. The Environmental Social\n\nGovernance practices for the basis of the bank\u2019s policies; the lending services and decisions are focused on three aspects: economic viability, environmental responsibility and social relevance. Fidelity Bank acts in line with local and international standards. These include The Nigerian Sustainable Banking Principles (NSBP), Equator Principles and the\n\nInternational Finance Corporations (IFC) Performance Standards.\n\nSustainable Investment in Nigeria\n\nThese are three examples of sustainable stocks in Nigeria. These should be considered by local investors with a focus on eco-friendly practices. They are often added to multi-asset portfolios. Stocks may be combined with Forex trading and derivative trading.\n\nWhen socially responsible companies disclose their practices, this contributes to the transparency of opportunities and risks. The country\u2019s manufacturing brands, conglomerates and commercial banks provide annual sustainability reports. These help investors decide whether their stocks are worth buying.\n\nFor socially responsible individuals, profitability is not the first priority. They allocate their capital based on multiple factors. These include the company\u2019s relationships with customers and staff, the treatment of animals, and the environment. The general public must have access to full descriptions of the values, assets, and policies of an enterprise.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "#WorldBloodDonorDay: 5 startups improving access to safe blood in Africa",
          "text": "You don\u2019t need to be a medical expert to know the value of blood to humans. At a basic level, most people understand that the absence of blood in a human is fatal, yet blood donation rates in most African countries are low.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 112.5 million blood donations are collected worldwide. Still, more than half of this number is gathered in high-income countries \u2014 home to only 19% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nWorryingly, the United Nations estimates that more than 536,000 women die during childbirth, with 99% of them living in developing countries. Postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of deaths, responsible for 40% of maternal deaths in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nBlood donation and supply remain major challenges in Africa as health officials battle logistical problems and cultural barriers. Consequently, family and friends donate most of the blood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not sustainable as family and friends of accident victims, for example, may not be readily available to donate blood. Worse still, they may not be matching blood donors.\n\nSolving Africa\u2019s blood donation problem requires more than calling for voluntary donors. In most places, officials have to contend with superstitions or cultural limitations that make people unwilling to donate.\n\nAlso, the infrastructure needed to transport the blood is often absent in most parts of the continent. With Africa\u2019s infrastructure challenges, it is difficult to say how many lives have been lost because they lacked access to blood.\n\nWHO advises that most of the blood donated come from voluntary donors, but that is not the case in all countries, especially in developing ones.\n\nIn Nigeria, the National Coordinator of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS), Dr Omale Amedu, revealed that only 5% of the blood collected in the country were from voluntary donors, with the remaining 95% commercially provided.\n\nMost African countries can\u2019t meet their annual blood requirements and increase millions of women, children, and accident victims\u2019 risk of mortality (ROM). In 2016, WHO estimated that Africa only covered 50% of its blood requirements.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Ministry of Health, for example, reports that the country needs 2 million units of blood annually but only collects 60,000 units. Cameroon, on the other hand, needs about 400,000 units of blood but collects only 90,000 units. The trend of supply failing to meet demand is common across Africa.\n\nThe startups below are using technology to solve the problems blood banks and hospitals face and close the gap between supply and demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLifebank\n\nTemie Giwa-Tubosun founded Lifebank in 2016. After suffering complications during pregnancy and needing a blood transfusion in the United States, she began to think of the millions of women back in Nigeria who could have lost their lives if they had been in her shoes.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with CNN, the entrepreneur said, \u201cI realised after I had my son that the highest cause of maternal mortality is postpartum haemorrhage. The most important thing you can do when a mum is haemorrhaging is replacing the blood she has lost, even if you can\u2019t stop the bleeding.\u201d\n\nThis epiphany was all she needed to start Lifebank to connect blood banks with hospitals and their patients. Since its inception, the startup has reportedly served over 500 hospitals while maintaining a presence in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nIt has also expanded its operations from moving only blood to other medical supplies like oxygen and blood products.\n\nThe startup has gained global recognition, with Facebook Founder, Mark Zuckerberg, commenting on the startup.\n\n\u201cThis is a thing [Lifebank] that needs to exist. If she can actually pull it off, she\u2019ll show a model that will impact not just Lagos, not just Nigeria, but countries all around the world.\u201d\n\nInfiuss\n\nWhile Cameroonian entrepreneur, Melissa Jane Bime, was in nursing school, a young girl at the hospital where she worked who had come down with malaria could not get a blood transfusion. She died as a result. Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite in Africa accounting for 99.7% of estimated malaria cases in 2018. It multiplies very quickly, causing serious blood loss.\n\nBime would later ascertain that a hospital 20 minutes away had the right blood all along. That was all the motivation she needed.\n\nIn 2016, Bime started Infiuss, a blood bank management system that connects hospitals with blood banks with hospitals without a blood bank. The startup is the recipient of the 2018 Cartier Women\u2019s Initiative Award and was the grand prize winner of the 2018 Anzisha Prize.\n\nDamu-Sasa\n\nAfter Nairobi\u2019s Westgate terror attack in 2013, the government appealed for blood donations to save survivors. And thousands of Kenyans turned up, but there was a problem. Although many people around the country were willing to donate, logistical challenges meant that only those in Nairobi could.\n\nThis led Francis Kilemi and Aaron Ogunde to create a solution that leverages technology to solve the problems of sourcing and donating blood.\n\nWith help from Kenya\u2019s Information and Communication Technology Authority, the startup piloted the project in Kenyatta Hospital in 2017. Since then, their reach has spread to over 100 hospitals across Kenya.\n\nDamu-Sasa is a Kenyan healthtech startup that works across the blood ecosystem. It connects hospitals with blood banks or donors and assists in screening, tracking, storage, distribution, preparation of blood products, and inventory management.\n\nRedbank\n\nRedbank homepage\n\nFounded in 2014 by Francis Adereti, Toluwanimi Adeyanju, and Tunde Ojediran, Redbank functions quite similarly to Lifebank.\n\nHowever, in addition to a mobile app, blood requests can be made via SMS and voice calls. The startup matches received requests with the appropriate blood banks. And according to the company, people can expect responses within 30 seconds of making their requests.\n\nUnlike other startups in the space, Redbank does not handle deliveries. It only provides information on which blood banks have the blood that is needed.\n\nThe startup has increased its reach by striking partnerships with the Nigerian Red Cross Society and the Blood Bank Society of Nigeria.\n\nHaima Health Initiative\n\nHaima Health Initiative homepage\n\nBukola Bolarinwa is a lawyer and a recipient of the Queen\u2019s Young Leader Award. As a child, her parents often told her there were things she could not do. But it was not until she was older she learnt why \u2014 she had sickle cell disease.\n\nWhile in law school, she became friends with Nkechi Azinge, who would go on to found the Sickle Cell Aid Foundation (SCAF). During this time, Bolarinwa volunteered at hospitals and discovered that sickle cell patients frequently needed blood transfusions.\n\nHowever, the hospitals often lacked sufficient blood. This led her to start Haima Health Initiative, which has evolved into an online voluntary blood donor register. It organises blood drives and educates people on the benefits of blood donation.\n\nWhile these startups are doing their part in ensuring that blood and blood products are available to those who need them, the success of their efforts depends on regular voluntary donors. According to WHO, 90% of people eligible to donate blood aren\u2019t doing so.\n\nResearch shows that one donated unit of blood can save up to three lives. We can\u2019t all build startups that save lives, but we can donate blood regularly and save lives in our little way.\n\nHappy World Blood Donor Day.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing,\n\nSouth Africa regulating cryptocurrency\n\nNigeria\u2019s new International Termination Rates\n\nToptal suing Andela\n\nSouth Africa inching closer to regulating cryptocurrency\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group (IFWG) has released a position paper calling for the regulation of the country\u2019s cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nEstablished in 2016, the IFWG is a regulatory sandbox set up by the South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB) \u2014 the country\u2019s apex bank \u2014 to understand the growing role of fintechs and innovation in its financial sector and explore how regulators can assess emerging risks and opportunities in the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe working group outlined 25 recommendations on a policy, legal, and regulatory framework for crypto assets and related activities.\n\nNot an endorsement: True to form, IFWG makes no deviations from its initial stance. It still does not recommend the use of cryptocurrency and advises caution.\n\nAny major difference? Probably not. Several African countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ghana, Mauritius, Kenya and South Africa \u2014 have been known to take a critical stance in the cryptocurrency arena. However, the government seems to be making moves to codify its intentions faster than others.\n\nInterestingly, this comes after the Central American nation of El Salvador announced the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in the country last week. It also follows the decision of countries such as Nigeria, China, Venezuela, Russia, North Korea to launch digital currencies.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, The crypto space will continue to see more controversies dog its steps.\n\nFor a more in-depth read, Check out South Africa Working Group Releases New Position Paper Calling for Regulation of Crypto Asset Providers\n\nNigeria\u2019s new International Termination Rates\n\nThe Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) has concluded plans to roll out a new Mobile International Termination Rate (ITR).\n\nThe Commission has finalised the process of determining the cost-based price of ITR to ensure healthy competition on traffic handling for voice services between local and international operators in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s ITR though? They are charges paid to local operators by international operators to terminate calls in Nigeria. Say your family member calls from America, the foreign telco has to pay a certain amount for ending the call on your local network.\n\nThe rates were last reviewed in 2016 from \u20a63.90/min to \u20a624.40/min (0.0095 cents/min to 0.059 cents/min) pending the result of the just concluded cost-based study.\n\nWhy does this matter? In 2018, Per The Punch call masking and SIM boxing fraud cost Nigeria $3 billion, and as Vice Chairman NCC, Umar Danbatta explained, investigations revealed the issue began immediately after it increased ITR in 2016\n\nCall masking and SIM boxing involve rerouting international calls illegally using a specialised box connected to the internet. The calls appear to be from local Nigerian numbers. You\u2019ve probably received such a call before.\n\nThis has been a long time coming. Although the NCC has not revealed the exact amount to be paid by foreign operators, this is undoubtedly good news for local operators who have suffered significant losses due to call masking and SIM boxing.\n\nToptal sues Andela\n\nPlentyWaka bus. Source: PlentyWaka Twitter\n\nToptal, a freelancing platform for software engineers, project managers, designers etc, has filed a lawsuit against direct competitor Andela and several ex-employees, alleging theft of trade secrets to create a perfect clone of its business.\n\nThese ex-employees include, Andela\u2019s current Vice President of Enterprise, Head of Talent Operations, Vice President of Product, and Executive Vice President of Talent Operations.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this is the fact that up until 2020, Andela\u2019s business model differed from Toptal\u2019s. The Nigerian-founded company decided to pivot into fully remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt had struggled with its initial model of creating physical hubs to train needed talents, laying off 420 junior developers in 2018 in three different African countries.\n\nIronically, Toptal and Andela\u2019s business model are pretty on par with freelancing platforms such as Fiverr, Upwork, Freelancer.\n\nThe US-based company is, however, claiming that its ex-employees, apart from revealing trade secrets, have stolen Toptal personnel, clients and talent.\n\nFear of competition? Toptal disagrees, but with a history that includes possibly disgruntled investors and employees, there might be more than meets the eye here.\n\nRead: Freelancer marketplace Toptal sues Andela and ex-employees, alleging theft of trade secrets\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nFrom ballot paper to blockchain ledger, can the tech behind Bitcoin heal Nigeria\u2019s democracy?

This is imperative because access to blood and blood components is an essential service that must be guaranteed if we are to make progress toward universal access to health and universal health coverage.\u201d\n\nHe however reassured that ongoing reforms in the Edo health sector, through the Edo Health Improvement Programme (Edo-HIP), would provide mechanisms to ensure patients in rural areas have access to safe blood.\n\nAccording to the WHO, \u201cWorld Blood Donor Day aims to raise global awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products for transfusion and of the critical contribution voluntary, unpaid blood donors make to national health systems.\n\n\u201cSafe blood and blood products and their transfusion are a critical aspect of care and public health. They save millions of lives and improve the health and quality of life of many patients every day. The need for blood is universal, but access to blood for all those who need it is not. Blood shortages are particularly acute in developing countries.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that everyone who needs safe blood has access to it, all countries need voluntary, unpaid donors who give blood regularly.

          "title": "UPDATED: Crisis deepens in Nigerian athletics as two factional leaders emerge",
          "text": "Two parallel elections were held in Kebbi and Abuja on Monday to elect leaders for the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN).\n\nOne of the elections produced Ibrahim Gusau as president while the other produced Tonobok Okowa as AFN president.\n\nMr Gusau was re-elected as AFN President at the 2021 Elective Congress of his faction in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi State, on Monday, June 14.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the Gusau-led AFN, he polled 20 votes while Uche Muoma got just two votes from the 22 delegates present at the venue.\n\nFor the position of 1st Vice President, North West Zonal Representative Sunday Adeleye got 15 votes to emerge the winner ahead of Solomon Abari who had four votes and Patrick Estate with three votes.\n\nFor the position of 2nd Vice President, Nneka Ikem polled 13 votes ahead of Esther Mallim who scored eight votes while Janet Wilson managed one vote.\n\nPatrick Estate (South-east), Paul Wakama (South-south), Solomon Abari (North-east) and Vitalis Lashimi (North-central) all emerged from their zones as representatives.\n\nOther members of the board include Olu Sule who is a representative of the Technical Officials and Coaches alongside Moses Suleiman as Athletes Representative.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Mr Gusau reportedly thanked the delegates for their support in making his first-term a success while counting on their continued support for the next four years.\n\nAbuja Election\n\nIn Abuja, Tonobok Okowa Of Delta State also emerged as the AFN President at the Elective Congress of the AFN faction recognised by Nigeria\u2019s sports ministry.\n\nThe congress took place at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium Abuja on Monday.\n\nThe congress was attended by 35 state chairpersons of the AFN, who had converged in Abuja since Saturday for the congress and elections.\n\nThe election was held following the sports ministry\u2019s invocation of section 10.4 of the 2017 AFN Constitution which led to the controversial dissolution of the Gusau-led board citing the expiration of its term.\n\nAccording to a statement received from the sports minister\u2019s office, the ministry\u2019s representatives, the Nigeria Olympics Committee (NOC) and Nigeria\u2019s Ambassador-designate to South Africa amongst others were observers at Monday\u2019s election in Abuja.\n\nIt is expected that the World Athletics (WA) and the Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) will, in the coming days, make categorical statements on which of the rival factions is legitimate.\n\nGenesis of crisis\n\nThough the AFN has had its fair share of crisis in the past, this current crisis began shortly after the Gusau-led board was inaugurated in 2017 by former sports minister, Solomon Dalung.\n\nWhile Mr Gusau\u2019s emergence as president was in itself widely challenged, the situation got worse with some of his early decisions termed as unpopular by his fellow board members.\n\nMr Gusau showed he was not comfortable with Olamide George as vice-president, and thus made his ally, Sunday Adeleye, the unofficial vice-president and technical director.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMessrs Gusau and Adeleye were also accused of diverting funds from a sponsorship deal entered into with PUMA. That allegation has not be proven.\n\nIn the heat of the crisis, a board meeting of AFN was called and Mr Gusau was removed as president and Mr George named the acting president. Since then, athletics and athletes in Nigeria have not known peace.\n\nMr Gusau went to court to challenge his removal and he was pronounced as the legal president but the sports ministry is challenging that ruling at the Supreme court.\n\nAfter a series of interventions by the World and Africa athletics governing bodies (WA and CAA), it was agreed that a fresh election that will unify the warring factions be held on Monday, June 14, in line with the 2017 constitution of the AFN to bring lasting peace.\n\nRather than bringing peace to the bleeding sports, Monday\u2019s factional elections appear to have opened another round of crisis in the athletics body.\n\nAnother twist\n\nInterestingly, Mr George, who headed the rival faction before now, appears to have been schemed out and is now realigning with the Gusau board.\n\nMr George complained about the guidelines for the Abuja election; alleging it was doctored to favour the anointed candidate of the sports ministry.\n\nAccording to the statement issued on Monday, Mr George congratulated Mr Gusau for his \u2018re-election\u2019\n\n\u201cI congratulate my brother and friend Engr Ibrahim Shehu Gusau on his re-election as President of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria and also rejoice with the newly elected board.\n\n\u201cI am happy that illegitimacy was not allowed to marr the Kebbi Elections. I promise to join hands with the Gusau led Board to continue the development of Athletics in Nigeria. I am with you all the way,\u201d Mr George was quoted as saying in the statement by the Gusau-led AFN.\n\nWhy the two rival factions are laying claims to their legitimacy, the WA and the CAA would have to make their stance known in the days ahead.\n\nOnly the Court of Arbitration for Sports, CAS, can take a legally binding stance different to those taken by the two bodies.",

Hence, external debt service payments fell to N126.02 billion (or $332.07 million) in the first quarter (Q1) 2021 from N170.60 billion (or $472.57 million) printed in Q1 2020.\n\nFurther breakdown of the total external debt stock in Q1 2021 showed that multilateral loans accounted for 54.26 per cent ($17.83 billion) of which loans from the International Development Association (IDA) was $11.09 billion, loan from IMF was $3.48 billion while others stood at $3.26 billion. According to DMO, bilateral loan accounted for 12.73 per cent ($4.18 billion) of which loan from China (Exim Bank of China) was $3.40 billion and loan from France was $0.49 billion in Q1 2021.\n\nNigeria\u2019s total public debt stock rose year on year by 15.64 percent to N33.11 trillion as of March 2021 (from N28.63 trillion as of March 2020), figures from the DMO show.\n\nThe year on year increase was mainly due to a 24.86 per cent rise in external debt to N12.47 trillion (or $32.86 billion at N379.50/$) as of March 2021 from N9.99 trillion (or $27.67 billion at N361.00/$) in March 2020. Within a year, Nigeria received $3.48 billion worth of loans from the International Monetary Fund. Also, an additional loan of $1.43 billion was gotten from IDA. More so, the depreciation of the Naira against the greenback exacerbated external debt: yo-y, Naira depreciated against the US dollar by 5.10 per cent to close at N379.50/$ as of March 2021. Commercial loans accounted for 32.47 per cent ($10.66 billion) of which Eurobonds was $10.37 billion while diasporal bond was $0.30 billion.

Despite the significant rise in FG\u2019s domestic loan, local debt service payment increased marginally by 0.59 per cent to N612 billion in Q1 2021 from N609.13 billion recorded in Q1 2020 amid a relatively low rate.",

We have seen turbines that have been running for over 40 years. We have seen efforts being made by Egbin management to effect a turnaround at the plant through overhaul of he entire system.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen the support you have been giving to the youth through employment and capacity development opportunities.\n\n\u201cI have listened to the concerns you raised, particularly, in the area of transmission restrictions.

We are going to support you to make sure that the power supply is steady.

As at the time we took over, the plant was generating 300MW which is abysmal 22 per cent.\n\n\u201cAs at today, our generation capacity has surged and we do 89 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe have reached the highest peak of 970 MW and we are working hard to ensure sustainability of this feat.\n\n\u201cThe 970MW we hit is the highest in the history of the plant and based on our core value of sustainability, we are working round the clock to make sure that we sustain the gains we have made.\u201d\n\nSonubi listed the challenges being faced by the company to include grid limitation, gas constraints and liquidity.\n\nHe, however, said stakeholders including the NNPC, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Transmission Company of Nigeria were working tirelessly to solve the issues.\n\nSonubi appealed to the NNPC to sustain effort towards gas development and supply of the product to keep turbines at Egbin working productively at optimal capacity.

          "text": "A report has revealed that the dreaded Boko Haram group and bandits have kidnapped almost a thousand school students in Nigeria between December last year and June 5, 2021.\n\nNaija News understands that secondary schools and tertiary institutions in the country witnessed a series of attack by criminal groups who abducted no fewer than 936 students in total within the specified date.\n\nAbductions were recorded in Ohordua, Edo State; Effurun, Delta State; Kankara, Kaduna State; and Mahuta village, Katsina within the speculated period. Other places where cases of abduction were recorded are Kagara, Niger State; Jangebe, Zamfara State; and Afaka, Kaduna State, among others.\n\nREAD ALSO: Updated: Fulani herders kill 12 in Plateau village\n\nSome parents of the abducted students who spoke with reporters had lamented the situation, saying they would not allow their children to return to school. One of them, Alhaji Ibrahim Baba, whose children were among the kidnapped Jangebe schoolgirls, said, \u201cI have decided to withdraw my children from school because of the security situation in the whole country.\n\nHe added: \u201cOur children are no longer at ease due to rampant cases of student abduction across the country and as such, I feel that it is better to withdraw my children so that I will have peace of mind.\u201d\n\nNaija News recalls also that a parent whose two children were abducted by bandits during the Jangebe School abduction, Hafsat Sani, had said many parents are sceptical about the government\u2019s readiness to fight banditry; and as such, do not wish to allow her children too to return to school.\n\n\u201cTwo of my children were kidnapped; I will not allow them to go back unless something tangible is done,\u201d she reiterated.\n\nMeanwhile, the presidency has warned Nigerians to stop rejoicing when cases of insecurity such as kidnappings and killings happen in the country.\n\nThe special assistant on media and publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari, Femi Adesina said those who rejoice when criminals kill security agents or some other negative things happen in the country need to repent.\n\nNaija News understands that the presidential aide stated this in an opinion article made available to newsmen a few days ago. Adesina said that some Nigerians are found to be shouting over the rooftops and amplifying every misfortune or negative occurrence that happens in the country but are always silent when the government records positive/good achievements.\n\nOn his part, the Director of Press, Ministry of Education, Bem Goong, had told newsmen earlier that the Federal Government was working hard to ensure that schools were safe.\n\nHe urged state governments to also do the same. Goong said, \u201cIf you go to our unity schools, you will notice the presence of security operatives. During the 2021 Common Entrance Examination monitoring exercise, the permanent secretary also added that unity schools are the safest and it is because we have deployed security operatives there.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) has called for more funding of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS) centres across the country.\n\nNMA President Prof. Innocent Ujah made the call on Monday, in Abuja, at a news conference organised by the association, in collaboration with the NBTS, to mark World Blood Donor Day, usually celebrated on June 14, every year.\n\nUjah said that the lack of proper funding of the NBTS had led to deficiencies in the quality of services offered by the organisation.\n\nHe lamented the inadequacy of the laws guiding the practice of blood transfusion medicine in Nigeria as they had resulted in the proliferation of quackery and other sharp practices in the sector.\n\nAccording to him, state NBTS centres were worst hit since the withdrawal of donor funds by implementing partners, as state governments were yet to take full ownership of such centres in their domains.\n\nHe, therefore, recommended sustained positive actions by all stakeholders on making voluntary blood donation a culture, and for the state governments to take ownership of the NBTS centres under their jurisdictions.\n\nUjah stressed that improved budgeting and release of funds to the NBTS centres across Nigeria would give room for effectiveness and efficiency in service delivery.\n\nThe NMA president also called on all stakeholders, in the public health sector, to join hands and push for the speedy passage of the national blood service commission bill.\n\n\u201dThere are some mind-blowing statistics about blood transfusion services in Nigeria that had made it imperative for NMA and all stakeholders to get involved in creating awareness about blood donation and transfusion services in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe cited some of the challenges of the sector to include, low level of eligible adult blood donor population, low level voluntary blood donation, high level commercial blood donation, high rate of transmission of transfusion transmissible infection among blood recipients from commercial donors, among others.\n\nUjah said the NMA was delighted to join the NBTS and stakeholders, within and outside the health sector, in the celebration of 2021 WBDD which has as its theme, \u2018Celebrating the gift of blood\u2019.\n\nHe noted that the celebration highlighted the uniqueness of the selfless act of voluntarily donating blood and the need for everyone to take responsibility and act to support the drive, under the slogan: \u2018Give blood and Keep the World Beating\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe NMA stands in full support of the NBTS and joins all voices of good reason to create sustained advocacy for a comprehensive improvement in blood transfusion services in Nigeria\u201d, he said.",

It is on record that I did not only do 8 years as governor, but the party also worked hard to have my successor elected on the platform. It does not matter what happened thereafter.\n\n\u201cI also was privileged to become the national chairman of our party and it does not matter even if I had spent just two days in that office. All that matters is that I occupied the office and it is a history that cannot be changed and for which I am grateful to God.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that I have an obligation to continue to maintain and sustain the ladder which by the help of other people I used to climb up, so that others too can take advantage of that ladder to even climb higher than I did,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on members of the party who were elected to the State House of Assembly, but were yet to be inaugurated, Oshiomhole thanked them for keeping their faith, noting that even though they committed no sin, they were being denied their right to be sworn-in to represent their constituents.\n\nHe, however, said he believed that God would deliver justice to them in His own way and at His own determined time.\n\nOshiomhole thanked the leaders for remaining steadfast inspite of sponsored negative stories against some of them, even as he saluted the foot soldiers for their trust and confidence and sacrifices in and for the party.\n\n\u201cSome resigned from their positions based on principles, some resisted the temptations to betray the party for monetary gains, while others were sacked or illegally suspended from their elected positions,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe former state governor who urged the party members across the senatorial zone to be proud of themselves, disclosed that no projects were ongoing in Edo North, apart from constituency projects being done by APC legislators in the National Assembly and those influenced by Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba.\n\nHe noted that since 2012, the party has not lost any position from House of Assembly, House of Representatives and Senate, not because the people elected were perfect, but \u201cbecause our people were determined, based on party discipline, that we must vote for the party\u2019s candidates at all times.\u201d",

Sometimes, it comes in subtle forms- in ways that do not really hurt.\n\n\u201cThere is no small oppression. So, to say I should have gone ahead with the interview without my #BuhariMustGo shirt means that I should allow my rights to freedom of expression to be trampled on, just \u2018slightly\u2019.\n\n\u201cI should have submitted myself to censorship and that I should have compromised the stance of the movement, right before the other person who was brought to defend how protesters were attacked during the #June12Protest. Never!\n\n\u201cWhen the Producer offered me a jacket to wear, so as to cover the #BuhariMustGo inscription, it was like initiating me to some identity crisis cult. It sounded too absurd.\n\n\u201dThe civil rights movement in America has a history and the \u2018small\u2019 defiant role of Rosa Parks cannot be discarded. In fact, it birthed the whole resistance against segregation.\n\n\u201dShould we say it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if Rosa Parks had allowed the white man sitting in the bus? Is it not \u2018small standing she will just stand\u2019? She would get to her destination sitting or standing, right? Is that not what you are saying? But what you need to know is that she would have postponed the campaign for freedom with such a \u2018slight acceptance\u2019 of oppression.\n\n\u201dThe right for blacks to sit in a bus at that time was not recognised anyway, but it was fought for, due to Rosa Parks\u2019 intolerable attitude towards \u2018small oppression\u2019. So if it\u2019s written in any code, known or unknown, that it is unethical to go on TV with insignia perceived to be anti-government, let the fight to make it right begin.\n\n\u201dNo matter how you package poison, it is still poison. It does not matter how you hide oppression in rules, regulations, \u2018ethics\u2019, conduct, flowery words, in your own docility, some of us can fish it out and we would never bow to it.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s a big shame on the drowning Buhari regime that all institutions that should promote and defend rights have been subdued, owing to the dictatorship of the regime. It\u2019s almost time up for the regime. We shall overcome. Victory is near.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said on Monday that the president is now more determined than ever to rid the country of \u201cartificial divisions that are impeding national cohesion and growth.\u201d\n\nThe Buhari administration has been plagued by widespread discontent, with secessionist agitations rising in the South-East and South-West.\n\nThe agitations, which have been led by the Independent People of Biafra, IPOB, and proponents of the Oodua Nation, have mostly been motivated by alleged injustices against some parts of the country and evident favoritism of the president\u2019s region in the distribution of federal benefits.\n\nMr Shehu, appearing on state-run broadcaster NTA, believes that the regime\u2019s adversary is the outlawed microblogging site Twitter, which is used to spew hate messages and endanger Nigeria\u2019s business survival.\n\n\u201cI think in the last few days, we are seeing a firmer determination by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle artificial divisions that are standing in the way of national cohesion and progress of the country,\u201d Mr Shehu said.\n\n\u201cAs I said, Twitter is one of them, but from the pronouncement of the president, in the interview he did on Arise TV and the one on NTA here, the speech he gave in Lagos and the broadcast he gave, I think they are suggestive of the fact that the growing heat in the country must not continue.\u201d\n\nSince the government announced the suspension of Twitter activities in Nigeria, the decision has been met with harsh criticism both locally and globally. Many citizens accused the president of infringing on citizens\u2019 right to free speech and depriving them of their primary source of income.\n\nWith over 30 million users in Nigeria, Twitter is not only a social networking site, but also a venue for Nigerians to communicate their thoughts on national issues and build social cohesion.\n\nBut, in justifying the ban, Mr Shehu claimed that it was the proper method in ensuring that the country\u2019s \u201crising heat\u201d was put to an end.\n\nThe decision, according to the presidential adviser, also reflects the current administration\u2019s willingness to address challenges that endanger Nigeria\u2019s peaceful coexistence.\n\nMeanwhile, the Buhari dictatorship has been extensively chastised for gross human rights violations, increasing insecurity and the economy, corruption, and nepotism, among other things.",

He did not demand the constitution and inauguration of A BOARD of NDDC.\n\n\u201cThis simply means that he was specifically referring to the Board of NDDC already screened and confirmed by the Senate in line with the NDDC 2000 Act, as amended, but whose members have been unjustly placed on standby under the guise of allowing for forensic auditing of NDDC.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, we are once more patriotically renewing our Advice to President Buhari to be very wary of those Governors, and some of his political Associates/Aides misleading him and putting pressure on him to continue to unjustly and unlawfully delay or jettison the inauguration of the Governing Board of NDDC that he rightly nominated and passionately requested the Senate to confirm, which the Senate did.\n\n\u201cAs we stated in our previous Advice to him, those Governors and Politicians who went pleading with him not to inaugurate the NDDC Board were not sincere to him and his APC but only wanted to pitch our people against him and his APC leadership. Have we not been vindicated now?\n\n\u201cIt will be against his commitment to restoring Peace, Order and Security in our Oil Producing South-South Region if he allows himself to be misled to further delay the inauguration of this substantive Board of NDDC. Nigerians can\u2019t afford to see our South-South Region added to the Regions that are sadly now engulfed in breakdown of Peace, Security and Public Order.\n\n\u201cAs High Chief Tompolo rightly stated in his Statement, the renewed demand for the inauguration of the substantive Board of NDDC is for the Love of our Region and Country, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer allow the guise of forensic auditing to be used to mislead President Buhari on this matter,\u201d it stated.",

          "title": "Re: 1,500 Christian Killed in 6 Months in Nigeria -NigPilot",
          "text": "While taking a vivid look at the article being published on the spiteful statements made by the immediate past United States Secretary of State and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo, all I saw was nothing but a tool (Pompeo) that is craving for relevance, and being used by the news agency to propagate pernicious propaganda aimed at the heart of Nigeria\u2019s unity by creating extreme religious bigotry among the peaceful citizens, and to also disrupt President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nThe article written by Mike Pompeo on the 10th of June is nothing but a tool aimed at breeding discord and blindly criticizing the patriotic leaders of our dear country Nigeria. It is nothing but false political propaganda created to serve no good deed.\n\nHe stated that at least 1,500 Christians have been killed in Nigeria in the last six months. This is an awful fabrication of facts. Yes, there are several issues of insecurity rocking the nation, but it is not nearly as bad as Mike Pompeo paints it to be. It is shameful for him to have stated such false facts without providing proof or a source of reference.\n\nI was perplexed to my very core when I read what was written in the fallacious article, as it was obvious that Mike Pompeo wished to blindly attack the Nigerian government without cause or reason, and I asked myself, \u201cWHY?\u201d\n\nIt is remarkable to know that the level of insecurity in Nigeria has drastically reduced overtime. The alarming Boko Haram insurgency has been dealt with in a pragmatic approach taken by President Muhammadu Buhari. Many successes have been recorded under his leadership as he has been steadfast in the discharge of his duty and providing aid to civil authority.\n\nThe issue of Muslims fighting Christians is a matter that has been present throughout history from the 7th century. The matter has encouraged a variety of views throughout history, but greeting the matter with the idiosyncrasy of condemning one party over the other is one that breeds hatred and hostility. Owing to the delicate nature of such a matter, it would have been wise for Pompeo to guard his statements regarding the killings of Christians in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria is on the edge presently, and statements that would further encourage discord and hostility between the two major religions in the country should be avoided.\n\nIt was myopic of Mike Pompeo not to have pointed out the fact that Christians are not the only ones being slaughtered in the country. Several faithful Muslims have also been killed in various parts of the country. It is obvious that his intents are born out of mischief.\n\nHe also failed to point out the fact that these acts were carried out by terrorists and bandits who do not discriminate when they kill. They do not care about what group or religion their victims belong to. They carry out their acts without mercy, no matter who you are.\n\nI strongly admit and concur that any government that cannot discharge this basic obligation of Protecting Lives and Property, losses any iota of legitimacy. President Muhammadu Buhari has been fervent in his handling of security issues in Nigeria that has led to massive killing and wanton destruction of property across the country, and making every region habitable to everyone irrespective of their religious view as opposed to what Pompeo insinuated.\n\nIn addressing the challenge to the survival of religion tolerance in Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari made it pertinent to consider, and also worked on security issues and problems that have affected or capable of affecting the attitude, confidence and cooperation of all groups and segments that make up the Nigerian federation, without leaving out the necessity to explore the gaps and gray areas in the national constitution that are responsible for various religion problems and crises.\n\nHowever, knowing that sensitive issues like that of religion intolerance is a weaponry that has fostered National and International Terrorist attacks on many Nations, Pompeo should have known better to verify every information gotten, or seen on the internet before relying on a creek in-house media as a source of verifiable information. This act makes a man like him reeks of low intelligence.\n\nHe also accused the Nigerian government of \u201cdownplaying the attacks and characterizing them as conflicts between herders and farmers rather than as religiously motivated acts of terror.\u201d One can never call a spade a bucket. We have all seen that there is no religious motivation behind the killings in Nigeria. These killings are merely carried out by merciless bandits and terrorists who know nothing about Islam or Christianity.\n\nPompeo cited the case of Leah Sharibu who has remained in captivity in the hands of the Boko Haram sect due to the fact that she refused to convert to Islam. He claimed that the young lady has remained in captivity over three years without consequence. By this, he insinuates that the Nigerian government failed to act merely because she is a Christian who refused to convert to Islam. This is an odoriferous innuendo that Mike Pompeo has so witlessly expressed.\n\nHe also made other claims about the matter, one of which he gave a self-declared statistic stating that Christians murdered in the country had risen to 60 percent in 2020 and was most likely going to get worse in recent times. This he stated without providing concrete evidence to his claim.\n\nWe should educate Pompeo and help his amnesia about his statement on the presence of radical Islamic jihadist groups in northern Nigeria.\n\nFirstly, he should know that radical Islamic jihadist groups are all over the world. Islamic State West Africa Province, ISWAP, is all over African countries and has registered their presence through different attacks. Has he forgotten so soon?\n\nThe memorable 9/11 attack on the twin tower by Alqueada, that was masterminded and executed on American soil?\n\nThe numerous attacks by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, or Daesh, which is detailed as follows:\n\nA car bomb in Iraq that killed 28 Shia pilgrims and injured 60 others as they were returning from Karbala, while in the capital Baghdad a roadside bomb exploded near a minibus, killing four pilgrims and wounding 15.\n\nA suicide bomber exploded targeting civilians in a commercial shop on a busy tourist destination and business center in Turkey, March 2016.\n\nISIL took responsibility for a stabbing that killed a French police officer and his companion in France, June 2016.\n\n29-year-old Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a mass shooting inside Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida in United State, June 2016.\n\nBetween November 2 and 3, five were killed in Stadttempel, Vienna, including the perpetrator. The Vienna Police Department confirmed that the attacker was an Islamic State sympathiser, and that the attack was motivated by Islamic extremism. This happened in Austria, November 2020.\n\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant targeted Shia Muslims on 21 January 2021 in a clothing market in Tayaran Square, Baghdad. US, UN, EU and the Pope condemn the attack calling it a senseless act of violence. Iraq, January 2021\n\nAttacks where everywhere \u2013 United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, Canada, etc \u2013 which were dated to 2021.\n\nHowever, with the above references and many more, should we now conclude just like Mr Mike, that all these attacks are on Christians, and every President in the attacked country supports religion intolerance?\n\nIt is obvious that Mike Pompeo\u2019s statements were borne out of hatred for the Islamic religion. It is important for him to realize that words are powerful. If he has any problem with the Islamic religion, he should keep it to himself and not sow seeds of discord in other countries. If he has nothing good to say about the country, it will be in his best interest to keep silent on the matter and focus on his own country.\n\nAt the end of his article, Mike Pompeo issued several lame threats to the federal government of the country. He stated that if the Nigerian government failed to carry out swift actions to put an end to the persecution of Christians, there would be consequences in the form of sanctions and increased diplomatic pressure.\n\nThe Buhari-led administration has been working tirelessly to safeguard the lives and properties of all Nigerian citizens no matter the religion you practice. It is an insult on Mike Pompeo\u2019s part to disregard the efforts put in by the current administration and try to create unnecessary agitation in the country.\n\nAt this point, sanctions and diplomatic pressure isn\u2019t what Nigeria needs. What the country needs is support from other countries. Mike Pompeo would do well to call for support in the country rather that criticize its leaders and proclaim unnecessary threats.\n\nPresident Buhari is efficiently leading the fight against insecurity in Nigeria along with the service chiefs and the Nigerian Military. Let us all join hands to support them rather than throw incessant criticisms at them.\n\nAdadu is a student of peace and conflict resolution and wrote from Gwarimpa",

I thank ACSC Governing Council for recognizing my modest contributions in that sector of our economy and definitely this fellowship will ginger me to do even more for our country and for humanity,\u201d Onojeharho said.\n\nAccording to a statement made available to our correspondent in Abuja, \u201cChief Onojeharho was appointed the chairman of NITT Governing Council in 2018 and within a short period of coming into office, the Council and the management have carved out a niche by changing the status quo.\u201d\n\nIt stressed that the institute has witnessed massive projects that are either completed or on-going to the admiration of stakeholders, adding that \u201cthe outcome is what is today known as the new face of NITT.\u201d\n\n\u201cApart from remodelling of existing structures, construction of new ones and equiping the Institute with modern facilities to aid learning activities, visibility has greatly improved, staff welfare enhanced and new ones recruited to beef up the manpower.\n\n\u201cAlso new training centres have been opened across the country while 3 drivers\u2019 development centres are being built in Zaria, Ilorin and Ugheli, Delta State.

          "text": "Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, says his people have no land to give out for cattle ranching.\n\nGovernor Umahi stated this on Monday evening while appearing as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019.\n\nUmahi said each state in the South-East already has laws banning open grazing and as such, it is way off as he is a servant to his people.\n\n\u201cThis is not about the governors, it is about the people, so, whatever position the people take in this regard, that is what will happen. There is no land in this regard that is not owned by individuals, corporate bodies.\n\n\u201cSo, this is beyond governors and that is the truth. People calling governors are making a very grievous mistake. Even if I say as a governor in South-East, I want people from this village, I want you to donate this land, the question is: will they allow it?\n\n\u201cI have heard about three communal crisis in my state, and it is all about land. There is a place that I am building a medical university and the people of that village, for a project that is almost completed, went and brought it down. They prefer to have their farms than a medical college. So, the land is a different ball game altogether,\u201d Umahi stated when asked whether he would provide land for ranching as a governor.\n\nREAD ALSO: Herders\u2019 Threat: What Is Going On In Nigeria Is Unconstitutional, Clark Tells Buhari\n\nSpeaking further Umahi noted that his people have \u201csaid they have no land for ranching. They put me where I am. If I have one acre of land and I am talking about giving land for ranching, I should be talking about that particular land. I can\u2019t be talking about somebody\u2019s land. Yes, constitutionally, I have control over the land but you have to kill all the people to get the land.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the year, Southern Governors banned open grazing of cattle across states in the region and urged the President to address Nigerians on the state of the nation.\n\nThe governors also called for the restructuring of the country to address increasing agitations in different parts of the nation, while restating their commitment to the unity of the country.\n\nIn reaction to the ban, the presidency said the governors failed to provide any solution to the lingering crisis between farmers and herders in the country.\n\nSeeking to profer the needed solution, President Muhammadu Buhari in a recent interview stated that the government will return to a practice in which herders will ply designated grazing routes across the country.\n\nThe President said the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, has been asked to begin the process to see how these routes can be legally put back to use, a directive which has not gone down with many Nigerians, with some claiming that the insistence on open grazing points to a hidden agenda.",

          "text": "Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday raised an alarm over the rate at which the All Progressives Congress (APC) is borrowing money to fund projects in the country.\n\nThis formed part of the resolutions reached at the end of the meeting of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum held in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital.\n\n\u201cMoney should only be borrowed for productive purposes as Nigeria\u2019s current debt of over N36 trillion is becoming clearly unsustainable relative to our earnings and GDP.\n\n\u201cWe should not saddle incoming generations with an undue debt burden. The borrowing spree of the APC administration if unchecked will certainly lead Nigeria into avoidable bankruptcy,\u201d a communique issued at the end of the meeting read in part.\n\nThe governors decried that the debt profile of Nigeria with over 80 per cent of normal appropriation spent on debt servicing was rising and becoming uncontrollable.\n\nThey stated that all the gains of the PDP government under former President Olusegun Obasanjo when the nation exited its foreign debt obligations had been destroyed.\n\nREAD ALSO: JAMB Asks Applicants To Complete UTME Registration By Tuesday\n\nThe governors accused the present administration of borrowing for frivolous items, stressing that such an action was scandalous.\n\nThey faulted the operational system and methods of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) which they claimed was functioning as an independent government-within-a-government.\n\n\u201cA situation where CBN creates money, decides how much of it to spend, on what to spend it on without any form of controls or supervision is patently subversive of our constitutional order.\n\n\u201cIt has become not just a leviathan, but also a Father Christmas of sorts, dabbling into every sphere and scope of governmental activity, not just as a lender of last resort, but as a full executing agency of government,\u201d the communique read.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe meeting observed that the CBN has become such an octopus that it threatens state governments publicly, without decorum, about sanctions on any attempt to question its Modus Operandi. The CBN should take immediate steps to halt the depreciation of the naira.\u201d\n\nTackling Insecurity\n\nThe governors also called for the decentralisation of the operations of the security apparatus of the state, even within the existing legal framework.\n\nThey explained that the move became necessary in the face of the disturbing spate of insecurity in the land, to ensure the input of local operators in state and local governments in policing and security.\n\nThe governors decried that President Muhammadu Buhari seemed not to be aware that the coercive instruments of state security were firmly within his hands and not the governors, considering his recent media interview on the subject.\n\nThey reminded the President that he has ultimate authority under the Constitution over the security organisations, even though the states have a role to play.\n\nThe leaders believe cooperation and synergy between states and the Federal Government in security operations were critical in securing the nation and its people.\n\nThey stated that despite being on the Exclusive List, the states spend huge sums of money to support the police and other security agencies to carry out their duties.\n\nThe governors called on the National Assembly to expedite action in passing the Electoral Act and Constitution amendments to ensure restructuring and decentralisation of governmental powers and functions.\n\nRead the communique issued at the end of the meeting below:",

          "text": "CNN\u2019s chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour told viewers Monday that she has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had successful major surgery to remove it, and I\u2019m now undergoing several months of chemotherapy for the very best possible long-term prognosis, and I\u2019m confident,\u201d Amanpour said at the beginning of her daily television program.\n\nAmanpour, 63, is one of the best-known journalists in the world, in part due to her fearless coverage of international conflicts. She has been off the air for the past four weeks due to the diagnosis.\n\nIn her on-air announcement, Amanpour pointed out that ovarian cancer is all too common, affecting \u201cmillions of women around the world.\u201d\n\nAnchoring from her home base in London, Amanpour said she feels \u201cfortunate to have health insurance through work and incredible doctors who are treating me in a country underpinned by, of course, the brilliant NHS,\u201d referencing the National Health Service in the UK.\n\nAfter speaking about her surgery and chemotherapy, Amanpour said, \u201cI\u2019m telling you this in the interest of transparency but in truth really mostly as a shoutout to early diagnosis.\u201d She said she wanted to \u201curge women to educate themselves on this disease; to get all the regular screenings and scans that you can; to always listen to your bodies; and of course to ensure that your legitimate medical concerns are not dismissed or diminished.\u201d\n\nAmanpour also thanked her program\u2019s staffers and Bianna Golodryga, CNN\u2019s senior global affairs analyst, who filled in on \u201cAmanpour\u201d for the past four weeks.\n\n.@camanpour, you\u2019re not only one of the best journalists in the business, you\u2019re also one of the toughest.\n\nWishing you a speedy and healthy recovery in the weeks ahead. No doubt you\u2019ll end up on top.\n\nWith months of chemo treatments ahead, Amanpour anticipates anchoring Mondays through Wednesdays for the time being. She also has three weeks of previously-scheduled time off starting at the end of June.\n\nChanneling the feelings of many staffers across the company, CNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker wished Amanpour a full recovery.\n\n\u201cI want to applaud Christiane Amanpour for her candor, bravery and always working towards the greater good,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAs a cancer survivor, I too encourage people to listen to their bodies and get all early cancer screenings available to them. From our CNN family, we wish Christiane the very best for a full and speedy recovery.\u201d\n\nSome of Amanpour\u2019s counterparts also shared well-wishes with her on Monday.\n\n\u201cThank you for being open\u201d about the diagnosis, NBC\u2019s chief foreign affairs correspondent and anchor Andrea Mitchell wrote to Amanpour on Twitter. \u201cIt is so important and typical of how strong and brave you\u2019ve always been. Courage and honesty is your trademark. You will beat this too.\u201d",

          "title": "UK PM Johnson Delays Lockdown Easing for England by 4 Weeks",
          "text": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed Monday that the next planned relaxation of coronavirus restrictions in England will be delayed by four weeks, until July 19, as a result of the spread of the delta variant.\n\nIn a press briefing, Johnson voiced his confidence that he won\u2019t need to delay the plan to lift restrictions on social contact further, as millions more people get fully vaccinated against the virus. He said that by July 19, two-thirds of the British population will have been double-vaccinated.\n\n\u201cI think it is sensible to wait just a little longer,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time to ease off the accelerator, because by being cautious now we have the chance in the next four weeks to save many thousands of lives by vaccinating millions more people.\u201d\n\nAccompanying the decision to delay the easing, Johnson said the government has brought forward the date by which everyone over the age of 18 will be offered a first dose of vaccine, from the end of July to July 19.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unmistakably clear the vaccines are working and the sheer scale of the vaccine roll out has made our position incomparably better than in previous waves,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder the government\u2019s plan for coming out of lockdown, all restrictions on social contact were set to be lifted next Monday. Many businesses, particularly those in hospitality and entertainment, voiced their disappointment ahead of the official announcement.\n\nThe delta variant first found in India is estimated by scientists advising the government to be between 40% and 80% more transmissible than the previous dominant strain. It now accounts for more than 90% of infections in the U.K.\n\nWhen Johnson first outlined the government\u2019s four-stage plan for lifting the lockdown in England in February, he set June 21 as the earliest date by which restrictions on people gathering would be lifted. However, he stressed at the time that the timetable was not carved in stone and that all the steps would be driven by \u201cdata not dates\u201d and would seek to be \u201cirreversible.\u201d\n\nThe speed at which new coronavirus infections have been rising had piled the pressure on Johnson to delay the reopening so more people can get vaccinated.\n\nOn Monday, the British government reported 7,742 new confirmed cases, one of the highest daily numbers since the end of February. Daily infections have increased threefold over the past few weeks but are still way down from the nearly 70,000 daily cases recorded in January.\n\nMany blame the Conservative government for the spike in infections, saying it acted too slowly to impose the strictest quarantine requirements on everyone arriving from India, which has endured a catastrophic resurgence of the virus.\n\nAcross Europe, many countries, including France, have tightened restrictions for British travelers to prevent the delta variant from spreading. Others, like Spain, are allowing British tourists to arrive without being required to take a test if they have been fully vaccinated.\n\nDespite concerns about the delta variant, the U.K.\u2019s vaccine rollout has won plaudits as one of the world\u2019s speediest and most coherent. As of Monday, around 62% of the British population had received one shot, while about 45% had got two jabs.\n\nThe rapid rollout of vaccines and a strict months-long lockdown helped drive down the number of virus-related deaths in the U.K. in recent months. Despite that, the country has recorded nearly 128,000 virus-related deaths, more than any other nation in Europe.",

          "title": "NATO Leaders Declare China a Global Security Challenge",
          "text": "NATO leaders on Monday declared China a constant security challenge and said the Chinese are working to undermine global order, a message in sync with President Joe Biden\u2019s efforts to get allies to speak out with a more unified voice against China\u2019s trade, military and human rights practices.\n\nIn a summit statement, the leaders said that China\u2019s goals and \u201cassertive behavior present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to alliance security.\u201d\n\nWhile the 30 heads of state and government avoided calling China a rival, they expressed concern about what they said were its \u201ccoercive policies,\u201d the opaque ways it is modernizing its armed forces and its use of disinformation.\n\nThey called on Beijing to uphold its international commitments and to act responsibly in the international system.\n\nBiden, who arrived at the summit after three days of consulting with Group of Seven allies in England, pushed for the G-7 communique there that called out what it said were forced labor practices and other human rights violations impacting Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in the western Xinjiang province. The president said he was satisfied with the communique, although differences remain among the allies about how forcefully to criticize Beijing.\n\nBiden has also used his eight-day trip to Europe to urge allies to work more closely in pressing Russian President Vladimir Putin over his government\u2019s treatment of political dissidents and to do more to stem cyber attacks originating from Russia that have targeted private companies and governments around the globe.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an alliance of European and North American countries formed after World War II as a bulwark against Russian aggression.\n\nThe new Brussels communique states plainly that the NATO nations \u201cwill engage China with a view to defending the security interests of the alliance.\u201d\n\nBut as Biden faced with the G-7 communique, some allies bristled at the NATO effort to speak out on China.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said NATO\u2019s decision to name China as a threat \u201cshouldn\u2019t be overstated\u201d because Beijing, like Russia, is also a partner in some areas. China is Germany\u2019s top trading partner and is heavily dependent on Russia in fulfilling the country\u2019s energy needs.\n\nMerkel noted that \u201cwhen you look at the cyber threats, the hybrid threats, when you look at the cooperation between Russia and China, you can\u2019t just ignore China.\u201d\n\nBut she added that it was important to \u201cfind the right balance\u201d as China is also a partner on many issues.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important, just like we do in Russia, to always make the offer of political discussions, political discourse, in order to come up with solutions,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cBut where there are threats, and I said they\u2019re in the hybrid field too, then as NATO you have to be prepared.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron urged the alliance not to let China distract it from what he saw as more pressing issues facing NATO, including the fight against terrorism and security issues related to Russia.\n\n\u201cI think it is very important not to scatter our efforts and not to have biases in our relation to China,\u201d Macron said.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy to the United Kingdom on Monday issued a statement saying the G-7 communique \u201cdeliberately slandered China and arbitrarily interfered in China\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d and exposed the \u201csinister intentions of a few countries, such as the United States.\u201d There was no immediate reaction from the Chinese government to the new NATO statement.\n\nBiden arrived at his first NATO summit as president as leading members declared it a pivotal moment for an alliance beleaguered during the presidency of Donald Trump, who questioned the relevance of the multilateral organization.\n\nShortly after arriving at the alliance\u2019s headquarters for the first NATO summit of his presidency, Biden sat down with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and underscored the U.S. commitment to Article 5 of the alliance charter, which spells out that an attack on one member is an attack on all and is to be met with a collective response.\n\n\u201cArticle 5 we take as a sacred obligation,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI want NATO to know America is there.\u201d\n\nIt was a sharp shift in tone from the past four years, when Trump called the alliance \u201cobsolete\u201d and complained that it allowed for \u201cglobal freeloading\u201d countries to spend less on military defense at the expense of the U.S.\n\nBiden was greeted by fellow leaders with warmth and even a bit of relief.\n\nBelgium Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said Biden\u2019s presence \u201cemphasizes the renewal of the transatlantic partnership.\u201d De Croo said NATO allies were looking to get beyond four stormy years under the Trump administration and infighting among member countries.\n\n\u201cI think now we are ready to turn the page,\u201d de Croo said.\n\nTrump routinely berated other NATO countries for not spending enough on defense and even threatened to pull the U.S. out of the world\u2019s biggest security organization and even questioned the mutual defense provision of the NATO charter, a central tenet of the alliance.\n\nThe alliance also updated Article 5 to offer greater clarity on how the alliance should react to major cyber attacks \u2014 a matter of growing concern amid hacks targeting the U.S. government and businesses around the globe by Russia-based hackers.\n\nBeyond extending the potential use of the Article 5 mutual defense clause to space, the leaders also broadened the definition of what might constitute such an attack in cyberspace, in a warning to any adversary that might use constant low-level attacks as a tactic.\n\nThe organization declared in 2014 that a cyber attack could be met by a collective response by all 30 member countries, but on Monday they said that \u201cthe impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack.\u201d\n\nThe president started his day meeting with leaders of the Baltic states on NATO\u2019s eastern flank as well as separate meetings with leaders of Poland and Romania to discuss the threat posed by Russia and the recent air piracy in Belarus, according to the White House.\n\nBiden\u2019s itinerary in Europe has been shaped so that he would first gather with G-7 leaders and then with NATO allies in Brussels before his much-anticipated meeting with Putin in Geneva on Wednesday.\n\nBiden met on Monday evening with Turkey\u2019s president, Erdogan, on the summit sidelines.\n\nBiden has known Erdogan for years but their relationship has frequently been contentious. Biden, during his campaign, drew ire from Turkish officials after he described Erdogan as an \u201cautocrat.\u201d In April, Biden infuriated Ankara by declaring that the Ottoman-era mass killing and deportations of Armenians was \u201cgenocide\u201d \u2014 a term that U.S. presidents have avoided using.\n\nIn a brief exchange with reporters, Biden described it as a \u201cvery good meeting.\u201d He and Erdogan met privately before being joined by other officials. They spent in total more than an hour together.",
