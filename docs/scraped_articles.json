          "text": "Buba Galadima\n\nBy Miftaudeen Raji\n\nA former ally of President Muhammadu Buhari, Buba Galadima who is now a member of the New Nigerian People\u2019s Party, NNPP has said there is no South-East presidential candidate that believes in the concept of a new Nigeria like Rabiu Kwankwaso, the presidential candidate of his party.\n\nGaladima, who made this assertion on Monday while speaking on Arise TV, noted that Kwankwaso\u2019s drive for a new Nigeria was a product of the past 30 years.\n\n\u201cThere is no South East candidate that believes in a new Nigeria as we do; we want someone that can believe in Nigeria, not a tribal Nigeria. We have been working on this project for over 30 years,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked why Kwankwaso can\u2019t be Peter Obi\u2019s running mate, Galadima replied, \u201cThe arithmetic is against Peter Obi, it\u2019s only Kwankwanso that can deliver the mission to New Nigeria. It\u2019s God\u2019s time for Kwankwaso to be president. We spoke about primordial sentiments.\n\nRecall Kwankwaso himself had earlier given reasons he can not be running mate to Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, in the wake of calls for the duo to form an alliance as an alternative for Nigerians aside the two major political parties \u2013 All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe former Kano governor had expressed interest in Obi to accept to be his running mate.\n\n\u201cThe northerner voters have made up their minds on what to do; certainly NNPP, nobody can change it,\u201d Kwankwaso said during an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Sunday Politics.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there are many issues in the South East, and a northern voter is the worst-hit in this issue of maladministration in this country. But even under that circumstance, a northern voter also believes that he is better with one united Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTherefore, most of the things that are happening in the South, especially in the South-East; people are not comfortable with that and as long as you have somebody from there in any party, it will be very difficult for the northern voters to vote, and that\u2019s the situation now,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Kwankwaso has informed that the NNPP Committee has been working to meet with Obi with a view to working together to take the leadership of the country at all levels.\n\nHe said, \u201cI believe it will happen, but I also believe that there are some challenges that we are having especially from the side of the Labour Party itself because there are so many influences.\n\n\u201cSome on their side have positive and even negative sides. We have a situation today where there are some people who are in other parties who are also influencing the decision of that party, which I believe is not good for the party,\u201d he added.\n\nKwankwaso, who said he has been to different parts of the country, expressed concern over the situation of the country in terms of economy, security, education and infrastructure.\n\nHe said the people of the country are yearning for change, adding that it will only be fair for the two parties to come together to bring a real alternative for Nigeria.",

          "text": "The Special Counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Aloy Ejimakor, has given reasons for the persistent insecurity in the southeast.\n\nEjimakor said the perceived injustice meted on the southeast is responsible for the persistent insecurity in the region.\n\nHe lamented that people of the southeast are being blamed for insecurity incidents.\n\nEjimakor disclosed this in a statement he signed and issued on Monday.\n\nAccording to Ejimakor: \u201cBefore post-colonial Nigeria lapsed into its current unitary state, while still passing off as a federation, regional security was largely within the purview of the respective regions, not the federal government. And it worked pretty well.\n\n\u201cThis basic arrangement was not by chance but by well-considered design. Despite their many failings, Nigeria\u2019s indigenous founding fathers and the departing British colonists knew too well that you cannot secure a people within their region without their participation. Even the mighty British empire knew that it couldn\u2019t secure colonial Nigeria without the participation of Nigerians in vast numbers.\n\n\u201cIn a diverse federation of equals (or even near-equals or unequal), Northern Nigerians shouldn\u2019t be the ones exclusively or dominantly securing Western or Eastern Nigeria, and vice versa. When you do that, it becomes counter-intuitive to security and begins to look like belligerent occupation or conquest. It also destroys the neutrality of the security personnel, and engenders ethnic profiling and extrajudicial killings.\n\n\u201cTruth be told, massacres won\u2019t happen if there\u2019s no premeditation, driven by sectarian impulses and lack of compatriot empathy customarily exhibited by some security personnel when it comes to law enforcement outside their regions, even when the targets of such law enforcement are unarmed and amenable to arrest.\n\n\u201cThe inherent dangers of an imbalanced security leadership and formations is the main reason the framers of the 1999 Constitution enacted Section 217(3) of the Constitution, which roughly states that \u2018the composition of the officer corps and other ranks of the Armed Forces of the Federation shall reflect the federal character of Nigeria\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn plain terms, it means that no region or tribe shall be markedly excluded from securing Nigeria or any part thereof, especially its own part. But today, the opposite is the case as Southeast officers and ranks are significantly redlined from all critical security formations, particularly the ones based in the Southeast. It makes no sense and it is unconstitutional to boot.\n\n\u201cStill, for the same reason of sectional balance, Section 14(3) of the same 1999 Constitution provides that, \u2018the composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies shall ensure that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few States or from a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that Government or any of its agencies\u2019.\n\n\u201cThis means that the Southeast shall be equal partakers in the opportunities of the Nigerian enterprise. But it is not and uniquely so. To be sure, there\u2019s no better contradiction to the oneness of Nigeria than this profound injustice that appears to have become the norm and has persisted since 2015.\n\n\u201cAnd this: Southeast being continually absent from the table partly explains why each time the witch cries at night in the Southeast and the baby dies in the morning, the authorities jump to conclusions that it\u2019s the witch that killed the baby.\n\n\u201cIn other words, almost every incidence of insecurity, including by State actors and others, ends up being blamed on the people of the Southeast, such that they are now left with no other option than rampant resentment, widespread alienation and popular agitation.\u201d",

          "text": "A former Deputy Governor of Imo State, Jude Agbaso, who served under the then-governor, Rochas Okorocha, has said the administration of the Senator representing Imo West Senatorial District at the 9th Nigerian Senate is the worst in the history of the state.\n\nAgbaso, who was impeached but eventually cleared by the court eight years after, on Monday stated this while speaking to newsmen in Owerri, Imo State capital.\n\nAgbaso, who also doubled as the Commissioner of Works under the same administration, described Okorocha\u2019s eight years as locust years, a total failure and the worst in the history of the state.\n\nHe said the ex-governor was undemocratic and self-centered in his approach to governance.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOkorocha turned down many sound developmental ideas coming from him and gave deaf hear to words of advice from other concerned citizens aimed at helping him govern the state well.\u201d\n\nHe also accused Okorocha, who currently represents Imo West in the Senate, for the arbitrary allocation of contracts without due procedures which amounted to huge wastage of the state resources.\n\nHe maintained that his purported impeachment, which was later nullified by an Owerri High Court in February 2021, was because of his insistence during the administration that due process should be followed in every transaction and project of the government.\n\n\u201cYes I had regrets (being Deputy Governor to Okorocha) especially when you work with people, you make reasonable inputs, but you are being ignored. I give you an instance again, Rochas Okoroch said he was going to build 4,000 kilometers of road network.\n\n\u201cI told him, this is a practical impossibility. It is unachievable. I knew what our monthly receivable from the Local Governments was. I knew what they were for the State Government.\n\n\u201cI asked him, why don\u2019t we do this in a planned, concise manner. Why will you be telling people, hey Mr. A do a contract from here to here; no bill of engineering quantities and no description. So because of that, I asserted my decision that I wasn\u2019t going to append my signature on any unreasonably given contract.\n\n\u201cAnd after I left, no contract was officially and properly done. None of them worked. The few roads that were constructed like that, couldn\u2019t even last a season. The painful thing was that Imo people lost so much money under Okorocha,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhen the Governor tells the civil servants, you can work three days in a week and use the rest days of the week to go to the farm. Is that a way to organize the civil service?\n\n\u201cAfter I left the Ministry of Works, there are no records during the Rochas years; contracts were awarded in the Government House. No Permanent Secretary, no Director, no Engineer because these are the people that keep records in the ministry.\n\n\u201cSo, it became obvious that Rochas does not listen to all these sound policy suggestions. The mind set was to do what pleased him and it is to the exclusion of building strong institutions.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nAs the search for running mate to the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, enters a critical stage, governors and leaders of the party from the North West have kicked against the possible exclusion of the region.\n\nThis is despite the fact that the region occupies the number one position and had occupied several top positions in the country in the recent past.\n\nBoth incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari and late Umaru Yar\u2019adua elected president in 2007, hail from the North West state of Katsina.\n\nIn 2003 and 2011, Bello Masari and Aminu Tambuwal, were elected Speakers of the House of Representatives, both hail from the North West states of Katsina and Sokoto states respectively.\n\nAnd in 2010, following the death of Yar\u2019Adua, former President Goodluck Jonathan, picked Namadi Sambo, also from North West state of Kaduna as vice president.\n\nOn the other hand, the North Central and North East, the two other geo-political zones in the North have not enjoyed the same privileges since 1999.\n\nDaily Sun reliably gathered that Tinubu, a Muslim from the South West, has settled for a serving Muslim governor from the North East, as his running mate.\n\nAPC screens Tinubu, Amaechi, Umahi,... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video APC screens Tinubu, Amaechi, Umahi, 9 others\n\nThe development, it was learnt, has not gone down well with North West governors and leaders, who are insisting on getting the coveted position.\n\nLast week, national vice chairman for North-West, Salihu Lukman, speaking on behalf of leaders from the region, boasted that they have contributed more than 39 per cent of votes recorded by the party during presidential elections in 2015 and 2019.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the zone resolved to aggregate its interests and vital concerns and engage accordingly with the presidential candidate of the party,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was learnt that Tinubu\u2019s inability to convince North West leaders to concede the position to the North East, has led to the delay in the announcement of his running mate.\n\nAn APC source told Daily Sun that series of meetings held between Tinubu\u2019s search team and Northern leaders all settled for a North East candidate. He, however, said the stakeholders had left the choice of picking his running mate to the presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe North West has the voting strength, they can roll out the drums for the APC. Bauchi, though in the North East, can swing votes for the APC because they gave votes to Buhari, twice,\u201d the source said.\n\nHe said leaders also urged Tinubu to pick a sitting governor, who is popular in the region and viewed as a liberal Muslim by the South.\n\nThough he declined to name the possible choice of Tinubu, he, however, said the governor is well-known within the media space in the country.\n\nSpeaking on a Muslim-Muslim ticket, which he claimed APC has settled for, he said: \u201cMost southerners, northern minorities see APC as a Muslim party. So, going for a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the APC is a matter of enlightened self-interest. Some APC governors stood for the South getting the APC ticket and it\u2019s payback time. It now comes to bringing out the votes.\u201d\n\nHe ruled out the chances of Plateau Governor, Simon Lalong, or Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, both Christians from the North East, for the position.\n\n\u201cYou take a Lalong, you take a Boss Mustapha and put them on the ballot, it\u2019s a zero for the APC in 2023. How do they convince their voters to vote if these people are on the ballot? Shettima sincerely wants to be Chief of Staff (CoS) and he wants Zulum to stay back in Borno because if Tinubu takes Zulum as his VP, Shettima\u2019s ambition is in jeopardy; he can\u2019t be CoS. The relationship between the Muslim North and the Christian minorities in the North is not cordial.\u201d\n\nAPC spokesman, Mr. Felix Morka, however, told Daily Sun on telephone that could not confirm if the presidential aspirant had settled for a running mate from the North East.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t confirm that. I can\u2019t deny it either. So, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he saids.\n\nSpokesman of Bola Ahmed Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Bayo Onanuga, was yet to respond to series of phone calls made to him on the subject as at the time of filing in this report.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nSome stakeholders have begun a search for a replacement for the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Iyorchia Ayu, amidst rising tension over the face-off between supporters of Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, and leadership of the party, indications emerged, at the weekend.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that the anti-Ayu group, who are insisting he must be removed before the 2023 polls were looking towards the South East for replacement.\n\nMultiple sources alleged that the move is spear-headed by supporters of the Rivers State Governor, in th National Executive Committee (NEC), and leaders of the party, who voted for Wike as their preferred choice for the vice presidential candidate, at a panel set up by opposition to shop for a suitable running mate for former vice president, Atiku Abubakar.\n\nThe opposition party has been in crisis since the unveiling of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as vice presidential candidate. The choice of Okowa has not gone down well with loyalists of the Rivers State governor.\n\nAccording to them, Wike ought to have been the vice presidential candidate, especially as 14 out 17 members of a special panel to shop for a running mate for Atiku reportedly voted in favour of the Rivers governor.\n\nThe aggrieved party leaders accused Ayu of bias in the processes leading to the emergence of both the PDP candidate and his running mate. Besides, the party chairman is also accused of running the party as a one man show.\n\nThe PDP chairman\u2019s case, it was gathered, is worsened by his recent face-off with his state governor, Samuel Ortom, over nomination of party candidates in the just-concluded primaries.\n\n2023: PDP panel tips Wike for vice ... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video 2023: PDP panel tips Wike for vice presidential candidate\n\nDaily Sun gathered that the development has polarised different organs of the PDP, including the Governors\u2019 Forum and the National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nOn the one side are Wike, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Okezie Ikpeazu, Samuel Ortom and Seyi Makinde governors of Rivers, Enugu, Abia, Benue and Oyo states respectively; while on the other side are governors Okowa, Aminu Tambuwal, Darius Ishaku, Diri Douye, Udom Emmanuel, Godwin Obaseki and Ahmadu Fintiri of Delta, Sokoto, Taraba, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Edo and Adamawa states. Though Bauchi Governor, Bala Mohammed enjoys good relationship with Wike, it could be immediately ascertained which side of the divide he belongs.\n\nSimilarly, Daily Sun gathered that members of the PDP NWC are split into two groups led by Ayu and the deputy national chairman (North) on the one hand and the Deputy National Chairman (South), Taofeek Alapaja, and National Secretary, Samuel Anyanwu, on the other hand.\n\nA party source told Daily Sun that the anti-Ayu group has vowed to stop at nothing to ensure he is removed.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThey have started looking for a replacement for the national chairman. And they are looking towards the South East, as a way of placating the zone, which is aggrieved that it has lost out in the party.\n\n\u201cMost of those who voted for Wike at that panel as their preferred vice presidential candidate are part of them. The NWC is equally split. Atiku may not want Ayu to go. But he will not come out to defend him.\u201d\n\nA source close to one of the governors told Daily Sun that it is only a matter of time, before the PDP chairman is sent packing.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cyou will remember that when Ayu became a national chairman, at a thanks giving that was held for him in Makurdi, the governors came and Wike told Ayu, Mr. National Chairman, you have come to the party at the time that the party needs to heal itself. But if you begin to do otherwise, me, I will \u2018shout o\u2019. He said it three times. I will not keep quiet. It is flowing from there, it is expected that when you are able to help someone, he should be dealing with you with a open hand.\u201d\n\nThe source also said: \u201cAyu went into the competition (nomination exercises) with a biased mind. He had a candidate in mind. And he worked against the very people that worked for him to be chairman. To make matters worse for Ayu; he was fighting Ortom over a House of Representatives seat.\u201d\n\nHowever, in his reaction, Ayu, who spoke through his Special Assistant on Communication and Strategy, Simon Imobo-Tswam, said the alleged plot to oust him is in the realm of rumour.\n\nImobo-Tswan told Daily Sun that the PDP chairman was neither biased in the nomination processes nor is he \u2018running a one man show\u2019.\n\n\u201cIf anyone or group is truly pushing for Ayu\u2019s removal, such a person or group is/are operating from a position of gross ignorance. Do they know what Ayu\u2019s removal entails? If Ayu resigns now, who takes over? A northern candidate? It changed nothing. So, let\u2019s suppose it\u2019s a southern candidate because the presidential candidate is from the North.\n\n\u201cOkay. So, he resigns and the chairmanship goes to the South. Will the South have the national chairman and national secretary? That is an unseen disruption.\n\n\u201cThose calling for Ayu\u2019s resignation are not thinking these things through; they are being driven largely by emotions,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen contacted, PDP National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said there is neither a crack in the opposition party nor in the NWC. Nevertheless, Ologunagba told Daily Sun that the party has a robust conflict resolution mechanism to resolve any issue in the PDP.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthere is no division whatsoever in the party and in the NWC. Any report or idea whatever will be in the realm of fake news intended to divide the party. Knowing fully well that we are united in our mission to rescue and rebuild Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe PDP is united. We must recognise one thing, politics is about interest and conflicting interests. Whatever you hear today, which are in the realm of speculations, in the next 48 hours, they will be saying different things, positively about the party.\u201d",

          "text": "No fewer than 18 people were feared dead in an accident involving two Mazda buses and a Previa bus around Isara Bridge on Lagos-Ibadan express road.\n\nThe Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Corps Public Education Officer (CPEO), Assistant Corps Marshal (ACM) Bisi Kazeem, who made the disclosure in a statement, yesterday, in Abuja, said the accident, which happened around 10:20pm, after the Isara Bridge, involved about 25 people.\n\nHe blamed the accident on over-speeding, which he said led to a multiple and fatal accident thereafter. He said out of the 25 people involved in the accident, six males, one female and one male child were identified, while 17 others were still unidentified.\n\n\u201cThe collision of the two Mazda buses with unidentified colours and registration numbers with the Previa bus resulted in an explosion which involved all the three vehicles. However, seven out of the two Mazda buses on the right lane survived, while others were caught up in the inferno and got burnt beyond recognition.\n\n\u201cAnd those in the Previa bus, which assumedly committed the road traffic violation, got burnt beyond recognition,\u201d he said.\n\nKazeem said that four more charred bodies were found while clearing the obstructions, adding that an unburnt body was also found on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, opposite the crash scene.\n\nHe said that obstructions had been cleared and traffic diversion closed, and that free flow of traffic had been restored. He quoted the Corps Marshal, FRSC, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, as saying that motorists should avoid night travels, adding that life had no duplicate, hence the need to drive with caution.\n\nOyeyemi said that road traffic violations and speed, heightened the spate and fatalities of road traffic crashes during night travels. He advised all road users to endeavour to drive safely to save the lives of other road users by adhering to all road traffic rules and regulations. The FRSC boss assured that the corps was working effectively to ensure a significant shift in the attitude of motorists and all road users across the country.",

          "text": "From Tony Osauzo, Benin\n\nTwo Catholic priests have been reportedly abducted by gunmen in Edo State.\n\nThe priests, Rev. Fathers Udo Peter and Philemon Oboh, of St. Patrick Catholic Church, Uromi and St. Joseph Retreat Centre, Ugboha, respectively, of the Catholic Diocese of Uromi, were said to be travelling from Benin to Uromi when they were abducted, along the Benin-Auchi road, on Saturday.\n\nThe incident occurred less than one week after Rev. Fr. Christopher Odia was gruesomely killed by suspected Fulani kidnappers, at Ikabigbo, in Etsako West Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe Edo State Police Command yesterday confirmed the abduction of the two priests. Spokesman of the Command, SP Chidi Nwabuzor, in a statement, yesterday, said: \u201cThis is to confirm the kidnap incident of two Catholic Reverend Fathers, Rev. Fr. Udo Peter of St. Patrick\u2019s Catholic Church Uromi and Rev. Fr. Philemon Oboh of St. Joseph Retreat Centre, Ugboha, in Esan South East Local Government Area of Edo State.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State Police Command was informed of the incident by the Divisional Police Officer, Ugboha, Edo State, that on Sunday, 03/07/2022, one Rev. Father Amos Abhulimen of St. Dominic Catholic Church Ugboha reported that he was informed by the Catholic authority, via WhatsApp, that the above named Catholic Rev. Fathers were attacked, kidnapped and taken to unknown places by some kidnappers, along Benin-Auchi expressway, between Ehor and Iruekpen communities.\n\n\u201cImmediately, the Commissioner of Police, Edo State, Abutu Yaro, dispatched police operatives to the area and warned to carry out aggressive and well coordinated manhunt in arresting the kidnappers and for the rescuing of the Rev. Fathers unhurt. The CP solicits the cooperation of the general public in giving information to the police and other sister security agencies in policing Edo State,\u201d the statement added.\n\nHowever, the Catholic Bishop of Uromi Diocese, Bishop Donatus Ogun, could not be reached for comments, as he was said to be in a meeting.\n\nAgain gunmen invade, bomb Kogi poli...

The Bishop is in a meeting,\u201d an aide to the Bishop told Daily Sun on telephone.\n\nAlso, a childhood friend of Fr Oboh, Mr Fred Itua, told Daily Sun that \u201cFr. Oboh is a religious priest who, contrary to popular held views, doesn\u2019t have money. His abduction is unfortunate and disheartening. We can only appeal to his abductors to set him free. It\u2019s an appeal. This is very traumatising.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the family of slain abducted Catholic priest of Ikabigbo, Fr Christopher Odia, has debunked media reports that her mother, Philomena Odia Ogedegbe is dead.\n\nThe family, in a statement signed by the late priest\u2019s elder brother, Comrade Robert Ogedegbe, said contrary to the false report, their mother was healthy and mourning her son. Besides, the statement said Kebiru, the arrested Fulani man who masterminded the kidnap and killing of Fr. Christopher Odia, was not his gardener nor gateman.\n\n\u201cWe, however, wish to set the records straight that the said Kebiru was neither Fr Christopher\u2019s gardener nor gateway, but was only living in the same Ikabigbo community, where our son/brother was pastoring the Catholic faithful as priest,\u201d the statement added.",

          "text": "As a prominent president of an African nation once explained to then US President Barack Obama, there are lines that Africans should never cross regardless of what the international community thinks. One of such lines is sexuality. While the rest of the world considers the pairing of a man and a woman to be conventional and can be flipped in the name of homosexuality, most of us are not having it. Even so, not everybody has been brave enough, like that African President, to speak out against the rising tide of this behaviour. But the Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), Segun Runsewe, is leading the conversation.\n\nNot long ago, there was a viral video that almost turned social media on its head: the video of Bobrisky (real name Idris Okeneye) in his female fa\u00e7ade during his alleged housewarming ceremony. In the beginning, Bobrisky received knocks because he claimed that he bought the house for N400 million.\n\nDuring the ceremony, however, Bobrisky was not the main attraction, rather the Islamic clerics who attended the housewarming ceremony took the spotlight.\n\nThe clerics were not at Bobrisky\u2019s party to renounce his cross-dressing lifestyle. They were there to pray for him, which is the norm on this side of the world whenever one accomplishes something worthwhile. Even though Bobrisky was dressed, spoke, and acted as a female, the clerics had nothing to say except to smile and bob their heads in the face of his aberrant behaviour.\n\nWhat Runsewe predicted not long ago is gradually taking root. According to him, if the Nigerian government does not take a firm stand on the matter of homosexuality and its associated lifestyles (including cross-dressing), it is only a matter of time before it becomes accepted.

          "text": "Troops of the Nigerian military comprising the Navy and the Army have reportedly killed dozens of innocent citizens in the productive age bracket in Ogbaru communities of Anambra State.\n\nSaharaReporters was told that the wanton killings, it was gathered took place on Tuesday night, 28th and early hours of Wednesday, 29th June 2022 at Ossomala, Umunankwo and Obeagwa communities.\n\nThe deployment of the military personnel in the area had begun in the evening of Tuesday during which they claimed to be looking for unknown gunmen that recently laid the area under siege, according to sources.\n\nThe soldiers, according to information SaharaReporters obtained,later turned their guns on the defenceless and unarmed natives and others, while abandoning the forests where the locals said were the hideouts of the unknown gunmen located inside big river/swamp forest of Obene-Ochuche/Umuzu/Okija divided by Ulasi River.\n\nThe soldiers were said to have been mobilised from Ogbaru Naval Base and Onitsha 302 Artillery Regiment in over 20 trucks with arms and ammunition. They were said to have targeted defenceless locals mainly young males and opened fire on them at close range and killed dozens.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s constitutional court has ruled against Khumbudzo Ntshavheni\u2019s decision to switch off analogue broadcast systems by June 30, 2022, declaring it unconstitutional. Ntshavheni \u2013 who serves as the country\u2019s current Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies \u2013 wants South Africa to migrate to digital broadcast systems.\n\nThis follows an appeal by e.tv and two other applicants, Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) and SOS Support Public Broadcasting, who sought to overturn a judgment and order of the High Court of South Africa that had ruled in favour of the minister and government earlier this year.\n\nIn 2006, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), of which South Africa is a member, resolved that all member states in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East should migrate from analogue broadcasting systems to digital broadcasting systems by the year 2015.\n\nCurrently, in South Africa, traditional analogue broadcast systems are occupying the frequency bands between 700 MHz and 800 MHz which could be used for mobile data. Digital migration would free up those bands, making the provision of mobile data services cheaper.\n\nTo comply with the ITU resolution, in September 2008, the then minister of communications and digital technologies in South Africa, Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, published a Broadcasting Digital Migration Policy (BDM Policy) which stated that the analogue switch-off would be on November 1, 2011, 4 years earlier than the ITU\u2019s proposed deadline.\n\nIn February 2021, South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced that the phased switch-off of analogue transmitters would be completed by the end of March 2022.\n\nOn October 5, 2021, the minister made a final call for those qualifying for state-sponsored set-top boxes (STBs) to register, with the deadline for registration set for October 31, 2021. STBs would enable households to continue having access to television channels on their analogue television sets after the analogue switch-off.\n\nAfter this announcement, e.tv brought an application to the High Court against minister Ntshavheni, seeking to prevent the minister from disconnecting millions of people who had not yet migrated to digital transmission.\n\nIn the court order, the applicants wanted the minister to, among other requests, consult all affected parties before determining the analogue switch-off date as well as provide a report on the steps taken to ensure access to STBs within 1 month of the date of the court order.\n\nIn its judgement on March 28, the court had accepted that out of over 14 million television sets in South Africa, 10.5 million were compliant with digital transmission and 3.75 million were analogue.\n\nThe High Court held that 3 months would be sufficient to allow the minister to complete the outstanding installation of STBs in households with analogue television sets.\n\nIn the final ruling, the High Court dismissed the application from e.tv, MMA and SOS but extended the analogue switch-off date to June 30, 2022.\n\nFollowing the ruling by the High Court, e.tv, MMA and SOS appealed the matter against the minister in the Constitutional Court arguing that the Minister had a duty to consult the public, including the applicants, before imposing the STB registration cut-off date and determining the analogue switch-off date.\n\nIn a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court ruled that the power to determine the analogue switch-off date and the registration deadline for STBs is located within the minister\u2019s original constitutional policymaking function. The court thereafter had to determine whether the minister exercised this power rationally and lawfully.\n\nIn that respect, the Constitutional Court held that it was not only irrational but also unlawful for the minister to set a switch-off date without adequate notice to the analogue broadcast providers and the public.\n\nAs to the remedy, the Court held that the decisions of the minister, as well as the order of the High Court, had to be set aside.\n\nThe judgement will further delay South Africa\u2019s migration into digital broadcasting, meaning that services like mobile data which could do with the freed-up space on the frequency spectrum as a result of digital migration will continue to be expensive, further hurting citizens\u2019 pockets.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Residents of the Ogbaru community in Ogbaru Local Government Area of Anambra State have accused the Nigerian Army of killing their innocent youths in the guise of fighting crime and criminality in the area.\n\nOgbaru is one of the communities where a curfew had been imposed over its high crime rate and military personnel has been reportedly dislodging some criminal camps in recent times.\n\nThe soldiers have also reportedly invaded several Indigenous People of Biafra/Eastern Security Network camps in the community and killed the dissidents.\n\nThe residents\u2019 lamentation followed alleged killings on Tuesday and Wednesday at Ossomala, Umunankwo and Obeagwa communities by the army.\n\nAn elder in the community who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the military personnel had been searching houses and in the process allegedly killed over 100 youths in the community.\n\nHe said the community was not against the military fighting criminal elements, but they are worried that scores of innocent lives have been lost in the process.\n\nHe said, \u201dTroops of the Nigerian military comprising the Navy and the Army have killed dozens of innocent citizens in their productive age bracket in Ogbaru.\n\n\u201cThe deployment of the military personnel in this area began in the evening of Tuesday during which they claimed to be looking for unknown gunmen that recently laid the area under siege.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers turned their guns on the defenceless and unarmed natives and others while abandoning the forests that are the hideouts of the unknown gunmen located inside big river/swamp forest of Obene-Ochuche/Umuzu/Okija divided by Ulasi River.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers were mobilised from Ogbaru Naval Base and Onitsha 302 Artillery Regiment in over 20 trucks with arms and ammunition. They targeted defenceless locals mainly young males and opened fire on them at close range and killed scores. They also wounded and arrested others who are later to be questionably labelled as \u201cESN/IPOB hoodlums.\u201d\n\nViral videos of the alleged attack showed abandoned corpses shot on the foreheads, heart regions, stomach, back and reproductive organ region littered in several locations of the community.\n\nThe soldiers were also accused of invading several \u201csacred\u201d places, destroying the places, and displaying sacred symbols while linking their adherents to IPOB and ESN.\n\nA security analyst and board of trustees chairman of a rights group, International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, Mr Emeka Umeagbalasi, in a statement, described the alleged killings as a genocide.\n\nUmeagbalasi lamented that the sanctity of human lives was not prioritized, likewise the principles of use of force, adding that the pictures and videos of the incident clearly connoted \u201cegregious and industrial-scale massacre of unarmed citizens\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cNo doubt that Ogbaru is one of the council areas presently under the grip of syndicated criminal entities engaging in several nefarious activities including abductions, killings, armed robberies and ransom demands as well as counterfeiting ESN trademarked modes of operation by attacking security operatives and government facilities.\n\n\u201cBut latest findings by Intersociety showed that the criminal entities are camped inside big river/swamp Forest of Obene-Ochuche/Umuzu/Okija divided by Ulasi River. The area covers Ogbaru Communities of Atani, Amiyi, Umuzu, Ochuche, Akiri-Ozuzu, Osamari, Umunankwo and Ogwuanaocha\n\n\u201cInformation available to Intersociety also has it that they have camps at different forests in Umunankwo and Ogwuanaocha.\n\n\u201cConsequently on the night of Tuesday, 28 June 2022, over 20 trucks of soldiers, arms and ammunition were mobilised and the areas were invaded in an aimless war grade operation and instead of the military personnel including Naval and Army Personnel from Ogbaru Naval Base and Onitsha 302 Artillery Regiment going into the affected Forest camps, they let loose on innocent locals, shooting them at close range including foreheads, chests, manhood and other terminal regions.\n\n\u201cSeveral or dozens were killed in the end as you might have seen in the videos and pictures of the aftermath of the invasion.\n\n\u201cThe rampaging military personnel also went into villages and broke homes at late night, forcing scores to be killed and other defenseless natives of the affected communities to escape through River Niger and others.\n\n\u201cOur findings further showed that the slain were members of defenseless locals and have nothing to do with \u201cUnknown Gunmen\u201d who the Nigerian security forces have severally and publicly acknowledged bearing charms preventing bullet penetration.Also no armed person could have been shot at such close range and killed easily that way at his terminal region without dodging and stiff defensive resistance.\u201d",

He played only twice for England.\n\nThe former football star his 17-year-long career, scored over 150 goals and won the 1988 FA Cup.\n\nHis \u201crefusal\u201d to play Nigeria was then earned him the scorn of the country\u2019s football fans.\n\nBut speaking on why he chose the Three Lions over the Super Eagles, Fashanu alleged he was denied a chance of representing Nigeria thrice because he would not pay a bribe.\n\nHe narrated how the late Moshood Abiola flew him into the country to play for the national team but he was rejected by the coaches despite playing top-flight football in the English Premier League (EPL).\n\n\u201cI remember a long time ago in England and I was London with my son and this Nigerian came up to me and said: \u2018You are a bloody traitor to your own country.\u2019 Then I went to a bar with him I talked it through with him.

          "text": "Ahead of the formal announcement of substantive vice presidential candidate of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), the party has declared that it will prioritise competence ahead of religion or any other consideration.\n\nThe party had submitted a place holder\u2019s name temporarily as a running mate to its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nVarious interest groups, including religious bodies and others, have expressed divergent opinions on the issue.\n\nWhile some are insisting on the political desirability, others are of the view that a Muslim-Muslim ticket won\u2019t be a fair decision.\n\nA case for competence\n\nBut speaking with newsmen Sunday in Abuja, APC\u2019s Deputy National Organising Secretary Nze Chidi Duru said the party would nominate a very competent and capable person to complement Tinubu\u2019s strength and weakness.\n\nAccording to Duru, APC has not taken a decision that it must come from a particular religion or tribe.\n\n\u201cOn Muslim-Muslim joint ticket, I think we must not bicker about denomination of who eventually emerges as our vice president. What is clear is that the party will nominate a very competent and capable person that will complement the strength and weakness of our candidate.\n\n\u201cAs it is today, what we have is a Muslim-Muslim joint ticket. Religion is no longer an issue for the party. I have said that we are looking for a capable and competent nationalist to complement our candidate.\n\n\u201cIt may be that we are going to reap the benefit of 1993 where people will no longer talk about religion and tribe but those that will do well for us and lift the country and provide the required leadership that Nigeria deserves.\n\n\u201cAll I want to say is that he will come from the Northeast, Northwest or North Central. This is the stand of the party for now. We will not bathe in the realm of congestion of whether he is the rightful candidate. He is capable in his own right,\u201d Duru said.\n\nWhen asked whether Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of Labour Party is a threat in 2023, Duru said: \u201cSowore is a threat, Atiku among other candidates are a threat to the APC. But what is important is that we are not complacent. APC understands that the party in power is a sitting duck waiting to be taken out.\n\n\u201cWe also understand that what could change is for the opposition to take over power and the party in power becomes the opposition party. We will work hard. While other parties are struggling to resolve their crisis, APC has managed the various tendencies and it is, therefore, easy for us across the board to handle situations.\u201d\n\n\u2018Christians abound in the North\u2019\n\nBut another APC chieftain and Director General Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, said Tinubu has a wide range of areas in the North to look for a Christian running mate.\n\nOkechukwu said there are Christians in Sokoto, Kebbi, Borno and many other states in the North to choose running mate from.\n\nThe VON boss also declared that Tinubu would win the presidential election by 60 percent.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe last I heard from our presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is that he is still searching and luckily, he has a wide variety of areas to search from, from River Benue up to the last point in Jibia, Dutse, Lake Chad boundary. So, if you are the one searching in a wide vast area where we have over 100 people with about 44 million voters which might go up to 50 million, you have a wide range of areas to search.\n\n\u201cLuckily for us, a lot of people will not know that even in Kebbi, Sokoto, there are Christians. Even in Borno, there are Christians. He has a wide range of areas to look for Christians. So Asiwaju has 60% of winning this election. We are in charge of 22 states of the federation. We have the majority in National and State Houses of Assembly \u2013 they are not going to betray him.\n\n\u201cEven for us in the South/east that has never been our stronghold on the day of election we are going there to protect our mandate. Otherwise, if I don\u2019t defend it, did I get appointment before APC won presidential election?\n\n\u201cWhatever is my preference, if I want my office to remain, it means I must support Asiwaju, it\u2019s applicable to those who are board members whether you are coming from Yenogoa or Dutse, so that is the power of incumbency.\u201d\n\nGroup cautions\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Democracy Defence Watch (NDDW) Sunday warned on the danger of presenting a Muslim/Muslim ticket by the governing APC in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIt said such development would not only be a threat to national stability but could also retard peace and security in Nigeria.\n\nIn a seven-page letter to President Muhammadu Buhari, a copy of which was obtained by Blueprint, the civic group said if the APC goes ahead with the Muslim/Muslim ticket agenda, it would only portray Nigeria as an Islamic and sectarian nation which will be ultimately resisted by the nation\u2019s millions of practicing Christians, moderate and progressive Muslims and civic groups, ethno-cultural associations and enlightened members of the International community.\n\nNDDW National Coordinator and National Secretary, Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Adamu, and Otunba Adeniji Niyi Adegoke respectively, sounded the caution in the letter titled \u2018APC\u2019s Muslim/Muslim ticket in Nigeria\u2019s 2023 Elections: A Threat to National Stability, Regional Peace and Security.\u2019\n\nThe group said it is worried more, particularly with the international dimension it is taking with a recent letter by five United States senators to the US Senate where they are calling for readmission of Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) due to the worsening sectarian violence in the country.\n\n\u201cThe US senators observed that \u2018horrific acts of deadly violence have been committed against Nigerian Christians in recent weeks, including the massacre of church goers on Pentecost Sunday and the stoning of a Christian college student.\n\n\u201cSadly, such violence has become all too familiar for Christians in Africa\u2019s most populous country\u2026Religious violence and intolerance directed toward Nigerian Christians has worsened in recent years. One report documented more than 4,650 cases of Nigerian Christians who were killed for their faith in 2021,\u201d the body said.\n\nThey therefore called on President Buhari to direct the security forces to do the needful by advising the APC presidential candidate and the ruling party on the possible threats the action could pose to security in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note the serious implications of the above with regards to security. This is especially when one rightly imagines that Christians will feel threatened with a Muslim/Muslim ticket, and may resort to pulpit preaching and mobilization of opinions across the Christendom.\n\n\u201cCivil society organisations and students would likely protest this destructive introduction into our polity in various manners which may constitute security concerns. However, it should be noted that the \u201coriginal sin\u201d is the adoption of a Muslim/Muslim ticket by the ruling APC, and not the reactions and responses that may follow it,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe letter, copied to all heads of democratic and security institutions in Nigeria as well as other international concerns, also warned on the danger such political arrangement could cause on the continental security.\n\n\u201cThe West African sub \u2013 regional, and indeed, African regional peace and security are basically predicated on the presumption of Nigeria\u2019s political stability, or at least, the absence of any conflict that can overwhelm the Nigerian State. This is because there is nothing in the African Peace and Security Architecture that is designed to contain a conflict in Africa\u2019s largest population of over 200 million people in a country that shares very porous borders with three sub \u2013 regions \u2013 West, Central and North Africa.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, its humanitarian consequences are frightening to imagine \u2013 in the event of a civil war or armed conflict in Nigeria, there will be a complete sub \u2013 regional melt down in 72 hours, if just 5 percent of the Nigerian population crosses the borders. Its economic repercussions will be a total calamity across the entire sub regions of West and Central Africa. The security implication of weapons proliferation and explosion of the two deadly terrorist organizations currently based in Nigeria, into the rest of the entire continent of Africa, can only be better be imagined.\n\n\u201cWe therefore implore you to use your good offices to weigh in on Sen Bola Ahmed Tinubu to thread with caution and refrain from his unyielding desire to foist on the nation a MUSLIM-MUSLIM ticket which if it succeeds will make the above tragic and destructive humanitarian quagmire a distinct possibility,\u201d the NDDW further cautioned.\n\n\u2026HURIWA too\n\nSounding similar warning, the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) said an APC Muslim-Muslim ticket was tantamount to playing with fire.\n\nIn a statement by its national coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, HURIWA said the emergence of a Muslim-Muslim ticket presidency would further heighten the aggression against Christians by bandits and terrorists claiming allegiance to Islam.\n\nHURIWA condemned the alleged plan insisting it is unconstitutional and violates Section 14 (3) and (4) and Section 318 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which specifically states that the principle of federal character should be reflected in the composition of the government and that no group, religious or ethnic, should dominate the other.\n\nOnwubiko said: \u201cThe nomination will endanger national unity and will divide Nigeria irretrievably. If Tinubu goes on with a Muslim running mate, the APC should just forget about Nigeria because religious war will break out and Nigeria\u2019s case will be worse than Somalia\u2019s.\u201d\n\nGroup roots for Lalong\n\nAlso, the National Coalition for Democracy, Peace and Unity has rejected APC\u2019s planned bid for a Muslim-Muslim ticket, while urging Asiwaju Tinubu to pick Plateau state Governor Simon Lalong.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of a one-day political summit held Sunday in Kaduna, NCDPU said it would only work with political parties and candidates with considerations for the diversity and regional interests of Nigeria.\n\nIt said topic of the summit, \u201cThe 2023 Presidential Elections; Need for a United and Peaceful Nigeria\u201d was carefully selected to discuss the best approach to addressing the issues overheating the polity ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 jointly signed by the National Coordinator and Secretary, Comrade Ibrahim Ringim and Comrade Peter Emmanuel respectively, said: \u201cAs concerned democrats, we are deeply worried about the potential threats and political crisis that would be created if the ruling party resolved to consider a Muslim-Muslim ticket during the forthcoming 2023 presidential elections. The political summit was informed by the palpable tension stirred up by regional agitations and the impending crisis that the idea of Muslim-Muslim ticket could cause.\n\n\u201cAfter an exhaustive deliberation by the Executive Members on the way forward for a sustainable peace and progress of our dear country, we resolved that in the interest of national unity, it is good for the ruling APC and its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to pick a Christian running mate in the same manner the main opposition party, PDP has done. We are asking all political parties to strike a balance along religion and ethnicity for a united and peaceful coexistence.\u201d\n\nWhile endorsing Governor Lalong as Tinubu\u2019s running mate, they said: \u201cIt is in public domain that Lalong has shown himself to be a unifier, who has managed the crises in Plateau very well that even the Muslims in the state are comfortable with him, evidence that he will no doubt be fair to all.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The Coordinator, Stand Up Nigeria, Sunday Attah, on Saturday berates the action of some oil marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nAttah describe the development as most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits.\n\nThe Coordinator, in his One Day Rally Text on the Lingering Fuel Crisis in FCT and Some other States in Nigeria said, the rally became pertinent in view of the toll the fuel crisis is taking on the economy of Nigeria and the attendant socio-economic effect on citizens.\n\n\u201cQuite unfortunately, queues have resurfaced in many states including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, that many are finding it difficult to go about their normal schedule without incurring further costs.\n\nConsequently, Nigerians have expressed outrage at the build up of these queues and the resultant hardship.\n\nWhile the outrage is justifiable given Nigeria status as the 6th largest oil nation in the world and the hardship occasioned by the need to access Premium Motor Spirit, the angst is misplaced as the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC) which some are blaming for the current situation is totally blameless as it is equally worried and doing all it could to bring the situation to normal.\n\nThe NNPC under the able leadership of Mele Kyari has no hand in the resultant hardship being suffered by Nigerian in the bid to access the petroleum product as the corporation has been up and doing to ensure that Nigerians have enough fuel to power their vehicles and other devices for the well being of the citizenry\u201d the statement\u201d.\n\nThe group however, exonerated the NNPC from playing any role in the ongoing scarcity after carrying out investigation into the cause of the problem.\n\n\u201cOur investigation have revealed NNPC has not relented in its task of importing products so as to ease transportation and other challenges that have to do with the use of fuel.\n\nWe can authoritatively say that all the jetties are fully stocked as a result of these efforts and currently have no less than 1. 9 billion liters of fuel which ordinarily should serve Nigerians for 32 days non stop even if a single liter is not been imported within the intervening period.\n\nOur findings have also revealed that there is no problem with transportation of products as government has not only paid but has increased the incentives for transporters.\n\nThe problem, we have since established is not with the NNPC but with the marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nThis is most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits\u201d.\n\nFurther more, that in order to maximize the profit for transporters, the government has even increased the freight cost with N10 per liter which brings to about N24 per liter the amount it pays to transporters on every liter\n\nThis is a huge amount that when multiplied results in huge profits for the marketers and ordinarily should have encouraged them to work harder in line with government\u2019s bid to satisfy the citizenry.\n\nThis is more so as the government did that without transferring the responsibility to consumers so as not add to the hardship on Nigerians.\n\nWe therefore frown at the artificial scarcity being created by marketers all in the bid to maximize profit at the expense of millions of Nigerians who are being forced to pay double for fares in order to move from one place to the other and the man hours being wasted just to buy fuel.\n\nVital component of the economy like banks, courts, factories etc are forced to reduce their working hours due to lack of fuel.\n\nWe therefore call on the marketers to show more sense of patriotism by taking into cognisance the pains they put other Nigerians through just to make profit.\n\nWe commend the NNPC GMD for standing firm for Nigeria in this trying period and for shunning all forms of intimidation to take actions that are against the interest of the masses.\n\nLooking at other countries and the global price of PMS across the world today, we can confidently say that Mallam Mele Kyari is a miracle worker to see that Nigeria and Nigerians are still buying PMS for 165 per liter.\n\nIn the USA a gallon of PMS is sold for 5.4 dollars, in Europe it is sold for 4.9 Euro, while back home in Africa, Ghana is selling for 11.87 cedi which is about 587 naira.\n\nThe landing cost of PMS to our country today is 600 per liter and government has not added one naria to what the marketers were buying before so should the marketers think of selling above government price all in the name of transportation cost?\n\nThis is why we are calling on all oil marketers and other stakeholders in the industry to be patriotic and shun sharp practices and put the interest of Nigeria and Nigerians above their high profit-making Target\u201d, Sunday added.",

          "title": "Economy Diversification: Why Nigeria\u2019s mining sector offers robust economic potential- Adegbite",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

          "text": "Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Mr Gbenga Komolafe, on Sunday said that with the surging participation of Nigerians in the oil and gas sector, local operators are now responsible for as much as 50 per cent of gas production and 30 per cent of crude oil output.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja last night at the Independent Petroleum Products Group (IPPG), Gala in celebration of the industry icons, Komolafe stated that at least 29 assets have been divested in recent years and are now being operated by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs at today, I am proud to say that indigenous companies contribute about 30 per cent of crude oil and 60 per cent of gas production as well as 40 per cent and 32 per cent of oil and gas reserves respectively,\u201d he added.\n\nHe explained that today, seven indigenous companies are among the top 20 with the highest oil reserves in the country.\n\nHe stated that the IPPG remains a major force in the exploration of the nation\u2019s hydrocarbons resources for optimal value addition, promising to ensure a clement regulatory environment for the oil producers.\n\nThe NUPRC boss recalled that prior to 1970, the Nigerian oil and gas space was dominated by foreign companies in the upstream and downstream sectors, with the first award of oil blocks to two indigenous companies failing because of lack of finances and technical know-how.\n\nSince then, Komolafe noted that there have been a number of programmes where 30 blocks were awarded on sole risk basis, while 24 were awarded between 2003 and 2004.\n\n\u201cOver 29 assets have been divested between 2009 till date presenting an opportunity for indigenous companies,\u201d he stated.\n\nFifty seven fields, he recalled were recently issued in 2020 resulting in 102 Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPLs) issued by the commission to indigenous companies.\n\nHe revealed that Nigeria has the largest participation of local operators in the oil and gas space among all petroleum producing countries in Africa, arising from a robust local content policy.\n\n\u201cAs a regulator, the commission is not oblivious of the threats posed to the development of the Nigeria\u2019s hydrocarbons industry by divestments of the IOCs which is mainly attributable to a hostile upstream environment arising from the menace of crude oil theft and energy transition,\u201d he added.\n\nHe urged the IPPG to see the divestment in the IOCs assets as an opportunity rather than a threat, stressing that it was time to look inwards and deploy their competences in the industry.\n\nKomolafe posited that the energy demand in Africa by 2040 will increase by 30 per cent compared to the current level, adding that divestment from onshore and shallow water will give a huge chance to local IPPG members.\n\nHe urged IPPG to remain competitive, adopt innovation in decarbonisation and cost efficiency, ensure good relations with host communities and be prepared to make the right investment in gas infrastructure.\n\nAccording to him, section 52 has set out the oil and gas fund which he said could be good for mergers and acquisitions, partnerships and synergies.\n\nThe IPPG is an umbrella body of the indigenous Petroleum Exploration and Production (E&P) companies in Nigeria. The Group was established in 2015 with the primary objective of promoting and advancing the development of the Nigerian energy industry.\n\nIt has 25 members which engages government and other industry stakeholders on matters affecting the industry with a view to realising a sustainable industry aspirations and maximising its contribution to the socio-economic development of Nigeria.\n\nAlso speaking, Chairman IPPG, Abdulrasaq Isa, noted that improving in-country value extraction of Nigeria\u2019s hydrocarbon resources and supporting the country\u2019s energy security remain one of the lofty goals of the group.\n\nHe commended the President, Muhammadu Buhari, for his steps to lift the petroleum industry through the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) as well as his support for the group and lauded the transparent conduct of the recent marginal fields bid rounds.\n\nAccording to him, the event was held to recognise individuals who contributed immensely to the sector in the past years.\n\nSome of those honoured included the Pioneer Chair of Seplat, Ambrosie Orjiako, Austin Avuru of Platform Petroleum, Abdulrasaq Isa of Waltersmith, Dr. Tunde Afolabi of Amni International and Layi Fatona, Pioneer Managing Director of Niger Delta E&P.\n\nOthers were: Danjuma Saleh of Waltersmith, Charles Odita, formerly of Shell and Midwestern Oil,Oluseye Fadahunsi , Adebayo Ayorinde, Osariemen Owieadolor, Ignatius Ifelayo, Ebiaho Emafo, Pade Durotoye and Dr Ladi Bada.",

          "title": "PDP Urges Buhari to Investigate Ex-Army Chief Buratai Over Recovered N1.8bn",
          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Sunday called on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately recall the former Chief of Army Staff (COAS) and Ambassador to Benin Republic, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai (rtd) to face investigations and clear his name over alleged connection with the N1.8 billion recovered by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in a property in Abuja.\n\nIn a statement, the National Publicity Secretary, PDP, Debo Ologunagba, said the party\u2019s demand for the recall and investigation of Buratai was predicated on the earlier assertion by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen. Babagana Monguno, after the exit of Buratai as COAS that the $1 billion drawn from the national coffers under the APC administration for the purchase of arms to fight terrorism in the country could not be traced.\n\nThe PDP said the assertion by the NSA heightened suspicion on allegations of barefaced looting of money meant to equip the security forces.\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cSuch corruption under the APC administration has led to the upsurge in unhindered terrorism attacks, mass killing of citizens and loss of many of our gallant fighters in the front in the last seven years.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore of serious interest to Nigerians when reports that the ICPC discovered the sum of N1.8 billion in various currencies, expensive cars and jewelries secreted in a property in Abuja allegedly linked to the former COAS broke out.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the PDP said, \u201cThere are already apprehensions that the discovered money is part of the security fund that was criminally diverted. This is especially against the backdrop of the frenzy and spirited efforts by certain quarters linked to the APC to suppress investigation and free flow of information, politicise the matter and sweep it under the carpet.\u201d\n\nThe PDP urged Nigerians to recall that it had on several occasions alleged that the looting of the treasury was officially sanctioned and enabled by the APC administration with its refusal to prosecute those who were alleged and found to have been involved in massive corruption.\n\nIt further recalled it had also alleged that the PDP drew attention to plans of the APC to create a slush fund account from monies fraudulently drawn from the national treasury to finance their plot to rig the 2023 general elections.\n\nThis, the PDP said was evidenced by the alleged massive use of money by the APC to prosecute a vote buying scheme in the recent Ekiti State Governorship election.\n\n\u201cThe prevalence of vote buying in that election by the APC was even acknowledged by the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Yakubu Mahmood, which prompted the INEC Chairman to demand for speedy trial of those arrested for vote buying in the Ekiti State election,\u201d the PDP stated\n\nThe PDP also said reports of massive looting by APC leaders and their cronies in government Ministries, Departments and Agencies further confirmed the ruling party was a haven for treasury looters.\n\nMoreover, it said the recent alleged looting of N80 billion by the suspended Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, \u201cwhich investigation has now gone cold is suspected to have been engineered by the cabal at very high level of the APC administration.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the PDP, the spokesperson said the party is standing with Nigerians, insisting that Buratai should return to the country and personally face investigation to clear his name.\n\nIn view of this, the PDP stated: \u201cThis is because any allegation bordering on looting of funds meant for the fight against terrorism is of grave national concern and consequence. It must be thoroughly investigated and anybody found wanting must be made to face the full weight of the law no matter how highly placed.\u201d",

          "title": "Insecurity Persists In Nigeria Because Previous Acts Not Punished, Says PDP Presidential Candidate Atiku",
          "text": "Presidential candidate of Nigeria\u2019s opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, on Sunday, said killings by raiding assailants and general insecurity across the country had continued unabated because culprits from previous incidents were left unpunished, and this naturally generated more criminals.\n\nAtiku said the situation might remain, except the authorities went beyond mere issuance of threats to actually punish those behind the killings. Arguing that not dealing decisively with the killers creates an atmosphere for others to plan future attacks. He declared that with the current state of the country, everyone was vulnerable.\n\nBut the former vice president believed the fate of the country depended on happenings within the main opposition party, saying when PDP gets better, hope for a better Nigeria is rekindled.\n\nIn a related development, the military high command, weekend, said it would take appropriate steps to address the issue of ambushment of soldiers, which had hindered military operations in the North-west and North-east over the years. It stated that in spite of the ambushing of troops by terrorists, the military had been able to roll back insurgent activities, forcing them to surrender in their thousands.\n\nThe military attributed the recent Shiroro attack to difficult terrain.\n\nPosting on his verified Twitter handle, Atiku, who reacted to recent attacks on security personnel in some parts of the country, also stated that the conflicts in PDP had provided an opportunity for the party to not just come together, but also get stronger together.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe attacks in Niger and Taraba states that led to the loss of scores of lives of soldiers, police personnel and civilians are worrisome. This is yet another attack that further exposes how vulnerable we are.\n\n\u201cMy thoughts and prayers are with the families of the deceased, even as I condole with the Nigerian military and the Nigeria Police. \u2013AA.\u201d\n\nBut when THISDAY exclusively approached the former vice president to expatiate on the security situation and the options before the country, he said, \u201cThe key to ending these spate of attacks on our military formations, from the point of view of civil authority, is to end impunity.\n\n\u201cThese killings keep recurring because previous killings have not been punished. We need to go beyond the rhetoric of mouthing that those behind these killings will face the full wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cThe fact remains that those behind such previous killings have not been dealt with. That is why these killings keep happening, and even as we speak, these belligerents are likely planning future killings. So, we must end impunity. That is one.\n\n\u201cSecondly, from a military standpoint, I am of the view that the president should not talk at the military. Quite the opposite. The holder of that office has to listen to them. They know their strengths and weaknesses. They know better than anyone the threats facing Nigeria. They know where the shoe pinches.\u201d\n\nAtiku said, if elected president next year, \u201cI intend to listen to them and provide them with everything they need. To that end, our soldiers have to be motivated. And I am not just talking about their wages. They have to know that their lives are important to their Commander-in-Chief.\n\n\u201cUnder my watch, such losses of lives will be minimal. However, where even one soldier is killed, it is the duty of the C-in-C to personally empathise with their families, so, those left behind are motivated, because they see that their service to the nation matters.\n\n\u201cIf you join the military, you should have financial and social security. At the barest minimum, if you die in service, then your family becomes the responsibility of the federal government.\n\n\u201cOur troops need the right leadership, the right weaponry, and the right conditions of service. When our military know that the nation and the C-in-C are behind them, these incidents of insecurity will also soon be behind us.\u201d\n\nIn yet another statement, Atiku, while addressing current concerns in the party, said, \u201c when party gets better, hope is higher, Nigeria\u2019s rescue is imminent.\u201d\n\nHe called for a united party, adding, \u201cAs a presidential candidate of the PDP, I shall ensure that I do my all to bring the party together under a formidable umbrella.\n\n\u201cWe must not lose focus of the bigger purpose of rescuing the country from the hardship that fellow Nigerians continue to endure under the ruling party.\n\n\u201cOne of the characteristic attributes of democracy that I admire a lot is that it is a system with an intrinsic asset of crisis management. It becomes even interesting that, perhaps, the most noteworthy outcome of a democratic process is the greater possibility of conflict generation.\n\n\u201cSo, a remarkable lesson that I have learned in politics is that in some instances, conflicts are healthy realities. I know, for instance, that when conflicts arise out of genuine concerns about having an inclusive political process, it signposts the viability of that process and, more importantly, the eagerness of stakeholders to be active participants in the success of such process.\n\n\u201cAs leaders and stakeholders in the Peoples Democratic Party, the simmering agitations in our party are a reflection of our credential as a democratic party. Whatever our agitations are, I believe it is borne out of a collective concern for the growth of our party and the country. Therefore, I don\u2019t see a divided house in the PDP. I see an opportunity for us to come together stronger and united.\u201d\n\n\u2018Military Taking Steps to Tackle Troops\u2019 Ambushment, Killing\u2019\n\nChief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Faruk Yahaya, at the weekend, vowed to track down the terrorists behind the killing of troops in Shiroro, Niger State.\n\nSpeaking in a chat with THISDAY, Director, Defence Information (DDI), Maj. Gen. Jimmy Akpor, who admitted that the military suffered casualties in Shiroro, attributed the development to the difficult terrain, where the attack took place.\n\nAkpor stated, \u201cIt is not a conventional terrain, where you know what is where. If the road is not good that you cannot traverse within 30 minutes and, instead, takes two hours and your vehicle is a marked military vehicle and it is a difficult terrain.\n\n\u201cAnd if you receive a distress call, you have to respond, which was what happened. It is unfortunate we suffered casualties but it\u2019s because of the difficult terrain, bad roads. A bitter lesson learnt, moving forward, we will find appropriate measures.\u201d\n\nSome security experts also spoke with THISDAY on ambushment of troops in Niger State and the North-east.\n\nAssistant Regional Vice President, ASIS International, th world\u2019s largest association of security management professionals, Dr. Kabiru Umar, said poor operational planning was responsible for the persistent ambushment.\n\nUmar said, \u201cThere have been numerous cases of ambush of military and other security convoys in all parts of the country. These ambushes occur against well-protected military and other security convoys, who are travelling between locations for either routine duties or for special missions and on convoys that have been deployed for reinforcement following distress calls involving civilians or other security personnel.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the reasons for the ambushes: poor operational planning and operational security that does not guarantee the security of the operation. These may be because of poor intelligence, a non-secure means of communication (our troops still communicate via GSM lines), fifth columnists that have infiltrated the rank and file, unaddressed grievances that provide incentive for sabotage, and no visual oversight of the mission.\u201d\n\nHe also identified, \u201cDefective intelligence that did not properly situate the capacity and capability of the enemy thereby not properly informing the mission of the likely expectations in terms of the strength of the adversary and dominance within the threat environment.\u201d\n\nUmar explained that the key to preventing further ambushes included correcting the above lapses.\n\n\u201cTechnology can be force multiplier and a quick win towards solving both challenges,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a similar vein, Executive Director, Rule of Law Accountability and Advocacy Centre (RULAAC), Mr Okechukwu Nwangwuma, said the military had failed to deploy resources appropriately.\n\nAccording to Nwangwuma, \u201cIt is scandalous that in spite of huge budgetary allocations and huge borrowings ostensibly to equip the military and strengthen the operational capabilities of the security forces to tackle terrorists and bandits, who are daily kidnapping and killing Nigerians across the country, the terrorists continue to have the upper hand in terms of the sophistication of their arms and operations.\n\n\u201cThey now even operate with helicopters. Every now and then, our soldiers are ambushed in operations, abducted and killed in their numbers by better-armed terrorists. When disgruntled soldiers complain about not being adequately equipped and motivated to face the terrorists or complain about the consequent high casualties on their part, military authorities arrest, court-marshal, imprison, dismiss and/or disappear them.\u201d\n\nHe also accused government of suppressing information on its operations, stressing, \u201cYet, government spokespersons continue to insult the sensibilities of Nigerians by continuing to lie that the military is making progress in tackling banditry and terrorism, and that the state of insecurity is better than the situation they inherited.\n\n\u201cIf it is so, why are they making it a policy of government to suppress information and hide the truth about figures of casualties on the part of soldiers in the field? Why are they not able to rescue kidnapped victims even when their locations are well-known and families are, therefore, left to negotiate and pay ransom to kidnappers to secure the freedom of their kidnapped family members?\n\n\u201cEven with numerous cases of ambush, abduction and killing of our soldiers reported on a daily basis, including the recent Shiroro incident, government continues to live in denial.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians, who have called on President Buhari to resign on account of the incompetence and failure of his regime, have been vindicated by calls by two state governors in the north on the citizens they are elected to govern to buy arms to defend themselves from incessant attacks by terrorists. It is obvious that the Buhari regime is incompetent to provide security to Nigerians. If citizens have to protect themselves, do we still need the government? Certainly not!\u201d\n\nFind Lasting Solution to Insecurity, ACF BoT Chair Tells Buhari\n\nChairman, Board of Trustees (BoT) of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) in Kwara State, Dr. Alimi AbdulRazaq, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to intensify the war against terrorism and find a lasting solution to insecurity in the country. Alimi, a legal icon and Mutawali of Ilorin, however, called on the leadership of ACF and all Nigerians to join hands with the federal government to halt insecurity in the north, in particular, and Nigeria, in general.\n\nSpeaking during a meeting with executive members of the Kwara State chapter of ACF, led by the chairman, Dr. Mohammed Ghali Alaaya, Alimi noted that the government needed the support of all Nigerians in tackling the hydra-headed security challenges facing the country.\n\nHe urged the government to do more in funding the security agencies, adding that more still needs to be done in the area of intelligence gathering in the fight against insurgency, banditry and other violent crimes across the country.\n\nAlimi identified unemployment as one of the causes of insecurity. He applauded the federal and state governments\u2019 efforts to create employment opportunities for the unemployed youth through implementation of robust agricultural policies.\n\nHe described the federal government\u2019s strides in the development of the agricultural value chain through the interventions of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as a step in the right direction.\n\nEarlier, Alaaya had intimated the BoT chairman with the prospects and challenges of ACF in the state and sought his support in the areas of policy and project implementation.\n\nHe appealed to Alimi to use his good offices to reposition ACF in Kwara, stating, \u201cThe need to unify and integrate our people is paramount, but priority should be given to curbing insecurity in the north. We need to promote dialogue across ethnic and religious lines.\u201d\n\nAlaaya pledged the commitment of his team to not only reinvigorate ACF in the state, but also provide the platform to evolve policies and programmes that would meet the yearnings and aspirations of the people of the state and complement the efforts of government at all levels .\n\nChuks Okocha, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Hammed Shittu in Ilorin",

          "text": "Pope Francis has dismissed reports that he plans to resign in the near future, saying he is on track to visit Canada this month and hopes to be able to go to Moscow and Kyiv as soon as possible after that.\n\nIn an exclusive interview in his Vatican residence, Francis also denied rumours that he had cancer, joking that his doctors \u201cdidn\u2019t tell me anything about it\u201d, and for the first time gave details of the knee condition that has prevented him carrying out some duties.\n\nIn a 90-minute conversation on Saturday afternoon, conducted in Italian, with no aides present, the 85-year-old pontiff also repeated his condemnation of abortion following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling last month.\n\nRumours have swirled in the media that a conjunction of events in late August, including meetings with the world\u2019s cardinals to discuss a new Vatican constitution, a ceremony to induct new cardinals, and a visit to the Italian city of L\u2019Aquila, could foreshadow a resignation announcement.\n\nL\u2019Aquila is associated with Pope Celestine V, who resigned the papacy in 1294. Pope Benedict XVI visited the city four years before he resigned in 2013, the first pope to do so in about 600 years.\n\nBut Francis, alert and at ease throughout the interview as he discussed a wide range of international and Church issues, laughed the idea off.\n\n\u201cAll of these coincidences made some think that the same \u2018liturgy\u2019 would happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it never entered my mind. For the moment no, for the moment, no. Really!\u201d\n\nFrancis did, however, repeat his often stated position that he might resign someday if failing health made it impossible for him to run the Church \u2013 something that had been almost unthinkable before Benedict XVI.\n\nAsked when he thought that might be, he said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know. God will say.\u201d\n\nThe interview took place on the day he was to have left for Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan, a trip he had to cancel because doctors said he might also have to miss a trip to Canada from July 24-30 unless he agreed to have 20 more days of therapy and rest for his right knee.\n\nHe said the decision to cancel the Africa trip had caused him \u201cmuch suffering\u201d, particularly because he wanted to promote peace in both countries.\n\nFrancis used a cane as he walked into a reception room on the ground floor of the Santa Marta guest house where he has lived since his election in 2013, eschewing the papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace used by his predecessors.\n\nThe room has a copy of one of Francis\u2019 favourite paintings: \u201cMary, Untier of Knots\u201d, created around 1700 by the German Joachim Schmidtner.\n\nAsked how he was, the pope joked: \u201cI\u2019m still alive!\u201d\n\nHe gave details of his ailment for the first time in public, saying he had suffered \u201ca small fracture\u201d in the knee when he took a misstep while a ligament was inflamed.\n\n\u201cI am well, I am slowly getting better,\u201d he said, adding that the fracture was knitting, helped by laser and magnet therapy.\n\nFrancis also dismissed rumours that a cancer had been found a year ago when he underwent a six-hour operation to remove part of his colon because of diverticulitis, a condition common in the elderly.\n\n\u201cIt (the operation) was a great success,\u201d he said, adding with a laugh that \u201cthey didn\u2019t tell me anything\u201d about the supposed cancer, which he dismissed as \u201ccourt gossip\u201d.\n\nBut he said he did not want an operation on his knee because the general anaesthetic in last year\u2019s surgery had had negative side-effects.\n\nSpeaking of the situation in Ukraine, Francis noted that there have been contacts between Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov about a possible trip to Moscow.\n\nThe initial signs were not good. No pope has ever visited Moscow, and Francis has repeatedly condemned Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine; last Thursday he implicitly accused it of waging a \u201ccruel and senseless war of aggression\u201d.\n\nWhen the Vatican first asked about a trip several months ago, Francis said Moscow replied that it was not the right time.\n\nBut he hinted that something may now have changed.\n\n\u201cI would like to go (to Ukraine), and I wanted to go to Moscow first. We exchanged messages about this because I thought that if the Russian president gave me a small window to serve the cause of peace \u2026\n\n\u201cAnd now it is possible, after I come back from Canada, it is possible that I manage to go to Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first thing is to go to Russia to try to help in some way, but I would like to go to both capitals.\u201d\n\nBut he hinted that something may now have changed.\n\n\u201cI would like to go (to Ukraine), and I wanted to go to Moscow first.

Wade ruling establishing a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion, Francis said he respected the decision but did not have enough information to speak about it from a juridical point of view.\n\nBut he strongly condemned abortion, comparing it to \u201chiring a hit man\u201d. The Catholic Church teaches that life begins at the moment of conception.\n\n\u201cI ask: Is it legitimate, is it right, to eliminate a human life to resolve a problem?\u201d\n\nFrancis was asked about a debate in the United States over whether a Catholic politician who is personally opposed to abortion but supports others\u2019 right to choose should be allowed to receive the sacrament of communion.\n\nHouse of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, for example, has been barred by the conservative archbishop of her home diocese of San Francisco from receiving it there, but is regularly given communion at a parish in Washington, D.C. Last week, she received the sacrament at a papal Mass in the Vatican. read more\n\n\u201cWhen the Church loses its pastoral nature, when a bishop loses his pastoral nature, it causes a political problem,\u201d the pope said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\nReuters",

          "text": "Presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Alhaji Rabiu Kwankwaso, says from all indications, Nigerians are tired of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and are desirous of seeing the end of the President Muhammadu Buhari government.\n\naKwankwaso applauded the massive turnout of people to welcome him to Gombe State late Saturday evening, describing it as a sign that the people are ready for the opportunity to do away with the APC federal government at the 2023 general election.\n\nThe NNPP presidential candidate, who was in Gombe to commission the state\u2019s party office, said the massive crowd that came out to welcome him from the airport into the town, had motivated him into believing that Gombe State had joined Kano and others in the league of \u201cKwankwasiya States\u201d.\n\nAddressing supporters at the Gombe International Hotel, shortly after commissioning the party office, Kwankwaso said there were huge indications of a bright future for the barely four months old party.\n\nAccording to him, NNPP would bring real positive change to Nigerians by wiping away the tears and sufferings inflicted by the Buhari government.\n\n\u201cThe greedy APC government officials have collapsed all sectors of the Nigerian economy, with the exception of their pockets,\u201d he said, urging the people to go out and obtain their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), as that is the only means they can use to change the tide in Nigeria.\n\nIn his remarks, Chairman, Board of Trustees of NNPP, Buba Galadima, said the 2023 elections would be very interesting for the NNPP, going by the way they were received in Gombe State. Galadima called on members of the party to go for their PVCs as well as mobilise Nigerians in all parts of the state, especially, in villages, to do same.\n\nThe governorship candidate of the party in the state, Alhaji Ahmed Mailantarki, thanked the presidential candidate for his visit and assured him that the party office would greatly enhance their campaign activities in the state. Mailantarki said NNPP in Gombe State relied very much on the masses, who were the backbone of the party.\n\nHe said NNPP had been able to win the support of Gombe people because they had followed the footsteps of Kwankwaso, who had been empowering the youth to realise their dreams and potential in different sectors.\n\n\u201cBy copying your legacies, we were able to send no fewer than eight young Nigerians to pursue their football career in Europe and other parts of world and we still plan more of such initiative,\u201d Mailantarki told Kwankwaso.",
