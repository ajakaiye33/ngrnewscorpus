          "title": "Buhari\u2019s provocative order on grazing route",
          "text": "Obsessed with outdated animal husbandry practices, the President, Major-General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), instigated fresh controversy on Thursday by declaring strong support for open cattle grazing. In a ghastly interview aired on Arise TV, Buhari adamantly rejected the ban that the governors of the 17 states in the South placed on open grazing in May. With a national stock of 20 million-plus cattle head, Buhari\u2019s open cattle grazing scheme is a threat to settled farming communities across the country.\n\nDemonstrating an uncommon passion for the contentious practice, the President said he would revive grazing routes throughout the country for cattle herders by dusting up a gazette of the First Republic. He argued that nomadism is the culture of the Fulani, not minding the wider implications of the primitive practice.\n\nBuhari\u2019s position is provocative and could further embolden the killer herders. It pits the President in direct conflict with the people in the South and their governors, where farming is the main occupation. Already, large swathes of the North-Central have become killing fields as herdsmen claiming a right to unfettered grazing everywhere are violently destroying lives, farms, and settlements.\n\nTo actualise his morbid ambition, Buhari says the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, will spearhead the resuscitation of the law. \u201cWhat I did was ask him (the AGF) to go and dig the gazette of the First Republic when people were obeying laws,\u201d the President said. \u201cThere were cattle routes and grazing areas. Cattle routes were for when they (herdsmen) are moving upcountry, North to South or East to West, they had to go through there. If you allow your cattle to stray into any farm, you are arrested. The farmer is invited to submit his claims. The khadi or the judge will say pay this amount and if you can\u2019t, the cattle are sold.\u201d Certainly, the President places cultural practice over the constitution of the land.\n\nBuhari should simply perish the thought. The Nigeria of the 1960s is not the Nigeria of today. What is particularly galling in the interview is that Buhari canvassed the same sense of entitlement to other ethnic nationalities\u2019 land as the killer herders. It is simplistic and dangerous for the President to anchor his pet ethnic project on a colonial law that is better forgotten. To the average person in the South, North-Central and even North-Western states like Kebbi and Kaduna, open cattle grazing has become impracticable, particularly because it is a source of farmland destruction, rape, kidnapping, violence, and geographical hegemony by the herders.\n\nGlobally, open grazing has been replaced by pragmatism: ranching, undertaken as a private business. This does not appeal to Buhari in any way. And it is tragic as it may worsen an already explosive situation.\n\nBuhari\u2019s idea is not feasible, going by the law. Since its promulgation in 1978, the Land Use Act has vested all land as trust in state governors. For now, governors hold land for their people. Governors of the South and North-Central states must protect the lives and livelihoods of their people at all costs by strictly enforcing the ban on open cattle grazing. All validly made laws should be enforced. Strikingly, in the same interview, the President has equally challenged the governors to maintain law and order in their domains.\n\nBuhari ought to get real. Open grazing belongs to the distant past of Nigeria\u2019s history. At the level of the President, he ought to promote modern solutions to divisive issues like nomadism. It does not serve anybody\u2019s interest, but provokes ethnic strife and food insecurity, and is a pretext for the chronic violence buffeting the country.\n\nThe President should do things methodically. The logical thing then for Buhari is to learn how other similarly challenged countries substituted their culture of open grazing for ranching.\n\nBy campaigning for open herding, Buhari is about to set the country on fire. He certainly does not need that as part of his doubtable legacy. Without getting emotional, Singapore\u2019s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, eradicated open grazing though it was the culture there. Simply, any retrogressive culture should give way to a modern, inclusive alternative. This is a better way out.\n\nBuhari is walking dangerously on eggshells around him. His regime is too immersed in ethnic politics and animal husbandry. Cattle rearing is a private business, nothing more than trading or farming. Buhari should decouple his regime from a sense of cultural hegemony.",

          "title": "The pains & gains of democracy",
          "text": "By Kayode Adaramodu\n\nWhen the Greeks thought of a system of governance that was all-inclusive, never would they have imagined that it would one day be the most preferred system of administering governance all over the world. From the great city of Athens to the famed halls of the American Capitol building, democracy has garnered strength all over.\n\nEven the great President Abraham Lincoln attests to the inclusiveness of the democratic process and describes it as \u201cthe government of the people, by the people and for the people\u201d. A quote that has reverberated the world over and Nigeria is not left out.\n\nThe beauty of the democratic process must have motivated the hearts and minds of Nigeria\u2019s founding fathers to bond across ethnic and religious differences. This bond forged by the zeal to attain a common goal led to the attainment of independence in 1960.\n\nSadly, shortly after the attainment of independence, our young country soon found itself navigating the murky waters of religious and ethnic differences which culminated in incessant military interventions in governance. The end result of this series of interventions was the annulment of the June 12, 1993 election, which signalled the birth of a new struggle in our dear nation.\n\nNeedless to say that on May 29th, 1999, the country returned to a democratic dispensation and the struggle for the actualisation of the June 12 dream was put to bed. But has the country really enjoyed the dividends of the June 12 struggle?\n\nIn his 1999 speech delivered in Nigeria, former United States president Bill Clinton, posed a series of questions in which he asked, \u201ccan a great country that is home to one in six Africans succeeds in building a democracy amidst so much trouble?\n\nCan a developing country, blessed with enormous human and natural resources, thrive in a global economy and lift all its people?\n\nCan a nation so blessed by the verge and vigour of countless traditions and many faiths be enriched by it? I believe the answer to all those questions can and must be, Yes\u201d.\n\nWhile Bill Clinton saw a way for the nation to progress, the country\u2019s reality has been far from that. The successive Nigerian government in this democratic dispensation has continued to make light of the supreme sacrifice paid by those who fought for the return of the country to democratic rule.\n\nFrom 1999 till date, our nation has experienced woes of bad governance, corruption of epic magnitude, series of human rights abuses as well as economic downturns. In the last few years, security has taken a turn for the worse also, and most recently, the country appears to be seemingly retrogressing from democratic principles. Sadly, my dear state, Ekiti, has not been entirely immune to these multitudes of woes.\n\nThe journey so far has not been all bleak for my country Nigeria as well as my State Ekiti. Far and few in between, some government policies have been geared towards the right direction. We must agree that Democracy is far better than military dictatorship.\n\nSince 1999, we the people, have through our democratic institutions, made laws and policies that directly advanced the course of the people.\n\nIn fact, without democracy, people like us will not have any chance whatsoever to aspire to lead our people, as we are doing now. Whatever plans I have for our people is a direct reflection of our interactions due to the liberty of association, guaranteed by democracy.\n\nWe can take pride in the fact that as a nation and State, we have lived together surmounting various challenges, and I believe that as the Fountain of knowledge, the poor delivery of the dividends of democracy only stands to improve more with the right calibre of servant-leaders at the helms of State affairs.\n\nI will continue to put in my bit for a better Ekiti knowing fully well that someday on the near horizon, we shall once more reap the beauty of our democratic process.\n\nWe must change the narrative!\n\nWe will revive Agriculture; we are an agrarian State. We must bring back our textile industry, creatively employ our youths and empower our women. We will invest more in Education. Our processes will benefit from the emerging opportunities in digital technologies.\n\nMy sleeves are already rolled up, my strategy is ready.\n\nIt is up to you and me, we won\u2019t let the pain outweigh the gain. It is time for us to start to see our desired change.\n\nGod bless the people of Ekiti state, God bless Nigeria.\n\nAdaramodu is a Policy Consultant and 2022 Governorship Aspirant in Ekiti.",

Nigerians he added owe Nigeria a duty of solidarity stating that enough of clannishness and acts capable of running the nation aground noting that all hands must be on deck to grow and develop a nation that will be envy of all nations of the world.\n\nHe stated: \u201cdemocracy can only thrive in the atmosphere of freedom with the fundamental rights of the citizens not only respected but given utmost priority, we have come to the stage where urgent steps are needed to be taking else, it will result to a total breakdown of all machineries of the state.\n\n\u201cSince Independence particularly from the berth of the fourth republic in 1999, nothing has really changed in Ndokwa Nation, and Delta State at large.\n\n\u201cNdokwa nation nay; Nigeria, needs collective efforts of all to function and develop because we have no other place to call our home and we must endeavour to build a virile nation where our children yet unborn can be proud to live in. The youths should eschew acts violence and work hard to build a better future. Looking round Delta State since creation, there is no visible change and even change in character is at its lowest ebb and such adds no value to any nation. Nigeria is our own, and its our duty to make it greater,\u201d the philanthropist stated.",

For others, it is about moving certain items from the exclusive legislation list to concurrent list. For some, it means community/state policing.\n\n\u201cFor few, it means fiscal federalism, which involves resource control.

          "title": "\u2018We can\u2019t imagine life without T.B. Joshua\u2019",
          "text": "As Nigeria and indeed the world come to terms with the shocking passing of renown founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, Prophet TB Joshua, The Nation\u2019s trio of Gboyega Alaka, Olukunle Akinrinade and Innocent Duru take a look at the life and times of the man, renowned for his giving spirit and a larger than life personality.\n\nThe news of his death in the early hours of last Sunday hit home like thunderbolt and reverberated across the globe. For those who knew Prophet T B Joshua, the late founder and overseer of the Synagogue Church of All nations (SCOAN) and had experienced or heard of his exploits as a preacher, seer, healer and philanthropist, it was a piece of information too difficult to digest.\n\nMany indeed lived in denial for hours, the media inclusive. Journalists\u2019 discussions across social media platforms, as the \u2018rumour\u2019 circulated, showed a frantic effort to refute rather than confirm. Then came the hard fact: \u2018It is true. The Commissioner of Police (Lagos State) has confirmed it,\u2019 a correspondent close to the police posted on one of the social media platforms. Doubts and disbelief turned to finality; and then reality.\n\nNaturally, the greatest concern as the finality of the reality dawned was what would become of the church. Or to put it more succinctly, what becomes of the massive religious empire he left behind? The question became particularly pertinent because all the activities of the church revolved around T.B. Joshua\u2019s person. Was there a succession plan? Who is the prophet that is likely to take over from him? Questions, questions\u2026.\n\nFor the numerous businesses that have sprung up around Ikotun-Egbe where the church is domiciled; what are the chances of survival?\n\nThe Balogun of the neighbouring Bolounpelu community, Alhaji Ambali Adewusi, captured it all when he said: \u201cThere is no doubt that his demise will cause a huge downturn in economic activities in the area. Those who benefitted from him economically and fed their families from the activities deriving from his church are massive.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, they are at a crossroads. Virtually everybody has been wondering if there is anybody in the church that can take over from him and carry on like he was doing.\u201d\n\nAdewusi was not done, as he proceeded to share more personal experiences with the late televangelist: \u201cMy brother, it is a massive loss. TB Joshua was not a small person in this community. Everybody loved him \u2013 both young and old.\n\n\u201cWe all loved him. You would hardly hear anyone speak ill of him, because he was good to us and touched lives positively. Even as I speak with you (five days after), his death is still a huge shock to me and I\u2019m pained and saddened.\u201d\n\nHe recalled how, about a decade ago, the community\u2019s transformer packed up and the revered prophet came to their rescue and gifted them with two transformers.\n\n\u201cHe told us told us that every time he stood at the balcony of his church, he noticed that his neighbours were in darkness, and he didn\u2019t quite like it,\u201d Chief Adewsusi recalled.\n\n\u201cWithin days, he gave us two transformers in place of the one that packed up.\n\n\u201cWhat that meant was that each of the two transformers now carried fewer loads, and we have been using them since then without any issue.\u201d\n\nAdewusi also spoke of how Joshua made it a habit to give the community 300 bags of rice and huge sums to share every Yuletide period; a habit he said he replicated in other communities around the Ikotun-Egbe axis.\n\nIronically, he said it was just about a month ago that he came to pay his condolence to the family of the community\u2019s Baale, who passed on recently, gifting them cash and even promising to do more.\n\n\u201cThat promise will no longer be fulfilled, but we are grateful for the much he did. Such was his kind of philanthropy that we can never forget him.\u201d\n\nMore stories of his generosity, philanthropy\n\nChief Adewusi also told stories of how the late Man of God, as he is fondly called by his members, never discriminated against anyone, regularly reaching out to the disabled, widows and other less-privileged.\n\n\u201cHe even embraced the street urchins and freely doled out cash to them. That explains why they all flocked the church to pay their condolences that Sunday morning.\u201d\n\nFlorence Jemegbe, a grocery trader in nearby Ikotun market, told The Nation how the late Prophet reached out to her and other victims of last October\u2019s #EndSARS looting.\n\n\u201cProphet Joshua was extremely humble and generous. I say this because some of us who were victims of looting by the hoodlums who hijacked the #EndSARS protest last year benefitted from his generosity.\n\n\u201cShortly after the #EndSARS protest, he gave lifelines worth several thousands of naira to some of us who were victims of the mass looting to start our business all over. In fact, I was shocked by the amount I saw in the envelope. If not for that money, I may well have gone back to my village in Delta State, because the hoodlums looted my shop clean.\u201d\n\nJoshua, it will be recalled, was also in the habit of reaching out to returnees of human trafficking; hosting as many as came to his church and doling out huge cash gifts to them to help them resettle quickly.\n\nHe also never discriminated on the basis of faith. Clerics of mosques around the Synagogue and as far as his Agbalumo, Arigidi Akoko hometown in Ondo State, where the head of his family was Imam, also reportedly benefitted immensely from his generosity.\n\nA journalist once narrated how Joshua told him the story of how he was walking past a nearby public school, Muslim Secondary School, not far from his church, and he saw pupils literally taking classes under the sun. He said out of curiousity, he branched to ask why, and upon learning that it was due to dilapidated classrooms, he promptly funded the reconstruction of the block. The \u2018Muslim\u2019 tag that the school bore was not an issue to him.\n\nCurrent vice Principal of the school, Mrs Eniola Adetukasi, confirmed the story and even showed one of our reporters the building during a brief visit on Thursday.\n\nThe Nation also learnt that he had wanted to rebuild it into a storey building, but he was restrained on religious grounds. \u201cYou know he was a Christian and the school was a Muslim school,\u201d she reminded.\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest losses of his death would be the university he was said to be building in his hometown and the hundreds of students on his scholarship, whose fate now hang in the balance.\n\nA product of a Muslim home, some of his members recalled that he always preached religious tolerance, reminding them that most people are either Muslims or Christians as a result of their birth rather than by choice.\n\nHis large heart also knew no bounds. Many will recall how he led his church crew on a mission to provide medical attention, food, cash and other relief items to victims of the earthquake in Haiti back in 2010. One of the high points of that mission was his pledge to adopt 500 orphan victims of the disaster.\n\n\u2018An Iroko tree has fallen\u2019\n\nFor his followers, who saw him as a huge spiritual being, the shock may yet take months to settle in. Not in their wildest imagination did many think the physical end to the prophet would come so soon, considering his age, energy as well as the fact that they still saw his ministry as a work in progress.\n\nA typical example of their dilemma would be the scenario that played out last Wednesday when a crew of The Nation visited the famed Synagogue. While the team was busy interviewing some of the faithful, a fierce wind started blowing, followed immediately by a heavy downpour. Instinctively, everyone scampered for refuge. But that was not until one of the female members had run out of the huge church hall to tell them: \u201cThey said this rain is Papa\u2019s rain; it\u2019s rain of blessing, everybody should go inside the rain.\u2019 Within seconds, virtually everyone who had run into the church ran back into the rain and remained there until it subsided.\n\nIt was the same scenario minutes later at his nearby Prayer Mountain on Ajisegiri Street, Agodo-Egbe, where he usually had his retreat and had operated from since the advent of COVID-19. All the security operatives at the highly secured entrance patrolled in the rain.\n\nIn the words of 50-year-old Tajudeen Alao, originally a Muslim, who said he became a member of the Synagogue Church of All Nations after he received healing for his acute knee pain, \u201cA big Iroko tree has just fallen at its prime.\u201d\n\nAlao recalled how he had gone round churches in search of healing and spiritual fulfillment but found none until he visited Synagogue.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cGod used Prophet Joshua to heal me of prolonged acute knee pain on a particular service day. He shook my hand, prayed for me and the pain in my knee immediately vanished,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also spoke of how, on his first visit to the massive church, the prophet received him warmly and even offered him free meal along with other first-timers.\n\n\u201cI was awestruck by his humility,\u201d he said.\n\nAbout his death, Alao said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the news when a colleague at work told me\u2026until I heard it on TVC News and Emmanuel TV. I was devastated completely and wept profusely because I didn\u2019t expect that his death would be so sudden. A big Iroko tree has just fallen in its prime.\u201d\n\nForty-one-year-old Edeki Ebere, a businesswoman, who said she had been with the church since she was 11 in 1991, said \u201cProphet TB Joshua was a man I can never forget in a hurry because he impacted lives. Is it widows we are talking about? Is it orphans or children who don\u2019t know anything? Is it people who are mentally challenged or from broken homes?\u201d\n\nShe disclosed that Joshua\u2019s large heart dated back to his days of little beginning. \u201cI knew him for his giving spirit even when he had nothing and the members of his church, then at its old site, were fewer than 20. At times after returning from school, he would tell me, \u2018You must come and say hello to me before you go home.\u2019 Then he would give me N10 for my transport home.\n\n\u201cAll through my school days, I was here. Today, I am a married woman but I can never forget his impact on my life. While here, I served as a chorister; I served as a disciple and worked at the restaurant for like two years. I equally worked with the protocol and later the visitors\u2019 department.\n\n\u201cAt times he would scold us, but all that was the normal father-daughter relationship. At times he would send me home and later call me back. Today, I can say that all the experiences garnered still live with me.\n\n\u201cThe Man of God never believed anything could not be done. For instance, I don\u2019t think he got a model for this church building from any architect. He only told them what he wanted and they brought it out.\u201d\n\nIn the case of septuagenarian Grace Aina Oluwatimileyin, she has not only lost a spiritual leader but a son. She first encountered the man T. B. Joshua back in 1985 in Ikole-Ekiti when he was virtually unknown. Then, as a woman earnestly in search of the fruit of the womb, she said she had gone to that town, seven miles from her Isu-Ijesha hometown, to meet a native doctor, who told her to fetch water from a stream. There, she almost drowned and would have been swallowed by a huge python.\n\n\u201cSuddenly,\u201d she said, \u201ca lean prophet appeared to me on the other side of the stream, shouted \u2018Halelluiah!\u2019 twice and on the third, which I also chorused with him, stretched his hand over about 20 meters and pulled me up.\u201d\n\nAfter that incident, Oluwatimileyin never saw that prophet again until 1994 when somebody referred her to the Synagogue because of her fibroid. She recounted how Joshua told the whole church to stand up for her that day.\n\n\u201cMy stomach was so big and I was deluding myself that it was pregnancy, whereas it was filled with blood. He told me he didn\u2019t have the power to cure me but that his father would do it. He told me to be patient, and two years after, I was cured of the fibroid. Today, I am free.\u201d\n\nDid she bear a child after? Her answer was no. But she said: \u201cHe already told me he would be my child and take care of all my needs. Since then, he had been taking care of me. My family members forsook me; they said I had gone to worship idol. He even sponsored me on a trip to the United States of America back in Year 2000. Would you believe that?\n\n\u201cOn my return, he made me Sanitation Coordinator in the church. But his officials didn\u2019t like my stance on certain things and eventually eased me out of the system. The good thing however is that the prophet never forsook me. He and his wife continued providing for me.\n\n\u201cEven today (five days after his death), his wife has given me money and food. So I have no doubt that the benevolence will continue.\u201d\n\nAnother member of the church, Alifat Adeleke, 47, told The Nation of how her search for the fruit of the womb was rewarded when she met the \u2018Man in the Synagogue\u2019 in 1993.\n\nShe said: \u201cI was battling barrenness that almost wrecked my marriage. I had been to several churches and spiritualists to no avail, and my husband and I were always fighting. The Man of God prayed to God to remove me from the circle of barrenness and truly, I became pregnant barely a month after and had a child. God has since blessed me with more children.\u201d\n\nNo known succession plan\n\nA major worry for members of the church, Joshua\u2019s admirers and investors around the Synagogue, has been the issue of succession. Is there anyone in the church\u2019s hierarchy who can take over its spiritual administration and maintain the tempo like he did?\n\nAt the moment, everything remains hazy. But Edeki Ebere does not seem to be worried.\n\n\u201cHe is a prophet. We might not know of it now but I believe he had plans. He was always talking about not living here forever and leaving things for the unborn. So I don\u2019t think such a person would not make preparations for his exit.\u201d\n\nOkorie Uguru, a journalist on the Tourism Beat, who is familiar with activities in the church, also expressed doubts about a formidable succession plan.\n\n\u201cIn 2010, Prophet T. B. Joshua brought in about five people, whom he called wise men, namely Harry (a Greek), Apostle Chi (a Cameroonian), Rasine (Cote d\u2019Ivoire) and two Nigerians: Christopher and Daniel.\n\n\u201cThe funny thing, however, is that of the five, only one, Rasine, who is not a Nigerian, is still in the fold, and that leaves a bit of sour taste. While Harry went to found a branch of SCOAN in Greece; I think the others went to found their own churches.\u201d\n\nMulti-billion naira tourism at risk\n\nA direct corollary to the succession discourse is what Uguru has dubbed \u2018multi-billion naira tourism industry in jeopardy\u2019.\n\nIt was United Bank for Africa publicist, Ramon Nasir, who perhaps first made a public assessment of the possible impact of the late pastor on tourism in Nigeria barely 24 hours after.\n\nHe wrote on his Facebook page: \u201cMy admiration became more telling on a Kenya Airways flight from Nairobi to Lagos three years ago, when I realised that half of the passengers in that big plane were on religious visit to Synagogue Church of All Nations\u2026. Pilgrims to his church were virtually from all parts of the globe\u2026.\u201d\n\nNasir went on to narrate how the airline attendant told him that the church remained their biggest market in Nigeria and concluded that \u201cthe country has lost a good ambassador.\u201d\n\nA similar story would be how Air Namibia had to, at some point, suspend its schedule to Nigeria the moment the Nigerian embassy in that country (due to some diplomatic row) stopped issuing visa to visitors headed for the West African country.\n\nUguru recalled: \u201cI was in the team that met with the Prime Minister of the Southern African country, Mrs. Saara Kuugongelwa, during an effort to revive its tourist sector. We found out that 95 percent of the travellers to Nigeria were headed the Synagogue; and once the embassy stopped issuing visa, the airline had no choice but to suspend its operations to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAssessing the impact on hotel businesses, Okorie said 80 percent of non-business tourists who come into Nigeria were headed for Synagogue Church of All Nations. As at 2016 when he did a rough assessment of hotel facilities around the church, he said there were about 3,500 bed spaces. And that is excluding informal lodging business that is known to thrive in the environs.\n\n\u201cBetween 2016 and now, we have had nothing less than 1,500 additional bed spaces. The question therefore is how are these businesses going to survive if there is a sudden stop to the activities that attracted them in the first place?\n\nSolomon Andrew, Assistant General Manager, D One Lodge Hotels on Adamo Street opposite the church, reflected the mood of hospitality business owners in the axis, when he said, \u201cThe whole place has been quiet since his death was announced. In fact, it\u2019s as if his death occurred right here, because it is affecting our business both in the area of lodging and patronage to our restaurant.\n\n\u201cI tell you, we have not overcome the shock. Up till now, we are still looking forward to someone coming from nowhere to tell us that the story is not true. We know how his person impacted our business. Since he started skeletal activities at the prayer mountain, we had started seeing a steady inflow of tourists coming into this place; but now that he has passed on\u2026.\u201d Andrew left the statement hanging.\n\nAsked if he was aware of any succession plan, Andrew said, \u201cWith the kind of person he was, he must have had something in the pipeline for the future of the church. TB Joshua is not a selfish person that would want whatever he was doing to end with his death. He always made it clear that whatever success you have, if you don\u2019t have a successor, it is failure in disguise. So I want to believe he made arrangements for his succession.\u201d",

          "title": "Full text of President Muhammadu Buhari's Democracy day 2021 address \u2013 The Sun Nigeria",
          "text": "Fellow Nigerians,\n\nI join you all today to commemorate and celebrate our Democracy Day. It is a celebration of freedom and a victory for one people, one country and one Nigeria.\n\n2. As with all democracies we will always be going through improvement processes in our desire to reach the goal of a mature democracy, a strong, evolved and integrated nation state to be reckoned with globally.\n\n3. In the last two years we have witnessed and overcome a good number of testy challenges that would have destroyed other nations especially relating to our collective security.\n\n4. The indefatigable CAN DO Spirit of the Nigerian has sustained us and would keep pushing us to put these challenges behind us.\n\n5. Unfortunately some of these challenges came in the shape of violent outrages leading to the loss of lives of many of our dear compatriots and the destruction of some of our infrastructure, including those devoted to improving our democratic processes.\n\n6. Once again, I want to render my sincere and heart-felt condolences to the families and friends of our gallant service men and women who lost their lives in the line of duty and as a sacrifice to keep Nigeria safe.\n\n7. I extend the same condolence to the families and friends of our country men, women and children who were unfortunate victims of such senseless arsons, kidnappings and murders.\n\n8. I also share the pains of families and direct victims of ransom-seeking, kidnaped victims who went through unimaginable trauma in the course of their forced imprisonment.\n\n9. Let me assure my fellow citizens that every incident, however minor gives me great worry and concern and I immediately order security agencies to swiftly but safely rescue victims and bring perpetrators to justice.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n10. When you elected me as your President in 2015, you did so knowing that I will put an end to the growing insecurity, especially the insurgency in the North East, but the unintended consequences of our scattering them in the North East pushed them further in-country which is what we are now facing and dealing with.\n\n11. We will, by the Grace of God put an end to these challenges too.\n\n12. Unfortunately, like in most conflict situations, some Nigerian criminals are taking undue advantage of a difficult situation and profiteering therefrom with the misguided belief that adherence to the democratic norms handicaps this Administration from frontally and decisively tackling them.\n\n13. We are already addressing these obstacles and we will soon bring some of these culprits to justice.\n\n14. We are, at the same time addressing the twin underlying drivers of insecurity namely poverty and youth unemployment.\n\n15. Interventions led by Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria driving economic growth over the past 6 years are targeted mostly to the agricultural, services, infrastructure, power and health care sectors of the economy.\n\n16. In the Agricultural sector, for instance, the Anchor Borrowers Programme resulted in sharp decline in the nation\u2019s major food import bill from $2.23billion in 2014 to US$0.59billion by the end of 2018.\n\n17. Rice import bill alone dropped from $1 billion to $18.5 million annually.\n\n18. This initiative supported local production of rice, maize, cotton and cassava. Government financed 2.5 million small-holder farmers cultivating about 3.2 million hectares of farmland all over the country and created 10 million direct and indirect jobs.\n\n19. Several other initiatives, namely AgriBusiness/Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme, the Non-oil Export stimulation Facility, the Targeted Credit Facilities operated across the 774 Local Governments.\n\n20. In the manufacturing sector the CBN \u2013 BOI N200 billion facility financed the establishment and operations of 60 new industrial hubs across the country, creating an estimated 890,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\n21. The CBN\u2019s N50 billion Textile Sector intervention Facility increased capacity utilization of ginneries from 30% to nearly 90%.\n\n22. The Economic Sustainability Plan \u2013 our rebound plan for the COVID-19 pandemic developed in 2020 is currently being executed. The plan is primarily focused on the non-oil sector, which has recorded phenomenal growth contributing over 90% to the GDP growth in Q1 2021.\n\n23. Though marginal we have recorded GDP growth over two quarters; Q2 2020 and Q1 2021. This is evidence of a successful execution of the ESP by the Federal Government.\n\n24. My vision of pulling 100 million poor Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years has been put into action and can be seen in the National Social Investment Programme, a first in Africa and one of the largest in the world where over 32.6m beneficiaries are taking part. We now have a National Social register of poor and vulnerable households, identified across 708 local government areas, 8,723 wards and 86,610 communities in the 36 States and the FCT.\n\n25. Our conditional cash transfer program has benefited over 1.6 million poor and vulnerable households comprising more than 8 million individuals. This provides a monthly stipend of N10,000 per household.\n\n26. I have also recently approved the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy Plan that augments existing plans to further reduce poverty in Nigeria.\n\n27. As at the end of 2020, the Development Bank of Nigeria had disbursed 324 billion Naira in loans to more than 136,000 MSMEs, through 40 participating Financial Institutions. I am to note that 57% of these beneficiaries are women while 27% are the youth.\n\n28. We are able to do all these and still accelerate our infrastructure development through sensible and transparent borrowing, improved capital inflow, improving and increasing revenue through capturing more tax bases and prudent management of investment proceeds in the Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n29. Our infrastructure revolution continues with key projects attaining critical milestones under the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund; The Second Niger Bridge, The Lagos- Ibadan Expressway and the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway.\n\n30. I have also approved the establishment of Infraco Plc, a world-class infrastructure development vehicle wholly focused on Nigeria with a capital structure of N15 trillion.\n\n31. The rail system is not left out as the Itakpe-Warri standard gauge rail was completed and commissioned 33 years after construction began. The Lagos-Ibadan double track railway line which I have just commissioned has commenced operations.\n\n32. We are focused on ensuring that our infrastructure drive is key to economic growth and one that can be felt by every Nigerian. Building critical infrastructure in our ports is also opening up opportunities for the Nigerian economy.\n\n33. My approval for 4 new seaports using a Public-Private-Partnership approach is hinged on growing the Nigerian economy. These four sea ports; Lekki Deep Sea Port, Bonny Deep Sea Port, Ibom Deep Sea Port and Warri Deep Sea port will create massive job opportunities and foreign investment inflows.\n\n34. We have worked at deepening our Eastern ports leading to success like having three container ships berth at Calabar port, a first in 11 years. Similarly, on October 30 2019, an LPG tanker operated by NLNG berthed in Port Harcourt, the first time an LPG ship is berthing at any of the Eastern Ports.\n\n35. As we invest in these new assets, we have also made strides in ensuring that they are secured and protected. In this regard I am also pleased to note the launch of the NIMASA Deep Blue project \u2013 which is an Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure that I recently commissioned. This initiative is designed to add to the layer of security we have to safeguard our maritime sector.\n\nDear Nigerians,\n\n36. I will be the first to admit that in spite of our efforts and achievements which are there for all to see, there is still much more to be done and we are doing our best in the face of scarce resources and galloping population growth rate that consistently outstrips our capacity to provide jobs for our populace. Our over-all economic target of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is our goal notwithstanding COVID-19.\n\n37. In the last two years we lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty \u2013 farmers, small-scale traders, artisans, market women and the like.\n\n38. I am very convinced that this 100 million target can be met and this informed the development of a National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy. The specific details of this accelerated strategy will be unveiled shortly.\n\n39. In the last one year, Nigeria and the whole world faced COVID-19 for which no one was fully prepared.\n\n40. Our response to the pandemic involved making hard choices in balancing livelihoods and public health concerns. You are all living witnesses to how successful this has been due to a number of pro-active measures put in place. Our response to COVID-19 is globally acclaimed.\n\n41. We were able to ensure that the various lockdown measures did not impact too negatively on the ability of ordinary Nigerians to continue sustaining their livelihoods.\n\n42. During the pandemic, we disbursed N5,000 to 1 million Nigerians using a Rapid Response Register and advanced N20,000 to 750,000 beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer Progamme and provided 1.37 million Nigerians with palliatives from CACOVID.\n\n43. At the same time the Federal Government released 109,000 metric tonnes of food reserve stocks and 70,000 metric tonnes of grains to the poor and vulnerable in all 36 states of the federation.\n\n44. In addition, Government reduced interest rates from 9% to 5% for struggling businesses and extended credit facilities to 548,345 beneficiaries.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n45. When this administration decided to change our Democracy Day from 29th May to June 12th in my first tenure, it was not only to honour the sacrifices of the men and women of our country who fought for the return to democracy but also to demonstrate our commitment to satisfy the aspirations of the people and creating an environment for democracy to be an accepted way of life.\n\n46. As your President, I remain committed to providing an enabling environment for a free, fair and credible electoral system under my tenure.\n\n47. However, you need to play your part by getting involved at any level you can supporting a democratic system that works for all and not for a section or a select few and demand accountability from your elected leaders.\n\n48. My commitment to bequeathing a sustainable democratic culture remains resolute, my pursuit of a fair society remains unshaken and my desire to see that Nigeria remains a country for each and every one of us has never been stronger.\n\n49. In responding to the challenges that this period imposes on us, Government also recognises the need to acknowledge notions of marginalisation and agitations for constitutional amendments among various segments of our population.\n\n50. While this government is not averse to constitutional reform as part of our nation building process, everyone must understand that the primary responsibility for constitutional amendments lies with the National Assembly.\n\n51. This body which, as I said, is the arm of government responsible for constitutional changes has concluded the preliminary stages of amending and improving our constitution in a way that the majority of Nigerians will be happy with.\n\n52. Government is, however, willing to play a critical role in the constitutional amendment process without usurping the powers of the National Assembly in this regard.\n\n53. As a nation we have come very far from where we started and we are getting incrementally closer to where we ought to be.\n\n54. Overcoming the present challenges is but one of a necessary process that we have to undergo as a nation so that we can come out stronger. The day I joined the Nigerian Army I was prepared to lay down my life for Nigeria.\n\n55. As your President I remain ever committed to upholding and defending Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n56. In adhering to the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy notably section 14(2)(b) I shall do all within my power to ensure that the Security and welfare of the people remain the primary purpose of government.\n\n57. I have, throughout my tenure, provided the security agencies with all they require relative to available resources and will be providing more as the dynamics unfold to put an end to our security problems.\n\n58. My strong belief in the Nigerian spirit gives me comfort that we are facing these challenges with renewed commitment to keep our country one.\n\n59. I thank you for your patience and attention and more importantly your resolve to join hands in making Nigeria the country of our dream.\n\nHappy Democracy Day! God Bless us All, God Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

Commending the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government for its concerted efforts in repositioning the country, Kalu stressed that the President has built critical infrastructure across the nation.\n\nHe cautioned politicians against actions that are capable of polarising the country, noting that Nigeria is better off as a united and indivisible entity.\n\nKalu, who frowned at the recurring destruction of private and public property in some parts of the country, sued for peace and calm across the country, adding that democratic virtues are anchored on rule of law.\n\nThe Senate Chief Whip urged Nigerians to be wary of selfish and power hungry politicians, who are inciting the people against the Federal Government, noting that the President has continued to demonstrate his patriotic determination to build a prosperous nation.\n\nKalu, while acknowledging the achievements of the founding fathers of Nigeria in sustaining a united country, stressed that the country\u2019s nascent democracy is fast growing under the current federal government.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan and Lukman Olabiyi, Lagos\n\nThe Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE), Soludero Hunters Association, and the apex Yoruba self-determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO) have blasted President Muhammadu Buhari for keeping silent on the Igangan massacre during his visit to Lagos State on Thursday.\n\nGunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen had last Saturday night stormed Igangan, a community in Ibarapa zone of Oyo State and massacred more than 10 persons in cold blood, though there was a resistance from the villagers.\n\nIn separate exclusive interviews with Saturday Sun, they also faulted President Muhammadu Buhari on his stance on the ban placed by Southern Governors\u2019 Forum on open grazing in all the states in the Southern region of Nigeria.\n\nPresident Buhari was in Lagos to commission some projects on Thursday, during which he vowed to restore grazing routes from the Northern to the Southern part of the country.\n\nSecretary-General of YCE, Dr. Kunle Olajide, told Saturday Sun: \u201cThe two projects that President Buhari came for in Lagos on Thursday were worth it. They are desirable. But it appears he\u2019s grossly insensitive to the problems of this country. Coming to Lagos, he should have made comments on the Igangan massacre. He should have at least emphathise with the South West.\n\n\u201cThen, he spoke about grazing routes from the North to the South. In this 21st Century, grazing route is archaic. The time Mr. President spoke about, the population of Nigeria was about 50 million. Now, the population of Nigeria is about 211million. So, the population has grown and urbanisation is another reality that we must face.\u201d\n\nThe National President, Soludero Hunters Association, Oba Nureni Ajijolaanabi, also said: \u201cThe Soludero Hunters are taking care of Igangan and its environs. By God\u2019s grace, such massacre would not happen again. The gunmen that stormed Igangan last Saturday night and killed many people are human beings like us. President Buhari should have made comments on the Igangan massacre, especially when he was in Lagos on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAgain, if he could not personally visit Igangan, he should have sent a delegation to visit Igangan on his behalf. But he has not done that. I don\u2019t think that is good enough.\n\n\u201cOn the grazing routes from the North to the South, we would not accept it. But it should be known that we are not fighting Fulani herdsmen. But we are fighting those among them carrying AK-47.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Ilana Omo Oodua, under the leadership of the Emeritus Professor Banji Akintoye, said the fact that President Buhari did not make any comment on the Igangan massacre has confirmed the allegation that he is president for the North and not the entire country.\n\nThe IOO that spoke through its Communication Manager, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, noted: \u201cWe at Ilana Omo Oodua want to say expressly that the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Federal Republic of Nigeria, a sovereign nation, has been accused of being the president of the North and not Nigeria, by individuals and groups.\n\n\u201cWhen Fulani men threatened war, what did the presidency say? Mr. President even abused our governors in the South West. He said two governors from South West came to meet him over atrocities of Fulani herdsmen and the need for state police. Mr. President said he told them that they were elected to protect their people and they should go and do their jobs, whereas they are mere ceremonial chief security officers. This is an affirmation that President Buhari is president of the North.\n\n\u201cAlso, Mr. President wants to use the gazette on the grazing route to override the governors, especially in Yorubaland. But the fact still remains that the Land Use Act vests the power on land in the governors, and not the president.\n\n\u201cNow, we implore our governors to ensure enactment of a law that would ban open grazing. We know that Ekiti and Oyo State have enacted the laws. The other governors should emulate them. The law must also establish an anti-open grazing marshal. The grazing route should be quashed through laws that would be made by Houses of Assembly and the passed bills should be expressly signed into law by the governors.\u201d\n\nAgbekoya Farmers Society has blasted President Muhammadu Buhari for not reacting to the recent killings and arson unleashed by suspected bandits on Igangan community in Oyo State.\n\nA rights activist and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Kunle Adegoke also knocked the president for keeping mute on he matter.\n\nAdegoke, in a separate interview, said: \u201cIt was expected that the President would commiserate with the victims of violence in different parts of Nigeria, Igangan inclusive. I suspect it is an oversight that the President, while in the South Western part of the country, failed to refer to and commiserate with the victims of the unnecessary violence that is swallowing up the whole of Oke-Ogun.",

          "text": "\u2022 Atiku, Tinubu, Saraki chart way forward for Nigeria\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja, Festus Akanbi in Lagos\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, in a national broadcast this morning to mark Democracy Day, vowed to ensure that the \u201cenemies of state sponsoring crises across the nation\u201d are punished, adding that the trial of those arrested so far would start in earnest.\n\nAlso on the occasion of Democracy Day, prominent Nigerians, including former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar; National Leader, All Peoples Congress (APC) Bola Ahmed Tinubu; former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday called for genuine collaboration among the citizens of Nigeria in the collective struggle to reinforce democratic governance in the country.\n\nThe President in the Democracy Day broadcast reviewed his administration\u2019s six years in office and concluded that much still needed to be done by him for Nigerians \u201cdespite the score of achievements recorded so far.\u201d\n\nBuhari said: \u201cI will be the first to admit that in spite of our efforts and achievements which are there for all to see, there is still much more to be done and we are doing our best in the face of scarce resources and galloping population growth rate that consistently outstrips our capacity to provide jobs for our populace.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that security challenges facing the nation are being tackled frontally but added that \u201csome criminally minded people\u201d are thwarting his government\u2019s efforts.\n\nThe President said: \u201cWhen you elected me as your President in 2015, you did so knowing that I will put an end to the growing insecurity, especially the insurgency in the North East, but the unintended consequences of our scattering them in the North East pushed them further in-country which is what we are now facing and dealing with. We will, by the Grace of God put an end to these challenges too.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, like in most conflict situations, some Nigerian criminals are taking undue advantage of a difficult situation and profiteering therefrom with the misguided belief that adherence to the democratic norms handicaps this Administration from frontally and decisively tackling them. We are already addressing these obstacles and we will soon bring some of these culprits to justice\u201d.\n\nHe expressed his commitment towards providing an enabling environment for a free, fair and credible electoral system while his tenure lasts.\n\nThe President however advised Nigerians to play their part by getting involved at any level by \u201csupporting a democratic system that works for all and not for a section or a select few and demand accountability from your elected leaders\u201d.\n\nThe President adds: \u201cMy commitment towards bequeathing a sustainable democratic culture remains resolute, my pursuit of a fair society remains unshaken and my desire to see that Nigeria remains a country for each and every one of us has never been stronger.\u201d\n\nHe also said his government was not against the campaign by some people for constitutional amendments to address the issue of marginalisation but stressed that the legislative arm has the constitutional power to address such matters.\n\nThe President said: \u201cIn responding to the challenges that this period imposes on us, government also recognises the need to acknowledge notions of marginalisation and agitations for constitutional amendments among various segments of our population.\n\n\u201cWhile this government is not averse to constitutional reform as part of our nation building process, everyone must understand that the primary responsibility for constitutional amendments lies with the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThis body which, as I said, is the arm of government responsible for constitutional changes has concluded the preliminary stages of amending and improving our constitution in a way that the majority of Nigerians will be happy with. Government is however willing to play a critical role in the constitutional amendment process without usurping the powers of the National Assembly in this regard\u201d.\n\nOn his administration\u2019s achievements, the President said they include: \u201cInterventions led by Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria driving economic growth over the past six years, targeted mostly to the agricultural, services, infrastructure, power and health care sectors of the economy.\n\n\u201cIn the manufacturing sector the CBN \u2013 BOI N200 billion facility financed the establishment and operations of 60 new industrial hubs across the country, creating an estimated 890,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\n\u201cThe CBN\u2019s N50 billion Textile Sector intervention Facility increased capacity utilization of ginneries from 30% to nearly 90%.\n\n\u201cThe Economic Sustainability Plan \u2013 our rebound plan for the COVID-19 pandemic developed in 2020 is currently being executed. The plan is primarily focused on the non-oil sector, which has recorded phenomenal growth contributing over 90% to the GDP growth in Q1 2021. Though marginal we have recorded GDP growth over two quarters; Q2 2020 and Q1 2021. This is evidence of a successful execution of the ESP by the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cMy vision of pulling 100 million poor Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years has been put into action and can be seen in the National Social Investment Programme, a first in Africa and one of the largest in the world where over 32.6m beneficiaries are taking part. We now have a National Social register of poor and vulnerable households, identified across 708 local government areas, 8,723 wards and 86,610 communities in the 36 States and the FCT\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "For the Record: Buhari\u2019s Democracy Day Speech",
          "text": "Fellow Nigerians,\n\nI join you all today to commemorate and celebrate our Democracy Day. It is a celebration of freedom and a victory for one people, one country and one Nigeria.\n\n2. As with all democracies we will always be going through improvement processes in our desire to reach the goal of a mature democracy, a strong, evolved and integrated nation state to be reckoned with globally.\n\n3. In the last two years we have witnessed and overcome a good number of testy challenges that would have destroyed other nations especially relating to our collective security.\n\n4. The indefatigable CAN DO Spirit of the Nigerian has sustained us and would keep pushing us to put these challenges behind us.\n\n5. Unfortunately some of these challenges came in the shape of violent outrages leading to the loss of lives of many of our dear compatriots and the destruction of some of our infrastructure, including those devoted to improving our democratic processes.\n\n6. Once again, I want to render my sincere and heart-felt condolences to the families and friends of our gallant service men and women who lost their lives in the line of duty and as a sacrifice to keep Nigeria safe.\n\n7. I extend the same condolence to the families and friends of our country men, women and children who were unfortunate victims of such senseless arsons, kidnappings and murders.\n\n8. I also share the pains of families and direct victims of ransom-seeking, kidnaped victims who went through unimaginable trauma in the course of their forced imprisonment.\n\n9. Let me assure my fellow citizens that every incident, however minor gives me great worry and concern and I immediately order security agencies to swiftly but safely rescue victims and bring perpetrators to justice.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n10. When you elected me as your President in 2015, you did so knowing that I will put an end to the growing insecurity, especially the insurgency in the North East, but the unintended consequences of our scattering them in the North East pushed them further in-country which is what we are now facing and dealing with.\n\n11. We will, by the Grace of God put an end to these challenges too.\n\n12. Unfortunately, like in most conflict situations, some Nigerian criminals are taking undue advantage of a difficult situation and profiteering therefrom with the misguided belief that adherence to the democratic norms handicaps this Administration from frontally and decisively tackling them.\n\n13. We are already addressing these obstacles and we will soon bring some of these culprits to justice.\n\n14. We are, at the same time addressing the twin underlying drivers of insecurity namely poverty and youth unemployment.\n\n15. Interventions led by Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria driving economic growth over the past 6 years are targeted mostly to the agricultural, services, infrastructure, power and health care sectors of the economy.\n\n16. In the Agricultural sector, for instance, the Anchor Borrowers Programme resulted in sharp decline in the nation\u2019s major food import bill from $2.23billion in 2014 to US$0.59billion by the end of 2018.\n\n17. Rice import bill alone dropped from $1 billion to $18.5 million annually.\n\n18. This initiative supported local production of rice, maize, cotton and cassava. Government financed 2.5 million small-holder farmers cultivating about 3.2 million hectares of farmland all over the country and created 10 million direct and indirect jobs.\n\n19. Several other initiatives, namely AgriBusiness/Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme, the Non-oil Export stimulation Facility, the Targeted Credit Facilities operated across the 774 Local Governments.\n\n20. In the manufacturing sector the CBN \u2013 BOI N200 billion facility financed the establishment and operations of 60 new industrial hubs across the country, creating an estimated 890,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\n21. The CBN\u2019s N50 billion Textile Sector intervention Facility increased capacity utilization of ginneries from 30% to nearly 90%.\n\n22. The Economic Sustainability Plan \u2013 our rebound plan for the COVID-19 pandemic developed in 2020 is currently being executed. The plan is primarily focused on the non-oil sector, which has recorded phenomenal growth contributing over 90% to the GDP growth in Q1 2021.\n\n23. Though marginal we have recorded GDP growth over two quarters; Q2 2020 and Q1 2021. This is evidence of a successful execution of the ESP by the Federal Government.\n\n24. My vision of pulling 100 million poor Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years has been put into action and can be seen in the National Social Investment Programme, a first in Africa and one of the largest in the world where over 32.6m beneficiaries are taking part. We now have a National Social register of poor and vulnerable households, identified across 708 local government areas, 8,723 wards and 86,610 communities in the 36 States and the FCT.\n\n25. Our conditional cash transfer program has benefited over 1.6 million poor and vulnerable households comprising more than 8 million individuals. This provides a monthly stipend of N10,000 per household.\n\n26. I have also recently approved the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy Plan that augments existing plans to further reduce poverty in Nigeria.\n\n27. As at the end of 2020, the Development Bank of Nigeria had disbursed 324 billion Naira in loans to more than 136,000 MSMEs, through 40 participating Financial Institutions. I am to note that 57% of these beneficiaries are women while 27% are the youth.\n\n28. We are able to do all these and still accelerate our infrastructure development through sensible and transparent borrowing, improved capital inflow, improving and increasing revenue through capturing more tax bases and prudent management of investment proceeds in the Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n29. Our infrastructure revolution continues with key projects attaining critical milestones under the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund; The Second Niger Bridge, The Lagos- Ibadan Expressway and the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway.\n\n30. I have also approved the establishment of Infraco Plc, a world-class infrastructure development vehicle wholly focused on Nigeria with a capital structure of N15 trillion.\n\n31. The rail system is not left out as the Itakpe-Warri standard gauge rail was completed and commissioned 33 years after construction began. The Lagos-Ibadan double track railway line which I have just commissioned has commenced operations.\n\n32. We are focused on ensuring that our infrastructure drive is key to economic growth and one that can be felt by every Nigerian. Building critical infrastructure in our ports is also opening up opportunities for the Nigerian economy.\n\n33. My approval for 4 new seaports using a Public-Private-Partnership approach is hinged on growing the Nigerian economy. These four sea ports; Lekki Deep Sea Port, Bonny Deep Sea Port, Ibom Deep Sea Port and Warri Deep Sea port will create massive job opportunities and foreign investment inflows.\n\n34. We have worked at deepening our Eastern ports leading to success like having three container ships berth at Calabar port, a first in 11 years. Similarly, on October 30 2019, an LPG tanker operated by NLNG berthed in Port Harcourt, the first time an LPG ship is berthing at any of the Eastern Ports.\n\n35. As we invest in these new assets, we have also made strides in ensuring that they are secured and protected. In this regard I am also pleased to note the launch of the NIMASA Deep Blue project \u2013 which is an Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure that I recently commissioned. This initiative is designed to add to the layer of security we have to safeguard our maritime sector.\n\nDear Nigerians,\n\n36. I will be the first to admit that in spite of our efforts and achievements which are there for all to see, there is still much more to be done and we are doing our best in the face of scarce resources and galloping population growth rate that consistently outstrips our capacity to provide jobs for our populace. Our over-all economic target of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is our goal notwithstanding COVID-19.\n\n37. In the last two years we lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty \u2013 farmers, small-scale traders, artisans, market women and the like.\n\n38. I am very convinced that this 100 million target can be met and this informed the development of a National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy. The specific details of this accelerated strategy will be unveiled shortly.\n\n39. In the last one year, Nigeria and the whole world faced COVID-19 for which no one was fully prepared.\n\n40. Our response to the pandemic involved making hard choices in balancing livelihoods and public health concerns. You are all living witnesses to how successful this has been due to a number of pro-active measures put in place. Our response to COVID-19 is globally acclaimed.\n\n41. We were able to ensure that the various lockdown measures did not impact too negatively on the ability of ordinary Nigerians to continue sustaining their livelihoods.\n\n42. During the pandemic, we disbursed N5,000 to 1 million Nigerians using a Rapid Response Register and advanced N20,000 to 750,000 beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer Progamme and provided 1.37 million Nigerians with palliatives from CACOVID.\n\n43. At the same time the Federal Government released 109,000 metric tonnes of food reserve stocks and 70,000 metric tonnes of grains to the poor and vulnerable in all 36 states of the federation.\n\n44. In addition, Government reduced interest rates from 9% to 5% for struggling businesses and extended credit facilities to 548,345 beneficiaries.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n45. When this administration decided to change our Democracy Day from 29th May to June 12th in my first tenure, it was not only to honour the sacrifices of the men and women of our country who fought for the return to democracy but also to demonstrate our commitment to satisfy the aspirations of the people and creating an environment for democracy to be an accepted way of life.\n\n46. As your President, I remain committed to providing an enabling environment for a free, fair and credible electoral system under my tenure.\n\n47. However, you need to play your part by getting involved at any level you can supporting a democratic system that works for all and not for a section or a select few and demand accountability from your elected leaders.\n\n48. My commitment to bequeathing a sustainable democratic culture remains resolute, my pursuit of a fair society remains unshaken and my desire to see that Nigeria remains a country for each and every one of us has never been stronger.\n\n49. In responding to the challenges that this period imposes on us, Government also recognises the need to acknowledge notions of marginalisation and agitations for constitutional amendments among various segments of our population.\n\n50. While this government is not averse to constitutional reform as part of our nation building process, everyone must understand that the primary responsibility for constitutional amendments lies with the National Assembly.\n\n51. This body which, as I said, is the arm of government responsible for constitutional changes has concluded the preliminary stages of amending and improving our constitution in a way that the majority of Nigerians will be happy with.\n\n52. Government is, however, willing to play a critical role in the constitutional amendment process without usurping the powers of the National Assembly in this regard.\n\n53. As a nation we have come very far from where we started and we are getting incrementally closer to where we ought to be.\n\n54. Overcoming the present challenges is but one of a necessary process that we have to undergo as a nation so that we can come out stronger. The day I joined the Nigerian Army I was prepared to lay down my life for Nigeria.\n\n55. As your President I remain ever committed to upholding and defending Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n56. In adhering to the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy notably section 14(2)(b) I shall do all within my power to ensure that the Security and welfare of the people remain the primary purpose of government.\n\n57. I have, throughout my tenure, provided the security agencies with all they require relative to available resources and will be providing more as the dynamics unfold to put an end to our security problems.\n\n58. My strong belief in the Nigerian spirit gives me comfort that we are facing these challenges with renewed commitment to keep our country one.\n\n59. I thank you for your patience and attention and more importantly your resolve to join hands in making Nigeria the country of our dream.\n\nHappy Democracy Day!

          "text": "Operatives of the police and the Nigerian Army, in carrying out mass raids and arrests of South-East residents, have shot dead some of the suspects, allegedly labelled as gunmen terrorising the region.\n\nSaharaReporters obtained the photographs of two of the victims living in Umuahia, Abia State, whom residents confirmed to be part of them and not unknown gunmen as the police and the army labelled them.\n\nThe first victim was identified as Obinna Ejekwu, 30 years old, and Onyebuchi Amadi, 27 years old.\n\nThe security operatives killed both men on May 29, and after that, labelled them as Eastern Security Network members.\n\n\u201cRather than using intelligence-based crime detection and investigation to go after criminal elements, the Nigerian security forces are going about letting loose on unarmed and defenceless Igbo citizens, hatefully targeting and killing them and labelling them as terrorists,\u201d the source, who released the photographs to SaharaReporters, lamented.\n\nA civil society organisation, the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, said it called on the international community not to fold their arms on the \u201csilent massacre\u201d going on in the South-East region but must prevail on the Nigerian government to respect the rule of law and sanctity of life.\n\n\u201cWe are drawing the urgent and \u2018red signals\u2019 attention of the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Scotland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Brazil and the European Union; the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the UN Security Council, and the International Criminal Court.\n\n\u201cThis urgent international clarion call is a sequel to ongoing genocidal attacks on defenceless civilians in Eastern Nigeria, done in total disregard to the country\u2019s international obligations and laid down rules including respect for human rights and sanctity of human life as well as rules governing internal policing operations and armed conflict,\u201d the organisation said on Friday.\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported on Friday that the Nigerian Army in joint operations with the police between April and May had raided and arrested scores of South-East youths, clamping them in underground cells and detention rooms in military barracks.\n\nSome of the fingered military camps were the 34 Artillery Brigade, Obinze, Imo State, 82 Division Headquarters, Enugu State, and up north as far as Suleja, Niger State.\n\n\u201cThe army and police have a certain NHSS Tactical Squad \u2013 whatever that means \u2013 which has been arresting the South-East residents, mainly youths, and locking them up in these discreet military underground camps.\n\n\u201cThey are labelled as members of the Indigenous People of Biafra members and Eastern Security Network members and denied access to family members and lawyers. I know at least three military detention underground cells, and the squad, at will, kills some of the detainees, arrange rifles for them and say they died during the gun battle,\u201d one of the sources had revealed to SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cIt was the same NHSS tactical squad which invaded the residence of IPOB lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor last Sunday, and shot dead one of his aides, while three personal workers were taken away. They burnt the car and corpse, leaving no trace. If he was not a popular lawyer, who would report that incident? That is the pattern they adopt in the South-East \u2013 abduct, kill and burn corpses,\u201d another source had revealed.",

          "text": "Seven months after taking up an initial 20% stake in BetKing, South African pay TV operator MultiChoice plans to increase its shareholding in the online gambling company to 49% in a $281.5 million deal.\n\nBetKing is the trading name of Blue Lake Ventures Limited, a pan-African sports betting and entertainment business with major operations in Nigeria. The value of MultiChoice\u2019s initial investment in BetKing was said to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nThe decision to double down on the gambling company, approved by the MultiChoice board on Thursday, is in line with the company\u2019s strategy to expand its entertainment ecosystem and develop meaningful drivers of future value, a statement from the South African entertainment giant reads.\n\n\u201cConsumers have a growing abundance of entertainment options available to them. It is therefore important for MultiChoice to maintain its relevance and grow its share of engagement time and consumer spend by expanding its entertainment platform with a more comprehensive offering and a greater number of products and services,\u201d the company said, explaining the rationale behind its increased investment in BetKing.\n\nAccording to MultiChoice, pursuing an adjacency such as sports betting creates a \u201cnatural extension\u201d to its video entertainment platform to further enhance its product offerings. In other words, sport betting augments the company\u2019s business given sports is a major revenue source.\n\nWidely known as one of the leading sports betting sites in Nigeria, BetKing was founded by CEO Byron Petzer and Adekunle Adeniji, who once served as Bet9ja\u2019s virtual product manager.\n\nBetKing\u2019s annual statement for the financial year ended December 2020 shows a growth in revenue to $77.9 million, from $54.7 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, net asset value stood at $100.2 million.\n\nIt is thus not hard to see the appeal in investing in the major sports betting company also considering that the market is growing significantly globally. Between 2020 and 2024, the industry is expected to grow by more than $134 billion, a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10%, according to Technavio.\n\nSeveral sports betting companies currently operate in this part of the world too. In Nigeria, some popular names apart from BetKing include Bet9ja, Nairabet, Naijabet, Sporting Bet, Surebet24, etc.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that an estimated 60 million Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 40 were involved in active sports betting. Also, almost \u20a62 billion was spent on sports betting daily in Nigeria, equivalent to nearly \u20a6730 billion in a year. Yet, Africa accounts for only 2% of global sports betting revenue. As the regional market begins to play catch up, it is poised for significant growth.",

          "text": "With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the world\u2019s central banks have \u2013 in the past two years at least \u2013 been working towards developing government-backed digital currencies.\n\nNigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d exploring the technology for digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee. \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to its populace.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities targeted at regulating the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms.\n\nDespite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool and in a change of tone, the CBN governor later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.\n\nWhy would the CBN get into virtual currencies?\n\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\n\nChina in April 2020 became the first major economy to pilot a digital currency and is working towards achieving a wide, domestic use of the digital yuan by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency. Other countries where national digital currency trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden and South Korea and in Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nBeyond just following the global trend, there are lots of potential reasons for the planned rollout of an official digital currency in Nigeria later this year.\n\nThe CBN director particularly cited the need to make remittances travel easier from abroad to Nigeria as one motivation. \u201cWe all know how money has to travel for someone to send money from Nigeria to abroad and it is a huge money in Africa,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.\n\nDigital currency could also boost financial inclusion as those unbanked can get easier and safer access to money through their phone. A recent report by the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFiNA) shows that Nigeria did not meet its financial inclusion targets for 2020 and at the current rate, they might not be achieved anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the recent report by EFiNA was that our target was to achieve 80% financial inclusion. We are about 60% and at the rate at which we are going, we are not going to meet this target,\u201d Mohammed said, adding that the Central Bank digital currency could \u201caccelerate\u201d the CBN\u2019s ability to meet this target.\n\nAfter the announcement, the apex bank will now explore technological options and engage various industry players, as well as move to the next stage of proof of concept to pilot the scheme, according to the CBN director.",
          "summary": "Nigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form.\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency.\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.",

          "title": "What is a VPN and how does it work in Nigeria?",
          "text": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are all the rage right now in Nigeria since the government banned Twitter. The rise in popularity of VPNs has brought up questions about how exactly they work.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how VPNs work.\n\nOn the internet, different computers send and receive information between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Think of it as sending items between two or more physical addresses. When we surf the internet with our IP address, different websites will know specific information about us such as our location, device type, browser and operating system.\n\nWhat does a VPN do?\n\nWith VPNs, our IP addresses change and online activities are hidden.\n\nBefore turning on my VPN, my device was in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAfter turning on my VPN, my device is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nThe images above show how my location changed from Nigeria to Dominican Republic after turning on my VPN.\n\nThink about it this way: The internet is like a highway that connects different cities across different countries. These highways are mostly public roads that many people use. If you drive on a public road anyone can follow you and track where you go, how long you spend at your destination, and when you return. They might even be able to spy inside your car and learn more about you.\n\nWith a VPN, you have your own private tunnel/road. A tunnel where no one can see what you\u2019re doing or where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhat can a VPN do for you?\n\nNo monitoring: As we mentioned earlier, your internet service provider (ISP) can see your internet traffic and probably log your browsing history. With a VPN, information about your activities online are scrambled in an encrypted tunnel so that external parties, your ISP included, can\u2019t read it.\n\nAccess any site: Every now and then, websites or services you want to use may be inaccessible from your location. VPN enables access to these sites or services from anywhere. If a website isn\u2019t available to devices located in Nigeria, VPNs can change your device location to a different country which has access to this website.\n\nProtection: Free public Wi-Fi might make you forget all your life\u2019s problems but it can also be the beginning of a new set of problems. Public Wi-Fi can easily be accessed by hackers on the same network, who can read your personal data. A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection to protect all your communications, even over unsecured networks.\n\nWhat is the difference between a VPN app, a VPN plugin, and a VPN browser?\n\nCurious about which you should use? VPN browsers or browser plugins only protect your web browser traffic. Note, however, that the rest of the network traffic from your device is still exposed to internet service providers and potential hackers. A VPN app encrypts and protects all network traffic from your device.\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN for online banking?\n\nYes\u2013 but ensure you are using a reputable VPN service. VPNs help protect your privacy while you perform online banking transactions. But remember, a VPN is a tunnel that encrypts your data. It cannot protect you from viruses or guarantee that you won\u2019t be hacked. Remember to create a strong password and adhere to online safety measures.\n\nWhat else should I know about VPNs?\n\nVPNs aren\u2019t without flaws. They have their fair share of practical drawbacks. Internet speed can be slower because VPNs have to reroute and encrypt your data while sending and receiving information between your device and a website.\n\nAlso, some sites and services look at VPN traffic as suspicious and won\u2019t let you connect. It becomes suspicious when a device is in different locations within a short time \u2014 in New York, Lagos and Tokyo within an hour. This could become a real problem, especially when it\u2019s your bank that blocks you.",

          "title": "TECNO CAMON 17 Pro: A Creative Nod to the Selfie and the Selfie Culture",
          "text": "A few weeks back, TECNO launched the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro smartphone, focusing on the selfie with a 48MP AI selfie camera and 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate at 6.8-inch FHD Screen. The brand showed sincerity in understanding their consumers\u2019 needs, seeing as the pandemic era amplified people\u2019s need for documenting personal memories.\n\nIt really is no surprise that the social phenomenon of selfies has gained momentum and has become central to how people express themselves and keep in touch with the world. Personally, I have taken more pictures, recorded more videos this past year than I have in years.\n\nI guess that is why TECNO\u2019s Camon 17 Pro stood out to me. It seemed to me like they were the first brand to put this behavioural shift into focus and offer a solution backed by the brand\u2019s usual innovation and sweet price range.\n\nSo, today, I am going to be sharing the things I love about the Camon 17 Pro.\n\n48MP AI Selfie Camera\n\nLike I already stated. The selfie camera of the Camon 17 Pro is one of the highlights of the phone. The 48 MP selfie camera captures the beautiful details in an elegant way even adding a professional finish. The embedded artificial intelligence (AI) technology\u2019s algorithms elevate the pictures by identifying features based on gender. The algorithms also adjust the surrounding light to make me the focal point of the shot. The wide selection tools helped me personalize the images just as I wanted them portrayed. I was able to conceal blemishes on my face. There is also a tool that helped hide the dark circles around my face.\n\nCamera LAB \u2013 The TAIVOS\u2122 Imaging Laboratory\n\nThe TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with trademarked TAIVOS technology. TAIVOS, which stands for TECNO AI Vision Optimization Solution provides users with an unprecedented visual experience, especially in low-light environments. TAIVOS filtered out the image noise of my pictures quite nicely and optimized the images\u2019 clarity. The end result of that were photos with enhanced night photography effects.\n\nOne of my favourite things about TECNO\u2019s TAIVOS\u2122 is how it lets in more light and optimizes details against a low-light background, adding clarity to the photos. The camera literally found light for my pictures despite how dark the night was. The super night mode of the device delivered impressively.\n\nApparently, TECNO has carried out much research to incorporate better technology on the Camon 17 Pro. And it shows in how grand the camera solutions are on the device.\n\nOf course, the camera features of the Camon 17 Pro aren\u2019t all there is about the device. Here are some of the other features that ticks the boxes for me.\n\nElegant Appearance with both Aesthetics and Functionality\n\nThe 6.8-inch 1080\u00d72460 FHD display of the Camon 17 pro provides incomparable clarity and is a feast for the eyes. Every edge feels sharper and every colour is brighter. These worked together to get me truly immersed in the high-definition video and intense games. The 90 Hz super-high refreshing rate offered me a smooth, snappy and refreshing experience.\n\nIt is obvious that the appearance of the device was constructed with ample consideration of both practicality and aesthetics. TECNO made use of light and shadow, as well as accurately crafted nanoscale textures. I should also state how the optical coating incorporated makes the device fingerprint resistant.\n\nThe device comes in distinct California dream silver and Malibu blue colours. Its ergonomic design for easy hold, slim body and adjusted edges gives it a great look.\n\nLong Lasting Battery and Peak Performance\n\nCamon 17 Pro offers users the performance they deserve. Animations are smoother, games are more immersive, and networking is faster. The Media Helio G95 Processor contains an 8-core CPU with Hyper Engine game optimization, making it TECNO\u2019s fastest chip yet, and at the same time still providing exceptional performance. Network optimization with the prediction engine allows for WIFI/LTE concurrence so my connection remained uninterrupted while gaming.\n\nWith an enormous 5000mAh battery you do not have to worry about your phone dying during crucial moments. Furthermore, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro comes with fast charging so, the TECNO CAMON 17 Pro will be ready to leave when you are.\n\nUser Focused OS 7.6 System\n\nI specifically like how TECNO prioritised privacy with the Camon 17 Pro. The device allows users to use fingerprints to lock apps away and keep data as secure as possible. The phone also comes with a privacy film that ensures only the user looking directly at the screen can see what is being shown.\n\nIt\u2019s One-click blockbuster feature allows the users to pick from professional templates to create dynamic and exciting albums to be played back for friends and family. The device makes sharing precious and fun moments a lot easier.\n\nThe Camon 17 Pro sells for N125,000 and is available in authorized stores nationwide. Good thing about buying the Camon 17 Pro as soon as you can is that you will be given the TECNO Buds 1 for free.\n\nHere\u2019s what you will be getting from the buds;\n\nSmooth Connectivity\n\nI went through a seamless process of pairing the TECNO buds 1 to the Camon 17 Pro over a Bluetooth v5.0 connection. With your phone\u2019s Bluetooth on, the earbuds are automatically seen and asks that you pair both devices.\n\nWireless Stereo Sound and Deep Bass\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 has a deep bass effect that locks out noise and allows you enjoy every single sound be it music or movie.\n\nEasy User Experience with the Smart Switching Function\n\nLet me say first that the buds fit perfectly into the ears and wouldn\u2019t fall out easily. I especially love that I didn\u2019t have to bring out my phone each time I had to do basic things like answer phone calls, or move a song to the next one. All I had to do was tap the touch sensitive buttons on the buds.\n\nBattery\n\nThe TECNO Buds 1 comes with an interesting battery capacity. Each earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh and delivers over 12 hours of charge to the earbuds\n\nEach earbud has a 40mAh battery capacity that lasts over 4 hours. The charging case itself is 300mAh\u2026",

          "title": "Fostering Gender Inclusion in Technology with the Bolt Drive4WITech Initiative",
          "text": "The journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing discussion largely influenced by cultural norms and societal expectations concerning gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and as part of efforts to drive participation and inclusion for women in technology, launched the #Drive4WITech (Drive for Women in Tech) initiative to support young women in Africa. The initiative is an immersive internship programme for young women to challenge the status quo and kickstart a career in the tech space. The goal for Bolt is to equip the interns with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, nine interns were selected with three from Nigeria. Two of them \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji and Oluwakorede Oseni spoke about their experience. The interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests.\n\nQ: Among the many applications received, you were selected to intern with Bolt in the #Drive4WITech initiative. How did you feel when you were selected?\n\nOluwakorede: I was excited when I was notified that I had been selected. I saw this as an opportunity to work with a global and inclusive brand that is committed to solving the mobility challenge in Africa. It is an opportunity I have been waiting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I felt elated to have been selected. I have always been curious about what it would feel like working at Bolt. I am happy and satisfied with the knowledge I have gained during my time as an intern.\n\nQ: What area did you specialise in during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I supported the marketing team at Bolt Nigeria. This provided me with a basic understanding of the necessary skills needed to supervise teams, programmes, and strategically plan for maximum impact.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I specialised in City Operations. I worked closely with Heads of Departments to build strategic solutions to issues as they arose, and it has helped me develop core competence in identifying and resolving issues.\n\nQ: Tell us about the experience and the new skills you learnt during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I had a great experience working at Bolt. In the marketing department, I discovered that marketing plays in promoting business goals and driving sales of products or services. Some of the skills I learnt include creative writing and how to structure the language of blogs and messages, using Emails and push notifications to pass across a clear message. I also learnt how to research and identify the organisation\u2019s target audience which helps in crafting content.\n\nOnyekachukwu: My experience was very exciting. I learnt the importance of teamwork, communication, staying up to date on issues that concern the company, professionalism, time management and discipline. The most important thing I have learnt is the ownership mentality. I must act like I own the business, that way, I would be at my best to ensure that everything runs smoothly and the business stays functional. To observe and think of ways to improve the business, it is paramount to communicate doubts and concerns where necessary. In addition, ask for clarity when in doubt and always being courageous enough to say when or where I lack knowledge. I have also developed analytical skills.\n\nQ: What impact has Drive4WITech had on you and how will it enhance your career?\n\nOluwakorede: The programme was very impactful. It exposed me to the importance of marketing and the role it plays in the business world. I am more confident, and I believe I more versatile and can provide useful insights. With all these learnings, I am positive of adding immense value in my future roles.\n\nOnyekachukwu: The skills I learnt will play an instrumental role in helping me to build a successful career. I am more equipped to confidently make significant contributions to my future work team.\n\nQ: How do you plan to use the knowledge gained to your advantage in the tech industry?\n\nOluwakorede: I aspire to own a tech company and to run the company successfully. I have learnt that it is important to manage the brand\u2019s image and proper representation of the brand. I want to use the knowledge gained to build my brand having realised that there is a misconception by tech enthusiasts about other fields. So, the knowledge will be very instrumental to my success in the industry.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I plan to pursue a career in data analytics. With the knowledge gained, I will be able to help businesses optimise their performances and make better consumer decisions, while leveraging on trends and insights for a better customer experience.\n\nQ: Did you have any challenges interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: A major challenge was writing and developing content because I initially had little knowledge about how to structure and develop detailed content with accurate language to pass across the right message. However, with the support of my team members who constantly provided guidance, I was able to overcome the challenge and I can boldly say that I am better off than I joined.\n\nOnyekachukwu: No, the company made my internship as accommodating as possible. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I reached out to my team for support. This has also helped me develop strong organisational skills, where I am more focused on important things.\n\nQ: The Drive4WITech initiative positions Bolt as an inclusive and diverse organization. How immersing was it for you?\n\nOluwakorede: It was very immersing and educating beyond a regular internship. The programme provided an effective vehicle for me to learn and grow. It also helped me develop strong work ethics that enhance productivity while building expertise working with a diverse team.\n\nOnyekachukwu: It was very engaging. Every team did their best to take us through their task and how they work. The operations team taught us several new processes in data analytics. From what was taught, I now understand more about data, how it is stored, and how to use it better. I also learnt how data can be used to tell a story and find useful insights.\n\nQ: Did the programme meet your expectations?\n\nOluwakorede: My experience during the programme exceeded my expectations as I did not expect to learn a lot from marketing. It was fun and challenging because there is always a new technique to learn, a case to study, and strategies to research which is very interesting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I came in with a curious mind and some expectation to learn and practice analytical skills. Even so, the internship curriculum covered more than I expected. It was highly satisfactory.\n\nQ: What is that one thing you will miss about interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: I will miss the friendly environment and meetings where I am encouraged to share ideas and ask questions, motivating me.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I will miss the work culture and healthy workspace that encourages growth, as well as my team; especially Onyinye, Bimbo and Miracle.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "In Africa, mental health resources are scarce, reflecting the weakness of mental health services on the continent. Also, it mirrors how governments and citizens turn a blind eye to the problem.\n\nPerhaps, that\u2019s why Ted Malanda, a Kenyan humour writer, couldn\u2019t comprehend why American actor Robin Williams \u2014 who suffered from depression \u2014 committed suicide in 2014.\n\nWriting via The Standard, Malanda describes how depression \u2014 a mental health disorder \u2014 is such a non-issue on the continent that African languages do not have a word for it.\n\nImpact of mental health disorders\n\nPhoto by Sam Moqadam on Unsplash\n\nA study shows that 13% of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) is primarily due to mental health disorders. Almost three-quarters of this burden lies in low and middle-income countries due to extremely scarce health resources and investment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMental health is an integral aspect of wellness because it reflects in daily living, relationships, physical health, work, and school productivity.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) fact sheet reveals that mental health disorders, otherwise known as mental health illnesses, vary and come with different presentations.\n\nThese disorders include depression, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other psychoses, dementia, and developmental disorders.\n\nThey are characterised by a combination of abnormal thoughts, perceptions, emotions, behaviours, and relationships with others. Therefore, mental wellness should receive as much care as physical health.\n\nGlobally, the impact of mental health illnesses on the economy is significant. The cost of productivity lost annually is approximately $1.15 trillion, while almost 4.7 billion days of productivity are lost.\n\nMayo Clinic \u2014 a US-based non-profit hospital \u2014 mentions that people will always have mental health concerns from time to time. Nonetheless, a mental health concern becomes a mental health disorder when signs and symptoms cause recurring stress and affect the ability to function.\n\nHence, protecting your mental health is essential.\n\nProtecting your mental health with technology\n\nImage by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nThere are effective strategies to prevent and alleviate the suffering caused by mental health disorders, and technology is one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe use of social media can be a cause of mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. However, technology can be advantageous to someone with mental health disorders.\n\nIt has opened a new frontier of mental health support and data collection. Research shows that mobile phones and Internet-connected devices provide an opportunity to collect objective information on individuals\u2019 behaviour.\n\nThis information helps generate a data set that provides insight into an individual\u2019s mental health needs.\n\nThe University of Illinois, Chicago, encourages Internet-based support groups, telehealth, and mobile apps to protect one\u2019s mental health.\n\nMobile mental health support can be simple and effective. Globally, about 800 mobile apps help users cope with symptoms, share their stories, and meet with psychiatrists and psychotherapists.\n\nFurthermore, they provide valuable data to physicians, therapists, and health care informatics experts.\n\nInternet-based support groups help people with mental health disorders, guiding them while they reveal their struggles anonymously. And telehealth provides consultation with a health care provider via phone or video conference.\n\nHow technology is protecting mental health in Africa\n\nA study by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) shows that doctors, researchers, and the public can access help, monitor progress, and increase understanding of mental wellbeing with mobile devices like phones and tablets. In Africa, some startups and non-profit organisations already do this.\n\nWe examine two startups and one user-led community helping people with mental health disorders in Africa.\n\nShezlong\n\nFounded in 2015 by Ahmed Abu ElHaz, an Egyptian software engineer, Shezlong is a healthtech startup that offers people in the Middle East and Africa (MENA) region on-demand mental health care.\n\nIt is the first online psychotherapy clinic in the region.\n\nShezlong has a mobile app that aims to help people with mental health disorders become more confident and make better life decisions. They also offer relationship counselling.\n\nShezlong homepage\n\nThe app is used in more than 60 countries. Over 300 certified and trusted therapists and psychiatrists are conveniently, privately, and anonymously connected with people with mental disorders in MENA.\n\nTruthshare\n\nTruthshare is an online mental health application that helps people get counselling. It was co-founded in 2019 by two Nigerians: Kuro Briggs and Fortune Bekee.\n\nTruthshare homepage\n\nThe online app aims to improve the mental health of Nigerians. It leverages the Internet to provide a safe place where people can express themselves anonymously, get access to certified counsellors, and feel better.\n\nMoreover, the public can offer advice to people struggling with their mental health.\n\nMentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI)\n\nMANI is a user-led community that uses social media platforms to reach its audience.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Victor Ugo, MANI is based on two core beliefs: to alleviate the stigma and suffering which arises from mental disorders and to know that people who have mental health disorders have a right to life and assistance.\n\nMANI attempts to fight stigma, improve mental health literacy, and drive policies that benefit mental health service users and those at risk.\n\nIt also engages in activities and services that promote and prevent mental health issues.\n\nWhen asked how MANI has helped people with mental health disorders, Max, a writer, told Techpoint Africa, \u201cWhen I was depressed last year, Mentally Aware Nigeria helped me get better. They assigned someone \u2014 who should be a counsellor \u2014 to me. They followed me up on WhatsApp until I started feeling better. That worked for me.\u201d\n\nTechnology has made mental health care affordable and convenient. And anyone with a mental illness can get care anywhere. The use of mobile apps and online platforms offer users the option of anonymity, helping them avoid stigmatisation as they share their stories.\n\nIn recognition of Global Wellness Day, we want you to take care of your mental health as much as you do your physical health. If social media is a source of depression or anxiety for you, you could take a break and take advantage of the Internet.\n\nWe care about your mental health and hope you get the help you need.\n\nHappy Global Wellness Day.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nVictoria here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations\n\nApple Health features for the elderly\n\nPlentywaka partners with GUO\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nThe global fintech industry recorded impressive growth in 2020. This is according to the State of Finance App Marketing 2021 report by US-based mobile marketing analytics company, AppsFlyer. The report reveals that beyond funding, fintech app installations grew by160% in the last quarter of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria alone, loan app installations grew by 43.3%; financial services grew by 34.6%, and investment apps by 20.3%.\n\nSimilarly, Kenya saw 100% growth, and South Africa 52% growth, in fintech app installations.\n\nWhy this growth? The economic effects of COVID-19 led to the rise in fintech app installations.\n\nBesides, in Nigeria, about 56% of the population is unbanked. Also, the unfavourable regulatory conditions could have prompted some of them to make use of loan apps while they explored other financial services.\n\nInterestingly, the fintech space recorded a significant boom in marketing investment. Over 150 Nigerian fintech startups reportedly generate annual revenues of over $5 million.\n\nTo read more on the state of fintech apps, click here.\n\nApple introduces new iPhone features for the elderly\n\nApple, at its World wide developer conference (WWDC) event, announced new features for iOS 15 on the iPhone. The event which started on Monday, June 7 will end today, Friday, June 11.\n\nThoughtfully, among the new features, Apple introduced two health-focused ones \u2014 Walking Steadiness and ability to share health data with family members \u2014 for the elderly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy these features? Older people are prone to falling, and it is the major cause of accidents, injury, and death for older people.\n\nHow does it work? The feature intends to track people as they move through their daily lives.\n\nNot to be confused with fall detection on the Apple Watch, which prompts users to call emergency services, Apple says Walking Steadiness is different, as it focuses on prediction rather than response.\n\nThat is, it is able to predict your risk of falling, using metrics like walking speed, step length, and the time both feet are in contact with the ground.\n\nWhile this may seem exciting, I doubt its ability to help everyone, as walking patterns differ. Moreover, it is only effective if users carry their phones around at all times; some don\u2019t.\n\nStill, it\u2019s good to know Apple does not just target only the young, but the elderly too.\n\nWalking Steadiness will be available for everyone who has an iPhone 6s and above.\n\nPlentywaka partners GUO to expand inter-state\n\nPlentyWaka bus. Source: PlentyWaka Twitter\n\nPlentywaka, a Nigerian bus-hailing tech company, has announced its partnership with interstate bus company, GUO Transport, to expand its reach.\n\nThis will lead to the opening of new routes on Plentywaka\u2019s inter-state offshoot, Travelwaka. About 200 routes are expected to be launched. Plentywaka will onboard 600 new buses from GUO, bringing total buses on the platform to 850.\n\nThis partnership is mutually beneficial because GUO doesn\u2019t have to build and maintain proprietary tech for commuters to find them online. Plentywaka, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t need to buy buses to expand inter-state.\n\nThe end goal of PlentyWaka is to give its users an easy way to compare their choices from a range of travel companies. So perhaps we can expect it to onboard more inter-state bus companies in the near future.\n\nSounds familiar? You might remember Oya.com.ng, the bus ticketing website that was acquired by Wakanow in 2015, barely 2 years into operation. They employed a similar inventory-less model.\n\nSidebar: It might interest you to know that GIGM, another major bus company, has a tech-enabled platform that allows investors to place their buses on its inter-state network.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching this weekend\n\nImproving early child development with words. Watch.\n\nHow China lost patience with its loudest billionaire. Watch.\n\nHave an amazing weekend ahead.\n\nVictoria Fakiya for Techpoint Africa.",

          "text": "In May 2021, CribMD, a Nigerian healthtech startup, closed a $2.6 million seed round led by US-based venture capital firm, Sputnik ATX.\n\nFounded by Dr Oksana Malysheva \u2014 a physicist with stints at McKinsey and Motorola \u2014 and Joe Merrill \u2014 a former US diplomat to Nigeria, South Korea, and Bosnia \u2014 Sputnik ATX runs an accelerator programme where founders receive $100,000, with the potential for more in follow-on funding.\n\nSince its inception, the firm has invested in over 30 startups across various industries.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Joe Merrill, a partner at the firm, and he gave some insights into how they invest in startups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFun fact: Sputnik is a Russian word meaning partner. It is also the name of the first artificial satellite launched into space.\n\nTell us how Sputnik ATX came about\n\nMy business partner, Oksana Malysheva, and I founded ATX in 2017 after we had managed a fund together.\n\nWe were looking for ways to improve our returns and be more impactful. In our research, we discovered a massive gap with early-stage financing that would give entrepreneurs the tools needed to grow their businesses and then follow-on funding to scale and grow quickly.\n\nWe founded Sputnik ATX so that we could do that. We joke that we teach nerds how to sell, so if they have a minimum viable product (MVP) and a customer and are looking to try and figure out how to grow their startup, we teach them how to grow and build a big company.\n\nWhat does VC investment mean to Sputnik ATX?\n\nDr. Oksana Malysheva, Managing Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nWe are early-stage investors, and to us, VC investment is the ability to help very brilliant, gritty, hardworking, humble people get access to capital at an early stage to accelerate their company\u2019s growth.\n\nWe also help them by giving them business skills, particularly in sales and marketing, so that they can refine their product and grow their business in a sustainable way that would help them to produce an amazing company.\n\nEvery VC has an eye or eyes in specific markets. Tell us what market(s) Sputnik ATX is interested in and why?\n\nWe\u2019re not necessarily interested in specific markets but in people who have a big impact. So, for example, we talk about this thing called consumer surplus \u2014 an economic term that refers to the difference between what you\u2019re willing to pay for something and what you pay for it.\n\nAnd when we see people who are generating lots of consumer surplus, it means they\u2019re generating lots of value in the market. And we want to help them to do just that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name Sputnik comes from the first thing mankind launched into space \u2014 the Sputnik 1 satellite \u2014 and like Sputnik, we\u2019re looking for people who are doing big things.\n\nDoes that mean you invest more in founders than in startups?\n\nIt has to be both. There\u2019s this statement about whether you invest in the jockey or the horse, and we think that you invest in both because good jockeys and good horses work together.\n\nWe think that the best ideas are where you have a fantastic person with incredible technology that the world desperately needs.\n\nBy Sputnik ATX\u2019s standards, what shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nJoe Merrill, Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a wrong answer to that question. If you\u2019re a startup founder, you should be asking yourself if what you\u2019re doing is making the world a better place, and if it\u2019s making the world a better place, then the question is how much better.\n\nSome startups that make the world a better place may not generate many financial returns, and that\u2019s okay. There\u2019s nothing bad about that.\n\nBut as venture investors, we have a responsibility to get a return for our investors. So while those are worthy businesses, the economics don\u2019t work for venture capital.\n\nWe have to invest in companies that are making an impact where additional money and resources can go a long way in building the business and generating a return for the investors, the founders, and ultimately something really great for the customers using the service or product.\n\nWhat is your average ticket size?\n\nWe start small by giving them a $100,000 cheque, and we have an option to increase that to $500,000, but we would continue to invest in companies as they grow. We have invested millions in some of the companies in our portfolio.\n\nWe\u2019re just getting started. Right now, we\u2019re raising a $100 million follow-on fund, and we have raised over half of the money. We plan to continue to write cheques worth $5 million to $10 million for companies as they continue to grow.\n\nIs there any other African startup in your portfolio other than CribMD?\n\nCribMD is probably the second. The first was Vybe Software, and even though Vybe was based in the United States, like CribMD, most of their customers were in Africa. Vybe has an app called Leia that enables people to launch a website.\n\nIt is free, but for 99 cents a month, you can upgrade and get a much nicer package. It uses artificial intelligence to build completely unique, beautiful websites for anyone.\n\nThat company did really well in Nigeria. Lots of merchants were able to create little marketplaces where they could advertise their businesses online.\n\nHow does Sputnik ATX deal with bad investments?\n\nI hate saying bad investments because bad is kind of like this judgement where something is morally repugnant, and that\u2019s not the case. What happens is someone starts a company, and the company is generating insufficient financial returns to justify the investments, but that doesn\u2019t make them bad.\n\nIt just means that it didn\u2019t work out, and there are a couple of choices. Sometimes those companies can continue to operate because they\u2019re profitable; they\u2019re not just going to get very big.\n\nHowever, if they\u2019re losing money, and if they continue to lose money, you usually sit down with the founders, and you decide if it\u2019s a good time to shut the company down. If there\u2019s some value in the asset that another company would find valuable, you sell the asset to other companies because while you may not be able to do a lot with it, someone else might.\n\nI\u2019ll be frank, it\u2019s okay if a startup doesn\u2019t work; we expect that to happen. It\u2019s how you do it that matters. If you realise your company is not viable, you shut it down in an orderly way. What you do says a lot about the quality and the integrity of the founder.\n\nWhen founders shut things down properly, we love to invest in them because they acted with integrity.\n\nWhat industries are of most interest to Sputnik ATX?\n\nWe invest in anything that is not evil. We have a strict policy of not investing in evil. We have everything, including a company that makes nutritious doughnuts.\n\nEverybody likes doughnuts, but they\u2019re not good for your health. This was a bunch of American football players with such strict diets who worked tirelessly to figure out how to make nutritious yet delicious doughnuts.\n\nWe also have a company producing an engine that will replace the one in cars, and it\u2019s beautiful. This thing would single-handedly stop greenhouse gas emission, and Shell just announced that they are investing in that company.\n\nIt works, and in 20 years, we could all be using this product. So when we see companies with amazing technologies like these, we want to invest in them.\n\nWhat opportunities have Sputnik ATX regrettably passed on, and why?\n\nMy biggest regret is a company called FloatMe. It\u2019s in San Antonio, and we almost accepted them. We limit the number of companies that we can accept to between five and seven for each group. They were the company that just missed the cut.\n\nWe liked the founders, and we should have done it. The company has been very successful. I still love the founders. They\u2019re incredible, and I think the world of the company.\n\nIt\u2019s such an incredible service. It puts a little money into people\u2019s accounts when they are about to overdraft them. I wish we had invested, but it turns out they didn\u2019t need our money, and they\u2019ve done very well.\n\nThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just happy to see smart people do awesome things that help other people even if we don\u2019t get to invest.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nThey can go to sputnikatx.com. They can also find me on Twitter @Austin_VC. I get and accept DMs from people.\n\nMy business partner is @Oksana_ATX. You can read all about her on our website. I also have a blog where I write about business, economics, and startups because I\u2019m an economist and an entrepreneur.\n\nI talk about Nigeria ever so often on my blog. I love Nigeria.",

          "text": "I told some old friends from King\u2019s College that I wanted to protest the negative impact of the Twitter ban on small businesses at the Lekki Tollgate and needed company. We were going to take a simplistic view of how the restriction was stifling the multitude of businesses that use Twitter as a means of constant communication with old and new customers. It was unacceptable for the government to act this way, not caring about the economic consequences.\n\nI referenced data from Netblocks, an online service that publishes estimates of the economic cost of internet disruptions around the world. Netblocks had put the cost of the ban to Nigeria at N90.7 million ($250,600) per hour. I gave several analogies to buttress how the cost was mainly shouldered by private businesses and not President Muhammadu Buhari who ordered the ban because his ego was bruised by the microblogging platform\u2019s treatment of his tweet. If these private businesses who had all been shut out of Twitter had a say, would the majority sign up for the ban?\n\nMy friends cut me short at this point.\n\nWhile they agreed we would be protesting for a good cause, they urged caution, citing the way the government had violently quashed protests against police brutality last year after armed military men shot at peaceful protesters and killed some of them. Drawing from that experience they urged me to say nothing. They didn\u2019t have to remind me about the events of October 20, 2020. I had also not forgotten the shameful incident for which not a single person has been tried eight months after. I actually had something else up my sleeves. I was carrying out a test of what democracy meant to young Nigerians and there I got my answer.\n\nDemocracy is about freedom. Freedom of speech, expression, association etc, and is also about holding the government accountable. When people are so afraid to speak for the fear of being brutally silenced, what does it say about democracy in such a country?\n\nOf course, we shouldn\u2019t define Nigeria\u2019s democracy by the events of just one year. Our democracy has indeed grown leaps and bounds since the military era, but it is now fast deteriorating.\n\nThere\u2019s been a global hit\n\nGlobally, democracy actually took a hit in 2020.\n\nThe average regional scores in The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Democracy Index worsened in every single region of the world in 2020 for the first time since 2010.\n\nRead Also: 22 years of democracy: Poverty, insecurity dealing deadly blow on Nigerians\n\nThe average global score in 2020 fell to 5.37 (on a scale of 0-10) from 5.44 in 2019, driven by regressions across all regions, and especially large ones in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nA decade ago the cause of a similar democratic recession was disaffection with governments and a collapse of trust in institutions following the global economic and financial crisis.\n\nBy contrast, the 2020 worldwide democratic regression was largely the result of the measures taken by governments to address the public health emergency caused by the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, which has entailed the suspension of the civil liberties of entire populations for prolonged periods. Across the world in 2020, citizens experienced the biggest rollback of individual freedoms ever undertaken by governments during peacetime (and perhaps even in wartime). The willing surrender of fundamental freedoms by millions of people was perhaps one of the most remarkable occurrences in an extraordinary year.\n\nThe main policy response of governments to the pandemic, whether they were authoritarian or democratic, was to impose social distancing, quarantines and lockdown measures of greater or lesser severity and of longer or shorter duration. By the end of 2020, many Western countries were entering their third lockdowns as cases of the coronavirus surged again as a result of the spread of new, more infectious strains. Only one year before, when the Chinese authorities locked down the city of Wuhan in Hubei province in central China, the rest of the world looked on incredulously, and people said that it could \u201cnever happen here\u201d.\n\nYet within months, countries around the world were following the Chinese template of lockdowns, albeit without employing the same repressive techniques as China to contain what had by then become a global pandemic. Political and cultural differences\u2014and, in some cases, an initial belief that the pandemic was a hoax\u2014led some democracies to resist the policy of lockdowns.\n\nIn the US in particular, a strong culture of anti-statism and commitment to individual rights resulted in high levels of popular resistance to the public health measures taken by state authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Yet these were differences mainly of degree rather than substance, and social distancing and lockdowns became the standard approach to dealing with the public health emergency across the developed world. In many emerging markets and poorer countries, lockdowns tended to be shorter (but more coercive) and social distancing less restrictive, given the dependence of so many on the informal economy and the state\u2019s inability to provide a social safety net for long, if at all.\n\nAcross the world, the pandemic led governments to take away their citizens\u2019 freedoms and suspend civil liberties. Freedom of movement was taken away as a result of border closures, international travel bans, and restrictions on domestic travel and the use of public transport. Governments invoked emergency powers or imposed states of emergency; dispensed with parliamentary oversight and checks and balances; introduced compulsory social distancing, lockdowns, curfews and mask-wearing; confined people to their homes, except for limited activities; closed educational and cultural establishments; cancelled or postponed elections; prohibited public protests; censured dissenting voices and curtailed freedom of expression, and used the full force of the law to punish those who disobeyed. This list may sound dystopian, yet this was the experience of most people in 2020.\n\nThe unprecedented suspension of individual freedoms, at least in countries where liberty prevailed before the pandemic, accounts for the sharp democratic regression recorded in the 2020 Democracy Index. Government restrictions on citizens\u2019 civil liberties led to scoring downgrades for several Democracy Index questions for almost every country in the world.\n\nNigeria\u2019s democracy suffers under Buhari\n\nNigeria\u2019s democracy index score declined to 4.10 in 2020 from 4.12 in 2019. In 2015, when the Buhari government was first appointed, the score was 4.62 which means the country saw a 10 percent slump between 2015 and 2020. So Nigeria\u2019s deterioration did not start last year, it\u2019s been on for the entire duration of the Buhari administration.\n\nIt is ironic that Nigeria\u2019s democracy is seemingly rescinding under the watch of Buhari who rode the coattails of a vibrant democracy to mount a sweeping defeat of an incumbent president, the first time it had ever happened in the country\u2019s history of democratic rule.\n\nHis victory was the result of rife discontent among Nigerians about the previous government.\n\nBuhari has however now become a threat to the same vibrant democracy that brought him into power whether it\u2019s in the form of sanctioning the use of aggressive force against peaceful protesters or the recent Twitter ban for all Nigerians. His entire administration is tainted with violation of court orders, arrest of journalists and other anti-democratic actions.\n\nThere was the crackdown on Omoyele Sowore, a journalist and publisher of Sahara Reporters who tried to lead national protests against Buhari\u2019s administration on the grounds of rising insecurity and corruption, even as there is the case of the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky and his wife Zeenat who on June 9 clocked 2000 days in illegal detention.\n\nAs far back as December 2016, a Federal High Court in Abuja had ordered El-Zakzaky and his wife released from detention, citing that the continued detention violates their rights and is against Section 35(1) of the constitution which provided \u201cevery person shall be entitled to his personal liberty and no person shall be deprived of such liberty\u2026in accordance with a procedure by law.\u201d\n\nBut the Nigerian government has continued to detain them using the exemption provided in Section 35 (1)(c), that an individual can be detained \u201c\u2026upon reasonable suspicion of his having committed a criminal offence.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if El-Zakzaky\u2019s continued detention is against the other provisions of the constitution.\n\nThis is what Nigeria has become, civic rights are no longer guaranteed. It is why Nigerians are now afraid to hold the government accountable through protests. Unfortunately, the pain of that forced silence is being borne by Nigerians whose misery is worsening.\n\nIn his six years as president, Nigerians have grown poorer each year, with the economy failing to expand at a fast enough pace to provide opportunities for a bulging population. Jobs are scarce and unemployment is the second highest globally at 33 percent in 2020. Nearly 14 million young people are out of work in Nigeria, which has one of the largest youth population, with more than a third of its 200 million people aged 24 or under according to United Nations data. Unattractive government policies and a difficult business environment won\u2019t let private capital come in droves to create jobs while the few investors within the country are being suffocated to death and the few jobs available are lost.\n\nThe lack of jobs for its teeming youth population is fanning insecurity and the worst may be yet to come for a country that is projected by the United Nations to be the third most populous nation in the world by 2050- with 400 million people, double of the current population.\n\nThe deafening silence of Nigerians amid the country\u2019s economic realities should be an indictment of its democracy, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be, at least not yet.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has signed a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) with promoters of the Edo Inland Dry Port, Atlantique Marine Engineering Services, formalising the framework as equity owners for the investment, on behalf of Edo people.\n\nWith the agreement, Edo citizens are now part owners of the inland dry port, which provides citizens and Nigerians from all walks of life, opportunity to participate and engage in international trading, commercial import and export activities of both raw and processed agricultural products and solid minerals, among others, while importers can consign their cargo directly to arrive in Edo.\n\nGovernor Obaseki, who spoke shortly after signing the document, commended the firm for the progress made on the project.\n\nThe governor, represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie, Esq., reassured the government\u2019s commitment to attracting investors into the state and providing the enabling environment for businesses to thrive.\n\nReassuring the construction of an access road to the project, Obaseki said: \u201cThe last time we came for inspection at the project site, we promised that as a state government, we were going to do something about the road.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that the design for the road has been done, and we are in touch with PRESCO Oil Ltd., to finance the construction of the road. Very soon, the contract will be awarded.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of AMES-Edo, Dr. Charles Akhigbe, said the Edo Inland Dry Port, which is 70 percent complete, is the first dry port in the South-South region.\n\nAkhigbe noted that the dry port, with a 20,000 TEU facility, was being developed as a private investment with the direct intention to place Edo on the global shipping map.\n\nHe added that the primary purpose of the Edo Inland Dry Port was to bring the port activities closer to industries, manufacturers, individual importers and exporters.\n\n\u201cWith the gradual realization of the AMES-Edo Inland Dry Port as a port of origin and destination, importers and exporters do not need to go to Lagos, Warri, Koko or Onne anymore.\n\n\u201cThis is because you can directly consign your cargo to and from the Edo Dry Port from wherever port abroad you may wish to ship from or to.\n\n\u201cEdo is lucky to be on the ECOWAS international trade route, which commences from Abidjan through Cotonou \u2013 Lagos \u2013 Ore \u2013 Benin and terminates at Lokoja.\n\n\u201cWith the state of the arterial logistics hub of the nation, the development of the Edo Inland Dry Port and truck transit park becomes a critical transport Infrastructure that is designed to converge local and international businesses in Edo,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CEO also said that as a future Customs port, the Edo Inland Dry Port would operate according to the custom and excise laws facilitating trade and ensuring revenue collection.\n\n\u201cEdo Inland Dry Port, as a terminal operator, would ensure efficient cargo handling, facilities management, provision of cold storage facilities and other handling equipment, to ensure topmost operational and cost efficiency,\u201d he added.\n\n...",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said the hard choices made by his administration to tackle the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the world have yielded successful impacts.\n\nThe president, who addressed Nigerians in a nationwide broadcast on Saturday to mark the 2021 Democracy Day, was referring to some measures, including travel restrictions across the states of the federation and beyond, compulsory use of nose masks, hand washing protocols and other relevant protocols instituted to limit spread of the virus.\n\nMr Buhari said; \u201cOur response to the pandemic involved making hard choices in balancing livelihoods and public health concerns.\n\n\u201cYou are all living witnesses to how successful this has been due to a number of proactive measures put in place. Our response to COVID-19 is globally acclaimed.\n\n\u201cWe were able to ensure that the various lockdown measures did not impact too negatively on the ability of ordinary Nigerians to continue sustaining their livelihoods.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response\n\nIt has been 16 months since Nigeria reported its COVID-19 index case in an Italian traveller. Since then, over 160,000 infections have been recorded in the country. This has led to more than 2,000 deaths.\n\nWhile Nigeria, like most African countries, has not suffered from the worst effect of the pandemic, unlike its European and American counterparts, the Nigerian government was slow to take action against the virus.\n\nTo limit the spread of the virus, the World Health Organisation (WHO) had urged countries to \u201cdetect, test, treat, isolate, trace, and mobilise their citizens to ensure that those with just a handful of cases could prevent the wider spread of the deadly virus.\u201d\n\nIt also warned that porous borders, a continuing flow of travellers and poorly resourced healthcare systems meant the risk of an outbreak across Africa was very high.\n\nHealth professionals, including the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), warned the Nigerian government to shut its skies and borders to prevent further importation of the virus from European and Asian nations where the disease had started to spread.\n\nBut the government appeared not to heed that advice until the country\u2019s caseload rose to at least 30. International flights were still operating despite rising cases overseas, making Nigeria particularly vulnerable.\n\nOn March 18, 2020, the government announced it was restricting entry into the country for travellers from China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Japan, France, Germany, U.S., Norway, UK, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. All five cases reported that day came from some of the blacklisted countries.\n\nPresident Buhari had declared a two-week lockdown of Lagos, Abuja and Ogun during his first address on the pandemic on March 29 to enable the country to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOn April 12, the president addressed the nation again on the same issue and announced the extension of the lockdown by another two weeks.\n\nThis was followed by other lockdowns at interval and inter-state travel bans on non-essential commodities.\n\nDemocracy Day\n\nJune 12 is one of the most memorable days in Nigeria\u2019s political history. It is the day that what is regarded as the country\u2019s freest and fairest presidential election was held.\n\nThe election result was cancelled and the presumed winner, Moshood Abiola, later detained. The Buhari administration declared June 12 Democracy Day, although the country also celebrates May 29 as the day of transfer of power between administrations.\n\n\u201cWhen this administration decided to change our Democracy Day from 29 May to June 12 in my first tenure, it was not only to honour the sacrifices of the men and women of our country who fought for the return to democracy but also to demonstrate our commitment to satisfy the aspirations of the people and creating an environment for democracy to be an accepted way of life,\u201d Mr Buhari said in his speech.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThere was heavy presence of security operatives at strategic locations in Oshogbo, Osun State capital on Saturday morning, as hundreds of human rights activists under the aegis of Osun Civil Societies Coalition staged protest marches within Osogbo metropolis to commemorate June 12 democracy day.\n\nThe activists who had earlier converged at the popular Oke-Fia roundabout, condemned the spate of killings, kidnapping and all forms of insecurities in the country.\n\nThe group said the current government structure is responsible for the myriad of problems choking the country\u2019s development.\n\nAddressing the gathering, Comrade Olowu Emmanuel, Coordinator, Democracy Vanguard, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to, as a matter of urgency, find lasting solutions to the insecurity bedeviling the country.\n\nOlowu said security situation in the country is worrisome, while calling for adequate funding of security outfits.\n\n\u201cOur security should be well financed. And any group of person that is trying to be corrupt in a particular government should be made to face the full wrath of law,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, used the occasion to appeal to Governor Gboyega Oyetola to conduct local government elections, saying local government election was essential in democracy as it\u2019s stated in the constitution.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cconducting a local government election is essential in our democracy as it\u2019s stated in our constitution.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of the coalition, Comrade Waheed Lawal, had in a statement to mark this year June 12, called for true federalism.\n\nLawal had said: \u201cWe believe that only true federalism, which is coming in the name of restructuring can address the challenges facing Nigeria as a country. The current government structure is responsible for the myriad of problems which is choking the country\u2019s development.\n\n\u201cAlso, it is a known fact that Nigeria\u2019s security structure has collapsed, which has thrown up a call for total overhauling of our security system.\n\n\u201cNowhere in Nigeria is safe now and we call on the President to show seriousness and political will to address the insecurity problem with action.\n\n\u201cWe also use this opportunity to call for peace and unity among Nigerians.

          "title": "Buhari\u2019s Democracy Day message to the nation: Full Text",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s democracy day speech today, June 12, 2021\n\nFellow Nigerians, I join you all today to commemorate and celebrate our Democracy Day. It is a celebration of freedom and a victory for one people, one country and one Nigeria.\n\n2. As with all democracies we will always be going through improvement processes in our desire to reach the goal of a mature democracy, a strong, evolved and integrated nation state to be reckoned with globally.\n\n3. In the last two years we have witnessed and overcome a good number of testy challenges that would have destroyed other nations especially relating to our collective security.\n\n4. The indefatigable CAN DO Spirit of the Nigerian has sustained us and would keep pushing us to put these challenges behind us.\n\n5. Unfortunately some of these challenges came in the shape of violent outrages leading to the loss of lives of many of our dear compatriots and the destruction of some of our infrastructure, including those devoted to improving our democratic processes.\n\n6. Once again, I want to render my sincere and heart-felt condolences to the families and friends of our gallant service men and women who lost their lives in the line of duty and as a sacrifice to keep Nigeria safe.\n\n7. I extend the same condolence to the families and friends of our country men, women and children who were unfortunate victims of such senseless arsons, kidnappings and murders.\n\n8. I also share the pains of families and direct victims of ransom-seeking, kidnaped victims who went through unimaginable trauma in the course of their forced imprisonment.\n\n9. Let me assure my fellow citizens that every incident, however minor gives me great worry and concern and I immediately order security agencies to swiftly but safely rescue victims and bring perpetrators to justice.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n10. When you elected me as your President in 2015, you did so knowing that I will put an end to the growing insecurity, especially the insurgency in the North East, but the unintended consequences of our scattering them in the North East pushed them further in-country which is what we are now facing and dealing with.\n\n11. We will, by the Grace of God put an end to these challenges too.\n\n12. Unfortunately, like in most conflict situations, some Nigerian criminals are taking undue advantage of a difficult situation and profiteering therefrom with the misguided belief that adherence to the democratic norms handicaps this Administration from frontally and decisively tackling them.\n\n13. We are already addressing these obstacles and we will soon bring some of these culprits to justice.\n\n14. We are, at the same time addressing the twin underlying drivers of insecurity namely poverty and youth unemployment.\n\n15. Interventions led by Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria driving economic growth over the past 6 years are targeted mostly to the agricultural, services, infrastructure, power and health care sectors of the economy.\n\n16. In the Agricultural sector, for instance, the Anchor Borrowers Programme resulted in sharp decline in the nation\u2019s major food import bill from $2.23billion in 2014 to US$0.59billion by the end of 2018.\n\n17. Rice import bill alone dropped from $1 billion to $18.5 million annually.\n\n18. This initiative supported local production of rice, maize, cotton and cassava. Government financed 2.5 million small-holder farmers cultivating about 3.2 million hectares of farmland all over the country and created 10 million direct and indirect jobs.\n\n19. Several other initiatives, namely AgriBusiness/Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme, the Non-oil Export stimulation Facility, the Targeted Credit Facilities operated across the 774 Local Governments.\n\n20. In the manufacturing sector the CBN \u2013 BOI N200 billion facility financed the establishment and operations of 60 new industrial hubs across the country, creating an estimated 890,000 direct and indirect jobs.\n\n21. The CBN\u2019s N50 billion Textile Sector intervention Facility increased capacity utilization of ginneries from 30% to nearly 90%.\n\n22. The Economic Sustainability Plan \u2013 our rebound plan for the COVID-19 pandemic developed in 2020 is currently being executed. The plan is primarily focused on the non-oil sector, which has recorded phenomenal growth contributing over 90% to the GDP growth in Q1 2021.\n\n23. Though marginal we have recorded GDP growth over two quarters; Q2 2020 and Q1 2021. This is evidence of a successful execution of the ESP by the Federal Government.\n\n24. My vision of pulling 100 million poor Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years has been put into action and can be seen in the National Social Investment Programme, a first in Africa and one of the largest in the world where over 32.6m beneficiaries are taking part. We now have a National Social register of poor and vulnerable households, identified across 708 local government areas, 8,723 wards and 86,610 communities in the 36 States and the FCT.\n\n25. Our conditional cash transfer program has benefited over 1.6 million poor and vulnerable households comprising more than 8 million individuals. This provides a monthly stipend of N10,000 per household.\n\n26. I have also recently approved the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy Plan that augments existing plans to further reduce poverty in Nigeria.\n\n27. As at the end of 2020, the Development Bank of Nigeria had disbursed 324 billion Naira in loans to more than 136,000 MSMEs, through 40 participating Financial Institutions. I am to note that 57% of these beneficiaries are women while 27% are the youth.\n\n28. We are able to do all these and still accelerate our infrastructure development through sensible and transparent borrowing, improved capital inflow, improving and increasing revenue through capturing more tax bases and prudent management of investment proceeds in the Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n29. Our infrastructure revolution continues with key projects attaining critical milestones under the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund; The Second Niger Bridge, The Lagos- Ibadan Expressway and the Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway.\n\n30. I have also approved the establishment of Infraco Plc, a world-class infrastructure development vehicle wholly focused on Nigeria with a capital structure of N15 trillion.\n\n31. The rail system is not left out as the Itakpe-Warri standard gauge rail was completed and commissioned 33 years after construction began. The Lagos-Ibadan double track railway line which I have just commissioned has commenced operations.\n\n32. We are focused on ensuring that our infrastructure drive is key to economic growth and one that can be felt by every Nigerian. Building critical infrastructure in our ports is also opening up opportunities for the Nigerian economy.\n\n33. My approval for 4 new seaports using a Public-Private-Partnership approach is hinged on growing the Nigerian economy. These four sea ports; Lekki Deep Sea Port, Bonny Deep Sea Port, Ibom Deep Sea Port and Warri Deep Sea port will create massive job opportunities and foreign investment inflows.\n\n34. We have worked at deepening our Eastern ports leading to success like having three container ships berth at Calabar port, a first in 11 years. Similarly, on October 30 2019, an LPG tanker operated by NLNG berthed in Port Harcourt, the first time an LPG ship is berthing at any of the Eastern Ports.\n\n35. As we invest in these new assets, we have also made strides in ensuring that they are secured and protected. In this regard I am also pleased to note the launch of the NIMASA Deep Blue project \u2013 which is an Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure that I recently commissioned. This initiative is designed to add to the layer of security we have to safeguard our maritime sector.\n\nDear Nigerians,\n\n36. I will be the first to admit that in spite of our efforts and achievements which are there for all to see, there is still much more to be done and we are doing our best in the face of scarce resources and galloping population growth rate that consistently outstrips our capacity to provide jobs for our populace. Our over-all economic target of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is our goal notwithstanding COVID-19.\n\n37. In the last two years we lifted 10.5 million people out of poverty \u2013 farmers, small-scale traders, artisans, market women and the like.\n\n38. I am very convinced that this 100 million target can be met and this informed the development of a National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy. The specific details of this accelerated strategy will be unveiled shortly.\n\n39. In the last one year, Nigeria and the whole world faced COVID-19 for which no one was fully prepared.\n\n40. Our response to the pandemic involved making hard choices in balancing livelihoods and public health concerns. You are all living witnesses to how successful this has been due to a number of pro-active measures put in place. Our response to COVID-19 is globally acclaimed.\n\n41. We were able to ensure that the various lockdown measures did not impact too negatively on the ability of ordinary Nigerians to continue sustaining their livelihoods.\n\n42. During the pandemic, we disbursed N5,000 to 1 million Nigerians using a Rapid Response Register and advanced N20,000 to 750,000 beneficiaries of the Conditional Cash Transfer Progamme and provided 1.37 million Nigerians with palliatives from CACOVID.\n\n43. At the same time the Federal Government released 109,000 metric tonnes of food reserve stocks and 70,000 metric tonnes of grains to the poor and vulnerable in all 36 states of the federation.\n\n44. In addition, Government reduced interest rates from 9% to 5% for struggling businesses and extended credit facilities to 548,345 beneficiaries.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n45. When this administration decided to change our Democracy Day from 29th May to June 12th in my first tenure, it was not only to honour the sacrifices of the men and women of our country who fought for the return to democracy but also to demonstrate our commitment to satisfy the aspirations of the people and creating an environment for democracy to be an accepted way of life.\n\n46. As your President, I remain committed to providing an enabling environment for a free, fair and credible electoral system under my tenure.\n\n47. However, you need to play your part by getting involved at any level you can supporting a democratic system that works for all and not for a section or a select few and demand accountability from your elected leaders.\n\n48. My commitment to bequeathing a sustainable democratic culture remains resolute, my pursuit of a fair society remains unshaken and my desire to see that Nigeria remains a country for each and every one of us has never been stronger.\n\n49. In responding to the challenges that this period imposes on us, Government also recognises the need to acknowledge notions of marginalisation and agitations for constitutional amendments among various segments of our population.\n\n50. While this government is not averse to constitutional reform as part of our nation building process, everyone must understand that the primary responsibility for constitutional amendments lies with the National Assembly.\n\n51. This body which, as I said, is the arm of government responsible for constitutional changes has concluded the preliminary stages of amending and improving our constitution in a way that the majority of Nigerians will be happy with.\n\n52. Government is, however, willing to play a critical role in the constitutional amendment process without usurping the powers of the National Assembly in this regard.\n\n53. As a nation we have come very far from where we started and we are getting incrementally closer to where we ought to be.\n\n54. Overcoming the present challenges is but one of a necessary process that we have to undergo as a nation so that we can come out stronger. The day I joined the Nigerian Army I was prepared to lay down my life for Nigeria.\n\n55. As your President I remain ever committed to upholding and defending Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\n56. In adhering to the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy notably section 14(2)(b) I shall do all within my power to ensure that the Security and welfare of the people remain the primary purpose of government.\n\n57. I have, throughout my tenure, provided the security agencies with all they require relative to available resources and will be providing more as the dynamics unfold to put an end to our security problems.\n\n58.

          "text": "The National Leader of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has said some Nigerians do not care about the country\u2019s path to democracy.\n\nThe former Lagos State governor said this in a statement he signed on Friday titled, \u2018June 12, 2021: Democracy Day Statement\u2019 \u2013 amid secessionist agitations from the South-East and South-West.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to stand against insurrectionists and killers destroying the country\u2019s democratic institutions.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cOn this memorable day, we mark, with respect, and honour the sacrifices that have allowed democracy to come to pass.\n\nWe also celebrate in anticipation of a future in which our democratic institutions, concepts and practices take firmer root; transforming this society from what it is to what it can be.\n\n\u201cThrough it all, our gaze has remained fixed as if it were focused on a star in the firmament. Our road has remained certain for it is the only road we can reasonably tread. We have moved toward a better Nigeria and greater democracy.\u201d\n\nHowever, the APC chieftain, who is rumoured to be eye tje 2023 presidency, decried that Nigeria\u2019s path to democracy had not been without peril.\n\n\u201cThey embark on a different trek for they hold to a different concept of governance and of the relationship of government to the people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey do not believe in a nation where every person therein has substantive rights, freedoms and liberties as God intended for all of his human creations regardless of the place of birth, ethnic origin, social station or religious creed.\n\nThese people hate democracy and despise you for choosing democracy over them and their oppressive ways.\n\n\u201cThey are violent and cold-hearted. They love nothing, save the destruction of the happiness and peace of others.

          "title": "June 12: Read MKO Abiola\u2019s Letter To Gani Fawehinmi Two Days Before He Was Murdered",
          "text": "Two days before the winner of the annulled June 12, 1993 election, MKO Abiola, was assassinated, he wrote a letter to a renowned constitutional lawyer, Chief Gani Fawehinmi.\n\nThe letter that was written on 05/07/98 and given to Lola Edewor & Bisi, Abiola\u2019s 3rd wife during their visit to Abiola was published by SaharaReporters.\n\nRead the letter below:\n\nMy Dear Gani,\n\nPraise be to God for your life and the courage, fortitude and determination with which He endowed you. May we live long to be of service to each other in the contribution we make to the development, peace and justice/fairplay in Nigeria and beyond. The \u201d Express \u201d story is a hoax.\n\nTrue, both Anan and Anyaoku (apparently working together, although I saw them separately), wanted me to sign a statement that I will not, once again, demand my mandate, once released. They both believed such undertaking would expedite my release. To each of them, my answers were:\n\n(1) Having been cut off from all both human and media contacts for 4 years, I was like a man put in an open grave, I quoted Rt. Hon. Harold Wilson\u2019s statement October, 1964, a few days before his first Labour victory in 13 years: \u201c24hrs is a long time in politics.\u201d\n\nIf 24hrs is a long time, 4years cut off from politics can be likened to eternity. Diplomats can guess: political leaders must be sure because credibility once lost can never be regained.\n\n(2) Both diplomats spoke of arranging my UNCONDITIONAL release. With the demand for that kind of statement that will render me a \u201cdeserter\u201d. Any release obtained on that basis would be the worst form of capitulation.\n\n(3) The declaration of 11/06/94 was made at a major public rally to thousands of cheering supporters. A statement under the table of AGUDA House purportedly negating it will not be acceptable as authentic.\n\nMy rejection will naturally read \u201cduress\u201d into it. Judged by the circumstances (therefore) it will not be worth the paper on which it was written. A declaration made publicly (at a major rally) and clear ( in the most unambiguous terms) at any similar rally.\n\nYou cannot render a man naked at the marketplace and prefer to dress him up in the bedroom!\n\n(4) That a declaration, like that of 11/06/94, once made and in great circulation, needs no repetition, which will be superfluous. Made when June 12 was suffering from a terminal illness \u2013 in-fact in a COMA \u2013 the June 11 shot-in-the-arm had over the years not only revived the patient (June 12) but has also established it firmly on its own base, such that its right to exist would today no longer be denied.\n\nIn this situation, I could well concentrate on my release, on revamping my health, attending to the wedding of 4 or 5 of my children, re-establish the cohesion of my family, whic has been almost totally eroded, especially after the brutal assassination of my Kudi whilst my leading supporters who have done wonders in my absence, take the full steps necessary for formal VICTORY by G d\u2019s grace. It is this point\n\n(5) that might have been twisted or misunderstood by Annan and /or the section of the press who got it wrong.\n\n(6) Finally, I reviewed the history of June 12. I told them that quite at the beginning, Obasanjo in July 1994 came to me with 26 traditional rulers to seek a similar statement.\n\nHe was told off in no uncertain terms in the presence of the retinue of traditional fathers, after I had explained that the issue is one of God Vs a few \u201cpowerful elements\u201d.\n\nThe voice of the people is the voice of God, \u201d Vox Populi Vox Dei\u201d, a popular maxim long before Jesus Christ arrived.\n\nI told them that IBB\u2019s only reason for cancelling the free, fair and peaceful poll \u2013 a fact he could not deny \u2013 was that his leading officers (who would have been retired with him) threatened to kill him and to kill me if he ever swore me in. I did not allow him to use the Koran to swear to \u201cblackmail\u201d\n\nIBB made the assertion to two Northern Emirs- mutual friends of the two of us and Chief Sonekan at a peace meeting called at the presidential wing of the ABUJA airport.\n\nI would not accept the cancellation on that ground or any ground hence my \u201d hijra\u201d of August 2 to mount a worldwide campaign, as the local press had then been silenced. I said that if I had accepted what was done, it would have created a most dangerous precedent, not only for Nigeria but most of the third world. The saying would then have been \u2013 \u201cwho are you to resist what could be forced on Abiola?\u201d.\n\nThe ultimate effect is that Nigeria would then become a land of \u201cguided democracy \u201c, of the type in the imagination of the late President Sukarno of Indonesia..ho used to issue \u201d voting directives\u201d to his nation of 230 million. God forbid bad thing!\n\nThe lapse of five years since the election of 12/06/93 was regarded as fatal to the mandate. Both diplomats told me nobody will recognise me on the basis of the out-of-date mandate. Chief Anyaoku went on further to say he had sought and obtained legal opinion which confirmed the \u201cdeath of the mandate\u201d.\n\nMy reply:\n\nFirstly, there\u2019s no statue of limitation on valid elections provided the winner did not willfully refuse to take office. The struggle in Sierra Leone more than three decades ago between Milton Margai and Siaka Stevens is a case in point. The Haiti issue re-Aristide is partially relevant.\n\nSecondly, if that were so, then, criminals would have had a lawful right to take advantage of the criminal situation they have created! That, in my opinion, is against equity and the rule of law and, therefore, invalid.\n\nThey illegally cancelled the election (which they had no power to do) and promoted their usurpation by putting in the most wicked incarceration ever known \u2013 4 years without exercise, access to the sun or even the corridor outside my room.\n\nThirdly, no nation ever solves her nagging political problems through legal opinion. The Bar of public opinion has a code of practice totally different to that of a formed point of law. I asked Chief Anyaoku what was his interest in seeking the so-called legal opinion?\n\nI got no answer because by that time the exchange had become eyeball to eyeball. He looked most embarrassed and dumbfounded. Annan must know that if the majority of OAU member nations gave me recognition, the UN must automatically do the same e.g. the Angola situation between MPLA and UNITA.\n\nREAD ALSO: Creative industry will continue to get attention of..\n\nThe call for the recognition in the London Times of last Friday has taken the wind out of the sail of the \u201cfive leg\u201d argument. There was no substance to it.\n\nMy final point is that although Time searches o destroys all things MATERIAL, a point made most convincingly by Shakespeare in his sonnets 5, 12 and 64, his emphasis on \u201cnever resting time\u201d and the Spencer in \u201cof time\n\nand the River\u201d where he stated that \u201cdark times remind us of and the briefness of our days\u201d. TRUTH, which is what June 12 is, is SPIRITUAL AL-HAQQU in Islam \u2013 one of the sacred names of God.\n\nTherefore, since all things in nature, life and creation are subservient to God(K2:116) willingly or unwillingly, TIME IS IN FACT AND INDEED ON THE SIDE OF TRUTH, K17:81, K34:49, K2:42 etc. and Gospel according to St. John 8:32, Psalm 62:1-2, Isaiah 40:30-31 etc.\n\nIt is falsehood, with its associated varieties and crookedness that must varnish as foam on the \u201d Torrent of time\u201d.\n\nThe FMG, probably did not want to meet me at this stage. Hence, the arrangement made for the two to meet me.\n\nThe very top meeting I had on Monday night with two of our service chiefs was to inform me about the death of General Abacha and my friend Ya\u2019adua and talk generally.\n\nThe atmosphere was most cordial and the service chiefs were most sympathetic. It enabled me to asses the quality and calibre of the two which are most high, indeed. I have gone St. John 8:32, Psalm 62:1-2, Isaiah 40:30-31 etc.\n\nIt is falsehood, with its associated varieties and crookedness that must varnish as foam on the \u201d Torrent of time\u201d\n\nThe FMG probably did not want to meet me at this stage.

The atmosphere was most cordial and the service chiefs were\n\nmost sympathetic. It enabled me to asses the quality and calibre of the two which are most high, indeed. I have gone into this minute detail because I heard you were upset when you read the exclusive report. You probably did not know me well enough! If I refused to listen to IBB, my personal friend of long standing, and ignored Abacha, will it be 2 international civil servants who would force my surrender?\n\nPlease, have more confidence than that in the future.\n\nAll my life I had worked for the result which God in His mercies, gave us on June 12, 1993. Quoting Jesus Christ (Luke 9) \u201cNo man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God\u201d. The spiritual consequence of any desertion of a sacred cause like June 12 is HELL, which God forbids.\n\nANOTHER DIFFERENT POINT on 13/1/95, Abacha sent Prince Ajibola to me to say he (Abacha) would not allow me to get any trial because he knew I had large sum of money pad to my recognition which will force him out of office. Ied Prince what he advised. He sad \u201d Patience\u201d Suru ni. I told him to tell my family and lawyers.\n\nWhen Ore Falomo saw me on 10/5/97, I sent him to you on that. Did you get the messages? Remember me to the family with best personal regards.",

Considering the potential for employment when completed, this will definitely reduce youth restiveness in the Niger Delta area and will also address the problem of illegal refining in the area,\u201d Kyari stated.\n\nIn his remarks, the Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Simbi Wabote stated that this milestone was as a result of strong interagency collaboration and public-private sector partnership. \u201cThe NCDMB will continue to drive such partnerships across the industry to bring development in Nigeria,\u201d he noted.\n\nEarlier, the Coordinator of the Project and Group General Manager, National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS), Mr. Bala Wunti stated that the project would enhance the economics of marine petroleum products distribution.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, for his drive and tenacity towards achieving the milestone recorded today, as well as the wonderful team in the Ministry that assisted in achieving this feat.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi earlier in his remarks expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari for summoning the courage to take the loan from China Exim bank to execute the rail project.\n\nHe also thanked the Chinese government for the loan with the hope that the Asian country will also approve the loan for the Ibadan to Kano axis which he said the Buhari led administration intends to start and complete before the end of its tenure.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that the Chinese government through the China Exim bank was able to give us the loan at a concessionary rate to construct from the seaport down to Ibadan.\n\n\u201c We hope that we get money to be able to construct from Ibadan -Kano so that we can complete the track and make sure that business takes place,\u201d he said\n\nThe Board Chairman, Nigerian Railway Commission NRC in his welcome address reiterated that the importance of the project cannot be over emphasized as it would be of great impact to the Nation\u2019s citizens and her economy.\n\nThanking President Buhari for his support in ensuring the project is a success, he stressed that the occasion is the third time of the President commissioning railway project completed during his tenure.\n\nHe equally thanked the Minister for being the chief pilot of the project in which the project wouldnt have been successful without his tenacity.\n\nDignitries at the event include Professor Wole Soyinka, Minsters of Info and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed , Works and Housing SAN Babatunde Fashola, Youth and Sports, Dr Sunday Dare, Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora, Minister of State for Transport, Sen Gbemisola Saraki, Perm Sec Dr. Magdalene Ajani.

The specific details of this accelerated strategy will be unveiled shortly.\n\n\u201cIn the last one year, Nigeria and the whole world faced COVID-19 for which no one was fully prepared.\n\n\u2018First in Africa\u2019\n\nThe plan to lift Nigerians out of poverty is demonstrated in the administration\u2019s National Social Investment programme.\n\nAccording to Buhari, the programme is \u201ca first in Africa and one of the largest in the world where over 32.6m beneficiaries are taking part.\n\n\u201cWe now have a National Social register of poor and vulnerable households, identified across 708 local government areas, 8,723 wards and 86,610 communities in the 36 States and the FCT.\n\n\u201cOur conditional cash transfer program has benefited over 1.6 million poor and vulnerable households comprising more than 8 million individuals. This provides a monthly stipend of N10,000 per household.\n\n\u201cI have also recently approved the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy Plan that augments existing plans to further reduce poverty in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs at the end of 2020, the Development Bank of Nigeria had disbursed 324 billion Naira in loans to more than 136,000 MSMEs, through 40 participating Financial Institutions.

Authorities said the umrah would be allowed to return to full capacity once the threat of the pandemic has abated.\n\nThe revered Black Stone in the Kaaba \u2014 which is customary but not mandatory to touch during the pilgrimage \u2014 remains out of reach.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Highest precautions\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cIn light of what the whole world is witnessing with the coronavirus pandemic\u2026 and the emergence of new variants, the relevant authorities have continued to monitor the global health situation,\u201d the hajj ministry said Saturday.\n\n\u201cConsidering the large crowds that perform hajj, spending long periods of time in multiple and specific places\u2026 required the highest levels of health precautions,\u201d it added in the statement carried by SPA.\n\nA scaled-down hajj represents a major loss of revenue for the kingdom, already reeling from the twin shocks of the virus-induced slowdown and a plunge in oil prices.\n\nThe hajj and the year-round umrah pilgrimages together rake in some $12 billion (10.3 billion euros) annually.\n\nLast year, the foreign press were barred from the hajj, usually a huge global media event.\n\nSaudi Arabia has so far recorded more than 460,000 coronavirus infections, including 7,536 deaths.\n\nThe health ministry says it has administered more than 15 million coronavirus vaccine doses, in a country with a population of over 34 million.\n\nHosting the hajj is a matter of prestige for Saudi rulers, for whom the custodianship of Islam\u2019s holiest sites is their most powerful source of political legitimacy.\n\nBut a series of deadly disasters over the years, including a 2015 stampede that killed up to 2,300 worshippers, has prompted criticism of the kingdom\u2019s management of the pilgrimage.\n\nAFP",

The specific details of this accelerated strategy will be unveiled shortly.\u201d\n\nAccording to the President, his administration has disbursed N5,000 to 1 million Nigerians using a rapid response register and advanced N20,000 to 750,000 beneficiaries of the conditional cash transfer programme and provided 1.37 million Nigerians with palliatives from the Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), a private sector-led organisation established to assist the government in combating COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cAt the same time the Federal Government released 109,000 metric tonnes of food reserve stocks and 70,000 metric tonnes of grains to the poor and vulnerable in all 36 states of the federation,\u201d Mr Buhari said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, Government reduced interest rates from 9% to 5% for struggling businesses and extended credit facilities to 548,345 beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
