          "title": "SERAP seeks voter registration deadline extension, threatens legal action",
          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to extend the voter registration deadline in line with the extension granted political parties for their primaries.\n\nThe extension of voter registration, the human rights organisation said, will give more time for eligible Nigerians to exercise their right to participation during the 2023 and subsequent elections.\n\nThe online voter pre-registration ends by May 30 2022 while the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration will end by 30 June 2022.\n\nHowever, in a letter dated 28 May 2022 and signed by SERAP Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, and contained in a statement on Sunday, the organisation said, \u201cvoters are also critical stakeholders in the electoral process. Treating all eligible Nigerian voters fairly would advance the people\u2019s right to vote and to participate in their own government.\n\n\u201cExtending the voter registration deadline would provide more time for eligible voters, including young people, the elderly, people living with disability, as well as those resident in states facing security challenges and living in IDP camps to participate in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for voter registration would be entirely consistent with constitutional and international standards, and the Electoral Act. Any such extension would also not impact negatively on the INEC\u2019s election calendar and activities.\n\n\u201cINEC mandates ought to be exercised in a fair, just and non-discriminatory manner. If voting is as important as the INEC always claims it is, now is the time to show that Nigerian voters will be treated equally and fairly. The future of Nigeria\u2019s democracy depends on it.\n\n\u201cINEC must not only be independent and impartial in the exercise of its constitutional and statutory responsibilities, but must also be seen to be independent and impartial.\n\n\u201cThe public perception of the independence and impartiality of INEC is essential for building public confidence in the electoral process, and ensuring the credibility and legitimacy of the 2023 elections. Where Nigerians have doubts about the independence and impartiality of INEC, they are more likely to have less confidence in the electoral process thereby undermining democracy.\n\n\u201cEnforcing unrealistic voter registration deadline while extending the deadline for party primaries would deny and abridge the constitutional and international human rights of eligible voters including to equal treatment and equal protection, and non-discrimination.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 48 hours of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel INEC to comply with our request in the public interest.\n\n\u201cThe recommended extension would also bolster voter confidence in the electoral process, and the ability of INEC to discharge its constitutional and statutory responsibilities independently and impartially.\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for voter registration would also be justified, given reports of challenges in the voter registration exercise, especially for young people, the elderly, persons living with disabilities, and those resident in states facing security challenges and living in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps.\n\n\u201cOne of the people\u2019s most sacred rights is the right to vote. The commission has a constitutional and statutory responsibility to ensure the effective exercise of the right of all eligible voters to participate in their own government.\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for party primaries without providing adequate time and opportunity for eligible voters to register and participate in the 2023 general elections would amount to an unfair and discriminatory treatment of Nigerian voters, and violate other human rights.\n\n\u201cThe will of the people is expressed through democratic elections. This requires that people should be afforded adequate time and opportunity to register to vote. Extending the voter registration deadline is crucial for promoting the independence and impartiality of INEC and building public confidence in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cSERAP therefore urges you and the commission to take immediate measures to encourage greater political participation by extending voter registration deadlines, and improving voters\u2019 education and engagement throughout the country. This would show the commitment of the commission to the principles of equal protection and non-discrimination.\n\n\u201cThe right of people to participate in their government is a fundamental feature of any democratic society, and any undue restriction of the right would strike at the heart of representative government.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Opa river is a major source of water for domestic use in Ile-Ife communities, Osun State, including the over 35,000 students and staff of Obafemi Awolowo University, located in the region.\n\nOur correspondent visited Afeki local community, Oke-Opa, in Ile-Ife, where gold mining was said to be taking place and where toxic substances were allegedly released into the water, flowing to the main Opa reservoir. Opa reservoir is the source of water for the OAU community.\n\nFrom ash-coloured looking small rivers, which, according to the residents, used to be clean; to remains of fallen cocoa, and palm trees, cassava, among others, as a result of excavation of farmlands belonging to residents, our correspondent saw that what used to be a natural vegetative area was fast turning into a worksite, where excavators, among other sophisticated machines, were actively in use.\n\nIssues of illegal mining across communities in Nigeria have been a major crux of agitations, as residents often complain of water pollution, land degradation, and little or no compensation to the host communities by the mining companies.\n\nSpeaking with some residents in the Afeki community, our correspondent gathered that mining of gold had recently begun in the community as farmlands were seen to have been recently displaced, water channel diverted, and deep excavations carved on most parts of the area.\n\nThe residents said they had not confirmed the name of the mining company, as the company representative was said to have been careful not to mention the name of the company when they came for a meeting with the locals. Meanwhile, speculations were that the company was owned by some Chinese.\n\nOne of the residents, Mr. Gideon Adeyeni, who said he was not sure if the miners were licensed or not, noted that their activity was largely unregulated, owing to the damage being done to the land, water, and people in terms of toxic substances the community was said to be exposed to.\n\nAccording to him, the issues surrounding the degradation and pollution of the Ogoni land in the Niger Delta started like this, adding that there was a need to begin to check such activities, especially at their early stage.\n\n\u201cThe colour of the water has changed, and the farmlands belonging to local farmers have been excavated. Chemicals being used are released into the water,\u201d Adeyeni had said.\n\nSome of the chemicals used in gold mining, by the research of our correspondent, include cyanide, sulfuric acid, and solvents for separating minerals from ore. Cyanide is among the most harmful substances on Earth and it is harmful to humans and most aquatic life even at low concentrations.\n\nAnother resident, identified simply as Mr. Olayiwola, said that mining activity in residential areas posed a lot of threats to humans, as \u201cissues like flooding, landslide and unnoticed pits resulting from excavation \u2013 that could be fallen into by unsuspecting locals, could occur.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything mining is toxic to human beings, for example, water poisoning could occur as a result of contaminated water finding its way into the wells from which people get consumable water,\u201d he said.\n\nThe residents also said they learnt the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, could be aware of the mining activity. According to one of them, when we approached them over their activity on an area designated for worship, one of them told us that even the \u2018Kabiyesi\u2019 (king) was aware of his presence there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnytime I visited the area and got close, their security personnel shouted at me to leave the scene, but they forgot that we were the first occupants of this place before they came for their mining,\u201d Adeyeni noted.\n\nHe maintained that they were asking for a regulated mining activity that would not threaten the survival of the locals, as he noted that he only learnt that the miners planned to compensate the community with electric poles.\n\nSome of the locals also called on relevant government authorities to see the situation.\n\nEfforts to reach the miners proved abortive for the security concerns of our correspondent and his acquaintances.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Abacha\n\nBy Miftaudeen Raji\n\nAs Nigerians brace up for the 2023 general elections, with various political parties holding their primaries, party tickets in the two major political parties were keenly contested.\n\nAlthough the primaries in a number of states were greeted with violence, horse trading, alleged manipulation, vote-buying, some politicians demonstrated a great deal of sportsmanship.\n\nWhile some political heavyweights got party tickets, some failed to secure their reelection bid, some aspirants bought nomination forms for two elective positions, as a backup plan.\n\nMeanwhile, quite a number of children of politicians secured their party tickets to test their popularity and chances in 2023 elections.\n\nAbacha, Lamido, el-Ruffin, Ajimobi\n\nOne of them is the son of late Sani Abacha, former Nigerian Head of State, Mohammed Abacha, won the Kano governorship ticket on the platform of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP, in Kano State.\n\nAbacha scored 736 votes, against his closest rival, Ja\u2019afar Sani-Bello, who scored 710 votes, to emerge as the winner.\n\nSimilarly, the son of former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido, Mustapha Lamido emerged the governorship candidate of the opposition PDP in the state.\n\nLamido defeated his opponent, Sale Shehu, a former Minister for Works by 829 to zero votes, to secure the governorship ticket of the PDP.\n\nIn Kaduna, the eldest son of Governor Nasir El-Rufai, Bello El-Rufai, won the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket for the House of Representatives in Kaduna North Federal Constituency.\n\nBello defeated a lawmaker representing Kaduna North Federal Constituency, Samaila Suleiman.\n\nIn Oyo State Idris Abiola-Ajimobi, son of late former Governor Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo, emerged as the All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate for Ibadan South-West II State Constituency.\n\nVanguard reports that his opponents at the primary had stepped down to pave way for Ajimobi as the party\u2019s flag bearer ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nIbori, Okowa, Fayose\n\nDaughter of former Governor James Ibori of Delta State, Erhiatake Ibori-Suenu also secured the PDP\u2019s for Ethiope Federal Constituency of Delta.\n\nIbori-Suenu had polled 46 votes to defeat her arch rival, Ben Igbakpa, who scored only 22 votes in a run-off primary election.\n\nIn Kano State, son of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, Umar Ganduje secured the APC ticket for House of Representatives, Dawakin Tofa, Rimin Gado and Tofa Federal Constituency.\n\nJunaidu Yakubu, an aspirant for the seat in the APC, had withdrawn from the contest, to pave the way for Ganduje\u2019s son.\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Okowa\u2019 daughter, Marilyn Okowa-Daramola, secured the PDP\u2019s ticket for Ika North East House of Assembly seat in Delta State.\n\nThe governor\u2019s daughter had returned unopposed in the primary election for the seat.\n\nIn Oyo, son of the late former Governor Otunba Adebayo Alao-Akala won the APC ticket for Ogbomoso North, South and Oriire Federal Constituency.\n\nOlamijuwonlo, a former chairman of Ogbomoso North local government area, had secured all the 150 votes to clinch the ticket of the APC.\n\nIn Ekiti, Joju Fayose, son of former Governor Ayodele Fayose, won the ticket for Ekiti Central Federal Constituency 1.\n\nJoju had scored 69 votes to defeat Deji Adeosun, who polled speak votes.\n\nElites would naturally circulate themselves, says UNILAG don\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on the development, a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Political Science, University of Lagos, UNILAG, Dr. Isiaka Adams, noted that there is no problem with children of politicians vying or taking elective positions, provided they are better qualified and not purposefully imposed on the people.\n\nAccording to him, elites would naturally circulate themselves in positions of authority, which determine allocation values and resources in the society.\n\nHe, however, said morally speaking it may be wrong, because there are people better qualified for the positions, but are denied by irregularities of electoral process and democratic procedures.\n\nAdams said, \u201cOrdinarily, we have seen that in the advanced democracies. In the US we\u2019ve had the Adams and the Bush families.\n\n\u201cEven in Pakistan and India, we\u2019ve had the Nero family and Gandhi family.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to deny children the opportunity to lead politically, but what is wrong or should be condemned is a situation whereby you manipulate it in such a way that you purposely install your children.\n\n\u201cWe have forgotten that we are not running a monarchy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut, if their children are qualified and it\u2019s the wish of the people, there\u2019s nothing bad in it,\u201d he added.\n\nAdams, however, said Nigerians need to interrogate the politicians installing their children to assess their score card while in government.",

All the political parties are courting me. Even the PDP needs to court me because they do not have a governorship candidate.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd by the Electoral Act, all of them who participated cannot participate in another party. You can now see the wisdom I did my letter and withdrew in line with the Electoral Act as a lawyer.\n\n\u201cThe conduct of the PDP is voided already. You only need the take steps for it to be voided. Forget the Supreme Court case on Bayelsa\u2019, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, former Chairman, Warri North local government area in the state, Chief Francis Maku, has congratulated the Delta state PDP governorship candidate for the 2023 polls, Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori; Delta South senatorial candidate, Mr. Micheal Diden, aka Ejele; House of Representatives candidate for Warri federal constituency candidate, Hon. Thomas Ereyitomi and Warri North House of Assembly candidate, Hon. Fred Martins, who emerged victorious in the just concluded PDP primaries in the state.\n\nMaku in a statement shortly after the primaries, said: \u201cThe leadership qualities of these candidates cannot be overstated because they are very consistent and committed party members with genuine contributions to the growth and development of the party over the years\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I urge all Deltans to vote and support the candidates of PDP in the 2023 general election, I also call on all the party flag bearers to build a more stronger friendship and extend hand of fellowship to all those who contested with them as a way of uniting the one bigger family in Africa, which the PDP stands for\u201d, he added.",

          "text": "By Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nSocio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has urged Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Professor Mahmood Yakubu to extend the deadline for voter registration to give more time for eligible Nigerians to exercise their right to participation the same way the electoral body has extended the deadline for party primaries.\n\nAgainst its earlier stance, the INEC last week suddenly extended the deadline for the conduct of primaries by political parties by six days, from June 3 to June 9.\n\nAlso, the online pre-registration ends by May 30 2022 while the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) ends by 30 June 2022.\n\nIn the letter dated May 28, 2022 and by SERAP Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cVoters are also critical stakeholders in the electoral process. Treating all eligible Nigerian voters fairly would advance the people\u2019s right to vote and to participate in their own government.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cExtending the voter registration deadline would provide more time for eligible voters, including young people, the elderly, people living with disability, as well as those resident in states facing security challenges and living in IDP camps to participate in the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cExtending the deadline for voter registration would be entirely consistent with constitutional and international standards, and the Electoral Act. Any such extension would also not impact negatively on the INEC\u2019s election calendar and activities.\n\n\u201cINEC mandates ought to be exercised in a fair, just and non-discriminatory manner. If voting is as important as the INEC always claims it is, now is the time to show that Nigerian voters will be treated equally and fairly. The future of Nigeria\u2019s democracy depends on it.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cThe INEC must not only be independent and impartial in the exercise of its constitutional and statutory responsibilities, but must also be seen to be independent and impartial.\n\n\u201cThe public perception of the independence and impartiality of INEC is essential for building public confidence in the electoral process, and ensuring the credibility and legitimacy of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 48 hours of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel INEC to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d",

We have been going to public schools to train them towards good menstrual hygiene.\n\n\u201cWe discovered that many girls are using rags for menstruation and this was so alarming that we have to say no to it. We discovered that even those students were not ashamed of it, because they don\u2019t know that sanitary pads exist. Today, we are taking the campaign to their mothers in the markets, to give them the pads to take home to their children.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know that it is harmful and it is bad. Quite a number of married couples have issue with infertility and when they went for tests, we discovered that those women have been carrying infections for years and these infections were traced to bad menstrual hygiene, more particularly those that used rags when they were young. We said that we must put an end to this and that is what we are doing.\n\n\u201cToday, we are taking our campaign to four major markets in Ibadan to educate mothers and give sanitary towels for free to them and their children.\n\n\u201cIt is alarming that girls don\u2019t see use of rags as a shameful thing. For instance, in a school of 300 of girls within menstruation age, you find out that 64 girls are still using rags in school, and this is quite harmful as they are prone to infection.\u201d",

Dominic Nyam, the former AGF complained primary didn\u2019t comply with the Electoral Act and APC guidelines.\n\nBut Benue APC Secretary, Hon James Ornguga, told The Nation the primary in Benue is valid and conducted in compliance with INEC and APC guidelines.\n\nOrnguga said APC gave INEC sufficient notice as to the mode of primary to adopt in the conduct of governorship primary and caution members to guide against acts that would drag the party unto unnecessary controversy.\n\nAondoakaa\u2019s petition reads: \u201cIt has become expedient and very urgent to call your attention to the governorship primary election of our great Party, the All Progressive Congress (APC), slated for today Thursday May 26, 2022 with regards to its conduct by the Benue State Chapter of the Party.\n\n\u201cMy principal, Chief Michael Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN is a governorship aspirant in the primary election.\n\nRead Also: 2023: Protests trail APC guber primaries as suspended priest wins in Benue\n\n\u201cWe wish to draw your attention to the fact that as at the moment, 7:00pm no election-related activity is going on.\n\n\u201cMy principal, as an aspirant has not been informed of the status of primary election which we have been duly informed is by indirect process\n\n\u201cEven as we visited the venue of the election, nothing was happening and only a few confused delegates were seen loitering around with no clear direction.\n\n\u201cAn inquiry from fellow governorship aspirants has only deepened the confusion as they are also at a loss as to what was really going on.\n\n\u201cSir, recall that we were notified of the decision of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of APC to conduct governorship election by indirect Primary (vide letters dated 23rd May, 2022 and 24th May, 2022) to the effect therefore, the delegates were elected between 16th-17th May, 2022 and were properly documented by the Benue State EXCO of the party; the list was forwarded to the party\u2019s headquarters and INEC.\n\n\u201cThe party has also made judicious efforts to comply with the relevant laws and regulations on the conduct of indirect primaries, including the Party\u2019s internal rules and directives.\n\n\u201cAs we expected that all is set for the conduct of the delegate primary to elect the governorship candidate of the Party for 2023 general elections, to the moment, the Benue State EXCo of the Party is yet to inform us of what is happening.\n\n\u201cAttempts to seek clarification from the NEC appointed Party\u2019s Election Committee led by Senator Khairat Abdulrazaq-Gwadabe has not yet yielded any result as the Committee saddled with the responsibility of conducting the Benue State Governorship Primaries Election could not be located.\n\n\u201cThe situation has given rise to several rumours and created undue tension within the ranks of the party.\n\n\u201cIt is rumoured that instead of the planned indirect primary based on delegate election, some elements of the Party claim that they are conducting Direct Primaries.\n\n\u201cIf this rumoured illegality is found to be true, it portends grave danger for our Party as it would have failed to give equal opportunity to aspirants including my principal to be voted for by members of our Party as envisaged under the indirect primary communicated to our principal.\n\n\u201cThis would also fail to comply with extant laws and regulations in the conduct of primaries with the rumoured scenario, our party risks not presenting a governorship candidate for the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cTo this effect therefore, it has become imperative for us to dissociate ourselves, including my principal/governorship aspirant Chief Michael K. Aondoakaa, SAN from this alleged kangaroo dance by the various actors of the Party in Benue State in clear violation of extant regulations guiding the conduct of this primary election.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, we are seeking your gracious and urgent intervention to guide the Party towards the proper conduct of the indirect primary to elect a governorship candidate for the 2023 general elections as issued by NEC of our Party in line with the relevant regulations to this effect.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we respectfully draw your attention to Regulation 8 of the INEC Guidelines on Conduct of Primary Elections as well as Section 84(a) & (13) of the Electoral Act. 2022, which states thus;\n\n\u201c84(4) A political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by any members of the party and shall adopt the procedure outlined \u2026\u201d Emphasis supplied.\n\n\u201c84(13) Where a political party fails to comply with the provision of the Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue\u2026\u201d",

Other contestants were former Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim; Akwa Ibom governor, Emmanuel Udom, former Ekiti State governor, Ayodele Fayose, publisher of Ovation Magazine, Dele Momodu, former President, Manufacturing Association of Nigeria (MAN), Sam Ohuabunwa; investment banker, Mohammed Charles Ugwu; Chikwendu Kalu and Tareila Diana.\n\nWike, who arrived at the venue of the convention at about 4:20 p.m, had proceeded to the part of the Velodrome, where the delegates were seated to greet them and as the Rivers governor moved round, the delegates leaped in jubilation, cheering him.\n\nSunday Sun observed that when he got to the area where the Rivers, Oyo, FCT, Ogun, Taraba and Benue delegates were seated, they gave him a standing ovation and broke into a song \u201cWike dey come o.\u201d\n\nShortly after the Rivers governor returned to his seat, Atiku, who had arrived much earlier, equally went round to greet the delegates, with his supporters cheering him with thunderous ovation.\n\nHe was followed almost immediately by Saraki, who also received loud ovation from his supporters in different stands.\n\nThe Bauchi governor, Bala Mohammed, who arrived much earlier was not found missing in the momentous occasion as he went round to greet the delegates, amid cheers from supporters.\n\nSunday Sun observed that the supporters of the various aspirants were in a frenzy as they tried to overwhelm one another in the cheering competition whenever their names were mentioned.\n\nThe Chairman of the Convention Planning Committee, David Mark, in his welcome address, said the convention was the first step in the PDP\u2019s quest to rescue the country.\n\nMark said: \u201cCountry men and women, history beckons on us today to rescue Nigeria. This congress is the first step towards the process.\n\n\u201cToday, our students are at home for over three months on account of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) strike because of failure of government to address issues affecting the education sector.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cFellow country men and women are today in captivity of kidnappers and our government looking overwhelmed and unable to rescue them.\n\n\u201cSadly, the APC government has mortgaged the future of Nigerians by ceaseless borrowings with nothing tangible to show. Nigeria is now the poverty capital of the world.\n\n\u201cThe intractable insecurity situation, rising unemployment, poverty, ineptitude and corruption, and above all the poor management of our diversity have become the hallmark of the APC administration. These have made living in Nigeria worthless.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s convention is beyond the ordinary, it is a call to salvage Nigeria from the brink.\n\n\u201cNigeria has had chequered socio-economic and political problems but never has it descended so low. The 2023 election is not a contest between the PDP and the other political parties; it will be a moment of historic decision of all Nigerians to right the wrongs of the misrule by the APC.\n\n\u201cFor Nigerians, it is a battle for survival. But thank God they have found solace and faith in the PDP as the vehicle to redeem the situation and give them a chance to live again.\n\n\u201cNo wonder, our logo the umbrella, is a veritable shade and shield for Nigerians and Nigeria as an entity.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore a call to patriotic national service, for all of us; delegates to make the wise decision which will ultimately save Nigeria. All our presidential aspirants are of proven integrity.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, while declaring the convention open, said the return of the opposition party to power will signify a new dawn for the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cso, the return of the PDP will be daybreak. Nigerians have broken up from the anesthesia of false promises. They have seen the limit of propaganda. And they want a return to development which PDP represents.\n\n\u201cOur focus is on 2023, but we see retaking both Osun and Ekiti in the July elections as our low-hanging fruits.\n\n\u201cThe electoral triumphs from there will sustain our momentum, boost the morale of party members and amplify our notice to the overwhelmed APC that PDP is coming.\u201d\n\nIn the speeches of the aspirants to the delegates, three major issues dominated their agenda for Nigeria particularly the need for security, unity of the country and infrastructural development.\n\nBefore actual voting started, what shocked many of those at the venue of the primaries was when the Sokoto State governor in an unprecedented manner came out to announce that he had stepped down for Atiku Abubakar.\n\nAccreditation and voting started by 8:50 p.m with a total of 767 accredited earlier in the day.\n\nMeanwhile, operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), stormed the venue of the PDP national convention.\n\nAt least nine EFCC officials wearing vests with the name of the anti-graft agency embossed on them were seen moving around the Velodrome of the MKO Abiola Stadium, venue of the event.\n\nThis is as there were unconfirmed reports of inducement of delegates by some of the aspirants at the presidential primary.\n\nIt was gathered that one of the leading aspirants from the South gave $20, 000 to each delegate while another from the North allegedly gave $15,000 to the delegates, with others allegedly wooing delegates with $10,000.\n\nThe EFCC officials, on arrival went round the delegates stand, before taking position at the entrance of the Velodrome, where they searched the bags of the party chieftains trying to enter the venue.\n\nAfter spending some time at the entrance to the convention venue, the officials of the anti-graft agency exited.\n\nOne of the presidential aspirants, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, had while announcing his withdrawal from the contest, alleged that the contest was monetized.\n\nHayatu-Deen said: \u201cI wish to reiterate that I did not join party politics and to contest for the presidency because of personal gains and inordinate ambition, but in order to serve our country.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore based on personal principles and with great humility that I have decided after wide consultations to withdraw from this contest which has been obscenely monetized.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, another aspirant, Dele Momodu, while addressing the convention, alluded to the alleged monitization of the presidential contest.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nChairman, Council of Elders, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, has assured Nigerians that Peter Obi\u2019s dumping of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Labour Party to pursue his presidential ambition will not in any way affect the chances of the Southeast to produce the next president of the country.\n\nAlso in this interview with our correspondent, he called for restructuring of the country before the expiration of the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari as the best thing that can ever happen to Nigeria. Excerpts:\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nDo you think Peter Obi\u2019s withdrawal from PDP will dim the chances of Ndigbo in producing the next president in 2023?\n\nPeter Obi is front runner, he is a good material, he is somebody judging from his past record, his character, humility is accepted by many people, we didn\u2019t see him losing, we thought that if he continues the way he was going that he would win and we are still fighting, however, what he has done has not dampened our resolve to win, we would fight like gallant soldiers, we would fight to the end, we\u2019re not going to surrender, we are going to continue to tell Nigerians that we Igbo are people who believe in justice, equity, we are people who believe one\u2019s words should be his bond, but unfortunately when the thing is in writing everywhere that the zoning is between North and South, people are still thinking of changing it , I think it doesn\u2019t tell good of Nigerians, I believe at this point we must sit back and think what best to do, let me tell you my greater concern, my greater concern is what happens after Buhari, everybody is blaming Buhari for what is happening today, I want to tell you that what is happening today is beyond Buhari, if you look at the countries in West Africa, they are suffering the same phenomenon even most of the world, this question of insurgency and Boko Haram and it\u2019s being compounded by social factor such as unemployment and poverty ,my concern is by May next year when we would hold election and a new president is sworn in ,what type of miracle is such president going to perform to change the situation. I\u2019ve been listening to the comment of these people (aspirants), I haven\u2019t been able to see any of them who has given a solution to what could help to solve the situation ,because whoever comes to power would work with the same Nigerian army and police, all over the world the Nigerian army is very highly rated and respected, the Nigerian army that is having problem with Boko Haram is the same army that stabilised Congo ,Tanzania, Sierra Leone and Liberia ,Nigerian army has played a major role in bringing peace and stability to many parts of the world ,now if these people could have the problem they are having, then it\u2019s a fundamental problem . I think what Buhari should do now is to take steps and make it easy, so that whoever succeeds him should be able to take charge from where he stopped. So, I think what these aspirants should be doing now is to be telling Buhari to take some certain steps and not just all about succeeding him ,immediate steps that can remedy the situation . It\u2019s clear to me that the structure of this country is faulty ,that\u2019s why people are talking of restructuring and I think the president and National Assembly should listen ,Nigerians cannot be foolish to be talking of restructuring ,people in South-south said they want restructuring, people in Southeast said they want restructuring, Southwest said they want it, even in the North , North-central, East, they said they want it ,I think we need to restructure now, we can\u2019t postpone it, ,if we continue postponing it, we may not have a country ,this insurgence have taken over many countries ,in a place, I heard they are taking over seven local governments, what type of a thing is this and we are all watching, going round for elections ,even when we want to elect a new president, what can he do,we must restructure now and the major thing to consider is security. The security apparatus of this country must be restructured , 200 million people, you cannot continue to control a police force centred at Abuja ,that is not possible,we must have local government police force ,we must have state police force ,this is the practice all over the world, I don\u2019t know why pwople are finding it difficult to accept the fact. When Lugard amalgamated the country, he did not consult the ethnic nationalities of Nigeria ,there are so many ethnic groups in this country, some of them are large and some of them are small, but they have their different culture and tradition ,to bring these kind of people together you must be able to agree on the terms of how to bring them together ,that was why it was difficult to agree on an independent constitution ,at a point they had to go to London for a constitutional conference ,these are some of the problems we had in the country that time ,we had constitution then which was good, but this was changed by the military. Nigerians have been telling our politicians that this constitution must be changed so that the various federating units can feel happy . When it is rotated among the six geo-political zones,the acrimony will reduce, when it comes to the turn of the Southeast, for example, they would know that it\u2019s their turn.\n\nConsidering the short time the president would be leaving office, do you think the restructuring you mentioned is achievable ?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nBreaking!!!

          "title": "Trial of Mubarak Bala: Tolerant Pluralism And Imperative Of Islamic Reformation In Northern Nigeria By Leo Igwe",
          "text": "The conviction of Nigerian Humanist, Mubarak Bala, after a judicial process marked by irregularities jolted the civilized world. People of conscience had hoped that human rights would prevail; that after some dark nights of denial and disappearance, some light would shine at the end of the tunnel untwisting extremist imaginaries that had viciously beclouded and gripped the minds of Islamic theocrats in the region. Incidentally, this hope was misplaced and terribly dashed. Mubarak Bala was handed down an outrageous sentence, short of the death penalty, that is unprecedented in the history of secular court trials in Nigeria. Following Bala`s sentencing, the darkness fiercely thickened culminating in the brutal murder of a Christian woman, Deborah Samuel, also accused of blasphemy in Sokoto, in Northern Nigeria.\n\nUnlike Ms Samuel, Bala has been a marked man since he renounced Islam in 2014. He defied a tradition which says that a person born into the Islamic religion, cannot renounce the faith. Bala left Islam, managed to escape from a mental hospital where he was sedated, and medicated at the instance of his family against apostasy and unbelief.\n\nBala has been on the watchlist of jihadists because of his exercise of freedom of religion and from religion, his assertion of freedom of expression posed a mortal threat to their power base. He became a pariah in Kano, where he was born. Kano is a city that is notorious for religious bloodletting and for attacking and extrajudicially killing alleged blasphemers.\n\nMubarak Bala, like Socrates of Athens, was accused of impiety and corruption of young Muslims because he was encouraging young Muslims to think, question and speak freely about Islam and its teachings. Bala became the rallying point for freethinking, rationalist, secularist, sceptical and atheist youths. But Islamists could not countenance this disruptive development, this sweeping wave of social awakening and enlightenment. They moved to stop, silence, resist and neutralize him and his cause. The Islamists hounded Bala out of Kano, where the parents lived. They could not allow him to physically meet with people of like mind. They monitored and censored his posts on social media, to ensure that his comments did not violate their faith sensibilities.\n\n\n\nBut even for the most commonsensical posts, Bala was accused and abused. Bala was maligned. Bala was indicted for offending the religious sentiments of Muslims. He was threatened and harassed online and offline by Islamists including Muslim state police and army officers.\n\nOn April 28 2020, the police arrested Mubarak Bala in Kaduna following a petition by some Islamist lawyers. They complained that he made posts on Facebook that insulted the prophet of Islam. In the petition, the lawyers enjoined the police to prosecute Bala to avoid a breakdown of law and order in the region. The petition was a covert warning to the police that if they did not arrest Bala, he would suffer the same fate as Deborah Samuel, and a Christian pastor, Shuaibu Yohana, who was murdered for blasphemy in September 2021. The police took Bala to Kano where the petition was lodged. They disappeared from him for several months. During this period they denied him access to his family members and lawyers. In April this year, a Muslim judge, in an attempt to placate Islamists convicted Bala. No Muslim leader condemned the sham trial and sentencing of Bala. The Muslim community largely saw Bala's conviction as a well-deserved punishment, as justice served, not justice denied.\n\nLook, the sentencing of Mubarak Bala shames us all, Muslims and non-Muslims alike. It is an indictment of our collective conscience and casts a huge shadow over the quest for African renaissance and enlightenment. African enlightenment cannot be realized if Africans cannot freely question ideas or criticize religious claims without fear of being attacked, killed or imprisoned. The conviction of Bala underscores the urgency of an Islamic reformation and intellectual awakening of Muslim youths from their religious slumber. It confirms the widespread notion that Islam, as practised in Northern Nigeria, is intolerant, and thrives on coercion and intimidation. The religion of Islam does not stand for peace as many Muslims claim because the imprisonment of Mubarak Bala for making Facebook posts that were critical of the prophet of Islam and other horrific treatment of alleged blasphemers constitute acts of war against non-Muslims. In Northern Nigeria, Muslims have prosecuted violent campaigns against Christians and Muslims who belong to other traditions. They kill and are ready to murder anyone who is believed to have insulted their prophet and religion. If by any stretch of religious imagination, peace applies to Islam as practised in northern Nigeria, it is peace in a graveyard of lives, rights and liberties of Muslim minorities as well as non-Muslims. And this situation must change.\n\nMuslims must realize that it is in the interest of their religion and the Ummah to shun extremism and tolerate supposed blasphemous statements wherever they are in the majority because Muslims could easily be accused, attacked or indicted for blasphemy in places where they are in the minority. Muslims should know that a person`s religious sense is another`s religious nonsense; that Muhammad is only a prophet for Muslims, and a prophet of Islam, not other religions. Muslims should not expect people who profess other religions and beliefs to respect and revere Prophet Muhammad. There are millions of Nigerians who do not recognize Muhammad as a prophet or as a messenger from God. In many places across Nigeria and the world, Muslims are in the minority and Islam is a fringe faith.\n\nIn such places, Muslims could be accused of blasphemy for reciting the Shahada, which is a fundamental article of faith in Islam. In non-muslim societies, the Shahada is seen as insulting, provocative and disparaging of other gods and prophets. And if non-Muslims tolerate this article of faith that disparages their faiths and beliefs, why shouldn't Muslims tolerate views and expressions of non-Muslims that are critical or supposedly disparaging of the Islamic faith or prophet?\n\nWith the way Muslims react to supposed blasphemies, Christians could accuse Muslims of blasphemy for declaring that God (Allah) has no son and that Jesus is not the son of God but the son of a wo/man. If Muslims want to be tolerated when they disparage Christianity, the Christian son of God and other deities, they should learn to tolerate those who hold views that supposedly insult Islam including those that defame the prophet or desecrate the Quran. Muslims should learn to live in harmony with non-Muslims or non-believers who regard Muhammad as a non-prophet, a terrorist, a paedophile, rapist, war criminal or a con artist. After all, those who hold these views are infidels according to the teachings of Islam and these notions are consistent with their state of unbelief.\n\nSo the way that Islam is practised in Northern Nigeria must change as vividly demonstrated in the trial and sentencing of Mubarak Bala and other reactions to blasphemy allegations in the region. The mainstay of Islam in Northern Nigeria has become radicalism, intolerance and bigotry. The Islamic religion is practised in a way that young Muslims who value their religion more than human life have become the face of the religion in the region. And this is unfortunate. Islam in Northern Nigeria needs to be reformed and transformed. Muslims need to embrace mainstream tolerant pluralism and humanity.\n\nOtherwise, there would be no peace in the country.\n\n",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

Starlink which currently operates in 36 countries has over 400,000 subscribers around the world.\n\n\u201cThe company received two licenses, which include the International Gateway license and Internet Service Provider (ISP) license, and will be trading as Starlink Internet Services Nigeria Ltd. According to NCC, the International Gateway license has a 10-year tenure while the ISP license is to last for five years. Both licenses take effect from May 2022 and may be renewed after the expiration,\u201d per Nairametrics.\n\nStarlink approved by Nigeria \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec & Mozambique \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddffhttps://t.co/Q1VvqVmJ2i \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 27, 2022\n\nStarlink is a low latency broadband internet system created to meet the needs of consumers in rural areas with low internet penetration across the globe. In simpler terms, it delivers super-fast internet via satellites to rural areas. It is theoretically capable of delivering 150Mbps internet speeds to any place on the planet. All the customer needs is a clear view of the sky.\n\nStarlink enters a Nigerian Internet service provider space that is dominated by telcos like MTN and Airtel, as well as individual ISPs such as Spectranet, SMILE and others.\n\nCompared to existing similar internet plans in Nigeria which cost an average of $50, Starlink is a more expensive option costing $599 (~\u20a6330,000) for a full kit, including a terminal, mounting tripod, and Wi-Fi router, then a $110 (~\u20a660,500) for preorder and monthly subscription. Its premium service costs about $2,500 (~\u20a61.375 million) for the full kit and $500 (~\u20a6275,000) monthly.\n\nThis price range is deemed expensive for the average Nigerian, except it introduces a different offering for the Nigerian Market.\n\nShare this article",

It\u2019s also the ideal time to bill that tech bro or sis.\n\nThis type of weekend only occurs once a month. If you miss it this month, you\u2019ll have to wait until the next. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to wait. Just kidding. No, I\u2019m not .\n\nBy the way, today is Children\u2019s Day in Nigeria. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity to fulfil that promise to take them out or buy that ice cream. \ud83d\ude09 I mean, make a child happy today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis weekend, I\u2019m also following my advice and billing you. Just kidding. I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do this weekend, but I know it will be fun.\n\nEnjoy your weekend however you can. You know I\u2019m always concerned with your overall health and wellbeing. Take care of yourself during this short break!!!\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to talk about two stories:\n\nJumia\u2019s partnership with CGAP\n\nProducts for people with disabilities\n\nJumia\u2019s partnership with CGAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt goes without saying that Jumia is one of the dominant players in the African eCommerce market. In Nigeria, the company made $33 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2021, with a $14.6 million increase in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nAlso, the Central Bank of Nigeria recently granted it a Payment Service Solution Provider (PSSP) licence.\n\nThe licence will enable it to process payments for Nigerian third-party businesses. This development pits it directly against Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita.\n\nIt also provides an additional revenue stream when the company desperately needs to increase revenue.\n\nInterestingly, the company is testing a healthtech play through a partnership with the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis collaboration will provide users with access to doctors for a $1 monthly subscription fee.\n\nWell, Chimgozirim thinks it\u2019s a fantastic move that will allow Jumia to leverage its existing customer base and infrastructure.\n\nI do not think we have enough doctors in this country, though.

          "title": "Dear healthtech startups, Jumia is coming for your bread!",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, May 17, 2022, Nigerian eCommerce giant, Jumia released its financial report for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nCo-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec shared that orders, revenue, and gross merchandise value (GMV) saw significant growth compared to the last nine quarters. Comparing Q1 2021 with Q1 2022, orders grew from 6.6 million to 9.3 million, GMV grew from $198.9 million to $252.7 million, while revenue went from $33 million to $47.6 million.\n\nEven with this growth, it\u2019s not all rosy for the company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss was $53 million. On a call with TechCrunch, Poignonnec shared that the company plans to keep EBITDA loss below the $70 million it recorded in Q1 2021.\n\nNow to some good and potentially exciting developments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJumiaPay, its fintech product, has secured a payment service solution provider (PSSP) licence, which will allow it to process payments for third-party businesses in Nigeria. This development puts it in direct competition with Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita. It also provides another revenue stream when it desperately needs to increase revenues.\n\nPSSPs usually make their money by charging a transaction fee for every transaction they facilitate, and these fees often vary depending on the transaction\u2019s value. Per the report, 34% of orders placed on Jumia were completed using JumiaPay, and with its licence, JumiaPay\u2019s numbers could significantly increase in the coming quarters.\n\nHealthcare at the drop of a hat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: AMISOM via Iwaria\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the developments shared in the report is Jumia\u2019s decision to venture into the healthcare space. Via a partnership with Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, the company is testing a service that will allow users to access doctors with a monthly subscription of $1.\n\nViewed in isolation, this is a great move that could see Jumia tap into its existing customer base and infrastructure. It also represents a more formidable competitor for existing healthcare startups.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 1 doctor per 600 people in a country, but Nigeria has 1 doctor for 5,000 people. Furthermore, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria, while the healthtech industry in Africa is projected to be worth $259 billion by 2030.\n\nAlthough little detail was provided about the move, its foray into an area that is notoriously difficult in Africa and is not remotely related to its core business warrants some questions.\n\nExisting telehealth startups in the country include CribMD, iWello, and WellaHealth. As private companies, their records are often not in the public domain, but in a 2021 interview with Techpoint Africa, iWello reported that it had 140 clients, with CribMD reportedly serving 2,800 patients as of 2021. WellaHealth\u2019s CEO also shared that the company hit 10,000 unique users in 2017, with thousands on its waitlist.\n\nThese companies are significantly less funded than Jumia, with Africa\u2019s healthcare sector raising $392 million in 2021. However, these companies have to combat low Internet penetration, dwindling household incomes, and cultural norms to get paying customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, Jumia has no expertise operating in the healthcare sector and would likely have to go through a learning curve for this venture to succeed. Even with the option of hiring experienced professionals, things will probably not go their way immediately.\n\nThe fragmented nature of the healthcare space is another challenge that existing players face. For example, there are only a handful of hospitals with digitised records and even fewer still that share this information. This makes it imperative that healthtech startups build solutions for this purpose.\n\nBuilding partnerships for effective healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these could pose challenges to Jumia\u2019s healthtech plans, Yomi Kazeem, Senior Consultant, Salient Advisory, believes that Jumia has what it takes to succeed, especially if it goes the partnership route.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he said, \u201cJumia can potentially build out its healthtech play through more partnerships to facilitate diagnostics. It can also partner with pharmacies, leverage its logistics network, and pair medication delivery with its telemedicine service, so patients are not only speaking to doctors remotely but also receiving needed medication seamlessly.\n\n\u201cThis approach is important because, ultimately, providing access to consultations is only one part of healthcare. With more of these companies emerging, user acquisition becomes more competitive. In essence, third-party partnerships that facilitate access to patients on a larger scale are vital.\u201d\n\nUnlike existing healthtech players, Jumia has an established logistics service that could help it deliver medications faster than startups that have to depend on third-party providers. While this means Jumia could potentially cut into their market, it also presents an opportunity to expand healthtech services in the country while unlocking one more revenue stream for Jumia.\n\nHealthtech startups, for example, can provide faster and more efficient services by partnering with Jumia. Such partnerships could also expose them to Jumia\u2019s considerably larger customer base.\n\nAn example of such a partnership is Airtel Kenya\u2019s partnership with MyDawa, an online pharmacy in Kenya that allows Airtel\u2019s customers log into the MyDawa website without incurring data costs while MyDawa provides an option to pay for products with Airtel Money.\n\nDespite being boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, healthtech startups are still a long way from meeting Africa\u2019s healthcare needs. However, partnerships such as this could be key going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOl\u00e1,\n\nYou\u2019ve missed out if you haven\u2019t been listening to the Techpoint Africa Podcast, dear reader! Ask around and tell me what other people are saying.\n\nToday\u2019s episode is a lot of fun to listen to! The editorial team made me laugh; Bolu\u2019s story was one of the stories that drew me in.\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? The Central African Republic announced plans to launch SANGO, a bitcoin investment hub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis follows a warning from the Banking Commission of Central Africa (COBAC) prohibiting banks in the region from collaborating with digital payment platforms. Why? The CAR adopted bitcoin as a reference currency.\n\nAlso, a Nigerian, Chidi Nwaubani, launched the \u201cLooty\u201d project to reclaim African artefacts stolen by European colonists.\n\nThe project will create 3D images of these artefacts, sell them as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and use the proceeds to support young African artists.\n\nPlease listen to the podcast to hear these gists in particular. Bolu spoke last, so you\u2019ll have to listen till the end.\n\nYou can find today\u2019s episode here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow Traction wants to stop fake alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7m seed\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\nTraction wants to stop fake alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction Founders: Dolapo Adejuyigbe and Mayowa Alli (L-R)\n\nOn Monday, I had to use a PoS kiosk because I had problems with one of my banks. Currently, I have two active accounts, but only one has an ATM card.\n\nThat was intentional. I had no idea the other ATM card would come in handy. I have, however, learnt my lesson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, at the kiosk where I was supposed to transfer money to get cash, I asked if they accept mobile transfers, and the attendant took a long look at me before responding reluctantly in the affirmative.\n\nWith her response, I knew they don\u2019t accept mobile transfers. But, because I am someone she knows, she reluctantly agreed.\n\nOf course, the attendant isn\u2019t the only one who has reservations about accepting mobile transfers. In fact, there are small business owners in my neighbourhood who refuse to accept mobile transfers.\n\nSo, before I went there, I mumbled some incantations because I had no money. \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude39 I\u2019m kidding. But that money was urgently needed, though.\n\nAlthough the transfer was successful, she did not give me my money until she saw and confirmed the alert. I was slightly vexed, but I understood why.\n\nReceiving fake alerts isn\u2019t new for merchants in my neighbourhood, so they\u2019d rather you give them cash for every item you buy over making a mobile transfer.\n\nI waited about 15 minutes before she gave me my money. Fear of fake alerts cost me 15 minutes of my time! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22 I\u2019m not crying, but I believe this is a problem.\n\nI\u2019m sure you know someone or have heard of someone who has been a victim of receiving fake alerts. Consider a merchant receiving fake alerts for every item they sell or service they render. That\u2019s cruel, in my opinion.\n\nHowever, there appears to be a solution. What is it? Traction! The Nigeria-based fintech startup believes its proprietary solution can solve this problem.\n\nHow? It has a unique feature that allows merchants to confirm that every alert is real. Isn\u2019t this interesting?\n\nBusiness owners can use the app to accept payments, generate invoices, manage inventory, and track payments. It also enables merchant employees to confirm payments without calling their boss. Aren\u2019t you curious now?\n\nIf you are, please read Ogheneruemu\u2019s story to learn more about the startup: Traction is building an ecosystem for Nigerian small businesses, starting with stopping fake credit alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R, Pascal Ntsama, Canza Finance CEO and Co-Founder and Oyedeji Oluwole, Canza Finance CTO and Co-Founder.\n\nWith the volatility of cryptocurrency, I won\u2019t even look at you twice if you ask me to buy, not to think of launching a crypto business with you.\n\nIt\u2019s simply too risky, if you ask me. It\u2019s high today, low tomorrow; please don\u2019t give me a heart attack. \ud83d\ude0f\n\nThis reminds me of something that happened last Monday. Please accept my apologies if you are a crypto trader or investor. But, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing when the guy next to me on the bus was glued to his screen, checking his crypto app. \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude02\n\nSincerely, this guy didn\u2019t even close the app for a second. He was just staring. His expression was sad. That could be due to the drop in cryptocurrency that week.\n\nToday\u2019s story, on the other hand, features two Co-founders, Pascal Ntsama and Oyedeji Oluwoye, who began working together after Oluwoye advised Ntsama to buy cryptocurrency. That was bold, if you ask me.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t convinced initially, but after seeing Oluwoye\u2019s success with cryptocurrency two years later, he agreed.\n\nThat\u2019s when the pair realised there was more to cryptocurrency than just trading. They established Coincentrix in 2017 and received a grant from the Zcash Foundation in 2018.\n\nThen, in 2019, they launched Canza Finance, a crypto neobank that connects African businesses to the global economy.\n\nIn other words, the startup makes cryptocurrency transactions easier. It also allows for payments and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions within the country. Besides, it intends to include treasury management in its suite of services.\n\nChimgozirin described the startup\u2019s journey in detail here: Canza Finance is a neobank enabling decentralised cross-border payments for Africans\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to mental health, there is a common misconception that only people suffering from mental disorders see therapists. This is because some of us mistake mental health for a mental illness, which it is not.\n\nMental health is more than just the absence of a mental disorder. It includes how you think, feel, and act.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re having trouble thinking clearly, stressed, or feeling depressed, it can affect your productivity at school, work, or at home, indicating poor mental health.\n\nConsequently, it would help if you spoke with a trusted person who can keep your information confidential while also providing a safe space to express your emotions and possibly offer advice. You can also talk with someone who is trained in counselling or psychiatry.\n\nMoreover, due to the stigma surrounding mental health, most people are afraid of physically going to a centre to see a therapist or psychiatrist\n\nIn Egypt, Fadi Doss, Founder and CEO of Esaal, launched a platform that connects users to experts, allowing them to receive personalised and genuine answers to health concerns straightforwardly and smoothly.\n\nAnd yesterday, Esaal \u2014 an online health and wellness consultation platform \u2014 announced a $1.7 million seed round, led by Egypt-based A15.\n\nEsaal claims that it has over 350 consultants. Also, the company offers consultations on a wide range of topics, like anxiety, physiotherapy, paediatrics, and nutrition.\n\nUsers use an app to access these services via texting, video/voice calls, and in-person visits. They can pay with cash, credit cards, Vodafone, and Fawry.\n\nPer the CEO, the services are available in seven other countries across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries: Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Palestine, and Iraq.\n\nThe funding will be used to expand across MENA, invest in product and brand development, and hire more people. Between 2021 and 2025, Esaal anticipates a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50-60%.\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce retail platform, JABU, announced a $15 million Series A round yesterday, Wednesday,May 25, 2022.\n\nThe round was led by Tiger Global and saw participation from Box Group, Knollwood, D Global Ventures, Afore Capital, Oldslip and FJ Labs.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nWhat\u2019s new? Akinin stated that JABU intends to build around its Jwallet, a wallet system that is currently available as a standalone product. It enables Southern African merchants to use their physical flows to provide cash withdrawal and deposit services to their customers.\n\nIs this similar? Yes. It\u2019s identical to agency banking, a branchless banking system in Nigeria and West Africa where human agents serve as ATMs to provide financial services in outlying areas. And in Morocco, Chari provides a similar service.\n\nJABU will use the Series A funding to expand its presence in Southern Africa and enter new markets like Botswana and Eswatini later this year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills.

Apply to AltSchool Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect avenue. Within 12 months, you would have learnt a highly sought-after tech skill and obtained a top-rated diploma. The knowledge and experience gathered during the program adequately prepare you for your first tech job.\n\nReady to begin that journey? Get started HERE.\n\nYou\u2019re reading this for one of two reasons:\n\n1. You\u2019ve made the decision to switch careers and you have your eyes set on the tech space. You\u2019re now on the lookout for key pointers on how to start.\n\n2. You\u2019re yet to decide on transitioning though you\u2019ve been giving it a lot of thought. You however seek more information in the hope that you get all the clarity and green light you need.\n\nA third possibility could be that you know someone who is at that phase of their life\u2014yearning for a career change and real opportunities for growth. This piece answers some of your questions about pursuing a career in tech and how to transition.\n\nBefore we dive in, what is your \u201cWhy\u201d?\n\nThe tech space undoubtedly holds a myriad of opportunities for skilled talent worldwide. Global ecosystems continue to witness exponential growth. In Africa, solution-driven startups keep springing up & raising rounds to help drive growth and expansion.\n\nTech news platforms are often inundated with announcements of funds raised by startups which sometimes run into several millions of dollars. More jobs are getting created. Top tech talents are being enticed with juicy compensation packages and then poached. Junior employees are now taking up more responsibility and securing promotions. It\u2019s Career Christmas!\n\nHowever, it\u2019s quite easy to get distracted by this zeitgeist. Away from the exciting announcements and fascinating Twitter conversations, the growth and successes of these tech ecosystems are powered by the blood and sweat of deeply passionate and hardworking people who put in their absolute best to make things work.\n\nIn other words, working in tech is not a walk in the park. Your \u201cwhy\u201d mustn\u2019t be influenced by the current ecosystem zeitgeist, but by a genuine readiness to learn, contribute and grow.\n\nYou also must define what you want to do going forward. Are you looking for core tech/code roles (e.g Software Engineering) or no-code roles like Product Design, Product Management, Product Marketing, Technical Writing, Customer Success, Recruitment etc,?\n\nHave you looked into what it takes to be successful in this new path and are you ready to give what it takes?\n\nAnswer these questions as truthfully as you can. Don\u2019t worry if you fear your answers aren\u2019t convincing enough at the moment. You can always look up more information on these roles to guide your final decision.\n\nWith that said, here are 5 Proven Tips to Help You Transition Into Tech:\n\n1. What transferable skills do you have?\n\nA sizeable number of people that transition to tech do so by leveraging their previously acquired skills\u2014though these skills are mostly no-code or non-technical. For instance, a Customer Service Representative at a local bank could easily transition to a similar role at a FinTech startup. A journalist or creative writer could try out technical writing and pick up really fast. Human Resource Managers/Recruiters in conventional companies would easily settle in as technical recruiters after a few months of training. The list goes on.\n\nWhat you should do is identify the skills you already possess and see what roles those could get you in tech. If you have your eyes set on an entirely different role (one that doesn\u2019t align with your current skills), check out the skills required for that role and how to go about acquiring them. Then go for it.\n\n2. Search for opportunities in industries where you have prior experience\n\nThis is in many ways similar to what we discussed above\u2014about seeking opportunities in tech where your previously acquired skills are a match. Say you\u2019re a Risk & Compliance Officer at a local bank; you can work the same job at a FinTech startup. A seasoned chartered accountant can head the Accounts & Finance unit at a tech startup. Medical doctors could, for instance, work as consultants at HealthTech startups offering home services. Product Managers can easily function across numerous industries. Conventional journalists and content creators could niche down and focus on reporting/producing content on tech and so on.\n\n3. Take courses & write a certification exam\n\nOne of the sure-fire ways to transition to tech is to learn the skill(s) required to function in specific areas of interest. A great way to achieve this is by taking online courses, registering for and joining boot camps and writing certification exams. Thanks to the internet, there now seems to be unlimited access to information allowing us to learn on our own.\n\nThe democratization of the internet has also brought about a rise in the number of digital platforms that help people acquire knowledge and learn new skills. Within a few months, you can go from being a complete outsider to becoming an entry-level professional, anywhere in the world.\n\nThis is where AltSchool Africa comes in. At AltSchool Africa, you can learn some of the world\u2019s most sought after tech skills and earn a top-rated diploma within 12 months. The school runs a number of coding and no-code learning programs that are stand-alone specialisations under its School of Engineering and School of Product respectively.\n\nFor instance, when you apply to the School of Engineering, you will have to select a specific area of specialisation among the following:\n\nFrontend Engineering Backend Engineering & Cloud Engineering\n\nHowever, for the no-code School of Product, you can choose to learn either Product Design, Product Management or Product Marketing.\n\nIs it possible to land a job in tech by just taking courses without certification? Yes. However, earning a certification badge from an institute of repute certainly opens more doors and gets you in much bigger rooms.\n\n4. Be on the lookout for Internships\n\nMany careers that began as internships have blossomed into highly successful vocations. Some of the most revered, most admired professionals today, started out as interns and managed to build their careers into the success we currently know them to be.\n\nInternships offer great learning opportunities and direct pathways to getting your first job in tech. Not only do you get the opportunity to learn directly from much more experienced professionals\u2013you could also be on your way to getting your first offer of employment. This, of course, is dependent on how well you perform during the period.\n\n5. Network. Network. Network\n\nThe opportunities you seek aren\u2019t coming to pay you a visit in the comfort of your home. You have to get out there and grab them. Your social capital will, to a large extent, influence your career trajectory.\n\nWho do you know? Who do they know? What do they know? What do they do?\n\nUnderstanding the power of networking and actively making time to build connections will help you grow personally and professionally. So, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll do:\n\nIf your LinkedIn has been inactive, it\u2019s time to power it up: That is a good place to start. Find people doing great work in your preferred field and connect with them. Genuinely engage them in conversations and keep an open mind during these discussions.\n\nYou could also look up startup founders and hiring managers in companies you have an interest in: Try to connect with them and send a properly worded message. Briefly introduce yourself and why you\u2019re reaching out. Remember to be courteous.\n\nAttend tech events: These events are the perfect place to network as attendance is primarily physical. You can walk up to stakeholders, politely introduce yourself and tell your story. If you\u2019ve completed all the necessary training and are now in search of a job, that would be a perfect place to pitch to startup founders and execs too.\n\nYou should also consider volunteering: A good number of startups are in the business of building communities and organizing events. Due to the workload which sometimes could get overwhelming, these startups seek to onboard volunteers to help out on a project temporarily. In some cases, volunteers are paid a stipend for the work they do. In reverse scenarios, they aren\u2019t. However, monetary benefits shouldn\u2019t be your primary concern here. Your focus must be on learning as much as you can, gaining insights into the workings of the space, identifying key players and expanding your social circle.\n\nVolunteering, when done right, puts your name on the lips of persons that have the capacity to get you your next job.\n\nJoin Tech Communities: As the ecosystem grows, stakeholders are beginning to appreciate the power of community; the need to bring key players and intelligent outsiders together to look inwards and map out strategies for continued growth.\n\nOne of the strategies designed to ensure said growth is the creation of smaller groups or communities dedicated to knowledge sharing, resource sharing, mentorship and access to opportunities. The primary targets of these communities are entry-level & intermediate professionals who are then guided by more experienced tech talent. Members of these communities often have a shared sense of responsibility to help each other grow.\n\nThere are communities for everyone. So, whether you\u2019re a Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Manager or Technical Writer, there is a place for you.\n\nOn a final note:\n\nIt is very much possible to transition into tech within one year. As a matter of fact, some have managed to make the switch in just a few months. Bear in mind that if you must transition and do it fast, you will have to simultaneously employ more than one of the methods mentioned above. For example, you could have direct, transferable skills but you may have to network and volunteer to access even bigger and better opportunities.\n\nThese methods also aren\u2019t set in stone. You could come up with other creative, honest ways to move several steps further and get to work.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s circle back to where we began:\n\nA quick guide on How to Transition into Tech in 1 Year?\n\nApply to AltSchool Africa\n\nApplications to the School of Product are currently open.\n\nReady to begin that journey?

          "title": "How Atiku emerged victorious",
          "text": "Atiku Abubakar, a former vice-president, has emerged the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate for the 2023 general election, amid horse trading and strong determination to wrest power from the incumbent All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe desperation by the party to win informed its decision to take some drastic measures, chief of which is the zoning arrangement that is also enshrined in its constitution.\n\nAtiku was declared victorious after a keenly contested primary held at MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja, Saturday.\n\nAbout 767 delegates elected from across the country voted in the presidential primary.\n\nThe chairman of the Convention Organising Committee, David Mark, announced the result of the election Saturday night/early morning Sunday, which saw Atiku, defeating 12 other aspirants to pick the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nIn the result, Atiku scored 371 votes to defeat his closest rival, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, who polled 237 votes.\n\nFormer Senate president, Bukola Saraki scored 70 votes; governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel scored 38 votes; Anyim Pius Anyim, former Senate president, scored 14 votes; Bala Mohammed \u2013 20; Sam Ohabunwa \u2013 1 and Olivia Tariela \u2013 1. There were 12 void votes.\n\nInitially, 17 aspirants purchased the party\u2019s nomination form at N40 million each but two aspirants, Cosmas Ndukwe, a former lawmaker, and Nwachukwu Anakwenze, a United State-based medical doctor were disqualified by the screening committee.\n\nPeter Obi, a former governor of Anambra State, had resigned his membership of the PDP just few days to the presidential primary, citing hanky-panky dealing.\n\nAlso, a few hours to the primary, investment banker, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen announced his withdrawal from the presidential race.\n\nAbout 24 hours to the primary two aspirants, Charles Ugwu and Chikwendu Kalu announced their decision to step down from the race and support Governor Wike.\n\nFew minutes before the commencement of voting, Aminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto State, announced his decision to step down from the race and give his support to Atiku.\n\nThere were intrigues hours to the convention after a meeting among key leaders of PDP from the North failed to broker a consensus deal among aspirants from the North as several of them declined to shift ground; preferring to participate in the primary.\n\nThere was also a long hours of closed door meeting Saturday at the Transcorp Hilton Abuja by top members of the party, which created apprehension that the party may shift its convention in continuation of the mind game with the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe last few months leading to the presidential convention had been trailed by debates on whose region the PDP presidential ticket should be zoned to.\n\nThere was intense pressure from the South-East for the presidential ticket of the PDP to be zoned to the region since it was the only zone among the three leading ethnic groups in Nigeria which had not produced a president since the return to democracy in 1999.\n\nInitially, the party was undecided on the issue, but later decided to throw the race open and gave every aspirant an opportunity to test their popularity in the presidential primary.\n\nWith the victory, Atiku is set to face whoever will emerge as the APC candidate from the 25 aspirants jostling to be president of Nigeria from May 29, 2023.\n\nBids for six times\n\nIn a recent interview, optimistic Atiku had said, \u201cI\u2019m the best of them all,\u201d alluding to his astuteness in the game of politics.\n\nHe had recently pointedly told the leadership of the party that what the party really needed was an individual that could deliver victory to the PDP and not about zoning.\n\nAtiku has since he joined politics in 1993, contested for the office of the president five times, without success.\n\nHe tried it in 1993, 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019. This is the sixth time he would be taking a shot at the presidency. Would he score the bull\u2019s eye this time around?\n\nWhy Atiku\u2019s victory was expected\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku\u2019s victory was eagerly expected in some quarters, as he was seen as perhaps, the only aspirant, with the most formidable structure with national spread, mileage and popularity across the country capable of winning the presidential election next year. He was also seen in many quarters as capable of mustering the war chest that can give the ruling party a serious fight. These, pundits say, may have informed the party\u2019s leadership decision to jettison the zoning arrangement that is enshrined in its constitution.\n\nAtiku was also the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2019 general election.\n\nRead also: The ruling party has ruined all our achievements \u2013 Atiku\n\nWike pledges to cooperate\n\nGovernor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, earlier before the voting, vowed to support whoever may emerge as the PDP presidential candidate.\n\nHe said, \u201cI want to speak on two subjects. One is the party. Let me vow, today, anybody who emerges here, I\u2019ll support the person to the fullest. I\u2019ll support the person to the fullest because I\u2019m a committed party person. Because I love this party. Because since 1998 I\u2019ve been in this party. I work for this party. I\u2019m not going anywhere. This is my party.\u201d\n\nWith PDP Nigeria shall be great again \u2013 Ayu\n\nIn his remarks at the convention, the PDP National Chairman, Senator Iyorchia Ayu called on Nigerians to vote for the main opposition party in the 2023 general election, saying that the country will rise again under its administration.\n\nAyu made the call on Saturday during the 2022 Special National Convention which was held at the MKO Abiola International Stadium in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nHe berated the All Progressives Congress (APC) led Federal Government for its handling of the nation\u2019s economy, lamenting that Africa\u2019s most populous country is now the headquarters of poverty in the world.\n\nAccording to the PDP National Chairman, Nigerians are yearning for the return of the opposition party at the federal level.\n\nThis, to Ayu, is because the indices under the current administration from terrorism to job creation, debt as well as security challenges has shown that things have worsened.\n\n\u201cIn December when we took over, I urged you all to keep hopes alive that with PDP, Nigeria shall rise again. Today, as I welcome all you delegates, observers and stakeholders to our national convention, I repeat the same words to you. Don\u2019t lose hope, don\u2019t give up on Nigeria. PDP is coming to the rescue,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have done fairly well in the byelections that have held across the country. If we competed on level-playing grounds, if INEC were resisted to external pressures and if security agents did not militarise some of the election\u2019s environment, your great party \u2013 the PDP \u2013 would have done much better.\n\n\u201cThe by-elections serve as a very important point, they are a referendum on APC\u2019s misrule. The outcomes of the elections show that Nigerians want us back in power. The reasons are obvious.\n\n\u201cNigeria is now both the poverty capital of the world, also Nigeria is the third most terrorized country. The economy has collapsed, the government now prints or borrows money to pay salaries, unemployment is about 35 per cent, the government now shares sovereignty with terrorists.\u201d\n\n767 delegates to decide ex-VP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, Governor Nyesom Wike, ex-Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and others\u2019 2023 presidential fate.\n\nThe breakdown is as follows:\n\nBayelsa: 8; Cross River:15; Delta:25; Rivers:23; Edo:18; Abia:17; Anambra:21;\n\nEbony:13;Enugu:17; Imo:21; Oyo:33; Osun:20; Lagos:20; Ekiti:16; Akwa Ibom:13; Ondo:18; Ogun:20; Adamawa:21; Bauchi:20; Borno:27",

          "text": "When Jim O\u2019Neill, the renowned British economist who coined BRICS, popularised the term \u2018MINT\u2019 in 2013, he had high expectations of the group of four countries \u2013 Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey.\n\nThe four countries were billed to be the next economic giants, thanks to their favourable demographics and resources.\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs chief economist, O\u2019Neill, travelled to all four countries and described Nigeria at the time as one with \u201cenormous challenges and problems\u201d and a \u201cvery complex country but harbours immense opportunities.\u201d\n\nYears later, only one of those countries is performing better than in 2014 but it is Nigeria that has performed the worst.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economic output per person, otherwise known as GDP per capita, has slumped by 32 percent between 2014 and 2020, according to the most recent World Bank data.\n\nTurkey and Mexico have seen their GDP per capita shrink 29.79 percent and 23.78 percent respectively while Indonesia, the only country to have recorded growth in economic output in that period, recorded an increase of 10.8 percent.\n\nO\u2019Neill did not immediately respond to an email seeking comments particularly about Nigeria\u2019s economic trajectory in that period.\n\nHowever, nothing better captures the worsening state of Nigeria\u2019s economy and its fading promise than these figures: The country\u2019s GDP slumped from $546 billion in 2014 to $432 billion as at 2020 while GDP per capita, a measure of the living standard of the people, has collapsed from over $3,000 to only $2,097.\n\nNigeria looks unrecognisable from the country that was forecast in 2015 to be the first African country to hit a GDP of $1 trillion. Today, African peers like South Africa and Egypt are closing the GDP gap in the continent\u2019s largest economy.\n\nSouth Africa and Egypt have been able to steal a march on Nigeria because while the latter\u2019s GDP has been shrinking since 2014, South Africa and Egypt\u2019s GDP have gained 9.6 percent and 31.8 percent respectively.\n\nMost of the damage to the economy was done in the seven years of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration so far.\n\nThe economy has slipped into two recessions since the 79-year-old first came into power in 2015, and insecurity has worsened, with killings and kidnappings on the rise. Foreign investments have dried up and the naira has tumbled.\n\nNigerians have had to bear the brunt of an economy stuck in a rot. With businesses groaning from rising production costs, which have worsened this year amid spiralling inflation, job creation has suffered and unemployment ballooned.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s economy to grow average of 3.2% till 2023- AfDB\n\nWhile it would appear that the economy has improved in the last one year after an exit from recession and six straight quarters of growth culminating in a 3.11 percent growth in the first quarter of 2022, most of it is elusive, according to multiple interviews with businesses and individuals.\n\nThe economy\u2019s recent recovery is eluding the vast majority of Nigeria\u2019s 200 million people because it has not been able to reduce poverty or lead to the creation of sufficient jobs.\n\nForeign investment, which countries like Indonesia, a member of the MINT, have relied on to boost their economies, has dried up in Nigeria due to a complex foreign exchange management system and weak economic growth.\n\nWhile the oil price downturn in 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 contributed to a recession in both years, Buhari\u2019s critics blame his lacklustre approach to the economy for making a bad situation worse.\n\n\u201cBuhari has set a number of ugly economic records that may well define his administration,\u201d a university professor who did not want to be named said.\n\n\u201cNigerians are tired and can\u2019t wait for his tenure to be over,\u201d the professor said.\n\nAt no point in its 60-year history has Nigeria\u2019s economy expanded slower than its population for a longer period than between 2015 and 2020, an indictment on Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nAfrica\u2019s largest economy failed for six years to match its average population growth rate of 2.6 percent. When economic growth fails to match population growth, it means the economy is not creating new opportunities to accommodate a fast-rising population and is a sign of worsening poverty levels.\n\nWhen Buhari became president in 2015, he promised to reform an economy hooked on petrodollars, reduce poverty and create jobs, yet the numbers show he achieved the exact opposite.\n\nNigeria\u2019s GDP per capita declined by 0.02 percent, 4.16 percent and 1.78 percent in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, it declined by 0.68 percent, 0.38 percent and 4.57 percent, a painful squeeze for Nigerians whose average incomes are less than half the $5,000 of South Africans.\n\nOf the four presidents who have led Nigeria since it returned to democracy in 1999, Buhari holds the worst record in terms of economic growth.",

          "text": "As President Muhammadu Buhari marks seven years in office today, Nigerians speak in tandem that government has not lived up to its promises to the citizens and that its actions and inactions have given rise to despondency in society.\n\nSome observers said that a lot of things have drastically gone wrong in the last seven years in terms of the economy, education, security, and in virtually every aspect of the nation\u2019s life.\n\nPundits argue that the Buhari administration has not done enough to justify the overwhelming support given to it by Nigerians to salvage the country from its woes.\n\nIn just seven years, the pains are so excruciating that Nigerians are simply gasping for breath. The pain is felt all over the place and in many homes.\n\nIn the year 2022, Nigeria is the world headquarters for extreme poverty, and the third most insecure nation in the world. The economy is not growing, while population is expanding.\n\nNigerians are now unemployed in record numbers. Nigeria is now more indebted than at any time in her history. Peace has eluded the country. Nigeria is in crisis due to insecurity.\n\nAs a Chibok mother lamented in Abuja at the fifth year anniversary of the missing Chibok girls, who haven\u2019t still returned home till date, \u201cfreedom to live and peace are the best this government can offer us, but it has failed and also in all its promises.\u201d\n\nA university lecturer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cNigeria has taken a prominent position among the worst secured countries on earth as insecurity thrives at an unimaginable rate under the watch of Buhari, an ex-military general, who was voted in for his alleged discipline, honesty and anti-corruption stand.\n\n\u201cWith the incessant attacks from Boko Haram, sustained onslaughts by bandits, free flow of ransom to kidnappers, and reign of unknown gunmen, Nigeria is now dreaded by peace lovers across the world.\n\n\u201cWhile Buhari failed to ensure security of lives and property in the country, he failed more in his fight against corruption, as Nigeria has witnessed the worst looting in the seven years Buhari has been in the saddle.\u201d\n\nAccording to the university don, \u201cIt is evident with the pardon of looters of public funds who decamp to the APC, the president\u2019s political party, and the offering of olive branch to former opposition party members who, according to Adams Oshiomhole, former chairman of the APC, are saints the moment they join the ruling party.\n\n\u201cAgain, the poor handling of the economy by the president still steers on the face of Nigerians today. With two recessions in succession in 2016 and in 2020, under Buhari, the president failed.\n\n\u201cAs well, the country has witnessed the worst inflation, highest level of unemployment, highest death rate from sufferings, lowest purchasing power and decline of the once rising middle class.\u201d\n\nHe also recalled that \u201cThe worst for many is the official rating of Nigeria by the United Nations as the poverty capital of the world.\n\n\u201cNepotism has never been this bad in the country under the president, while Nigeria has been more divided in the seven years of the president.\n\n\u201cEducation and health have not done well as the Covid-19 pandemic exposed the infrastructure gaps, while universities have been under lock and key severally under Buhari.\u201d\n\nFor the remaining one year in office, many do not see any magic as things are already out of hand and a huge challenge for whoever will emerge president of the country in 2023.\n\nRecently, Peter Obi, one of the presidential aspirants, recalled that in the first five months of last year, \u201cAs a nation, we earned 1.847 trillion; we used N1.802trillion, which is about 98percent, to service debts, remaining N45 billion for a nation of 200 million people.\u201d\n\nAddressing the nation\u2019s senators during his consultation, he said: \u201cYou approved last year a budget of N14 trillion and we are supposed to borrow N4 trillion, in the end we borrowed about six, seven trillion. This year, you approved a budget of N17 trillion, which the government said they were going to generate a revenue of over N10 trillion, from where? And that\u2019s why I am first pleading with you; can we build a better Nigeria? It is not about politics, it is not about who becomes president, who becomes governor, we can make this country better.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria is on top of the list of fragile failing states. Go and look at the list of terrorised nations, Nigeria is No 3. We are now ranked the same place as Afghanistan and Yemen. The first ingredient of a failed country is when the government is no longer in control of its territory. Today, we are the world poverty capital; what it means is that Nigeria has more people living with poverty than the two biggest countries of the world combined \u2013 China and India (2.8 billion). We have more people living in poverty than the two countries combined. We today have 50 million children out of school; 60 to 70 percent of them have never been to school at all. So, they are not out of school; they have never even experienced it not to talk of coming out of it.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cYour country\u2019s stress level \u2013 this country is now the most stressful place for people to live in. Go and check the stress level index. The misery index has also worsened. We have the highest employment rate compared to South Africa. We have 33percent unemployment; when you include underemployment; that is 55percent out of which 60percent of this are young people in their productive age doing nothing. At the age they are supposed to be the engine of production, they are not doing everything. So you have millions of them all over the space.\n\n\u201cWe have just also overtaken India in infant mortality. The list is endless: In drug prevalence now, the global rate is 5.8percent Nigeria is 14.9percent and 70percent is among the young ones; that is where your country is. Your debt level is totally unacceptable.\n\n\u201cToday, we are owing 98 percent of our revenue to debt. And I can tell you by end of this year, it will be hundred and something percent of our revenue.\u201d\n\nSome Nigerians however, would argue that in view of the challenges that have plagued his administration, that President Buhari has recorded some achievements in some sectors to his credit.\n\nSome believe that President Buhari has made significant achievements in some sectors, such as the signing into law of the Electoral Amendment bill in February, 2022. It was seen as a step in the right direction toward reforming the electoral system in Nigeria ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nThe signing of the bill into law had elicited wide applause among political stakeholders across Nigeria and beyond.\n\nObservers say that the innovations would guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens to vote and to do so effectively, it would improve the effectiveness and transparency of the election process.\n\nIn the last two decades, elections at all levels in Nigeria have been trailed by controversy such as; vote buying, voter intimidation, thuggery, result manipulation among others. This, among others, allows the electoral empire, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to transmit election results electronically.\n\nBuhari had said that he received inputs from relevant MDAs after thorough reviews of the bill and its implications to Nigeria\u2019s democratic processes, said it contains salient provisions that could positively revolutionise elections in Nigeria through the introduction of new technological innovations.\n\nAnother major achievement of the Buhari\u2019s administration in the last seven year is the signing into law of an Executive Order to grant financial autonomy to the legislature and the judiciary across the 36 states of the country.\n\nThe order also mandates the accountant-general of the federation to deduct from source amount due to state legislatures and judiciaries from the monthly allocation to each state for states that refuse to grant such autonomy in 2020.\n\nThe Attorney-General, Abubakar Malami said the Executive Order No.10 of 2020, made it mandatory that all states of the federation should include the allocations of both the legislature and the judiciary in the first-line charge of their budgets.\n\nHe had said consideration was given to all other applicable laws, instruments, conventions and regulations that provided for financial autonomy at the states.\n\nAccording to the AGF, \u201cA presidential implementation committee was constituted to fashion out strategies and modalities for the implementation of financial autonomy for the State Legislature and State Judiciary in compliance with section 121(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as Amended).\u201d\n\nMalami had maintained that the implementation of financial autonomy of the state legislature and state judiciary would strengthen the institutions at the states and make them more independent and accountable in line with the tenets of democracy as enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nAlso, the Buhari administration the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC). PACAC was established by President Buhari in August 2015 to, among other things; promote the reform agenda of the government on the anti-corruption effort, and advise the present administration in the prosecution of the war against corruption and the implementation of required reforms in Nigeria\u2019s criminal justice system. It was the very first committee the President set up after he was sworn into office.\n\nIn the last few years, PACAC has empowered judges and prosecutors to operate effectively in carrying out their responsibilities through workshops on the new Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015.\n\nIn recent times, President Buhari has received wide applause among stakeholders on the decision.\n\nRead also: Buhari warns against tenure elongation\n\nSpeaking recently, Monday Ubani, a former 2nd Vice-President of Nigeria Bar Association, said the signing of an executive order giving financial autonomy to state legislature and judiciary by President Buhari was commendable.\n\nUbani, however, called on the President to engineer a constitutional amendment to address several areas of leakage of public funds.\n\nUbani said, \u201cThis is a thumb up for President Muhammadu Buhari. We need more of this kind of thinking and innovation in governance to revive Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that Nigeria is being killed incrementally by her leaders through brazen stealing of her resources that should have been used to develop the country and the people.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in 2019, the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) implemented its guidelines on the administration of local government funds.\n\nThe guidelines limited the cumulative amount that can be withdrawn from a local government account to not more than N500, 000 daily.\n\nThe NFIU said the guildelines are to guard against the overbearing influence of state governments in the administration of local government monthly allocations.\n\nThe guidelines are aimed at reducing crime vulnerabilities created by cash withdrawal from local government funds throughout Nigeria effective from June 1, 2019.\n\nHowever, the state\u2019s governors had challenged the agency decision, while instituting a legal action.\n\nThe state governments had argued that the guidelines were in breach of the financial autonomy of the various states as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution.\n\nBut delivering on the case recently, the judge Ekwo Inyang, held that the essence of the NFIU guidelines is to entrench financial transparency in government transactions at the local level.\n\nThe Judge, Ekwo, agreed with the AGF that going by Section 23 (2) (a), Section 28 (2) and Section 31 of the NFIU Act, the unit has the power to make the guidelines.",

The complete set of results is currently being compiled.\n\nAminu Tambuwal, the governor of Sokoto state and a fellow presidential candidate, had previously withdrawn from the contest. Mr Tambuwal asked delegates to vote for the former vice president, putting him ahead of his major rival Nyesom Wike.\n\nMr. Abubakar formally stated his intention in running for President of Nigeria in 2023 in March. Security, the economy, education, and devolving greater resources and authorities to the federating units were all major themes in his campaign.\n\nIf elected president in the 2023 general elections, Mr Abubakar pledged the people that his administration would combat the theft of public funds. The presidential candidate promised to give the educational sector the attention it deserves.\n\nHis victory followed the comments of Doyin Okupe, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, who revealed that the presidential primary election will be a money market as presidential aspirants, like Messrs Abubakar and Wike, would persuade delegates with money. How much role cash distribution played throughout the exercise was unclear.\n\nMe Abubakar\u2019s desire to be president dates as far back as 2019 when he won the ticket of the PDP but was beaten at the polls by incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe former vice president had tried five times unsuccessfully to become Nigeria\u2019s president, starting in 1992 when he ran under the Social Democratic Party. He sought the office in 2007, 2011, 2015 and 2019.",

          "text": "BY ONU OKORIE\n\nLagos: May 26, 2022: To encourage and simplify vehicle ownership for personal use by millions of Nigerians, First City Monument Bank (FCMB) now offers auto loans of up to N30 million at a reduced interest rate. The FCMB auto loan supports acquiring brand new and pre-owned vehicles (popularly known as \u201cTokunbo\u201d), with N500,000 as the minimum loan amount that a customer can access for a repayment duration of up to 5 years.\n\nThis affirms FCMB\u2019s commitment to improving the social well-being of individuals and enhancing access to credit for higher standard of living for families.\n\nCommenting on the unique value proposition, Divisional Head, Personal Banking of the Bank, Mr Shamsideen Fashola, said, \u201cvehicle ownership is one of the most exciting moments in a person\u2019s life. Yet, many people struggle to save up for a long time to make this dream come true. To bridge this gap, we created a value proposition that is flexible, convenient and empowers individuals, families and businesses to achieve the dream of vehicle ownership. Nigerians can now finance their dream vehicle with an auto loan from FCMB at a low-interest rate with monthly or yearly payment options depending on their income. We, therefore, urge the populace, including, but not limited to salaried individuals, to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfil their vehicle ownership dream\u201d.\n\nFCMB Auto Loan empowers qualified Nigerians to part-finance the purchase of brand-new and pre-owned vehicles while spreading the repayment between one and five years. The loan, which is dependent on the type of vehicle to be purchased, is open to salaried individuals and self-employed Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the number of registered vehicles in Nigeria is 13 million. However, vehicle ownership in the country has been declining because of increased prices. This is due to foreign exchange and importation challenges, leading to a drastic reduction in purchasing power and sales decline in the auto industry.\n\nA purpose beyond profit commercial banking institution, First City Monument Bank is a member of FCMB Group Plc, led by Ladi Balogun as Group Chief Executive. The Bank is committed to COVID-19 recovery, income equality and poverty reduction by easing credit constraints to disadvantaged individuals and small businesses. The intervention of FCMB in the automobile sector aligns with Goals 3 and 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus on well-being and reduced inequalities.",

His closest challenger, Wike, polled 237 votes. Saraki pulled 70 votes.\n\nEmmanuel (38), Mohammed (38), Anyim Pius Anyim (14), Mrs Tari Diana Oliver (1) and Sam Ohuabunwa (1) shared the remainder of the valid votes.\n\n\u2018Sense of Belonging\u2019\n\nIn his victory speech, Atiku commended the electoral process employed in the primary.\n\n\u201cToday we are making another history,\u201d he said. \u201cA history which we believe will bring about fundamental changes and also in our political processes.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that his campaign will be built on five fundamentals, including a pledge to unify the country.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\u201cI pledge to unify this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I refer to myself as a unifier.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I feel that unity is important is because APC has disunited Nigerians completely.\n\n\u201cI will work to restore unity and bring a sense of belonging to all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nMr Atiku vowed to decisively deal with the country\u2019s security challenges and confront its economic problems.\n\n\u201cThe PDP made Nigeria one of the most prosperous countries in Africa,\u201d he said. \u201cWe implemented economic reforms. The APC wiped out all those gains.\u201d\n\nHe also called on his fellow contestants to work and cooperate with him.\n\nEarly signs\n\nThere were speculations that the PDP may postpone its National Convention after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) extended the deadline for political parties to conduct their primaries for the 2023 general elections by six days.\n\nThe extension had prompted the ruling All Progressives Congress to postpone its own primaries, earlier scheduled for Sunday, to June 6.\n\nBut the PDP quickly denied that it had any plans of shifting its postponement, criticising INEC for \u201cshifting the goal post.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Convention, which was held at the Velodrome of the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, sprung to life before midday on Saturday as party delegates began to troop in.\n\nUdom Emmanuel was one of the first presidential aspirants to arrive and others soon followed.\n\nAlthough the Convention had been scheduled to begin at 10am, proceedings did not commence until late evening.\n\nParty leaders who spoke to Channels Television were upbeat about the success of the election, vowing to take back the country from the ruling APC.\n\nSigns that Atiku would emerge as the flagbearer surfaced after Adamawa State Governor Umaru Fintiri revealed that Mohammed Hayatu-Deen had stepped down for the former Vice President.\n\nHayatu-Deen, one of the presidential aspirants, announced earlier that he was exiting the race but did not say he was supporting any particular candidate.\n\nThe big twist\n\nAfter the National Anthem was sung, all 14 aspirants were given the opportunity to address the delegates for a maximum of five minutes.\n\nAtiku went first, following an alphabetical order. And Wike, his eventual closest challenger, spoke last.\n\nBut the big twist of the primary came after the speeches, when voting was about to commence.\n\nTambuwal, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives and North-West politics stalwart, stepped on to the podium and announced he was stepping down for Atiku.\n\n\u201cI have come to the conclusion \u2013 to the glory of God Almighty, seeing millions of Nigerians suffering and the need for us to close ranks in the party and as one of the leaders in this party \u2013 I have come to a patriotic conclusion to step down my aspiration,\u201d Tambuwal said, to wide cheers and applause.\n\n\u201cAnd not only that, I have appealed to my supporters to take this in good strides and for national unity and patriotism \u2013 not only that, those who are delegates here \u2013 should vote for Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\u201d\n\nFrom there, it seemed destined to be Atiku\u2019s night as the final results later showed.",

Our country is on the threshold of greatness because for the first time since our independence, we would have successive administrations of a progressive and visionary government; a government of integrity, a government which sole interest is the well-being of Nigeria and Nigerians\u201d.\n\nSteve Bayode, while canvassing for Asiwaju Tinubu, posited, APC delegates are lucky to be here at this time; in this great party, in a time when our country is hoping to be led by a selfless individual who has the progress and prosperity of our people as his major objective, we are here, he said, as a witnesses to the success story of APC because Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has been a very key part of this story.\n\nBayode calls on the APC ad-hoc delegates across the 36 states and Abuja to make history by unveiling the dawn of a greater nation through their preference for Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu in the party\u2019s presidential primary; to not only elect him as the party\u2019s flag bearer but to celebrate the incoming dawn in Nigeria; to celebrate the next level in the party where every party men and women will be served and given what is due to them.\n\nBayode, particularly, hailed Tinubu for his political dexterity, doggedness, undoubted courage and political acumen, saying the attributes of the national leader played key part in the electoral victory of APC at the Federal, National Assembly, Governorship and State Assembly elections across the federation.\n\nAsiwaju he said has worked assiduously over the years to put most politicians in office, it is only fair and logical to accord him say opportunity to serve at the highest capacity for our nation being his long time known political ambition to serve the nation as its next president.\n\nWhile describing the presidential ambition of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as timely and perfectly conceived and apt for the moment, Prince Iyantan noted that it is instructing that it was coming at a time when Nigerians are eagerly looking forward to a revolutionary transformation in key sectors and sections of the country.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Tinubu\u2019s presidency is coming at a time when the APC has spread its political tentacles even, further in the country and is coming at a time when Nigerians are eagerly looking forward to the next level in progressive politics, economic growth, social welfare and increased national security ensured,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Tinubu is one who knows the way, goes the way and shows the way. A person that does what he says; a pragmatic person. The servant-leader type headship that talks, participates and leads his followers to achieve expected group goals as demonstrated in the way he used his positions as Governor to impact lives, opened up Lagos State to further developments and also ameliorated the sufferings of the downtrodden.\n\nAsiwaju\u2019s story is like that of many numbers of men rising from a humble beginning, struggling from birth to political stardom, a man with strong philosophy, his values and contributions to the nation building as well as his acumen as an administrator, will\n\nmake a role model for anyone including the youth to emulate.\n\nLike the change we all clamour for that brought President Mohammed Buhari to power in 2015; in moving forward beyond 2023, there is need to consolidate the gains, and the next level would require a pragmatic leader, someone with great vision the type of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to take our nation to an Eldorado of boundless riches.\n\nSo, as APC delegates file out to effect their franchise, they should put the interest of the party first and foremost by voting wisely and casting their votes for the man who can truly win the presidency for the party \u2013 ASIWAJU BOLA AHMED TINUBU.",

          "title": "Buhari Backs Establishment of African Standby Force on Terrorism",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has backed the recommendation of the African Union Commission for the setting up of a Standby Force on Terrorism in the continent.\n\nThis is just as he charged African leaders to muster the political will that will fuel synergy, enhance intelligence gathering and bring more urgency in tackling violent crimes.\n\n\n\nAlso, President Buhari charged African political leaders to respect the right of citizens to make their choices in elections, saying the right to vote and determine who leads them should not be treated lightly.\n\nSpeaking Saturday in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea during the 16th African Union Extra-ordinary Session of the Assembly of African Union on Terrorism and Violent Extremism in Africa, the president said resources meant for development of countries had been channelled into fighting violent crimes, leaving many governments with less options on investing in people to meet the targets of Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nWith the presentation of a report on Terrorism and Violent Extremism in Africa at the meeting, President Buhari highlighted four items on the recommendation for immediate action.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the West African region, we are working very hard through the instrumentality of ECOWAS to combat terrorism. The Multi National Joint Task Force in the Lake Chad region and the G5 in the Sahel have continued to degrade the insurgents by substantially reducing their capacity to inflict harm on our citizens.\n\n\u201cMr. Chairman, these efforts however, need to be strengthened and complemented by the African Union, through the African Union Peace and Security Architecture.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason, Mr. Chairperson, that we endorse the key recommendations contained in your report. Some of the recommendations which we believe should be implemented immediately include;\n\n\u201cIncreasing troop levels in situations of combating terrorism, and enhancing intelligence capabilities of deployed troops, including improving the operational cooperation of contingents in the operation areas;\n\n\u201cEnsuring the readiness of the African Standby Force for immediate response when a member state is under terrorist threat;\n\n\u201cStrengthening the fight against cybercrime, money laundering, drugs and arms trafficking, smuggling of persons and counterfeit goods, which facilitate terrorist financing; and\n\n\u201cEnsuring that specialised institutions like the African Centre for the Study and Research on Terrorism and AFRIPOL, are adequately resourced in order for them to effectively discharge their mandate\u201d.\n\nWhile validating the report on terrorism, the president underscored the need for political will to forge a \u201cCoordinated Continental Approach to tackling insecurity.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason, that we commend the Chairperson of the Commission for his comprehensive report on Terrorism and Violent Extremism in Africa. The report is very enriching, resonating and it behoves on us as the Assembly of the African Union to show the political will and forge a Coordinated Continental Approach to tackling insecurity, as we must entrench peace and stability on our continent,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nAccording to him, the recommendations, if implemented, will go a long way in increasing the capacity of affected states to respond to the threats posed by terrorists and violent extremists in their respective countries.\n\nHe said: \u201cYour Excellencies, this summit affords us yet another opportunity as leaders of the continent to rub minds and take far reaching decisions to address the challenges of terrorism and violent extremism on our continent.\n\n\u201cThe activities of these sinister groups have not only led to the loss of valuable lives and property.\n\n\u201cThey have equally taken a drastic toll on our national economies. The capacity of Governments to address infrastructural needs and other developmental challenges, in line with our Sustainable Development Goals is grossly diminished.\n\n\u201cThe resources meant for developmental programmes are being channeled to fight terrorists and violent extremists, who are currently rampaging our continent\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, H.E. Moussa Faki Mahamat, had presented the Commission\u2019s Reports on the Prevention and Combating of Terrorism and Violent Extremism and on Unconstitutional Changes of Government in Africa.\n\nThe report looked at persistent threats, evaluated current response mechanisms, and decided on the specific actions and measures necessary to strengthen the collective security of Member States facing terrorism and violent extremism.\n\nThe report also recommended actionable measures needed to stem the upsurge on the continent.\n\nBuhari Urges African Presidents to Respect Citizens\u2019 Right to Choose Their Leaders\n\nIn related development, speaking at a bilateral meeting with the President of Malawi, Lazarus Chakwera, President Buhari charged African political leaders to respect the right of citizens to make their choices in elections, saying the right to vote and determine who leads them should not be treated lightly.\n\nHe said in a move to strengthen the continent\u2019s democratic fabric and ensure smooth conduct of elections, \u201cwe must convince the people that we respect them, and this is by allowing them to choose whoever they want.\u201d\n\nThe president acknowledged that the path to democracy in African countries had not been a smooth one, recalling that he had been to the Supreme Court three times before he became President.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had to openly disabuse the minds of our colleagues. We are a developing country, that we should not be demoralised.\n\n\u201cWe have to go through these processes. We must trust these institutions to do what is right. Present the evidence. Don\u2019t give up. Keep on pushing,\u201d Buhari explained.\n\nHe explained that the merit of one\u2019s case, not religion, or ethnicity or section would determine success in political endeavors. He stated that his meritorious cases in court were thrown out by judges who more or less shared the same sentimental backgrounds with him.\n\n\u201cSo, I say go for merit. Don\u2019t stand on ethnicity or such other divisive factors,\u201d the president said.\n\nCommenting on the relationship between Nigeria and Malawi, and that of the Southern African Sub-region in general, President Buhari said his predecessors in office, especially the late General Murtala Muhammed laid out the continental rule of engagement placing Southern African countries on Nigeria\u2019s priority list.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are acutely aware of the problems of Southern African countries, more than most others.\n\n\u201cMurtala virtually left the country to General Olusegun Obasanjo, then, and faced up to Europe and America on the problems of apartheid. He was very energetic and patriotic. We will continue on that path,\u201d Buhari added.\n\nPresident Buhari said he greatly valued his meeting with President Chakwera, giving assurances that he would pay attention to the issues brought to the meeting.\n\nThe Foreign Affairs Ministers of the two countries were directed to take the matters forward.\n\nIn his remarks, President Chekwara described President Buhari as a statesman and role model. He added that his country was willing to learn from Nigeria\u2019s experience in agriculture, infrastructure development and in managing security and violent extremism, which, he said, were creeping into the South African sub-region.\n\nAccording to him, while both countries were together in the framework of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, his country\u2019s wish was for a speedy trade relationship with Nigeria.\n\nPresident Chekwara asked for the convening of a meeting of technical experts to discuss trading pacts, Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) and agreements.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is no way we won\u2019t relate to the biggest economy in Africa. Our older brother should hold our hands and we walk together\u201d.\n\nPresident of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, Carlos Vila Novo and his spouse also met President Buhari and the First Lady, Mrs. Aisha Buhari.\n\nThe Sao Tomean President got assurances that Nigeria will continue to play a brotherly role in the affairs of sister African countries.\n\nPresident Buhari also received in audience the President of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo who came to thank him for honouring the invitation for the Extraordinary African Union Summit in his country.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "Mexico earned a 2-1 victory over Nigeria in a friendly on Saturday night as El Tri launched a stretch of summer matches in preparation for the 2022 World Cup.\n\nIn what was the first match of Coach Jos\u00e9 Peseiro as Head Coach of the Super Eagles, a largely under-strength squad fought courageously and commendably against CONCACAF \u2018s perennial champions.\n\nPeseiro opted for a flexible and interesting 3-5-2 formation, with Moses Simon and Calvin Bassey deployed as wing backs, and Joe Aribo, Alex Iwobi and Innocent Bonke serving in midfield. Cyriel Dessers and Terem Moffi searched for the goals.\n\nIn front of 56,872 fans at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Mexico took an early lead when Cruz Azul\u2019s Santiago Gimenez found the back of the net in the 12th minute. Through an assist from Monterrey\u2019s Jesus Gallardo, Gimenez\u2019s shot pinballed between himself and goalkeeper Francis Uzoho before crossing the goal line.\n\nBy the halftime whistle, El Tri found themselves with a narrow 1-0 advantage, but with eight shots in their favor in comparison to Nigeria\u2019s total of zero.\n\nThe Super Eagles leveled the scoreline in the 54th minute through their first opportunity on target. Following a well-placed cross from Calvin Bassey, Cyriel Dessers forced an error from Mexican goalkeeper Rodolfo Cota, who fumbled the ball into his net.\n\nMoments afterwards, Mexico would take the lead once again after their opposition made a mistake of their own. After a hard pass from Gallardo on the left flank, defender William Troost-Ekong accidentally launched the ball past his goalkeeper through a poor clearance.\n\nLooking to extend the lead for his CONCACAF squad, manager Gerardo \u201cTata\u201d Martino began to make substitutions in the second half that pushed his side further up the pitch. Although the introduction of substitutions like Diego Lainez, Erick Gutierrez and Orbelin Pineda helped create more chances in the final third, the scoreline remained once the final whistle was blown.\n\n\u201cAs a striker, you\u2019re always looking to score goals. Thankfully I scored today and I think that gives strikers a lot of confidence,\u201d said Gimenez in the post-game press conference.\n\nOn Friday, Martino told media that he recently had a conversation with LA Galaxy forward Javier \u201cChicharito\u201d Hernandez, Mexico\u2019s all-time leading goalscorer who hasn\u2019t earned a call-up since 2019, but also reiterated that he continues to have trust in attacking options like Gimenez.\n\nFor the Eagles, home \u2013based professionals Sani Faisal, Victor Mbaoma, Chiamaka Madu and Ishaq Kayode who came in after the first 45 minutes, also gave good account of themselves.\n\n\u201cI am happy with what we put up out there. It was the first time after the disappointment of the World Cup playoff and you can say this is a makeshift team, while Mexico had their full-strength squad out there. I like what I saw today and I have confidence that we have appointed the right coach that can restore the glory of the Super Eagles and make them start winning once more,\u201d President of the NFF and FIFA Council Member, Amaju Pinnick, said after the game.\n\nNigeria had eight shots on goal compared to Mexico\u2019s 12, while Uzoho made four saves as against Cota\u2019s one.\n\nThe Eagles are scheduled to fly to New Jersey on Sunday morning, ahead of Thursday\u2019s clash with Ecuador at the Red Bull Arena in Harrison.",

I had luck to come here last year and have a fantastic season,\u201d Ancelotti told BT Sport after the match.\n\nMadrid finished off a remarkable journey to this season\u2019s final: First leading a comeback victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16, then edging Chelsea in extra-time in the quarterfinal, and finally leading an unprecedented comeback over Manchester City in the semifinals.\n\nThe match was delayed by 30 minutes amid chaotic scenes outside the stadium as thousands of Liverpool fans were stuck outside and police deployed pepper spray and tear gas on supporters.\n\nVideo footage on social media showed large crowds of supporters outside the Stade de France in the buildup to the game, with large numbers of Liverpool fans unable to access the stadium as the original kickoff time neared.\n\nLiverpool were handed a fitness boost with Thiago Alcantara and Fabinho both starting despite being injury doubts in the week leading up to the game.\n\nJurgen Klopp\u2019s side dominated possession early on, peppering the Madrid goal and forcing Courtois into a number of diving saves.\n\nMohamed Salah had the first chance of the game on 16 minutes as he flicked a low cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold only to be denied by Courtois, and Sadio Mane shortly after when he fired a shot into the left bottom corner only for the Madrid goalkeeper\u2019s outstretched arm to tip the ball onto the post.\n\nSalah cut an isolated figure in the first half, and allowed just a small number of half-chances, although Madrid fared worse the other way, managing just one shot on target in the opening 45 minutes \u2014 tied for their fewest shots in a first half this season in all competitions.\n\nBenzema briefly thought he had broken the deadlock just before the break as he netted after a scramble in the box, but a lengthy check from the VAR confirmed the referee\u2019s decision that he was offside.\n\nLiverpool again peppered the Madrid goal in the opening spells of the second half, but Madrid continued to deny them before Vinicius broke the deadlock on 58 minutes with a comfortable strike. The 21-year-old became the fifth-youngest player to score in a Champions League final.\n\nCourtois continued to keep Liverpool at bay, notably with a superb save from Salah on the right-hand side of the 18-yard box to push the ball past the far post as Ancelotti\u2019s side ran out 1-0 winners.\n\n\u201cYesterday in the press conference I said that when Madrid plays finals they win. I was on the good side of history,\u201d Courtois told BT Sport.\n\n\u201cI saw a lot of tweets coming my way that I would get humbled today it was the other way round.\n\n\u201cToday I needed to win a final for my career, for all the hard work to put respect on my name as I don\u2019t think I get enough respect, especially in England. I saw a lot of criticism even after a great season.\u201d\n\nESPN",
