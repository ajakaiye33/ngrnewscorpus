          "text": "The Organised Private Sector of Nigeria has said fulfilling of tax obligations, especially remitting Value Added Tax, has become confusing as businesses did not know the actual authority to relate with.\n\nA statement from the association disclosed that OPSN chairman, Mr Taiwo Adeniyi, said this while addressing a forum on Friday.\n\nThe Organised Private Sector of Nigeria comprises of Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, Nigeria Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture, Nigeria Employers Consultative Association, Nigeria Association of Small Scale Industries and Nigeria Association of Small and Medium Enterprises.\n\nSome state governments and the Federal Inland Revenue Services are currently slugging it out in court over who should VAT in their states.\n\nAdeniyi said, \u201cIt is important to also note that at a time when businesses are clamouring for streamlining and reduction of tax burdens, the ongoing challenge has the potential to make businesses pay double VAT because of the demands of the FIRS and state governments for remittance of VAT.\n\n\u201cMore so, as the deadline for remittance of VAT collection falls due on 21st of every month. Businesses as the collecting agents are practically unclear on authority to remit to and without a clear path, this would further aggravate the pain on businesses.\u201d\n\nHe added that the Federal Inland Revenue Services and states should not throw businesses under the bus.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the Lagos and Rivers state governments for the platform created to engage organised businesses in the course of this controversy.\n\n\u201cWe appeal that the FIRS and the states should also engage, in the interest of enterprise competitiveness and national development.\u201d\n\nAdeniyi said that adding the current issue to accumulated issues facing Nigerian businesses would make survival of enterprises even tougher.",

          "text": "Says Lagos targets 30% vaccination of residents in 1yr\n\nBy Olasunkanmi Akoni\n\nLagos State Goverrnor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu has stressed that vaccine equity remained the only path to toe by world leaders to end the COVID-19 pandemic in the globe.\n\nHowever, Sanwo-Olu said that his administration aimed to vaccinate 30 per cent of the state population within one year as parts of recovery strategies against ravaging COVID-19 pandemic in the state.\n\nThe governor, who gave detailed explanation on how the state government had expanded access to vaccines since the vaccination programme began in March and the state\u2019s projection to protect its residents and environment, spoke at the 2021 \u201cGlobal Citizen Live Concert,\u201d held at Fela\u2019s Afrika Shrine in Ikeja.\n\nOn the vaccine equity, the Governor said, the world must ensure that vaccines were available to all, especially poorer countries that had struggled with supply.\n\nSanwo-Olu, noted that the situation of unequal distribution of vaccines in which richer nations secured more doses than the size of their populations and are preparing to roll out booster shots, while poorer countries struggled to administer first doses, threatening the global efforts to end the pandemic.\n\nOn how Lagos is creating access and ramping up vaccination, Sanwo-Olu said the Government was leveraging the private sector funding, capacity and infrastructure to scale up availability and distribution.\n\nAs the epicentre of the pandemic outbreak, Sanwo-Olu said Lagos had pursued a radical vaccination programmes, which led to the administration of 16,000 jabs of vaccines daily noting that is still a far cry from what was projected in achieving herd immunity.\n\nSanwo-Olu disclosed that 405,000 residents had received first doses of AstraZeneca, while 289,000 persons returned for their second doses. The State, he said, administered 230,000 first shots of Moderna to raise the vaccinated population to about 1.2 per cent within five months.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur vaccination rate is far below the minimum target of 60 per cent recommended by the World Health Organisation (W.H.O) per city population. At the current rate, it would take about three years to achieve our herd immunity target. We cannot continue at this speed if we seriously want to beat this virus.\n\n\u201cTo safely achieve herd immunity against COVID-19, a substantial proportion of our population would need to be vaccinated to lower the overall amount of virus able to spread in the whole population.\n\n\u201cOne of the objectives of attaining herd immunity is to prevent mutations from emerging leading to more aggressive strains. It is important that Lagos achieves herd immunity at the same time with all countries together.\n\n\u201cOur proposal to the private sector is to reserve and administer 50 per cent of the vaccines procured in partnership with the private sector to be made available free of charge at Government health centres.\n\n\u201cWe propose to deploy a proven system where those who can pay for vaccines subsidise the cost of vaccination for those who cannot.\n\n\u201cGiven the fact that we expect COVID-19 vaccinations to be annual going forward, this is the only sustainable path towards achieving herd immunity and making Lagos free of the virus.\n\n\u201cWith our approach, we expect to vaccinate 30 per cent of the population of Lagos within one year.\n\n\u201cThis will put us on a better and more sustainable path towards herd immunity. We expect COVID-19 vaccinations to be an annual programme, going forward, as this is the only way to making Lagos free of the virus.\u201d\n\nThe governor urged Nigerians to continue to be law-abiding and comply with the travel guidelines stipulated by the Presidential Steering Committee to prevent the importation of new variants.\n\nHe reiterated that observation of social distancing and personal hygiene would break the cycle of community transmission of the virus.\n\nInstructively, free access to coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines is one of the strategies designed by the United Nations (UN) to kickstart global recovery, especially in cities that are signatories to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework.\n\nAudiences in 11 cities across the world, including Paris, Seoul, London, Sidney, New York and Los Angeles, witnessed the live event, held in honour of frontline and essential workers in the battle against the global pandemic.\n\nGlobal Citizen Live is a 24-hour global event initiated in six continents to unite the world in defending the planet against diseases and defeating poverty.\n\nA-list of Nigerian musical artistes that performed live during the international concert were: Femi Kuti, Davido, Tiwa Savage and Made Kuti, among others.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

As a nationalist and patriot that he was, Dr. Mailafia was completely dedicated to the emancipation of ethnic nationalities from the clutches of oppression. The economist was never afraid to speak truth to power just as he remained committed to the enthronement of justice and equity to all citizens across ethnic and religious divides.\u201d\n\nThe forum recalled his patriotic zeal in standing up for truth and justice, adding that he was never a letdown in being at the forefront of showing the way for national greatness as he was willing to lay down his life for Nigeria.\n\nIt said it is inspired by his altruistic disposition and contributions to national development and remains proud of his footprints on the political, economic and social sands of the country.\n\nThe forum noted that as a former presidential candidate in the 2019 poll, Dr Mailafia sought to deploy politics to bring about the dream he had for his country, stressing that even after he lost the election, he never let down the bar in demanding fair treatment for all Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cIn the twilight of his life, this consummate technocrat and global scholar of repute beamed his searchlight on the raging insecurity ravaging our country. He expressed regrets over the government\u2019s incapacity to rein in the activities of insurgents and criminal groups terrorising the nation.\u201d\n\nIt stated that the death of the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital Gwagwalada, Abuja came to the forum as a great shock, saying that as someone who relentlessly participated in the activities of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), his untimely death has dealt a deadly blow on ethnic nationalities of not only the Middle Belt but the country at large.\n\nArising from various inquiries from Nigerians over the circumstances of his death, the forum stated that Dr Mailafia arrived in Abuja last Sunday, September 12, 2021 from Akure and was received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport by his wife.\n\nIt said on arrival at home, the wife noticed he was not in the best of health conditions and seemed to be suffering from malaria, after three days of treatment without signs of improvement, he went to the CBN Hospital on Friday, September 17, 2021, where he was shabbily treated, adding that it took the intervention of a senior medic who immediately placed him on oxygen and admitted him.\n\nIt added that Dr Mailafia was later given the option of choosing three hospitals at Gwagwalada Hospital, National Hospital and EHA Clinics, but his wife opted for the third choice.\n\nOn arrival at the EHA Clinics, the statement explained that the wife was subjected to yet another moment of anxiety as it took a direct order from the top management of the hospital to accept him.\n\nThe statement explained that on Saturday, September 18, 2021, Dr Obadiah was transferred to Gwagwalada and on arrival, the name of the doctor that was billed to attend to Dr Mailafia was not on duty, pointing out that even when an attempt was made by foreign health consultants to save the situation, the doctor on duty got angry and said he was not obligated to listen to any foreign consultants that had been brought into the matter with the sole purpose of ensuring nothing goes wrong.\n\nIt stated that the wife of the former CBN Deputy Governor was asked to pay the sum of N600,000 as a deposit even when it was a referral case, with an accruing medical bill to be settled by the CBN, adding that at a point, Dr Mailafia complained over his breathing problems and pleaded with the doctors to place him in a ventilator. The doctors flatly refused.\n\nIt explained that even after the doctors declared Dr. Mailafia dead, foreign consultants who were brought into the matter through Dr Mailafia\u2019s son that is living abroad, had directed a family member who is a medical professional, with the wife of the CBN Deputy Governor, to mount pressure on the chest of Dr. Mailafia for resuscitation and thereafter place him on life support.\n\nIt added that the doctors in Gwagwalada refused all entreaties by the family members of Dr Mailafia to follow the advice of the foreign consultants, insisting that they have already pronounced him dead, stressing that even when the wife could feel the pulse of her husband, the doctor flatly declared there was nothing they could do since they had already pronounced him dead.",

          "text": "Groups seek probe\n\nTributes pour for ex-CBN chief By Raymond Mordi and Gbenga Omokhunu, Abuja\n\nDetails of how a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Dr. Obadiah Mailafia, died in Abuja were made public on Sunday.\n\nThe former CBN chief died at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital in Gwagwalada.\n\nHe was 64.\n\nThe Middle Belt Forum (MBF), which gave the details in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Dr. Isuwa Dogo, said: \u201cArising from various enquiries from Nigerians over the circumstances of his death, the forum wishes to state as follows: that Dr. Mailafia arrived Abuja last Sunday, September 12, 2021, from Akure and was received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport by his wife.\n\n\u201cOn arrival at home, the wife noticed he was not in the best of health conditions and seemed to be suffering from malaria. After three days of treatment without signs of improvement, he went to the CBN Hospital on Friday September 17, 2021, where he was shabbily treated. It took the intervention of a senior medic who immediately placed him on oxygen and admitted him.\n\n\u201cDr. Mailafia\u2019s was later given the option of choosing three hospitals: Gwagwalada Hospital, National Hospital and EHA Clinics. The wife opted for the third choice. On arrival at the EHA Clinics, the wife was subjected to yet another moment of anxiety as it took a direct order from the top management of the hospital to accept him.\n\n\u201cAfter few hours of treatment, the EHA Clinics told the wife that it was expedient to transfer the former CBN Deputy Governor to Gwagwalada as the clinic was not fully equipped to handle the case.\u201d\n\nMBF said: \u201cThe death of the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital in Gwagwalada this morning (Sunday, September 19) came to us as a great shock. As someone who relentlessly participated in the activities of the MBF, his untimely death has dealt a deadly blow to ethnic nationalities of not only the Middle Belt but the country at large.\u201d\n\nMrs. Mailafia was said to have opposed taking her husband to Gwagwalada but agreed when the consultant assured her that nothing bad would happen to the ex-CBN chief.\n\n\u201cYesterday (Saturday, September 18, 2021), Dr. Obadiah was transferred to Gwagwalada. On arrival, the name of the doctor that was billed to attend to Dr. Mailafia was not on duty. Even when an attempt was made by foreign health consultants to save the situation, the doctor on duty got angry and said he was not obligated to listen to any foreign consultants that had been brought into the matter with the sole purpose of ensuring nothing goes wrong.\n\n\u201cWife of the former CBN deputy governor was asked to pay N600,000 as deposit, even when it was a referral case, with accruing medical bill to be settled by the CBN. At a point, Dr. Mailafia complained over his breathing problems and pleaded with the doctors to place him in a ventilator. The doctors flatly refused.\n\n\u201cEven after the doctors declared Dr. Mailafia dead, foreign consultants who were brought into the matter through Dr. Mailafia\u2019s son that is living abroad, had directed a family member, who is a medical professional, with the wife of the CBN deputy governor, to mount pressure on the chest of Dr. Mailafia for resuscitation and thereafter place him on a life support.\n\n\u201cThe doctors in Gwagwalada refused all entreaties by the family members of Dr. Mailafia to follow the advice of the foreign consultants, insisting that they had already pronounced him dead. Even when the wife could feel the pulse of her husband, the doctor flatly declared there was nothing they could do since they had already pronounced him dead.\n\n\u201cWhile the above narration sums up the circumstances under which Dr. Mailafia died, we still await the result of the actual cause of his death. As a nationalist and patriot that he was, Dr. Mailafia was completely dedicated to the emancipation of ethnic nationalities from the clutches of oppression.\n\n\u201cThe economist was never afraid to speak truth to power just as he remained committed to the enthronement of justice and equity to all citizens across ethnic and religious divides.\n\n\u201cIn the twilight of his life, this consummate technocrat and global scholar of repute beamed his searchlight on the raging insecurity ravaging our country. He expressed regrets over government\u2019s incapacity to rein in the activities of insurgents and criminal groups terrorising the nation.\u201d\n\nThere were tributes yesterday from many Nigerians mourning the former CBN deputy governor.\n\nA chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, described the death of Dr. Mailafia as a \u201cgreat loss to Nigeria and his beloved family that he loved dearly\u201d.\n\n\u201cI just got off the phone with Dr. Bitrous Porgu, President of the Middle Belt Forum to confirm the distressing news popping up on my phone. It is true we have lost Obadiah Malafia,\u201d he said.\n\nThe national leaders of an emerging political platform, the National Consultative Front (NCF), expressed shock and sadness over Mailafia\u2019s demise.\n\nA statement by its spokesperson Rukaiya Mohammed described the late Mailafia as an indomitable icon who would be greatly missed by the leadership of the group.\n\nAlso, spokesman of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), Luka Binniyat, said: \u201cYou know, following his harassment by the DSS, he has been taking refuge from place to place.\u201d\n\nHuman Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) yesterday alleged that Dr. Mailafiya may have been killed.\n\nIn a joint statement by its National Coordinator Emmanuel Onwubiko and National Media Affairs Director, Miss Zainab Yusuf, the organisation called for an independent autopsy to ascertain the cause of Mailafia\u2019s death.\n\nPresident of Yoruba Ronu Leadership Forum, Akin Malaolu, mourned the late banker and prayed for his soul rest in peace.",
          "summary": "Mailafia\u2019s was later given the option of choosing three hospitals: Gwagwalada Hospital, National Hospital and EHA Clinics.\nOn arrival, the name of the doctor that was billed to attend to Dr. Mailafia was not on duty.\nAt a point, Dr. Mailafia complained over his breathing problems and pleaded with the doctors to place him in a ventilator.\n\u201cWhile the above narration sums up the circumstances under which Dr. Mailafia died, we still await the result of the actual cause of his death.\nAs a nationalist and patriot that he was, Dr. Mailafia was completely dedicated to the emancipation of ethnic nationalities from the clutches of oppression.",

          "text": "By Joseph Jibueze, Deputy News Editor\n\nState laws, court rulings create problems of how and where to pay\n\nStates will reject FIRS bid to alter Exclusive List\n\nMbam seeks political solution\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nManufacturers and service providers under the Organised Private Sector of Nigeria (OPSN) have expressed their worries over how to pay the Value Added Tax (VAT) and to who.\n\nThey urged the Federal Government to clear the controversy.\n\nThe OPSN comprises the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), the Nigeria Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Nigeria Employers Consultative Association (NECA), Nigeria Association of Small Scale Industries and the Nigeria Association of Small and Medium Enterprises.\n\nVAT is a sales tax paid when goods are purchased and services are rendered. It is charged at 7.5 per cent.\n\nChairman OPSN, Taiwo Adeniyi, at the weekend, said the controversy had created uncertainty for businesses, especially on the collection and remittances of VAT.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that by September 21 we will get penalised if we do not pay or remit the VAT for the month of August.\n\n\u201cWe are also aware that laws are not made in retrospect. It then means that even if those laws have been enacted, particularly the Lagos State law which came into effect in September, it will not affect the payment by businesses in the state.\n\n\u201cDue to our remittances, we have issues with the fact that the law for Rivers was made in August and the majority of the businesses in Lagos usually will have a relationship with the Rivers State Inland Revenue too.\n\n\u201cThe confusion in the public space is the reason we are calling on the government to come to our aid as we want to pay.\n\n\u201cIt is for the government at the centre to make a pronouncement as to what becomes of us,\u201d he said.\n\nAdeniyi, who is also the NECA President, said the situation had the potential to make businesses pay double VAT in view of demands by the FIRS and state governments.\n\nHe said businesses, as the collecting agents, were unclear on the authority to remit to.\n\n\u201cIt is a popular saying that where two elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers.\n\n\u201cIt is no longer news that Nigerian businesses have been battling with myriads of challenges, making the survival of enterprises and ease of doing business in the country among the worst in this part of the world,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso yesterday, Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, said the amendments to the Constitution being sought by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) would be killed at the Houses of Assembly.\n\nThe agency had written the National Assembly to propose that VAT should be included in the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\nAkeredolu said the law does not empower the Federal Government to collect VAT and share with the states, adding that the VAT should be under the states.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the position of the law. The FIRS seeking amendment is a confirmation that they don\u2019t have the power. The amendment will be dead on arrival.\n\n\u201cWhy seek an amendment to a constitution when the provision is so clear?\u201d Akeredolu said.\n\nThe governor, who spoke on \u2018Arise TV Sunday Talk Show\u2019, insisted that if the Federal Government was to collect VAT for states, it could only get a percentage.\n\n\u201cYou can only collect VAT on behalf of the states and hand their money over to them. You can only take percentage there for helping us to collect the money,\u201d he said.\n\nChairman of the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), Elias Mbam, believes the issue should be resolved politically.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the VAT, I am reluctant to comment on it because it is in court and the lawyers say it is subjudice but I will make a personal observation.\n\n\u201cI think we are overheating the process and it is not as simple as many people see it and I don\u2019t think court will be the answer. A table like this will provide a better answer.\n\n\u201cIt is a complex issue that I believe it shouldn\u2019t be. We need to sit down at the table and consider the realities on the ground and get clarity as a country.\n\n\u201cRemember if you make VAT become a state issue, a state can increase its own rate to 10 per cent.\n\n\u201cSo, the goods you charge four per cent, by the time it gets to my state, I can give you 10 per cent or you take it back. It is better we sit down and talk to ourselves.\n\n\u201cRemember, VAT is not part of our money or what we allocate. VAT sharing formula is different.\n\n\u201cThe sharing formula is that the Federal Government gets 15 per cent, the state gets 50 per cent and the local government 35 per cent as against what I read.\n\n\u201cThen when the state gets 50 per cent, they have 50 per cent equality of that share, then they have 30 per cent based on population and then 20 per cent on derivation.\n\n\u201cIf the derivation is a problem then they can say, if we generate this money, 20 per cent is too small for us, let us agree on something else.\n\n\u201cBut to say we go to court and struggle, it will not end anywhere. Let us sit down and talk it over.\u201d\n\nThe confusion arose from the August 9 judgment of Justice Steven Pam of the Federal High Court in Port-Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, which voided the VAT Act and empowered states to collect VAT.\n\nFollowing the judgment, Rivers and Lagos states passed laws empowering them to collect VAT.\n\nThe FIRS appealed the judgment but lost an application for a stay of its execution.\n\nBut the Court of Appeal on September 10 ordered parties to maintain status quo ante-bellum.\n\nDissatisfied, the Rivers government urged the Supreme Court to set aside the Court of Appeal ruling ordering status quo.\n\nIt also urged the apex court to disband the Appeal Court panel and order the constitution of another one to hear the case.\n\nLast Thursday, Rivers and Lagos urged the Court of Appeal to stop FIRS from collecting VAT pending the determination of the issues.\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Chief Mike Ozekhome, had argued that the Court of Appeal order on status quo empowered Rivers to collect VAT.\n\n\u201cClearly, the status quo ante bellum was before the breakout of the hostilities.\n\n\u201cThe law (Rivers VAT law) was already in operation before the FIRS challenged the validity of the judgment that had given the Rivers State Government the power to collect the VAT.\n\n\u201cSo, the status quo is that it is the Rivers State Government that has the power to collect VAT, until perhaps, the Court of Appeal rules otherwise and set aside the FHC judgment.\u201d",

          "text": "By Sunday Ani, Chukwudi Nweje and Chinelo Obogo\n\nMixed reactions have trailed the position of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) that power would remain in the north after 2023.\n\nNEF\u2019s spokesman, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, had said since the region control majority of the votes, it should not play the second fiddle.\n\nWhile some dismissed the statement as political, others maintained that there was a gentleman\u2019s agreement about the rotation of the presidency between north and south which should be respected.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Alex Ogbonnia, said those with such views were definitely in the minority, stressing that triumph of good over evil was as sure as life.\n\n\u201cThere are two groups of Nigerians \u2013 those who want the country to remain as a corporate entity and for it to progress and grow in one hand, and those that don\u2019t want the unity of this country but want it to retrogress. But in all of this, there is what we call conscience and that makes it imperative that people with good ideas will always be greater in number\u2026\n\n\u201cThat is the role of conscience in human beings, because ultimately, those who are in favour of equity, justice and fairness will be more in number. So, those northern elders saying this (power will remain in the north) will definitely be in the minority because there was a gentleman\u2019s agreement that power should be rotating between north and south. And it has been like that since 1999. So, for justice, equity and fairness, power must rotate to the South East in 2023. So, whatever happens, truth will always prevail over falsehood.\u201d\n\nNational president, Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Pogu Bitrus, said power shift is determined by political parties and not northern elders.\n\n\u201cIt is not for northern elders to determine what happens in PDP, APC or any political party for that matter. It is what the parties want to do that will carry the day. So, they are just making a political statement that is neither here nor there,\u201d he said.\n\nSpokesperson for Alhaji Atiku Abubakar during the 2019 presidential elections, Umar Sani, said PDP would likely consider the fact that the north has only had the presidency for two years on its platform since 1999 in making its decision on zoning.\n\n\u201cIf the APC decides to zone it to the north after eight years of Buhari, then it is morally wrong, but will it be morally wrong for PDP to zone it to the north seeing that the north has only had it for two years on its platform?\u201d\n\nTanko Yakassai said the Southern Governors Forum was not recognised by the country\u2019s constitution and as such, they cannot dictate to any Nigerian whom to vote for.\n\n\u201cThe statement by the Southern Governors Forum that the presidency must be zoned to the South in 2023 is an exercise in futility because there is no provision in the constitution where a governor is empowered to dictate to Nigerians how they should cast their votes.\u201d\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of pan-Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, Jare Ajayi said every part of the country should be free to field a candidate of their choice, but that equity and fairness dictates that the presidency should go to the southern part of the country.\n\nHe said more important than where the presidency should be zoned to is that Nigeria needs to be restructured before the 2023 general election.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "By Lukman Olabiyi\n\nSpeaker of the House of the Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, ex governor of Anambra State and vice presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Obi, former chairman of the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC), Mallam Nuhu Ribadu and others have said secession would not address challenges facing various ethnic or region in Nigeria.\n\nThey said what every citizen needs and cares for is level playing field, justice, equity, fairness and good governance.\n\nThey spoke amidst call for secession at the 112th anniversary celebration of the Kings\u2019 College Old Boys Association (KCOBA) over the weekend\n\nThe theme for the event was: \u201cUnity in Diversity\u2026 Stronger Together.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila, who delivered the keynote address, declared that ongoing review of the constitution by the National Assembly would not produce a perfect constitution, stressing that \u201cthere is no such thing anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the House of Representatives, we are currently in the process of a substantive review of our nation\u2019s constitution. Our objective is to deliver a constitution that more effectively organises our politics to make it more inclusive, enshrine efficient mechanisms for holding the institutions of state to account and put an end to the debilitating conflicts that continue to tear our nation apart. We would not produce a perfect constitution; no such thing has ever existed anywhere in the world. Indeed, some part of the world have unwritten constitutions. However, together we can by the choices we make and our actions use our constitution as a foundation document to give life to the people of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nObi, Ribadu and the former minister of state, Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Bagudu Hirse, who were the panelists, gave different views on what is threatening the unity of country.\n\nObi said the country cannot stay united unless there was equity and justice. According to him, Nigeria has about 250 ethic groups , which is far below that of India with over 2,000 ethnic groups and Indonesia with 1,300 ethnic groups adding that both countries were doing far better than Nigeria\n\n\u201cYou cannot stay united when there is injustice; we cannot stay united if you don\u2019t allow people to operate on a level playing field. If Nigeria was a productive country, our diversity could have been a source of strength but we are a sharing country\u2019.\n\n\u201cOur country is not a productive country but a country of consumption and sharing. Once it is a sharing economy, it becomes difficult to be united because everybody wants to be part of the sharing,\u2019\u2019 he said.\u2019\n\nRibadu stated that ethnic or religion has nothing to with challenges facing the country. Rather, he blamed them on individual attitudes, lack of love for each others and bad governance.\n\nRibadu said Nigeria is work in progress, stressing that Nigerians needs to do their best to keep the country united.\n\nHe warned Nigerians to avoid what happened in Rwanda and Somalia but rather emulate Tanzania, which he said is one of the peaceful\n\nHirse called on Nigerians to do aways with what would divide the country and embrace what would unite the people.\n\nHe also shared agreed with other panalists on the issue of good governance, justice, fairness and equity.\n\nKCOBA President, Alhaji Kashim Ibrahim-Imam, observed that Nigeria is experiencing the worst turbulence in its history. He stressed the need for Nigerian to come together and find solution to the problems.\n\nHe also pleaded with Gbajabiamila to sponsor a bill that would hand over King\u2019s College to the Board of Trustees adding that government has no business managing secondary schools.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "*Says southern governors support electronic transmission of election results\n\n* Wants SWF, instead of NNPC, to manage host community fund in PIA\n\nChinedu Eze\n\nGovernor of Ondo State and Chairman, Southern Governors Forum, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, has said the move by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) to push for amendment of the constitution so as to put collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) on the Exclusive List would fail. Akeredolu stated this during an interview on \u201cTHISDAYLIVE\u201d, a programme monitored on Arise News Channel, yesterday.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cThe issue of VAT, looking at the constitution, is under the purview of the states. Southern governors have taken a decision to pursue fiscal federalism. I am a lawyer. This is not a tax that is under the purview of the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe, the southern governors, clamour for true federalism and true federalism includes fiscal federalism. There is no room for equivocation. Southern governors have taken a decision. They know that the constitution did not give them the power to collect VAT and that is why they are clamouring for the amendment of the constitution.\n\n\u201cThat amendment will be dead on arrival. Even if the governors agree to amend the constitution, the House of Assembly in the various southern states will never approve it. The amendment must follow laid down process.\n\n\u201cWe are supposed to be a federation, but we have been operating unitary government, rather than the federal arrangement. That plan to amend the constitution over VAT will fail.\u201d\n\nAccording to Akeredolu, the recent comment by the governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, who opposed the move for states to collect VAT because the consumption tax forms 40 per cent of the allocation that accrue to his state, is his personal opinion. Akeredolu insisted that the southern governors were united in their resolve to push for states\u2019 collection of tax.\n\nOn the southern governors\u2019 insistence that the next president of Nigeria should come from the region, Akeredolu said the governors spoke the people\u2019s mind. He said people in the region had decided that in recognition of fairness and equity, now that the North had produced a president, who would end his administration in 2023, it should be the turn of southern Nigeria to produce the next president of the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are not a pressure group, so we are not threatening anyone, but we represent the people of the South. We have agreed that after President Muhammadu Buhari, it will be the turn of the South to present the next president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are responsible governors who want to realise the yearnings of our people. We took that decision when we met in Asaba. We reiterated that decision when we met in Enugu.\u201d\n\nThe Ondo State governor also denied reports that the governors might be planning to pick one of their members and support to become the next president of Nigeria, saying such an idea has never been part of their discussion.\n\nResponding to a question on the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the Ondo State governor said the forum had taken some steps to push for the amendment of the legislation, in conjunction with the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF), because some of its contents negated the power of the states and dealt directly with the communities, \u201cas if the communities are not under the control of the states.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the southern governors also disagreed with the three per cent contribution for host communities, saying, \u201cThere are areas we have agreed on. We are also asking, why not use the Sovereign Wealth Fund, instead of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), to manage the host community fund?\u201d\n\nThe chairman of Southern Governors Forum also spoke about electronic transmission of election results, saying the southern governors affirmed their support for the initiative in order to ensure transparency. He urged legislators from the southern part of the country to ensure they represented the people that elected them into office.\n\nAkeredolu said there would be a day of reckoning for those who turned against the wishes of those that elected them into political positions.\n\nOn the anti-open grazing law, he said the governors would not rescind their resolve on the matter, saying the law is not targeted at anyone, but meant to ensure the safety of lives and property.\n\nAkeredolu stated, \u201cThe anti-open grazing law is not targeted at anybody. We have our own livestock farmers. If they graze their cattle in the open, the law will catch up with them. I don\u2019t want to respond to Miyetti Allah or whatever you call them. We are not dealing with associations; we are dealing with government.\n\n\u201cWe have our own association. In Ondo, we are taking the law seriously and those Miyetti Allah in Ondo are cooperating. We have gone past that anachronistic way of rearing cattle. You can feed them at one place and they will do better. Katsina State has also banned open grazing and they have even banned interstate movement of cattle.\u201d\n\nThe governor also spoke on the in-fighting in his ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and his visit to the national leader of the party, Bola Tinubu. Akeredolu said when he visited the former governor of Lagos State he was recuperating well, adding that his loyalists are looking forward to his return.\n\nAkeredolu described Tinubu as the \u201cCapone\u201d of politics in the zones.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Raises hope of meeting OPEC October quota\n\n*Buhari directs incorporation of NNPC Ltd, retains Kyari, Ajiya\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nFor the first time since 2020, Nigeria\u2019s rig count, which had been on the decline, soared to 11 in August, signalling readiness by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and its partners to pump more oil.\n\nThis was just as President Muhammadu Buhari, in his capacity as Minister of Petroleum Resources, yesterday triggered Section 53(1) of the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) by directing the incorporation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited under the new law. The president also approved the formation of a new board, which would be overseen by Senator Ifeanyi Ararume, a career politician from Imo State.\n\nThe significance of this appointment is that the president has appointed a south-easterner into a high profile federal position and in a critically sensitive government company.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that the new board is made up of three women namely: Mrs. Lami O. Ahmed (North-central), Senator Margaret Chuba Okadigbo (South-east) and Barrister Constance Harry Marshal (South-south), which is a reflection of gender diversity and inclusiveness.\n\nThe other board members are Dr. Tajudeen Umar (North-east), Mallam Mohammed Lawal (North-west) and Chief Pius Akinyelure (South-west). However, the president retained the Group Managing Director, NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, as Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Umar Ajiya as Chief Financial Officer of the corporation on the new board.\n\nMeanwhile, in the last few months, Nigeria had been unable to meet the quota allocated to it by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), due to weakening infrastructure and difficulty in restarting oil facilities that were shut down because of the cuts in production assigned to the country.\n\nBut latest data from the OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) indicated that the country\u2019s oil rigs have climbed from a low of five in the second quarter of 2021, to 11, as of last month. A further analysis of the data showed that while in 2018, the average rigs count was 13, it was 16 in 2019, but fell to 11 in 2020, a reduction by five oil rigs.\n\nSince the third quota of 2020, the count had continued to slump, first to eight in that quarter, and seven in July, but with an addition of four rigs for the month of August, raising hope of more production.\n\nPut side by side with a country like Algeria, the North African nation has a high of 50 and low of 21, while the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for instance, has a high of 62 and a low of 40.\n\nIn the oil industry, the rig count is a major index of measuring activities in the upstream sector, with a breakdown showing that Nigeria utilised six, seven, and six rigs in January, February, and March 2021, respectively, against 21, 23, and 21 used in the corresponding period of 2020, when production was about two million bpd.\n\nDespite asking for a higher baseline, in June, July and August, Nigeria failed to meet the existing quota assigned to it by OPEC for the months, losing 90,000 barrels per day in the month of August alone. When cumulated for the entire month, this amounted to roughly 2.8 million barrels, making last month\u2019s production of 1.43 million bpd one of the lowest in five years.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia and Iraq were the main drivers of OPEC\u2019s production for August, with an additional production of 290,000 bpd and 200,000 bpd, respectively, Nigeria, which has a capacity to produce two million bpd, other things being equal, slumped from its July figure of 1.520 million bpd, according to an OPEC document.\n\nProduction growth in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s highest oil producer, going by recent data, is proving a major challenge due to infrastructure challenges and technical difficulties, leading to shut-ins.\n\nIn addition to decreasing rig counts and highly degraded facilities due to old age and lack of investment, there have also been instances of community workers\u2019 protests, which incessantly disrupt operations, leading to severe losses.\n\nThe previous month, a document obtained by THISDAY showed that the NNPC and its partners lost 6.035 million barrels of crude oil to emergency shutdowns.\n\nIn its August presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC), which held between the 18th and 19th of last month, the corporation recorded that there were 32 of such incidents throughout its facilities in the country.\n\nA breakdown of the losses, according to the document, indicated that the highest combined shortage of 1.62 million barrels was from Qua Iboe, with 200,000 barrels due to production shut-in arising from flare management and low well head pressure.\n\nStill on Qua Iboe, a further 530,000 barrels were lost to shut-ins following tank top concerns, 650,000 barrels as a result of production cut-back as directed by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), as well as a loss of 240,000 barrels due to a gas leak on one of the assets.\n\nThis was followed by losses from the Forcados facility, which shed 200,000 barrels, 84,000 barrels, 30, 000 barrels and 80,000 barrels, respectively on different days, with reasons ranging from leak repairs, tank top issues, fire incident, and declaration of force majeure.\n\nBuhari Directs Incorporation of NNPC Ltd, Retains Kyari, Ajiya\n\nAnnouncing the latest decisions and changes to the board, the Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity), Mr. Femi Adesina, in a statement, stressed that the president gave the order in his capacity as petroleum minister.\n\nOn the other hand, the member of the board representing the South-south, Senator Magnus Abe was replaced with Harry-Marshal, a lawyer. He also dropped Dr. Stephen Dike from the board and replaced him with Senator Margaret Chuba Okadigbo.\n\nThe statement explained, \u201cThis is in consonance with Section 53(1) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, which requires the Minister of Petroleum Resources to cause for the incorporation of the NNPC Limited within six months of commencement of the Act in consultation with the Minister of Finance on the nominal shares of the company.\u201d\n\nThe statement pointed out that Kyari had been directed to take necessary steps to ensure that the incorporation of the NNPC Limited was consistent with the provisions of the PIA 2021.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cPresident Buhari has also approved the appointment of the board and management of the NNPC Limited, with effect from the date of incorporation of the company.\n\n\u201cThe president named Senator Ifeanyi Ararume as Chairman of the Board while Mele Kolo Kyari and Umar I. Ajiya were appointed as Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, respectively,\u201d it stated.\n\nWith Buhari\u2019s latest directive, the Minister of State, Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Sylva, ceases to be the alternate chairman of the board, since the NNPC would begin to operate under a new law, which would see it detached from the apron strings of the government.\n\nWhen the process is fully consummated, NNPC would cease to exist as specified under the law and would eventually be transformed into a private company that would pay taxes and dividends to its shareholders, Kyari said in a recent interview.\n\nThe latest decisions by Buhari also imply that the new company would be incorporated under the Companies Allied Matters Act (CAMA), while all assets and liabilities of NNPC will be transferred to the new company.\n\nExplaining this, Kyari had stated, \u201cComing back to the NNPC, the provision of the law clearly states that the corporation will be transformed into a CAMA company.

          "text": "James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele has said the apex bank is ready to approve legitimate foreign exchange (FX) demand that exceeds the approved transaction cap if such applications meet stipulated requirements.\n\nThe CBN governor gave the assurance against the backdrop of complaints that the current FX policy which limits transactions to $5,000 may not fulfil consumers\u2019 actual needs.\n\nBut Emefiele, while addressing journalists over the weekend, said the CBN was ready to approve requests from commercial banks to go beyond the caps if it is proven that the extra demand for FX is for legitimate purposes.\n\nHe said, \u201cIndeed, I want to put it on record; if the amount you want is even above the limit that is recognised and we find that the reason you are making those demands is legitimate, your bank will speak to us and we will give you more than what is even the limit.\u201d\n\nHe further insisted that the Investors and Exporters (I&E) Window of the central bank remains the major market which anyone seeking to procure or sell foreign exchange should patronise.\n\nWhile urging customers to go to their banks for their FX needs, the CBN Governor said, \u201cThe only exchange rate that I recognise today in the Nigerian foreign exchange market which is the dominant market remains the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sorry to say that I do not and I do not intend to recognise that there are any other rates in the market,\u201d he added.\n\nThe CBN governor also reiterated that the much anticipated Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) also known as the eNaira would debut on October 1, adding that the bank has all the approvals and mandate to launch on the said date.\n\nHe explained, \u201cBut it is important to note that the eNaira is not a one-off but a journey that start on October 1. October 1 marks the beginning of the eNaira journey. On October 1, a Nigerian should be able to download the eNaira App from either Google Play Store or Apple Apps Store and onboard themselves and find their eNaira wallets using their bank accounts or with cash at a registered agent located across the nation and conduct transfers.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cLet\u2019s imagine a bank has about N10 billion in physical cash in its account. We can decide that out of the N10 billion we move N2 billion into an electronic wallet for the bank.\n\n\u201cSo if you are a customer and you have say N10 million with your bank, for your comfort of spending and making purchases, you could tell the bank to load N2 million out of your N10 million and so your bank balance sitting in physical currency drops to N8 million while the eWallet carries N2 million. With that you can make purchases both within and across the country.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank boss also explained that there are many variants of the eNaira adding that other components would be introduced whenever it is deemed fit to do so.\n\nHe said,\u201d We are not going to pretend that there are no risks in opening your system up. We will look at the various products, determine the risks, determine the best way to mitigate the risks before opening it up.\n\n\u201cBut it is a journey that we are determined and decided that we will start on October 2021.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "PDP Zoning C\u2019ttee Meets Wednesday to Take Critical Decisions",
          "text": "*May throw presidential ticket open\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nAll things being equal, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Convention committee on Zoning, headed by the Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, has scheduled to meet on Wednesday, where it is expected to critical decisions on the zoning of offices for the October 30 and 31 national convention.\n\nBut from all indications, there are evident signs that the party might throw open itspresidential ticket to all the six geopolitical zones since it might have resolved to keep its national chairmanship in the South.\n\nChairman of the National Convention committee of the Party and Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, had last Thursday urged the Ugwuanyi committee to hasten up the zoning of the offices.\n\nTHISDAY, however, learnt last night that the zoning committee would meet Wednesday in Enugu and possibly come with the zoning of the offices of the National Working Committee.\n\nThis latest development, THISDAY learnt, might have followed new calculations on the zoning of the office of the leadership of the party.\n\nIn the new thinking, however, the office of the national chairman, might be zoned to South as against micro-zoning it to any particular zone or state in the region.\n\nYet, other offices of the NWC, might be left open as they were before the 2017 national convention of the party.\n\nA top PDP source told THISDAY that the Ugwuanyi committee has decided to be fair to any of the national chairmanship aspirant from the south by ensuring that the office was open to all to avoid any litigation from anyone over constitutional right.\n\nThat, nonetheless, the entire work of the Ugwuanyi committee would be subject to the final ratification of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party.\n\nBut sources have claimed that though there\u2019s been clamour that the presidential ticket be specifically zone to the south in line with the agitation from the southern governors, the party might adopt the position of the Governor of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed, whose committee reviewed the outcome of the 2019 presidential election.\n\nThe Mohammed committee had recommended that on the basis of equity and fairness as well as calibre of Nigerians believed to be capable of being the president, the ticket should be thrown open.\n\nThe committee had anchored its position on the fact that across the land, Nigeria boasts good hands capable of bailing the country \u201cout of her current quagmire.\u201d\n\nMohammed, therefore, said: \u201cIn line with certain unwritten conventions of the nation\u2019s history, many people think that, for fairness and equity, the North-East and South-East geo-political zones that have had the shortest stints at the Presidency, should be given special consideration, in choosing the presidential flagbearer of the party, for the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWhile we admit that this is a strong argument, we should not lose sight of the fact that Nigeria is endowed with many capable and very experienced leaders in every part of the country. Moreover, the exigencies of the moment demand that nothing should be compromised in choosing the leader, with the attributes to disentangle the country from the present quagmire.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we think that every Nigerian, from every part of the country, should be given the opportunity to choose the best candidate, through a credible primary election; as a way of institutionalising a merit-based leadership recruitment process, for the country.\u201d\n\nAnother party source told THISDAY that in view of the clamour by the southern governors and indeed, the PDP governors, that it might not be out of place for the presidential ticket of the party be thrown open, even if the national chairman of the party was from the south after the October 30 and 31 national convention.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cWater will always find its level and it is common knowledge that all the presidential aspirants that have indicated interest are from the north.\n\n\u201cThe PDP as a political party cannot force any politician from the South to contest for the presidential ticket of the party. The politicians from the south have to come out and contest. No one can force the southern politicians to contest.\n\n\u201cSo, this is one of the reasons why it had to be thrown open, so that whoever is interested should come out and contest,\u201d the source.\n\nIt also contended that the presidential ticket should be left to those who are interested, andnot what would be forced on those who are not ready to do the job.\n\n\u201cLook at what is happening in the northern part of the country, many aspirants have indicated interest in contesting, none so far from the Southeast. Even Peter Obi, who was a presidential running mate to Atiku Abubakar, as we talk, has not indicated interest.\n\n\u201cBut check out the north, the number of those aspiring to contest are many. No one should force anyone to contest. We cannot force any one, who is not prepared to come and be the PDP presidential candidate. You must work for it, because we are looking for a willing presidential candidate, who has the capacity,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nFormer Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Kingsley Moghalu has advised the federal government to evolve a well-defined strategy to attract foreign direct investments (FDIs) that would help solve the challenges of human capital and infrastructure development.\n\nHe made the recommendations when he delivered a keynote address titled, \u201cBack to Basics: How to Make Foreign Investment Work for Nigeria,\u201d which he delivered at the United States-Nigeria Investment Summit held in New York City, at the weekend.\n\nMoghalu, who is also the President and CEO of Sogato Strategies LLC explained: \u201cNigeria should now require, as a matter of strategic national interest, that any investment in natural resources and solid mineral include a beneficiary on plan to add value to them before export, as opposed to extraction and exports of crude oil and other natural resources.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Nigeria is a country of significant potential for FDIs, \u201cbut for several reasons including a weak macroeconomic environment, policy inconsistency and the absence of a well-defined strategy for FDI as a component of economic growth strategy, FDI into Nigeria has declined markedly in the past several years.\u201d\n\nMoghalu, who was a former presidential candidate in the 2019 general election, also noted that FDI would play an important role in Nigeria\u2019s development if certain conditions exist or would be met because such investments do not automatically trigger productivity.\n\n\u201cIt can complement, but not substitute local factors that are essential for development,\u201d he said.\n\nThese conditions, according to him, include the understanding that the impact of FDI on developing countries depended very much on the host country\u2019s level of development.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe assumed benefit of technology transfer from FDI only happens when the investment is made in economies which themselves are actively engaged in research and development (R&D).\n\n\u201cForeign investment can help lift a country from poverty if it is targeted at the real economy, for instance electricity, manufacturing, service industries, and export oriented industries, and uses local suppliers, as opposed to a lopsided focus on extraction industries.\n\n\u201cThe most important requirements for FDI to successfully contribute to real development in a country like Nigeria (depends on) the presence of a well-educated workforce, and infrastructure. It is this question of the absorptive capacity of an economy, which is determined by how well educated and skilled a workforce is to take advantage of the possible technology and employment generated by FDI that determines whether or not FDI contributes to real economic growth.\u201d\n\nMoghalu also stated that Nigeria\u2019s quest for FDIs should begin with clearly defined priority sectors that should be woven into a single thread that becomes the basis for execution, communication and engagement with potential investors.\n\nHe also advised the government to develop factor endowment that would have skilled human capital as a priority need.\n\n\u201cThe presence or absence of productive knowledge in a society is the most important foundation for economic transformation, which remains necessary for a country such as ours with an economy still in need of diversification,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also enjoined the government to evolve an FDI paradigm shift away from extractive industries to value-added derivatives of such industries.\n\nMoghalu also said Nigeria should evolve a legal regime that would offer strong investor protections in order to facilitate increased flows of high quality investment.\n\n\u201cBeyond this, Nigerian authorities \u2013 and foreign investors- should incorporate political risk guarantees into major FDI agreements.\n\n\u201cThis includes making use of guarantees offered by the World Bank Group\u2019s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) for losses relating to currency inconvertibility and transfer restrictions, expropriation, terrorism, war and civil disturbances, breaches of contract, and failure to honor sovereign financial obligations.\n\n\u201cImprove the quality of governance and institutions: assessments of governance and institutional capacity to create a sustainable investment environment play an important role in attracting quality investment,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "TIMELINE: Four Staunch Critics Of Lawless Buhari-led Government Who Have Died Within Eight Months",
          "text": "Four staunch critics of the Muhammadu Buhari-led government have died in the last eight months.\n\nThey include a 2nd Republic lawmaker and popular government critic, Dr. Junaid Mohammed, who died on February 18, 2021.\n\nIn 2015, Mohammed, who trained as a medical doctor, began to take on the Buhari-led government.\n\nHe had in 2016 accused the President of running a government that is based purely on nepotism rather than merit.\n\nSee Also News Buhari's Staunch Critic, Junaid Mohammed Is Dead\n\nJunaid Mohammed\n\nThe deceased was one of the first Nigerians who stated publicly that the President\u2019s nephew, Mamman Daura, had become the most influential man in Nigeria.\n\nHe had said, \u201cThe most influential person in the Presidency today is one Mamman Daura who as you know, is a nephew of the President. His father was Buhari\u2019s elder brother.\n\n\u201cIn addition, Mamman Daura was the one who singlehandedly brought up Abba Kyari, the current Chief of Staff to the President. In fact, Abba Kyari knows Mamman Daura more than he knows his own father.\n\n\u201cNext, the Personal Assistant to Buhari himself is the son of Mamman Daura, next is what they call SCOP, State Chief of Protocol, and is also a son-in-law to Mamman Daura because he is married to Mamman Daura\u2019s daughter. Next, the minister they unilaterally chose, against the interest of the party and against the wishes of Sokoto people, happens to be the daughter of the younger sister of Mamman Daura\u2019s wife. Both of them are daughters of Sultan Dasuki, who was sacked by General Abacha.\n\n\u201cWe have the Aide De Camp to Buhari himself, Colonel Abubakar. He is married to the granddaughter of one of Buhari\u2019s elder sisters. Next, we have the woman who represents Kaduna in the Federal Executive Council, she is a cousin to Kaduna State governor, Nasir el-Rufai. It is well known that el-Rufai is one of the closest governors to Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cNext, we have the Minister for the Federal Capital Territory. The Minister of the FCT is the man called Musa Bello, who used to be the Managing Director of the Northern Nigeria Development Corporation, which used to be the biggest holding company that belonged to all the northern states. His only qualification to be FCT minister is the fact that his father has been Buhari\u2019s friend over the years.\n\n\u201cNow, there is a young man called Sabiu Yusuf, nicknamed Tunde \u2013 probably because of the late General Tunde Idiagbon. He is another PA to President Buhari. He is also a grandson of another sister of Buhari. This is enough to prove to you that this is shamelessly the worst form of nepotism in the history of government in Nigeria. In fact, in the history of Africa, let me make bold to assert that I have never seen any level of nepotism that has equalled or surpassed this in my entire life \u2013 I am now in my 67th year.\n\n\u201cAnother thing I also want you to know is that, Amina Zakari, who was and still a national commissioner in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) representing the entire seven states in the North-West, it is being claimed that Buhari knows nothing about her appointment (before he became President); it is a lie.\n\n\u201cWhen President Goodluck Jonathan was re-organising the INEC and he was bringing in Prof. Attahiru Jega, he reached out to Buhari and asked Buhari to nominate somebody from the North-West so that that person would be a national commissioner. Of all the people in the North-West, Buhari decided to nominate his own niece, the daughter of his elder sister- Amina Zakari. She has been there; when Jega left, Buhari was determined to make her chairman, it was because of the massive backlash that he dropped the idea like hot potatoes. As we are talking today, that woman is a national commissioner which means she is one of the principal election umpires. Throughout my reading of history, political science, and social sciences generally, I have never heard of any dictator or any tyrant under any system of government whether totalitarian or fascist, appointing his own niece to conduct elections in which he was either a party or going to be a party to; Buhari has done that. The immediate younger brother to Amina Zakari is currently the Minister for Water Resources representing Jigawa State in the same Buhari government.\n\n\u201cIn addition, even though they are from Kazaure, Kazaure is contiguous to Daura. The eldest sister of both of them is now the Commissioner for Education in the All Progressives Congress (APC) government in Jigawa State. If this is not nepotism, then I don\u2019t know what is nepotism and anybody who has the guts, the brutal arrogance to appoint these relations not bothering about public opinion, about the sense of justice, about competence, then you can see that he has a very serious question to answer. There are two mysterious cases.\u201d\n\nA few months later, on April 3, the death of Yinka Odumakin, a human rights activist and critic of the Buhari-led government, was announced.\n\nYinka Odumakin\n\nOdumakin played a key role in the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) that fought the regime of General Sani Abacha after the annulment of the June 12, 1993 election.\n\nSee Also News Odumakin Will Be Difficult To Replace, Afenifere Leader, Adebanjo Says\n\nHe was also one of the spokespersons of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF), the body representing ethnic nationalities in the South-West, South-South, South-East, and the Middle Belt.\n\nOdumakin, who was married to another activist, Dr. Joe Odumakin, was one of the strongest critics of the present government.\n\nHe consistently took on the Buhari-led government over alleged impartiality and favouritism in appointment into various offices.\n\nHis voice was also very loud in condemning the activities of killer herdsmen in Yorubaland.\n\nShortly before his death, he warned the Nigerian government against arresting a Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Igboho for issuing a quit notice to the Fulani herders in Ibarapa, Oyo State and subsequently ejecting the Sarkin Fulani in Igangan.\n\nAnother vocal voice against the current administration, Barrister Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance (CAGG) died on September 18.\n\nOlusegun Bamgbose\n\nBamgbose in one of the last statements he released before his death told President Buhari to stop sleeping and hold meetings at midnight to tackle the nation\u2019s deteriorating security situation.\n\nMaking reference to the recent attack on the Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA), which was carried out around 1 am, he said it was obvious bandits do not sleep, wondering why Nigerian leaders should sleep comfortably while the country is on fire.\n\nHe said the bandit attack on NDA, one of Nigeria\u2019s strongest security units, has shown that the criminals have no atom of respect or fear for the Nigerian military.\n\nThe senior lawyer further pointed out that due to his constant warnings with no accompanying action, the bandits now have no atom of regard for the President.\n\nIn April 2021, the deceased also questioned the morality of Buhari to remain at the Presidential Villa.\n\nBamgbose claimed Nigerians committed a great blunder electing Buhari in 2015 but those who repeated the mistake in 2019 cannot be forgiven.\n\nExactly two days after Bamgbose died, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia was pronounced dead.\n\nMailafia\n\nThe former deputy governor, who was the Presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress in the 2019 election, was a known government critic and had advocated for public sector and exchange rate reforms.\n\nMailafia had during a radio programme alleged that repentant Boko Haram members had revealed to him that a serving Northern governor was a commander of the terrorist group.\n\nVideo of Repentant Bandits Named One Northern Governor As Boko Haram Commander In Nigeria \u2014Mailafia Repentant Bandits Named One Northern Governor As Boko Haram Commander In Nigeria \u2014Mailafia WATCH VIDEO: Repentant Bandits Named One Northern Governor As Boko Haram Commander In Nigeria \u2014Former CBN Deputy Governor, Mailafia\n\nEarly in September, he described the alleged 'fulanisation' of Nigeria as real, just as he disclosed that there was an ongoing plot by Buhari\u2019s administration to foist an alleged Fulani and Islamic agenda on Nigerians.\n\nMailafia had said, \u201cThe kind of Islam that is coming from Sahara is dangerous.

          "title": "TIMELINE: Four Staunch Critics Of Lawless Buhari-led Government Who Have Died Within Eight Months",
          "text": "Four staunch critics of the Muhammadu Buhari-led government have died in the last eight months.\n\nThey include a 2nd Republic lawmaker and popular government critic, Dr. Junaid Mohammed, who died on February 18, 2021.\n\nIn 2015, Mohammed, who trained as a medical doctor, began to take on the Buhari-led government.\n\nHe had in 2016 accused the President of running a government that is based purely on nepotism rather than merit.\n\nSee Also News Buhari's Staunch Critic, Junaid Mohammed Is Dead\n\nJunaid Mohammed\n\nThe deceased was one of the first Nigerians who stated publicly that the President\u2019s nephew, Mamman Daura, had become the most influential man in Nigeria.\n\nHe had said, \u201cThe most influential person in the Presidency today is one Mamman Daura who as you know, is a nephew of the President. His father was Buhari\u2019s elder brother.\n\n\u201cIn addition, Mamman Daura was the one who singlehandedly brought up Abba Kyari, the current Chief of Staff to the President. In fact, Abba Kyari knows Mamman Daura more than he knows his own father.\n\n\u201cNext, the Personal Assistant to Buhari himself is the son of Mamman Daura, next is what they call SCOP, State Chief of Protocol, and is also a son-in-law to Mamman Daura because he is married to Mamman Daura\u2019s daughter. Next, the minister they unilaterally chose, against the interest of the party and against the wishes of Sokoto people, happens to be the daughter of the younger sister of Mamman Daura\u2019s wife. Both of them are daughters of Sultan Dasuki, who was sacked by General Abacha.\n\n\u201cWe have the Aide De Camp to Buhari himself, Colonel Abubakar. He is married to the granddaughter of one of Buhari\u2019s elder sisters. Next, we have the woman who represents Kaduna in the Federal Executive Council, she is a cousin to Kaduna State governor, Nasir el-Rufai. It is well known that el-Rufai is one of the closest governors to Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cNext, we have the Minister for the Federal Capital Territory. The Minister of the FCT is the man called Musa Bello, who used to be the Managing Director of the Northern Nigeria Development Corporation, which used to be the biggest holding company that belonged to all the northern states. His only qualification to be FCT minister is the fact that his father has been Buhari\u2019s friend over the years.\n\n\u201cNow, there is a young man called Sabiu Yusuf, nicknamed Tunde \u2013 probably because of the late General Tunde Idiagbon. He is another PA to President Buhari. He is also a grandson of another sister of Buhari. This is enough to prove to you that this is shamelessly the worst form of nepotism in the history of government in Nigeria. In fact, in the history of Africa, let me make bold to assert that I have never seen any level of nepotism that has equalled or surpassed this in my entire life \u2013 I am now in my 67th year.\n\n\u201cAnother thing I also want you to know is that, Amina Zakari, who was and still a national commissioner in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) representing the entire seven states in the North-West, it is being claimed that Buhari knows nothing about her appointment (before he became President); it is a lie.\n\n\u201cWhen President Goodluck Jonathan was re-organising the INEC and he was bringing in Prof. Attahiru Jega, he reached out to Buhari and asked Buhari to nominate somebody from the North-West so that that person would be a national commissioner. Of all the people in the North-West, Buhari decided to nominate his own niece, the daughter of his elder sister- Amina Zakari. She has been there; when Jega left, Buhari was determined to make her chairman, it was because of the massive backlash that he dropped the idea like hot potatoes. As we are talking today, that woman is a national commissioner which means she is one of the principal election umpires. Throughout my reading of history, political science, and social sciences generally, I have never heard of any dictator or any tyrant under any system of government whether totalitarian or fascist, appointing his own niece to conduct elections in which he was either a party or going to be a party to; Buhari has done that. The immediate younger brother to Amina Zakari is currently the Minister for Water Resources representing Jigawa State in the same Buhari government.\n\n\u201cIn addition, even though they are from Kazaure, Kazaure is contiguous to Daura. The eldest sister of both of them is now the Commissioner for Education in the All Progressives Congress (APC) government in Jigawa State. If this is not nepotism, then I don\u2019t know what is nepotism and anybody who has the guts, the brutal arrogance to appoint these relations not bothering about public opinion, about the sense of justice, about competence, then you can see that he has a very serious question to answer.

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has said Northern Nigeria inherited leadership, insinuating that the British colonial administrators handed over the leadership of the country to the North in 1960.\n\nThe group said, for this reason, the North will not succumb to intimidation to give up the presidency in 2023.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari, a northerner, has been Nigeria's President since 2015, winning the election in 2019 for a second term in office.\n\nThe Southern region expects to produce the next President in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, the Northern group also stated that the region will fix its economy so as not to depend on other regions which it accused of intimidating the North.\n\nThe group revealed this through its spokesman, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed who delivered a keynote address at the maiden Maitama Sule Leadership Lecture Series organised by the students' wing of Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, last weekend.\n\nBaba-Ahmed also charged the students to be proud of who they are, challenging them not to accept being treated as second-class citizens in their own country.\n\n\u201cThe North is not for sale and northerners will surprise those waiting for them to queue up in 2023 and be given money in exchange for their votes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will lead Nigeria the way we have led Nigeria before, whether we are President or Vice President, we will lead Nigeria. We have the majority of the votes and democracy says vote whom you want.\n\n\u201cWhy should we accept second class position when we know we can buy form and contest for first class and we will win? Why does anybody need to threaten us and intimidate us? We will get that power, but be humble because power comes from God. We inherited leadership, being honest is not being stupid.\n\n\u201cThere are Nigerians who believe that because the economy of the North is being crumbled; we are running away from insecurity, we are politically vulnerable, they think they can buy us for 2023 but they are making a mistake\n\n\u201cWe are ready for this; we will consider every economic adversity, challenge, we will fix the Northern economy and we are the only one who can fix this Northern economy. For that reason, we are not for sale. We are in the process of rebuilding the North and we will rebuild the North from 2023.\n\nHe also charged the youths to be active in politics, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t accept second class status because you are a northerner. No northerner is a second-class citizen in this country. If we want to support a southerner, we will support a southerner because that will be in our own interest and we can decide for ourselves.\u201d",
          "summary": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has said Northern Nigeria inherited leadership, insinuating that the British colonial administrators handed over the leadership of the country to the North in 1960.\nThe group said, for this reason, the North will not succumb to intimidation to give up the presidency in 2023.\nMuhammadu Buhari, a northerner, has been Nigeria's President since 2015, winning the election in 2019 for a second term in office.\nMeanwhile, the Northern group also stated that the region will fix its economy so as not to depend on other regions which it accused of intimidating the North.\nWe are in the process of rebuilding the North and we will rebuild the North from 2023.",

          "title": "A backstory to the tussle between CBN and popular website abokiFX",
          "text": "abokiFX, a popular mobile and web-based platform that collates the black market foreign exchange rates in Nigeria, on Friday announced it will temporarily suspend the publishing of rates on all its platforms, hours after receiving threats from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe apex bank had said it would shut down the platform, which Governor Godwin Emefiele described as \u201cillegal and criminal\u201d and accused of carrying out an \u201cillegal activity that undermines the economy\u201d.\n\nAfter the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s two-day meeting in Abuja, Emefiele confirmed that the apex bank was also planning to prosecute abokiFX\u2019s supposed owner, Olusegun Adedotun Oniwinde, for \u201cillegal forex trading\u201d and \u201ceconomic sabotage\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have given instructions to our experts to go after his website and let it be clear that we will go after him because we can\u2019t allow this to continue,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that the CBN does not recognize any foreign exchange market window apart from the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window.\n\nWhy Nigeria has different exchange rates\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest producer of oil, a commodity that brings in more than 90% of the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings. Between 2014 to 2016, a plunge in global oil prices caused a dollar crunch that resulted in an economic recession.\n\nBut rather than an outright devaluation of the naira, the CBN adopted a multiple exchange-rate regime. This involved keeping a stronger rate pegged to the U.S. dollar for official transactions and a weaker floating rate for investors and exporters, known as the NAFEX window.\n\nOther rates were introduced for travelers and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) while there\u2019s also the parallel or black market, where foreign currencies are traded unofficially and the naira is often valued less than the NAFEX rate.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA historic plunge in oil prices triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic last year caused a more severe scarcity of hard currency in Nigeria. The CBN was forced to devalue the naira twice last year, amid other measures meant to stabilise the exchange rate such as limiting forex deposits and withdrawals over the counter and banning the sale of forex to exchange bureaus.\n\nIn March, the apex bank also replaced the exchange rate at the official window, set at \u20a6379/$1, with the NAFEX rate of \u20a6410.25/$1, as part of efforts to ditch the multiple exchange rate system that\u2019s been said to distort the market and frustrate foreign investors, in favor of a single-rate system. That left Nigeria with only two rates \u2013 the NAFEX rate and the parallel market rate \u2013 from almost five different rates as of early 2020.\n\nWhere abokiFX comes in\n\nBefore abokiFX, Nigerians wanting to change currencies in the unofficial black/parallel market could only obtain information on rates manually, such as through phone calls to money changers.\n\nHowever, the platform, which was launched in 2014 has gained popularity as a go-to source for information on the value of the naira against the major foreign currencies in the black market. It is used by market operators for trading and news organisations for reporting.\n\nIn recent weeks, and particularly after the CBN stopped forex sales to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators a month ago, the value of the naira has plummeted sharply, with the gap further widening between the parallel and NAFEX rates.\n\nBefore the ban, the local unit traded at around \u20a6520/$1 but fell to \u20a6570/$1 on Friday. A day before, the naira recorded its biggest single-day plunge in the parallel market in several months, a \u20a68.00 or 1.42% decline from \u20a6562/$1 on Wednesday to \u20a6570/$1, per abokiFX data.\n\nMeanwhile, data on the FMDQ securities exchange window, where forex is traded officially, showed that naira closed at \u20a6412.88/$1 on Friday. Currency speculators profit from this difference between the black market and official rates through round-tripping and other forms of currency manipulation practices that negatively affect the value of the local currency.\n\nAllegations of economic sabotage\n\nAccording to the CBN Governor, Oniwinde, who is based in the United Kingdom, publishes arbitrary rates without contacting BDCs and uses his website for forex manipulations and speculations, making profits from the significant disparity in rates quoted on abokiFX and the official exchange rate.\n\nEmefiele added that the apex bank had been studying the activities of the platform in the last two years. \u201cThere was a time we asked our colleagues to call the abokiFX to ask how he conducts the rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CBN act section 2, does make it clear that only the Central Bank can determine the value of the naira, and yet a single individual living in England continues to manipulate the exchange rate and make a huge profit which he withdraws through an ATM in London.\n\nA screenshot of the abokiFX website.\n\n\u201cIt is economic sabotage and we will pursue him, wherever he is, we will report him to international security agencies, we will track him, Mr. Oniwinde, we will find you, because we cannot allow you to continue to conduct an illegal activity that kills our economy,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nThe CBN head also alleged that Oniwinde was an illegal forex dealer with over 20 bank accounts in eight banks that are filled with money from speculative activities and he\u2019s sold \u201ctens of millions of forex\u201d to several Nigerian companies, violating the country\u2019s foreign exchange laws.\n\nabokiFX debunks claims\n\nabokiFX in a statement released on Friday debunked the CBN\u2019s claims and said all allegations towards its director were not confirmed.\n\n\u201cAll allegations against our director are yet to be confirmed but we at abokiFX DO NOT trade FX nor do we manipulate parallel market rates,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOutside the media allegation, we have not received any communication from any government body and our accounts are not closed as stipulated in the media.\u201d\n\nThe company has, however, temporarily suspended rate updates on all its platforms to \u201cget better clarity of the situation\u201d, adding that it \u201csincerely hopes the suspension will lead to the Naira appreciation from next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal rates have been posted this evening but the abokiFX news section and the crypto rates section will still be active,\u201d the statement adds. \u201cWith our decision to temporarily suspend online rates publication, we are aware that there will be limited visibility of parallel rates information which will impact decision making for many.\u201d\n\nThe abokiFX statement.

          "title": "Africell exits Ugandan telecom market due to fierce competition",
          "text": "On September 7, Africell announced its decision to leave Uganda after operating in the East African country for seven years. The decision saw the U.S-owned company become the latest network operator to throw in the towel and exit a market dominated by two pan-African telecom behemoths.\n\nA statement issued by Africell blames tough competition from the local units of MTN and Bharti Airtel, both of which account for more than 90% of the market share. The remaining 10% is split between three or four other nationwide operators including Africell and Uganda Telecom.\n\nSouth Africa-based MTN Group, Africa\u2019s largest telecoms operator, entered Uganda in 1998 and has since established dominance in the market; largely due to first-mover advantage and significant investments the business has made in Uganda.\n\nAirtel, which launched 12 years later, has mainly relied on acquisitions to scale its market position. After entering Uganda through the purchase of Zain\u2019s operations, the company, in 2013, fully acquired Warid Telecom for $100 million; the first-ever in-country acquisition in the sector that increased Airtel\u2019s subscriber base by over 50%.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWith operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), The Gambia, and Sierra Leone, Africell launched in Uganda in 2014 after buying the local operations of French telecom giant, Orange.\n\nAt the time of the acquisition, 8 operators were serving a population of around 36 million Ugandan residents, with total subscriptions estimated at less than 20 million. It appeared Africell was entering an untapped market and the company bet on data services to eat into the market share of incumbents.\n\n\u201cWhen entering new markets, Africell\u2019s objective is always to introduce competition in a manner that benefits local consumers and communities,\u201d Sam Williams, the firm\u2019s communications director told TechCabal. \u201cIn Uganda, our goal was to provide an appealing alternative to the incumbent duopoly, by focusing (among other things) on fast and reliable data services.\u201d\n\nAfricell is reputed for its affordable internet service packages and relative network stability in Uganda, which saw it gain the trust of a substantial number of subscribers. But like its predecessors, the company struggled to make a notable impact in a mobile market reputedly hostile to new entrants.\n\nThe perils of playing third fiddle\n\nThe economics of being number three on the telecoms players list in a relatively small and saturated market makes little commercial sense for Africell or any potential entrant.\n\nUganda has over 24 million mobile subscribers with MTN controlling 50% of the market while Airtel Uganda accounts for 43%. This means newcomers are forced to share in a limited pool of subscribers left over by the leaders.\n\nFor instance, other telecom players in South Africa apart from MTN and Vodacom have struggled to make consistent profits. MTN also decided against reapplying for a license in Ethiopia, to avoid trailing behind Ethio Telecom and Safaricom.\n\nAccording to Williams, Africell \u201cbuilt a strong position\u201d in Ugandan urban centers already dominated by its competitors. However, a wider rollout to underserved areas would have required a significant longer-term investment that would have been difficult to recover given the size of Africell\u2019s market share.\n\n\u201cIn a market where two incumbents control that much market share already, it\u2019s definitely going to be very challenging for other operators to break in,\u201d Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cTelecommunications is capital intensive. Masts, towers, fibre, and data centres do not come cheap. Without a significant number of subscribers, it\u2019s going to be hard to recoup returns on investment.\u201d\n\nAn Africell Shop in Uganda. Image credit: Techjaja\n\nOrange invested significantly in new technologies before deciding to cut short its losses. Since it entered Uganda via a shareholding agreement with HiTS Telecom in 2009, the French firm was only able to get around 700,000 subscribers \u2013 roughly 3.3% of the market share at the time.\n\nAfricell claims to have grown the inherited number of subscribers to about 2.3 million within seven years, becoming the country\u2019s third-largest player, according to data available on the firm\u2019s website.\n\nHowever, data from Omdia shows that figure is closer to 1.6 million, some way off the pace compared to almost 15 million subscribers for MTN and 12.8 million for Airtel. It\u2019s also reportedly been losing its share of the market slowly, which fell from about 7% at the end of 2019 to 5% at the end of June 2021.\n\n\u201cWe decided to end operations following a careful analysis of how the Uganda business fits into our overall Africell Group strategy,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of the fact that \u2013 in our view \u2013 investment in our other markets is a more sustainable route to our goal of advancing the African telecoms sector.\u201d\n\nA flurry of exits\n\nAfricell hasn\u2019t been the only victim of MTN and Airtel Uganda\u2019s dominance. Before Africell\u2019s decision to pack, at least four other players have either exited or been bought out by bigger players after failing to break into the inner circle of the market.\n\nIn addition to the acquisition of Warid, which at the time was the third-largest player and had offered the biggest threat to the MTN-Airtel duopoly, K2 Telecom\u2019s operation was absorbed by Airtel in 2018.\n\nSmart Telecom exited the market in August of this year; and Vodafone, with all its solid financial backing, could only challenge for three years before it eventually quit.\n\nWith Africell\u2019s exit, only three major network providers currently operate in Uganda, a landlocked country with a population of over 44 million people.\n\nWhat next for Africell?\n\nWhile it struggled to grow its market share, Africell also grappled with high operating costs and debt burden, part of which was inherited from Orange. In 2019, the company\u2019s losses reportedly rose to over Ksh1.5 trillion ($400 million), with the bulk of its debt due to cell tower operators.\n\nPart of the conditions set by the sector\u2019s regulator, the Uganda Communication Commission (UCC), before Africell formally winds up operations is the payments of its creditors. Without giving out specific details, Williams disclosed that discussions are currently ongoing between the relevant parties.\n\nIn 2019, Africell signed a financing agreement worth $100 million with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a U.S. government funding agency. The investment is expected to be deployed across Africell\u2019s remaining markets while it\u2019s also planning to launch operations in Angola by the end of this year.\n\nAfricell\u2019s exit from Uganda will come as good news to the likes of MTN, which is gearing up to sell 20% of its shares to the public via an IPO, in line with a government directive issued last year.\n\nCurrent Africell subscribers in the country must close their accounts and switch to alternative mobile providers by October 7, with the company saying it will provide support and guidance during the migration process.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Africell will return mobile sites to third-party owners while network technology equipment will be transferred to other units within the Africell Group. The operator\u2019s mobile frequency and spectrum holdings will be returned to the UCC and it claims to have notified GSMA of the termination of roaming partner agreements.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "Inside story of electronic bank fraud in Nigeria",
          "text": "More than six high-profile electronic bank fraud cases took place in Nigeria between February and July this year. Among these was the failed attempt on an account of a Federal Government parastatal domiciled with one of the first-generation banks in which well over N1 billion was transferred to various accounts across different banks in the country.\n\n\u201cIt failed,\u201d some repentant bank hackers, told BusinessDay, \u201cbecause the transfers were done over the NEFT platform and it takes 24 hours to clear on that platform. So, it was detected before the money could clear.\u201d\n\nBarewa, Ele, and Ereke (not real names) are repentant bank hackers. It took months to cultivate their trust. \u201cWe used to be in the business,\u201d Ereke told BusinessDay, after getting assurances of anonymity.\n\nThe digital revolution in banking has resulted in an equivalent revolution in e-banking frauds. PwC in a recent report on Payments in Emerging Markets notes that to meet the need for financial inclusion, there has been a rapid expansion of new technologies and innovations, which are helping to make it more economically viable for banks to reach the \u2018unbanked\u2019 or \u2018underbanked\u2019 populations. Technology has leapfrogged from branch banking to e-banking and now mobile money, which has helped to create pockets of strength even among the less financially inclusive countries.\n\nIn Nigeria, usage of mobile-based payment systems has increased due to wide access to mobile phones as a payment form, both on the customer usage side and acceptance (merchant) side.\n\nA 2020 McKinsey & Co report observed that \u201ca youthful population, increasing smartphone penetration, and a focused regulatory drive to increase financial inclusion and cashless payments, are combining to create the perfect recipe for a thriving fintech sector.\u201d\n\nBut these variables have not just been drivers of financial inclusion alone. The Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBBS) warned that \u201cthe increase in transaction processing, speed and available channels comes with an unavoidable side effect \u2013 more vectors for fraudulent activities.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NIBSS, fraud-related transactions reportedly cost Nigerian banks on average N14 billion in losses annually. These figures, some within the banking sector, believe are understated.\n\nThe Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) in 2018 sought to investigate some banks for the inadequate rendition of returns to the Corporation on instances of fraud, forgeries, and cases involving members of their staff who were either dismissed or had their appointments terminated on grounds of fraudulent activities. The NDIC made the decision in the light of the report from its Off-Site Supervision of the banks, which revealed the number of fraud cases attributed to internal abuse by staff of banks increased from 231 in 2016, to 320 in 2017, or 38.53 percent above the figure reported for the previous year.\n\nToday, e-banking frauds have developed into a mega industry where cyber criminals deploy sophisticated tools to steal information and scam account holders. The list of bank frauds perpetrated online is endless.\n\nElectronic bank fraud\n\nIn September 2020, the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation arrested four Nigerian nationals in Muntinlupa City of the country for alleged involvement in an international syndicate that hacks and siphons funds from banks.\n\nAccording to the NBI, the fraudsters\u2019 transactions were traced when they hacked a system of one Philippine bank, where at least P100 million ($2m) were transferred into a different account.\n\nIn early 2016, a criminal gang penetrated the security systems of Bangladesh Bank with malware that cloned legitimate transactions. On February 4, the malware sent 35 withdrawal requests through the international SWIFT system to the New York Federal Reserve, where the Bangladeshi central bank had money on deposit. The fraudsters attempted to steal a total of $951 million. Thirty of the orders, worth $850 million, were blocked by the New York Fed, but the gang succeeded in having $101 million transferred to banks in Sri Lanka and the Philippines before their activities were noticed, thanks to a spelling mistake in one of the transfer requests. Subsequently, $20 million was recovered from a Sri Lankan bank, but officials were too late to stop the remaining $81 million from disappearing.\n\nIn January this year, the Police in Edo State arrested six suspected bank hackers who stole N5 million from a victim\u2019s account. One of the suspects, Adesola Kayode, was said to have confessed to the police: \u201cWe buy stolen SIM cards from armed robbers and thieves. We normally assess the ones that have money in their bank accounts and remove the money.\u201d\n\nIn July 2021, the police in Kano State arrested eight men and two women for belonging to a syndicate that specialises in hacking individuals\u2019 bank accounts to withdraw money.\n\nAlmost a year earlier, a Lagos High Court convicted Abbas Mohammed and a Bureau De Change operator, Ibrahim Saidu Jogal, who connived to hack into the flexible database of Union Bank of N2,550,000,000 (two billion, five hundred and fifty million naira).\n\nIn February, Obiwanne Okeke, who once appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine, was jailed for 10 years in the US over a cyber fraud scam that led to the theft of about $11 million. Obinwanne Okeke, also known as Invictus Obi, used Nigerian-based companies to defraud people in the US. His companies used phishing emails to steal funds from victims.\n\nIn one phishing attack in 2018 he managed to gain access to the email of a manager at Unatrac Holding Limited, the export sales office for Caterpillar\u2019s heavy industrial and farm equipment. They made fraudulent wire transfers to the value of nearly $11 million, and moved the funds overseas.\n\nElectronic or e-banking in Nigeria has become so expansive that it is hard to believe that it was only in the 2000s that this reality began to gain prominence within the country\u2019s financial landscape.\n\nHow frauds are committed, those behind them and their methodologies\n\nTargeting the business account of a large corporate or public sector organisation requires fraudsters to always recruit an insider from within the target organisation. In the case of the Federal Government parastatal targeted in April this year, such an insider was able to aid the hacking of the accounting platform of the parastatal by accessing the log-in details of as many as six approving officials.\n\nA device known as a \u2018Grabber\u2019 will be connected to the key-board of an approving officer\u2019s computer. The work of the grabber is to collect and send all actions on the keyboard to the fraudsters wherever they may be\u201d. The major objective of the fraudsters at this point is to get the password of the approving officers.\n\nWith the fraudsters\u2019 computer system connected to the parastatal\u2019s server, they now had a system that served as the link between the server and themselves. At this point, they could now comfortably operate from within or outside the country.\n\nThis is made possible by installing a software like TeamViewer which makes it further possible to connect multiple computers to one server once the master hard disc (computer connected to host server) is connected to the server of the targeted bank. TeamViewer is a remote access and remote control computer software that connects computers, smartphones, servers, IoT devices including robots, with fast, high performance connections through a global access network. It was first released in 2005, and its functionality has expanded step by step. It is proprietary software, but does not require registration and is free of charge for non-commercial use. It has been installed on more than two billion devices.\n\nI ask if they are aware of the recent hacking of a first-generation bank in early August. They all mention the name of the bank in unison. \u201cWord spreads around,\u201d they tell me. \u201cIt is impossible to undertake such a big project without word spreading in the community. People have to be recruited, accounts have to be opened and money has to be evacuated. You can\u2019t do that alone,\u201d one of them says.\n\nAccording to the Police Special Fraud Unit, after hacking the Flex-Cube Universal Banking System (FCUBS) of the bank, Salau Abdulmalik Femi created fictitious credits totalling One Billion, Eight Hundred Thousand Naira (N1,868,900,000.00) on the accounts of three of the bank\u2019s customers and successfully consummated debits (outflows) amounting to Four Hundred and Seventeen Million, Five Hundred and Forty-Two Thousand Naira (N417,542,000.00) through Internet Banking transfers to other banks.\n\nOver N1.8 billion was transferred out of different accounts domiciled with the bank using the most secure anti-fraud device known as TOKEN, as the gateway. What they did was to reconfigure existing TOKENS of other customers of the bank and refresh it to match a targeted account in the bank that has good money. Account providers then provided accounts which were credited with amounts ranging from twenty million naira (N20m) to five hundred million naira (N500m) depending on the volume the accounts can carry without raising a red flag.\n\nRead Also: How to protect yourself from rising e-banking fraud\n\nHow are these huge amounts evacuated and laundered through the system?\n\nThis is where the Bureaux De Change comes in. BDCs are the major platforms for laundering fraud-based monies. There is a long incestuous relationship between the BDCs and bank fraudsters, a relationship an official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission tells me is well known to the regulators, the police and the anti-graft agencies.\n\nIn late July, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, banned the sale of foreign exchange to BDC operators. The ban, Emefiele said, was necessary because the parallel market had become a conduit for illicit forex flows and graft.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that BDCs have allowed themselves to be used for graft,\u201d he had said. \u201cThis measure is not punitive on anyone, but it is to ensure the CBN is able to carry out its legitimate mandate of serving all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nBDCs are indispensable partners with the fraudsters in major bank fraud operations. The BDCs do not originate any fraud operation, but they serve as the most credible and most practicable instruments for evacuating and laundering the billions of naira hacked out of the banks\u201d.\n\nThe methodology is simple. The BDCs provide accounts to which the fraudsters who have attacked a bank pay let\u2019s say five hundred million naira into. The BDCs will then use the money to purchase dollars from the CBN from which they would pay the fraudsters an agreed percentage of the total amount credited to their accounts. Percentages range from 40 to 50 percent for the fraudster. So, if the BDC buys one million dollars from the CBN with the N500 million given to them by a fraudster, they will give the fraudster between four hundred and five hundred thousand dollars and keep between five hundred and six hundred thousand dollars for themselves as their cut.\n\nWhy do the BDCs get such huge amounts when they are not involved in the initiation and operationalisation of the frauds? It is because the BDCs take the biggest risk. \u201cThey have to be paid well\u201d, I am told, \u201cbecause the BDCs will need lots of money to follow up the case in the event of arrest and investigations. It is not easy to find and arrest the brains behind the fraud. It is easier to trace the flow of money to the BDCs. The BDCs provide the final evacuation accounts for the big money and this can easily be traced to them by the Police or EFCC and when investigations start, the monies would easily be traced to them. With big risk comes big money\u201d.\n\nBut why do BDCs take such big risks? \u201cGreed!\u201d Ereke asserts. \u201cGreed and because they can get away with it\u201d.\n\nHe asks me if I have ever heard of a BDC owner jailed for abetting bank fraud.\n\nI cannot recollect any. He tells me that no BDC owner has ever been jailed for aiding fraudsters after the fact. \u201cSome owners and managers are arrested of course; they settle with the Police or EFCC and are released. Any BDC person jailed is just a low-level employee that has been put forward for just that purpose\u201d.\n\nWho is the Insider?\n\nWhat is the role of Insiders in e-banking frauds? Absolutely no bank fraud of any nature can happen without the collaboration of someone from the inside; a staff of the bank or staff of the organisation whose business account is being targeted. Though the insider in almost all cases is not the originator of the bank fraud, he or they (most times the fraudster will have multiple insiders on a single fraud transaction) playing a significant role in the operation.\n\nThe insider, they tell me, is responsible for plugging the keylogger to the system (for the hardware) or installing it on the system in the case of the software type. A keylogger is a small hardware device not bigger than the smallest flash drive. It is used to record keyboard actions, like keystrokes on a key-board, typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored and recorded. Some keyloggers also come as soft wares.\n\nDeveloped in the then Soviet Union in the 1970s, the Keylogger was first used by KGB (Soviet Intelligence Service) counterintelligence officers who installed keystroke loggers in the US Embassy and Consulate buildings in Moscow. They installed the bugs in Selectric II and Selectric III electric typewriters. It measured the movements of the print head of IBM Selectric typewriters. By doing this, they were able to determine the exact information American diplomats were sending back to their headquarters at the State Department in Washington.\n\nIt is almost impossible for fraudsters to hack into a bank\u2019s system from the outside, because all the banks operate on an intranet system. So, there is always the need for an insider who can smuggle a computer system into the bank and connect it to the server. Such a system must have been configured to provide intranet connectivity of the bank to the fraudsters anywhere they are in the world.\n\nIn addition, an insider is critical to the fraudsters in their understanding of the detailed process required to carry out fraudulent operations on a customer\u2019s bank account. This will include but not limited to initiation and authorisation process, withdrawal limits on specific accounts, confirmation system and approval patterns, among others.\n\nFurthermore, they enable the fraudsters to be very much cognisant of everything happening within the bank after the fraud has taken place. The post-fraud information they provide makes it difficult for the bank to arrest an account holder in the process of trying to make withdrawals because once the banks find out about the fraud, all account holders will be informed by the insider to stay clear for the meantime.\n\nThere is no specific profile of an insider based on tribe, region or religion, but a very distinctive characteristic of such an individual is someone who has gained the trust of his co-workers. They will be careless around him because of his hard work, cheerfulness and willingness to help.\n\nThe typical Insider is almost always a Male. Very few women tend to be willing to take big risks to serve as Insiders.\n\nIn searching for an insider, fraudsters tend to look out for bankers that are sociable and who tend to live above their income. A banker with a drug addiction is a very sure bet for recruitment as an insider. The insiders are cultivated by the fraudsters who expose them to a very lavish lifestyle. \u201cThey fly them on first class air tickets, lodge them in five-star hotels, ply them with some of the most expensive whiskey and wines, and in fact there are cases where senior insiders are flown on weekends to Dubai for operational meetings,\u201d they tell me.\n\nAn insider can be any staff of a bank, depending on the role he or she is expected to play. An insider can be a senior bank staff, junior staff, a bank cleaner or the security seated at the door.\n\n\u201cCertainly, you won\u2019t need a Head of Operations in a bank for the purpose of plugging a keylogger\u201d, Ele informs me. These classes of insiders are mostly casual staff of the bank who most times are aggrieved with their employer for a number of reasons such as low salaries, lack of motivation, bogus target, job insecurity and the ego factors such as having the requisite qualifications as their colleagues who are core staff with better enumeration. Even a cleaner can be recruited for key log plugging.\n\nAn insider that helps provide connectivity for remote access most likely would have a good knowledge of IT, this is so because IT information will be needed in setting up remote access; information such as URL, domain name and general information. Such a person is expected to be able to multitask. Among other things he or she is expected to identify accounts that will be attacked and debited for the fraud.\n\nAccount openers and account peddlers\n\nThese are people whose only role in the fraud cycle is the provision of accounts that will not be traceable to them in the event of fraud. What they do is recruit financially handicapped people in the society and open various bank accounts for them and then collect the ATM cards from them. Their targets are shoe shiners, truck pushers, bike riders (Okada) who have never had any dealings with a bank. The \u2018account peddler\u2019 tends to sell them a glossy but false story about the Federal Government distributing money to the poor through the banks. For these financially excluded persons to be able to access these monies, they are told they first need to open a bank account.\n\nBecause of voter awareness in the northern part of Nigeria most of this group of people have the INEC voter\u2019s card which is one of the means of identification needed to open a savings account. The \u2018peddler\u2019 now provides them with the other requirements needed, such as utility bills, phone number (which the peddler already has), email address and N10,000 (amount needed to open a bank account).\n\nWhen the account is opened and the bank ATM given to the account opener, the \u2018peddler\u2019 collects the ATM from the account owner on the pretext of taking it to the government agency for registration. A day or two later he calls the account holder, and informs him that the money has been paid into the account, gives him N10,000 and tells him that particular account cannot collect the grant twice. So now armed with his BVN from the first account, the \u2018peddler\u2019 will now take the account opener round commercial banks in town, opening accounts and paying N5000 to N10,000 for each account.\n\nAt the end of the day, a single person could provide between 10-12 ATM cards for the peddler. An active Peddler can recruit up to 10 persons in a month, and by doing so he will have control of over 100 accounts that are not traceable to him. In the event of a bank hacking fraud operation, he is able to provide these accounts to the fraudsters. If the fraudster credits each of these cards with N5 million each, the total will amount to over N500 million. He will then be given a percentage of the amount withdrawn from these accounts.\n\nThese funds tend to be withdrawn at different sources such as big departmental stores with the aid of staff such as the Manager or Supervisor of the store at an agreed percentage. He uses the ATM on their POS and collects cash. Petrol filling stations, electronics and car marts also serve as withdrawal points.\n\nOperational team\n\nThere is no specific number of persons required to undertake an electronic bank fraud. The \u2018Chairman\u2019 (initiator and supervisor of a particular fraud) alone determines exactly what he needs for the operation. So, he recruits people based on the input he requires and the operational strategy he has put in place. I am told there is a pool of bank fraudsters of over ten thousand people scattered across the country. So, all the \u2018chairman\u2019 needs, is to access the pool, where he will get all the \u2018specialists\u2019 needed. Each \u2018specialist\u2019 in the team for a specific bank fraud has a specific role to play. Nobody is called upon to participate unless there is a role he or she has to play. These include roles like an Insider to plug the keylogger, an Insider that can provide remote access, account peddlers that will be used for the evacuation of proceeds of the fraud and if need be, a sponsor of the operation.\n\nD-Day\n\nAlmost all bank frauds tend to take place during weekends and public holidays. The reason for this is to allow ample time for the monies hived out of the bank to be squirrelled away. \u201cIt is mostly on Fridays that these operations take place. Public holidays that begin on Thursdays are the most welcome period for bank fraud. This is because there will be sufficient time to carry out the operation, move the funds to twenty to fifty different accounts, and then the weekends and public holiday periods will allow them to withdraw the money through ATMs, POS, supermarket purchases and transfers to BDCs\u201d.\n\nA crime without end\n\nAndy Greenberg in Wired, aptly noted that \u201cthe traditional model of robbing a bank isn\u2019t so different from the old-fashioned method of robbing one. Thieves get in, get the goods, and get out\u201d. In 2016, Nigeria\u2019s central bank warned, \u201cthat this digital journey is plagued with land mines represented by electronic fraud would be stating the obvious, as the world over has shifted security policy stances to a more cybercentric position. The warfare of banking security has changed from what was conventional to a constantly changing strategy in response to the rapid developments in payment technology\u2026\n\n\u201cThe story behind the figures clearly shows that as we move further down the digital path in payments, fraud attempts are bound to increase and the test of our strength as an Industry will be how effective the collaboration among all stakeholders in warding off this imminent threat to the payments system is, not only domestically but also internationally.\u201d\n\nIn today\u2019s world, bank thieves no longer need a sledgehammer and an AK-47 to break into your bank and steal your money. Their weapons of choice today are a harmless computer, an innocuous hardware and software; and with these harmless tools, they are able to steal a lot more money than they could ever have stolen with large instruments of violence. It is unlikely that electronic banking fraud will end anytime soon in Nigeria. While the regulators and the banks have continued to put up electronic ramparts and throw instruments and institutions of the criminal justice system to counteract the fraudsters, this at best is passive resistance.\n\nLack of a willingness by banks and the regulators to invest in understanding the risk landscape, archaic risk assessments, policies, procedures and controls would continue to result in knowledge gaps that serve as broad highways for fraudsters to walk into the Nigerian banking system.\n\nThe NIBBS was right when it posited that, \u201cthe anti-fraud battle can only be won when organisations institute a well-rounded strategy involving sensitisation, investments in well-suited technologies, risk management, effective governance, and industry-wide collaboration with relevant stakeholders.\u201d",

          "title": "Inside story of electronic bank fraud in Nigeria",
          "text": "More than six high-profile electronic bank fraud cases took place in Nigeria between February and July this year. Among these was the failed attempt on an account of a Federal Government parastatal domiciled with one of the first-generation banks in which well over N1 billion was transferred to various accounts across different banks in the country.\n\n\u201cIt failed,\u201d some repentant bank hackers, told BusinessDay, \u201cbecause the transfers were done over the NEFT platform and it takes 24 hours to clear on that platform. So, it was detected before the money could clear.\u201d\n\nBarewa, Ele, and Ereke (not real names) are repentant bank hackers. It took months to cultivate their trust. \u201cWe used to be in the business,\u201d Ereke told BusinessDay, after getting assurances of anonymity.\n\nThe digital revolution in banking has resulted in an equivalent revolution in e-banking frauds. PwC in a recent report on Payments in Emerging Markets notes that to meet the need for financial inclusion, there has been a rapid expansion of new technologies and innovations, which are helping to make it more economically viable for banks to reach the \u2018unbanked\u2019 or \u2018underbanked\u2019 populations. Technology has leapfrogged from branch banking to e-banking and now mobile money, which has helped to create pockets of strength even among the less financially inclusive countries.\n\nIn Nigeria, usage of mobile-based payment systems has increased due to wide access to mobile phones as a payment form, both on the customer usage side and acceptance (merchant) side.\n\nA 2020 McKinsey & Co report observed that \u201ca youthful population, increasing smartphone penetration, and a focused regulatory drive to increase financial inclusion and cashless payments, are combining to create the perfect recipe for a thriving fintech sector.\u201d\n\nBut these variables have not just been drivers of financial inclusion alone. The Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBBS) warned that \u201cthe increase in transaction processing, speed and available channels comes with an unavoidable side effect \u2013 more vectors for fraudulent activities.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NIBSS, fraud-related transactions reportedly cost Nigerian banks on average N14 billion in losses annually. These figures, some within the banking sector, believe are understated.\n\nThe Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) in 2018 sought to investigate some banks for the inadequate rendition of returns to the Corporation on instances of fraud, forgeries, and cases involving members of their staff who were either dismissed or had their appointments terminated on grounds of fraudulent activities. The NDIC made the decision in the light of the report from its Off-Site Supervision of the banks, which revealed the number of fraud cases attributed to internal abuse by staff of banks increased from 231 in 2016, to 320 in 2017, or 38.53 percent above the figure reported for the previous year.\n\nToday, e-banking frauds have developed into a mega industry where cyber criminals deploy sophisticated tools to steal information and scam account holders. The list of bank frauds perpetrated online is endless.\n\nElectronic bank fraud\n\nIn September 2020, the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation arrested four Nigerian nationals in Muntinlupa City of the country for alleged involvement in an international syndicate that hacks and siphons funds from banks.\n\nAccording to the NBI, the fraudsters\u2019 transactions were traced when they hacked a system of one Philippine bank, where at least P100 million ($2m) were transferred into a different account.\n\nIn early 2016, a criminal gang penetrated the security systems of Bangladesh Bank with malware that cloned legitimate transactions. On February 4, the malware sent 35 withdrawal requests through the international SWIFT system to the New York Federal Reserve, where the Bangladeshi central bank had money on deposit. The fraudsters attempted to steal a total of $951 million. Thirty of the orders, worth $850 million, were blocked by the New York Fed, but the gang succeeded in having $101 million transferred to banks in Sri Lanka and the Philippines before their activities were noticed, thanks to a spelling mistake in one of the transfer requests. Subsequently, $20 million was recovered from a Sri Lankan bank, but officials were too late to stop the remaining $81 million from disappearing.\n\nIn January this year, the Police in Edo State arrested six suspected bank hackers who stole N5 million from a victim\u2019s account. One of the suspects, Adesola Kayode, was said to have confessed to the police: \u201cWe buy stolen SIM cards from armed robbers and thieves. We normally assess the ones that have money in their bank accounts and remove the money.\u201d\n\nIn July 2021, the police in Kano State arrested eight men and two women for belonging to a syndicate that specialises in hacking individuals\u2019 bank accounts to withdraw money.\n\nAlmost a year earlier, a Lagos High Court convicted Abbas Mohammed and a Bureau De Change operator, Ibrahim Saidu Jogal, who connived to hack into the flexible database of Union Bank of N2,550,000,000 (two billion, five hundred and fifty million naira).\n\nIn February, Obiwanne Okeke, who once appeared on the cover of Forbes magazine, was jailed for 10 years in the US over a cyber fraud scam that led to the theft of about $11 million. Obinwanne Okeke, also known as Invictus Obi, used Nigerian-based companies to defraud people in the US. His companies used phishing emails to steal funds from victims.\n\nIn one phishing attack in 2018 he managed to gain access to the email of a manager at Unatrac Holding Limited, the export sales office for Caterpillar\u2019s heavy industrial and farm equipment. They made fraudulent wire transfers to the value of nearly $11 million, and moved the funds overseas.\n\nElectronic or e-banking in Nigeria has become so expansive that it is hard to believe that it was only in the 2000s that this reality began to gain prominence within the country\u2019s financial landscape.\n\nHow frauds are committed, those behind them and their methodologies\n\nTargeting the business account of a large corporate or public sector organisation requires fraudsters to always recruit an insider from within the target organisation. In the case of the Federal Government parastatal targeted in April this year, such an insider was able to aid the hacking of the accounting platform of the parastatal by accessing the log-in details of as many as six approving officials.\n\nA device known as a \u2018Grabber\u2019 will be connected to the key-board of an approving officer\u2019s computer. The work of the grabber is to collect and send all actions on the keyboard to the fraudsters wherever they may be\u201d. The major objective of the fraudsters at this point is to get the password of the approving officers.\n\nWith the fraudsters\u2019 computer system connected to the parastatal\u2019s server, they now had a system that served as the link between the server and themselves. At this point, they could now comfortably operate from within or outside the country.\n\nThis is made possible by installing a software like TeamViewer which makes it further possible to connect multiple computers to one server once the master hard disc (computer connected to host server) is connected to the server of the targeted bank. TeamViewer is a remote access and remote control computer software that connects computers, smartphones, servers, IoT devices including robots, with fast, high performance connections through a global access network. It was first released in 2005, and its functionality has expanded step by step. It is proprietary software, but does not require registration and is free of charge for non-commercial use. It has been installed on more than two billion devices.\n\nI ask if they are aware of the recent hacking of a first-generation bank in early August. They all mention the name of the bank in unison. \u201cWord spreads around,\u201d they tell me. \u201cIt is impossible to undertake such a big project without word spreading in the community. People have to be recruited, accounts have to be opened and money has to be evacuated. You can\u2019t do that alone,\u201d one of them says.\n\nAccording to the Police Special Fraud Unit, after hacking the Flex-Cube Universal Banking System (FCUBS) of the bank, Salau Abdulmalik Femi created fictitious credits totalling One Billion, Eight Hundred Thousand Naira (N1,868,900,000.00) on the accounts of three of the bank\u2019s customers and successfully consummated debits (outflows) amounting to Four Hundred and Seventeen Million, Five Hundred and Forty-Two Thousand Naira (N417,542,000.00) through Internet Banking transfers to other banks.\n\nOver N1.8 billion was transferred out of different accounts domiciled with the bank using the most secure anti-fraud device known as TOKEN, as the gateway. What they did was to reconfigure existing TOKENS of other customers of the bank and refresh it to match a targeted account in the bank that has good money. Account providers then provided accounts which were credited with amounts ranging from twenty million naira (N20m) to five hundred million naira (N500m) depending on the volume the accounts can carry without raising a red flag.\n\nRead Also: How to protect yourself from rising e-banking fraud\n\nHow are these huge amounts evacuated and laundered through the system?\n\nThis is where the Bureaux De Change comes in. BDCs are the major platforms for laundering fraud-based monies. There is a long incestuous relationship between the BDCs and bank fraudsters, a relationship an official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission tells me is well known to the regulators, the police and the anti-graft agencies.\n\nIn late July, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, banned the sale of foreign exchange to BDC operators. The ban, Emefiele said, was necessary because the parallel market had become a conduit for illicit forex flows and graft.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that BDCs have allowed themselves to be used for graft,\u201d he had said. \u201cThis measure is not punitive on anyone, but it is to ensure the CBN is able to carry out its legitimate mandate of serving all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nBDCs are indispensable partners with the fraudsters in major bank fraud operations. The BDCs do not originate any fraud operation, but they serve as the most credible and most practicable instruments for evacuating and laundering the billions of naira hacked out of the banks\u201d.\n\nThe methodology is simple. The BDCs provide accounts to which the fraudsters who have attacked a bank pay let\u2019s say five hundred million naira into. The BDCs will then use the money to purchase dollars from the CBN from which they would pay the fraudsters an agreed percentage of the total amount credited to their accounts. Percentages range from 40 to 50 percent for the fraudster. So, if the BDC buys one million dollars from the CBN with the N500 million given to them by a fraudster, they will give the fraudster between four hundred and five hundred thousand dollars and keep between five hundred and six hundred thousand dollars for themselves as their cut.\n\nWhy do the BDCs get such huge amounts when they are not involved in the initiation and operationalisation of the frauds? It is because the BDCs take the biggest risk. \u201cThey have to be paid well\u201d, I am told, \u201cbecause the BDCs will need lots of money to follow up the case in the event of arrest and investigations. It is not easy to find and arrest the brains behind the fraud. It is easier to trace the flow of money to the BDCs. The BDCs provide the final evacuation accounts for the big money and this can easily be traced to them by the Police or EFCC and when investigations start, the monies would easily be traced to them. With big risk comes big money\u201d.\n\nBut why do BDCs take such big risks? \u201cGreed!\u201d Ereke asserts. \u201cGreed and because they can get away with it\u201d.\n\nHe asks me if I have ever heard of a BDC owner jailed for abetting bank fraud.\n\nI cannot recollect any. He tells me that no BDC owner has ever been jailed for aiding fraudsters after the fact. \u201cSome owners and managers are arrested of course; they settle with the Police or EFCC and are released. Any BDC person jailed is just a low-level employee that has been put forward for just that purpose\u201d.\n\nWho is the Insider?\n\nWhat is the role of Insiders in e-banking frauds? Absolutely no bank fraud of any nature can happen without the collaboration of someone from the inside; a staff of the bank or staff of the organisation whose business account is being targeted. Though the insider in almost all cases is not the originator of the bank fraud, he or they (most times the fraudster will have multiple insiders on a single fraud transaction) playing a significant role in the operation.\n\nThe insider, they tell me, is responsible for plugging the keylogger to the system (for the hardware) or installing it on the system in the case of the software type. A keylogger is a small hardware device not bigger than the smallest flash drive. It is used to record keyboard actions, like keystrokes on a key-board, typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored and recorded. Some keyloggers also come as soft wares.\n\nDeveloped in the then Soviet Union in the 1970s, the Keylogger was first used by KGB (Soviet Intelligence Service) counterintelligence officers who installed keystroke loggers in the US Embassy and Consulate buildings in Moscow. They installed the bugs in Selectric II and Selectric III electric typewriters. It measured the movements of the print head of IBM Selectric typewriters. By doing this, they were able to determine the exact information American diplomats were sending back to their headquarters at the State Department in Washington.\n\nIt is almost impossible for fraudsters to hack into a bank\u2019s system from the outside, because all the banks operate on an intranet system. So, there is always the need for an insider who can smuggle a computer system into the bank and connect it to the server. Such a system must have been configured to provide intranet connectivity of the bank to the fraudsters anywhere they are in the world.\n\nIn addition, an insider is critical to the fraudsters in their understanding of the detailed process required to carry out fraudulent operations on a customer\u2019s bank account. This will include but not limited to initiation and authorisation process, withdrawal limits on specific accounts, confirmation system and approval patterns, among others.\n\nFurthermore, they enable the fraudsters to be very much cognisant of everything happening within the bank after the fraud has taken place. The post-fraud information they provide makes it difficult for the bank to arrest an account holder in the process of trying to make withdrawals because once the banks find out about the fraud, all account holders will be informed by the insider to stay clear for the meantime.\n\nThere is no specific profile of an insider based on tribe, region or religion, but a very distinctive characteristic of such an individual is someone who has gained the trust of his co-workers. They will be careless around him because of his hard work, cheerfulness and willingness to help.\n\nThe typical Insider is almost always a Male. Very few women tend to be willing to take big risks to serve as Insiders.\n\nIn searching for an insider, fraudsters tend to look out for bankers that are sociable and who tend to live above their income. A banker with a drug addiction is a very sure bet for recruitment as an insider. The insiders are cultivated by the fraudsters who expose them to a very lavish lifestyle. \u201cThey fly them on first class air tickets, lodge them in five-star hotels, ply them with some of the most expensive whiskey and wines, and in fact there are cases where senior insiders are flown on weekends to Dubai for operational meetings,\u201d they tell me.\n\nAn insider can be any staff of a bank, depending on the role he or she is expected to play. An insider can be a senior bank staff, junior staff, a bank cleaner or the security seated at the door.\n\n\u201cCertainly, you won\u2019t need a Head of Operations in a bank for the purpose of plugging a keylogger\u201d, Ele informs me. These classes of insiders are mostly casual staff of the bank who most times are aggrieved with their employer for a number of reasons such as low salaries, lack of motivation, bogus target, job insecurity and the ego factors such as having the requisite qualifications as their colleagues who are core staff with better enumeration. Even a cleaner can be recruited for key log plugging.\n\nAn insider that helps provide connectivity for remote access most likely would have a good knowledge of IT, this is so because IT information will be needed in setting up remote access; information such as URL, domain name and general information. Such a person is expected to be able to multitask. Among other things he or she is expected to identify accounts that will be attacked and debited for the fraud.\n\nAccount openers and account peddlers\n\nThese are people whose only role in the fraud cycle is the provision of accounts that will not be traceable to them in the event of fraud. What they do is recruit financially handicapped people in the society and open various bank accounts for them and then collect the ATM cards from them. Their targets are shoe shiners, truck pushers, bike riders (Okada) who have never had any dealings with a bank. The \u2018account peddler\u2019 tends to sell them a glossy but false story about the Federal Government distributing money to the poor through the banks. For these financially excluded persons to be able to access these monies, they are told they first need to open a bank account.\n\nBecause of voter awareness in the northern part of Nigeria most of this group of people have the INEC voter\u2019s card which is one of the means of identification needed to open a savings account. The \u2018peddler\u2019 now provides them with the other requirements needed, such as utility bills, phone number (which the peddler already has), email address and N10,000 (amount needed to open a bank account).\n\nWhen the account is opened and the bank ATM given to the account opener, the \u2018peddler\u2019 collects the ATM from the account owner on the pretext of taking it to the government agency for registration. A day or two later he calls the account holder, and informs him that the money has been paid into the account, gives him N10,000 and tells him that particular account cannot collect the grant twice. So now armed with his BVN from the first account, the \u2018peddler\u2019 will now take the account opener round commercial banks in town, opening accounts and paying N5000 to N10,000 for each account.\n\nAt the end of the day, a single person could provide between 10-12 ATM cards for the peddler. An active Peddler can recruit up to 10 persons in a month, and by doing so he will have control of over 100 accounts that are not traceable to him. In the event of a bank hacking fraud operation, he is able to provide these accounts to the fraudsters. If the fraudster credits each of these cards with N5 million each, the total will amount to over N500 million. He will then be given a percentage of the amount withdrawn from these accounts.\n\nThese funds tend to be withdrawn at different sources such as big departmental stores with the aid of staff such as the Manager or Supervisor of the store at an agreed percentage. He uses the ATM on their POS and collects cash. Petrol filling stations, electronics and car marts also serve as withdrawal points.\n\nOperational team\n\nThere is no specific number of persons required to undertake an electronic bank fraud. The \u2018Chairman\u2019 (initiator and supervisor of a particular fraud) alone determines exactly what he needs for the operation. So, he recruits people based on the input he requires and the operational strategy he has put in place. I am told there is a pool of bank fraudsters of over ten thousand people scattered across the country. So, all the \u2018chairman\u2019 needs, is to access the pool, where he will get all the \u2018specialists\u2019 needed. Each \u2018specialist\u2019 in the team for a specific bank fraud has a specific role to play. Nobody is called upon to participate unless there is a role he or she has to play. These include roles like an Insider to plug the keylogger, an Insider that can provide remote access, account peddlers that will be used for the evacuation of proceeds of the fraud and if need be, a sponsor of the operation.\n\nD-Day\n\nAlmost all bank frauds tend to take place during weekends and public holidays. The reason for this is to allow ample time for the monies hived out of the bank to be squirrelled away. \u201cIt is mostly on Fridays that these operations take place. Public holidays that begin on Thursdays are the most welcome period for bank fraud. This is because there will be sufficient time to carry out the operation, move the funds to twenty to fifty different accounts, and then the weekends and public holiday periods will allow them to withdraw the money through ATMs, POS, supermarket purchases and transfers to BDCs\u201d.\n\nA crime without end\n\nAndy Greenberg in Wired, aptly noted that \u201cthe traditional model of robbing a bank isn\u2019t so different from the old-fashioned method of robbing one. Thieves get in, get the goods, and get out\u201d. In 2016, Nigeria\u2019s central bank warned, \u201cthat this digital journey is plagued with land mines represented by electronic fraud would be stating the obvious, as the world over has shifted security policy stances to a more cybercentric position. The warfare of banking security has changed from what was conventional to a constantly changing strategy in response to the rapid developments in payment technology\u2026\n\n\u201cThe story behind the figures clearly shows that as we move further down the digital path in payments, fraud attempts are bound to increase and the test of our strength as an Industry will be how effective the collaboration among all stakeholders in warding off this imminent threat to the payments system is, not only domestically but also internationally.\u201d\n\nIn today\u2019s world, bank thieves no longer need a sledgehammer and an AK-47 to break into your bank and steal your money. Their weapons of choice today are a harmless computer, an innocuous hardware and software; and with these harmless tools, they are able to steal a lot more money than they could ever have stolen with large instruments of violence. It is unlikely that electronic banking fraud will end anytime soon in Nigeria. While the regulators and the banks have continued to put up electronic ramparts and throw instruments and institutions of the criminal justice system to counteract the fraudsters, this at best is passive resistance.\n\nLack of a willingness by banks and the regulators to invest in understanding the risk landscape, archaic risk assessments, policies, procedures and controls would continue to result in knowledge gaps that serve as broad highways for fraudsters to walk into the Nigerian banking system.\n\nThe NIBBS was right when it posited that, \u201cthe anti-fraud battle can only be won when organisations institute a well-rounded strategy involving sensitisation, investments in well-suited technologies, risk management, effective governance, and industry-wide collaboration with relevant stakeholders.\u201d",

          "text": "Bunmi lives in Maitama, a swanky district of Nigeria\u2019s capital city, Abuja. She runs a medium-sized fashion design and fabric procurement outfit from her home from where she dresses a small but well-heeled posse of customers, and supplies draperies and textiles to clients.\n\nShe sighs as she remembers the day, she said changed her life. \u201cIt was on Saturday, July 11th last year,\u201d she said.\n\nWith a corporate account in one of the fastest growing banks in the country, she had become worried after customers, including an international NGO based in the city had paid ninety-three million naira into her corporate account over a two-day period for the supply of fabrics. \u201cI became nervous,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen I neither received alerts nor emails on my phone alerting me to these deposits. It was very unusual. I actually thought it was a network problem. In fact, I hadn\u2019t been bothered initially; it was after a few hours that I began to get agitated. I needed to pay my suppliers in Lagos that Saturday\u201d.\n\nRead Also: How to protect yourself from rising e-banking fraud\n\nBunmi called her friend who works in the bank that evening, and it was then she found out that her alerting system had been compromised. Fraudsters had taken over the phone and email alert instructions she left with her bank and routed the alerts to themselves.\n\nThey had also changed her daily transfer limits of ten million naira.\n\n\u201cThey stole ninety-nine million naira from my account!\u201d she said agonizingly.\n\nBunmi\u2019s account wasn\u2019t the only one hacked that day by fraudsters. Four accounts, including a public sector account were attacked a day before, and four hundred and eleven million was stolen from the bank.\n\nShe said the experience has left her paranoid and suspicious. \u201cI am always going online to check my accounts\u2019 status every now and then. I just have these paranoid thoughts that it\u2019s going to happen again. If the bank hadn\u2019t refunded my money, I would have been ruined.

I cannot remember if we had a phone alert system in place but we certainly received emails from our bankers whenever there were transactions on our accounts\u201d.\n\nLarge public sector organisations as well as big corporate concerns are common targets of certain gangs of bank hackers who want to maximise the economies of scale.

          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nContrary to speculations that the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr. Obadiah Mailafia, died at the National Hospital, the National Publicity Secretary of the Middle Belt Forum, Dr. Isuwa Dogo has disclosed that he died at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, Abuja.\n\nRecall that the Middle Belt Forum was championed by Mailafia.\n\nDr. Dogo also said that the death of the former CBN Governor was shocking and ridden with suspicion.\n\nA statement issued by Dr. Dogo on behalf of the Middle Belt Forum said as someone who relentlessly participated in the activities of the Middle Belt Forum, his untimely death had dealt a deadly blow on ethnic nationalities of not only the Middle Belt but the country at large.\n\nDr.Dogo added that arising from various enquiries from Nigerians over the circumstances of his death, the Forum wished to state that Dr. Mailafia arrived in Abuja last Sunday, September 12, 2021, from Akure and was received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport by his wife.\n\nHe said on arrival at home, the wife noticed that he was not in the best of health conditions and seemed to be suffering from malaria.\n\nDr.Dogo further explained that after three days of treatment without signs of improvement, he went to the CBN Hospital on Friday, September 17, 2021, where he was shabbily treated and that it took the intervention of a senior medic who immediately placed him on oxygen and admitted him.\n\nDr.Dogo stated that Mailafia was later given the option of choosing three hospitals: Gwagwalada Hospital, National Hospital and EHA Clinics.\n\nHe said the wife opted for the third choice and that on arrival at the EHA Clinics, the wife was subjected to yet another moment of anxiety as it took a direct order from the top management of the hospital to accept him.\n\nHe added that after a few hours of treatment, the EHA Clinics told the wife that it was expedient to transfer the former CBN Deputy Governor to Gwagwalada, as the clinic was not fully equipped to handle the case.\n\nDr.Dogo said that the wife opposed the decision and insisted that she was opposed to the idea of taking her husband to Gwagwalada and that Mailafia\u2019s wife only succumbed when the consultant assured her that nothing bad would happen to her husband.\n\nHe said that on Saturday, September 18, 2021, Obadiah was transferred to Gwagwalada and that on arrival, the doctor who was billed to attend to him was not on duty.\n\nHe added that even when an attempt was made by foreign health consultants to save the situation, the doctor on duty got angry and said that he was not obligated to listen to any foreign consultants that had been brought into the matter with the sole purpose of ensuring that nothing went wrong.\n\nDr.Dogo said the wife of the former CBN Deputy Governor was asked to pay the sum of N600,000 as a deposit, even when it was a referral case, with an accruing medical bill to be settled by the CBN, saying that at a point, Mailafia complained over his breathing problems and pleaded with the doctors to place him on a ventilator, which he flatly refused.\n\nHe stated that even after the doctors declared Mailafia dead, foreign consultants who were brought into the matter through Dr. Mailafia\u2019s son who lives abroad, had directed a family member who is a medical professional, with the wife of the CBN Deputy Governor, to mount pressure on his chest for resuscitation and thereafter placed him on life support.\n\nHe said the doctors in Gwagwalada refused all entreaties by the family members of Mailafia to follow the advice of the foreign consultants, insisting that they have already pronounced him dead and that even when the wife could feel the pulse of her husband, the doctor flatly declared that there was nothing they could do since they had already pronounced him dead.\n\n\u201cWhile the above narration sums up the circumstances under which Dr. Mailafia died, we still await the result of the actual cause of his death. As a nationalist and patriot that he was, Dr. Mailafia was completely dedicated to the emancipation of ethnic nationalities from the clutches of oppression.\n\n\u201cThe economist was never afraid to speak truth to power, just as he remained committed to the enthronement of justice and equity to all citizens across ethnic and religious divides,\u201d Dr.Dogo said.",

          "title": "KADINVEST 6.0: Kaduna Is Still Investors\u2019 Destination Of Choice \u2013 KADIPA",
          "text": "Beyond the yearly gathering of intellectuals, captains of industry and top government officials as well as groundbreaking ceremonies and commissioning of some projects, what has Kaduna Investment Summit (KADINVEST) achieved in the last five years?\n\nFor us as a state, the Kaduna Investment Summit (KADINVEST) has helped showcase the state to the world. It has put us on the world map as an investment destination of choice and it has shown people what the Kaduna State Government is doing. We continue to show the world the reforms that we have undertaken to promote investment in the state. And we have seen our investment portfolio grow, which is a plus for us. We have continued to receive inquiries from investors every day. I think the Kaduna Investment Agency (KADIPA) gets many proposals for one project or the other. Every credible businessman is keen on bringing investment in the state and to see how we can work together to develop the state.\n\nHow was KADIPA able to earn investors\u2019 confidence in the last five years, so much that it is an investment destination of choice?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe first was Governor Nasir El-Rufai\u2019s key decision to establish KADIPA as a one-stop shop for investors. Which means that as you come into Kaduna state, there is an agency where you can ask all the questions about investment opportunities. You also have an agency that can guide you and work with other agencies to get your approvals. The next thing that we did was also to get all the agencies that provide services to investors to sign what we call a Service Charter. This charter commits every agency to delivering the service that it provides, within a record period. So, every agency is aware of its responsibility. So, that has built confidence in investors, and it has made us to have a coordinated working relationship with Ministries, Departments and Agencies that support us.\n\nApart from laying the policy framework, how did the agency build the capacity to focus on driving investment processes?\n\nWe have a very robust board which is chaired by the Deputy Governor, Dr Hadiza Balarabe. The reconstituted board also has the former Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammad Sanusi II, as the vice chairman. So, we have a very supportive board. We have also filled up vacancies in the agency with competent hands. We work closely with Development Partners who have continued to assist us in capacity building. And very recently, the state adopted the PPP policy manual, which really gives a framework for how we will enter a public-private partnership with investors, so that things are not done haphazardly. We have trained staff from other MDAs to work with us in this regard. We have trained desk officers in the local governments to also understand how they can drive investments in the area councils.\n\nRecently, we embarked on certification courses for KADIPA staff, to be experts in Public Private Partnerships. The government is also sponsoring a couple of staff for an MBA in Public Private Partnership, in Malaysia University of Science and Technology. We have also restructured the agency. We did a Corporate Planning exercise to make it more vibrant. We worked with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office of the United Kingdom and other Development Partners to help us develop capacity in line with global best practices.\n\nWe have gotten KADIPA registered with the World Association of Investment Promotion Agencies. We are the first subnational in the country, and probably in Africa, to be registered. Our aim is to ensure that KADIPA is recognized worldwide, and our processes are in line with global best practices.\n\nWe used to operate under civil service rules and procedures, but very recently, we have been taken off that structure. So, our enabling law empowers our board to hire and fire, to also determine the remunerations for the agency\u2019s staff and that is how we were able to attract good hands into the agency.\n\nIn a pre-event press briefing, you said that KADINVEST has so far attracted about $2 billion worth of investments into Kaduna state. How have these investments impacted on the wellbeing of the people of Kaduna state?\n\nA lot of the investments that we have attracted are huge Foreign Direct Investments. These are investments that have been sited in the middle of nowhere. For example, where Olam is, is our Green Agro-Allied Industrial Zone, which is along the Kaduna-Abuja way and now you have a lot of economic activity around the area. The place has developed so fast, we are building a Grains Market there so that our people don\u2019t have to keep going up and down. They can just bring their grains there and sell. Olam off-takes grains from local farmers once they meet their quality. So, this has helped in empowering our people.\n\nThe company has created enormous jobs, both direct and indirect. Between the top three investments that we have in the state\u2014Olam, African Natural Resources and Mines, and others\u2014they have provided 500,000 direct and indirect jobs in the state. So, that is our number one priority; bringing economic development in the areas where they are located and providing necessary jobs. The companies also train local talents and impart skills. For example, Olam trains our farmers in modern agriculture, supports them with inputs, and maximizes the yield of their farms.\n\nWe plan to create more industrial areas in Kaduna state. For example, we are going to create a \u2018Health City\u2019 along the new Rabah road to the Rigasa train station. This will provide an opportunity for investors in the health sector to build hospitals and diagnostics centers because we will want Kaduna state to become a medical tourism state, so that we can retain the money that is being spent abroad on medical tourism.\n\nKaduna state has been ranked as number in the World Bank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business rating amongst states in Nigeria. What did you do as an agency to enable this assessment?\n\nFirst, we identified those sectors that are critical to the Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria; the critical things that investors worldwide will require to ease their businesses. These are what the World Bank is looking at when it does its analysis. There are land matters, tax matters, building permits, environmental impact assessment, business premises registration and all that. So, we asked ourselves, what do we do to ensure that the agencies that provide these services are automated and provide their services optimally and people are happy?\n\nWe got all the agencies on board and had a conversation, where we asked them what support they needed from us. First, we looked at their processes and took out those that are no longer relevant and necessary. When we did that, we asked the agencies to go back and review what we did. Afterwards, we then decided to automate these essential processes. We want to save people from having to go to the agencies every day to get documents; going from office to office, pursuing files, and so on. We want them to do all these from the comfort of their homes. So, we automated the processes and the first automation that government did was that of KADGIS, which was turned into a world class geographic information agency. This is what every state in Nigeria is copying. Kaduna state has an automated land registry.\n\nHow relevant is this year\u2019s theme, \u2018\u2019Towards a sustainable knowledge-based economy,\u2019\u2019 to the investment potential of the state?\n\nWe are looking at the world post-Covid and one of the things that has come out from the pandemic is that you can do a lot of work from home. And that the world must go digital and that there are jobs that are no longer relevant. Why we chose this theme is that we would like to have a conversation on the demands for the jobs of today. What kind of skills are relevant in today\u2019s world; what do we need to do as a state to ensure that we are ready for that?\n\nWe foresaw this even before Covid-19. When the governor assumed office, the first thing he did was convert Kaduna state into an e-governance state. This is because technology is the way to go, and we didn\u2019t see Covid coming. So, when the pandemic came, it was very easy for us to adapt; none of our work stopped because we continued to work online and remotely. We even had council meetings via Zoom. Our KADINVEST 5.0 was a hybrid of physical and virtual event.\n\nA knowledge-based economy is what will drive investments and sustain them. It is what will ensure that the economy will continue to grow. For us as a state, we don\u2019t want to bring an investment where we cannot guarantee that a substantial workforce that it requires. Part of our major aim is to ensure that the people that they hire for the jobs that are being created are available within the state.\n\nKaduna used to be the nation\u2019s textile hub, where a substantial number of textile companies are located. Somehow, almost all the companies are now comatose. Is KADIPA planning an edition of KADINVEST, where the issue of how they will be revived will be extensively discussed?\n\nThe issue of the Cotton Textile and Garment industry (CTG), as we prefer to call it, is a conversation that is ongoing. When we came, it was one of the critical things for us as a state because we knew that the textile industry back then in the 70s, used to provide most of the jobs in Kaduna state. So, as a state, we engaged the services of Professor Justin Lin from the Institute of Structural Economics to help us work on how to revive the CTG sector. An agreement has been signed. What stalled it was the COVID pandemic of 2020. The Vice Chairman of KADIPA, former Emir of Kano Muhammad Sanusi II, who sits on the board of United Nigerian Textiles Limited (UNTL), brought them on board and they made a presentation to the State Executive Council.\n\nUNTL is planning a holistic revival because even the textile industry has now changed. Doing things the way they were done before will not work now. So, they are looking at the complete value-chain. They are proposing a Textile Park, where they will take the full value-chain into consideration, from farming of the cotton to textile to garmenting. And they will attract other businesses that will simply set up shop in the state. We are having that conversation and it will be part of KADIVEST 6.0\n\nKADINVEST Facts",

We have trained desk officers in the local governments to also understand how they can drive investments in the area councils.\n\nRecently, we embarked on certification courses for KADIPA staff, to be experts in Public Private Partnerships. The government is also sponsoring a couple of staff for an MBA in Public Private Partnership, in Malaysia University of Science and Technology. We have also restructured the agency. We did a Corporate Planning exercise to make it more vibrant. We worked with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office of the United Kingdom and other Development Partners to help us develop capacity in line with global best practices.\n\nWe have gotten KADIPA registered with the World Association of Investment Promotion Agencies. We are the first subnational in the country, and probably in Africa, to be registered. Our aim is to ensure that KADIPA is recognized worldwide, and our processes are in line with global best practices.\n\nWe used to operate under civil service rules and procedures, but very recently, we have been taken off that structure. So, our enabling law empowers our board to hire and fire, to also determine the remunerations for the agency\u2019s staff and that is how we were able to attract good hands into the agency.\n\nIn a pre-event press briefing, you said that KADINVEST has so far attracted about $2 billion worth of investments into Kaduna state. How have these investments impacted on the wellbeing of the people of Kaduna state?\n\nA lot of the investments that we have attracted are huge Foreign Direct Investments. These are investments that have been sited in the middle of nowhere. For example, where Olam is, is our Green Agro-Allied Industrial Zone, which is along the Kaduna-Abuja way and now you have a lot of economic activity around the area. The place has developed so fast, we are building a Grains Market there so that our people don\u2019t have to keep going up and down. They can just bring their grains there and sell. Olam off-takes grains from local farmers once they meet their quality. So, this has helped in empowering our people.\n\nThe company has created enormous jobs, both direct and indirect. Between the top three investments that we have in the state\u2014Olam, African Natural Resources and Mines, and others\u2014they have provided 500,000 direct and indirect jobs in the state. So, that is our number one priority; bringing economic development in the areas where they are located and providing necessary jobs. The companies also train local talents and impart skills. For example, Olam trains our farmers in modern agriculture, supports them with inputs, and maximizes the yield of their farms.\n\nWe plan to create more industrial areas in Kaduna state. For example, we are going to create a \u2018Health City\u2019 along the new Rabah road to the Rigasa train station. This will provide an opportunity for investors in the health sector to build hospitals and diagnostics centers because we will want Kaduna state to become a medical tourism state, so that we can retain the money that is being spent abroad on medical tourism.\n\nKaduna state has been ranked as number in the World Bank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business rating amongst states in Nigeria. What did you do as an agency to enable this assessment?\n\nFirst, we identified those sectors that are critical to the Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria; the critical things that investors worldwide will require to ease their businesses. These are what the World Bank is looking at when it does its analysis. There are land matters, tax matters, building permits, environmental impact assessment, business premises registration and all that. So, we asked ourselves, what do we do to ensure that the agencies that provide these services are automated and provide their services optimally and people are happy?\n\nWe got all the agencies on board and had a conversation, where we asked them what support they needed from us. First, we looked at their processes and took out those that are no longer relevant and necessary. When we did that, we asked the agencies to go back and review what we did. Afterwards, we then decided to automate these essential processes. We want to save people from having to go to the agencies every day to get documents; going from office to office, pursuing files, and so on. We want them to do all these from the comfort of their homes. So, we automated the processes and the first automation that government did was that of KADGIS, which was turned into a world class geographic information agency. This is what every state in Nigeria is copying. Kaduna state has an automated land registry.\n\nHow relevant is this year\u2019s theme, \u2018\u2019Towards a sustainable knowledge-based economy,\u2019\u2019 to the investment potential of the state?\n\nWe are looking at the world post-Covid and one of the things that has come out from the pandemic is that you can do a lot of work from home. And that the world must go digital and that there are jobs that are no longer relevant. Why we chose this theme is that we would like to have a conversation on the demands for the jobs of today. What kind of skills are relevant in today\u2019s world; what do we need to do as a state to ensure that we are ready for that?\n\nWe foresaw this even before Covid-19. When the governor assumed office, the first thing he did was convert Kaduna state into an e-governance state. This is because technology is the way to go, and we didn\u2019t see Covid coming. So, when the pandemic came, it was very easy for us to adapt; none of our work stopped because we continued to work online and remotely. We even had council meetings via Zoom. Our KADINVEST 5.0 was a hybrid of physical and virtual event.\n\nA knowledge-based economy is what will drive investments and sustain them. It is what will ensure that the economy will continue to grow. For us as a state, we don\u2019t want to bring an investment where we cannot guarantee that a substantial workforce that it requires. Part of our major aim is to ensure that the people that they hire for the jobs that are being created are available within the state.\n\nKaduna used to be the nation\u2019s textile hub, where a substantial number of textile companies are located. Somehow, almost all the companies are now comatose. Is KADIPA planning an edition of KADINVEST, where the issue of how they will be revived will be extensively discussed?\n\nThe issue of the Cotton Textile and Garment industry (CTG), as we prefer to call it, is a conversation that is ongoing. When we came, it was one of the critical things for us as a state because we knew that the textile industry back then in the 70s, used to provide most of the jobs in Kaduna state. So, as a state, we engaged the services of Professor Justin Lin from the Institute of Structural Economics to help us work on how to revive the CTG sector. An agreement has been signed. What stalled it was the COVID pandemic of 2020. The Vice Chairman of KADIPA, former Emir of Kano Muhammad Sanusi II, who sits on the board of United Nigerian Textiles Limited (UNTL), brought them on board and they made a presentation to the State Executive Council.\n\nUNTL is planning a holistic revival because even the textile industry has now changed. Doing things the way they were done before will not work now. So, they are looking at the complete value-chain. They are proposing a Textile Park, where they will take the full value-chain into consideration, from farming of the cotton to textile to garmenting. And they will attract other businesses that will simply set up shop in the state. We are having that conversation and it will be part of KADIVEST 6.0\n\nKADINVEST Facts",
          "summary": "For us as a state, the Kaduna Investment Summit (KADINVEST) has helped showcase the state to the world.\nI think the Kaduna Investment Agency (KADIPA) gets many proposals for one project or the other.\nHow was KADIPA able to earn investors\u2019 confidence in the last five years, so much that it is an investment destination of choice?\nIn a pre-event press briefing, you said that KADINVEST has so far attracted about $2 billion worth of investments into Kaduna state.\nWhen the governor assumed office, the first thing he did was convert Kaduna state into an e-governance state.",

          "title": "Obasanjo calls Buhari's mounting debts criminal",
          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has questioned President Buhari\u2019s plan to borrow more money, declaring that borrowing to accumulate debt for the next generation is criminal.\n\nObasanjo gave his opinion in an interview with Channels Television on the sidelines of an event in South Africa.\n\nObasanjo cautioned that if the existing debt is left unserviced or unpaid, it might become a problem for successive administrations.\n\nWhile noting that borrowing is not a problem, the former Nigerian leader stated that what could be a problem would be what one is borrowing for and the plan or capacity to pay back.\n\n\u201cBut if you are borrowing and accumulating debts for the next generation and the next generation after them, it is criminal. What are you borrowing for?\u201d Obasanjo asked.\n\n\u201cIf we are borrowing for recurrent expenditure, it is the height of folly. If we are borrowing for development that can pay for itself, that is understandable. Then the payment, how long will it take to pay itself?\u201d\n\nThe ex-president recalled that in 1999 when he came to power, the country was spending $3.5 billion to service debts that kept on increasing.\n\n\u201cWhen I came into government as elected President, we were spending $3.5 billion to service debts. Even with that, our quantum of debts was not going down.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s debts now stand at N33 Trillion and will rise to N35 trillion as the Federal Government seeks foreign loans to deliver key infrastructural projects.\n\nPresident Buhari last week wrote to the National Assembly, seeking approval to borrow $4,054,476,863 and \u20ac710 million in an addendum to the 2018-2020 borrowing plan.\n\nIn the letter, the President explained that owing to \u201cemerging needs\u201d, there is a need to raise more funds for some \u201ccritical projects\u201d, while seeking the parliament\u2019s nod to also approve grant components of $125 million.\n\nIn July, the National Assembly approved the sums of $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million loans contained in the initial 2018-2020 borrowing plan.\n\nThe Presidency on Friday listed the projects that the new loans are meant for.\n\nOne of the projects is the rail line from Kano to Maradi in Niger Republic.\n\nPat Utomi also speaks\n\nIn another interview with Channels TV, Professor Pat Utomi, a political economist warned that Nigeria runs the risk of entering another debt trap if it keeps borrowing to fill the needs of recurring expenditure spending.\n\nHe urged that Nigeria develop a clear national strategy, which looks at how growth can take place in sustainable manner in the economy, and then borrow.\n\n\u201cOur country is going through a very trying period. This is a time for statesmen to emerge, not people arguing partisan position on things.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy, is not growing in any way or shape that can accommodate its needs, population growth, rates, location on scale of poor countries. It means that in terms of absolute numbers of people living in poverty, that this is one of the most terrible places to live in on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn terms of statistic\u2019s being said, yes, in an absolute sense, the fact of borrowing $4billion is not necessarily something that will kill Nigeria, even though if you look at how much of our revenues going into servicing debt, you have to worry.\n\n\u201cHowever, there is a converse point here. This country needs to grow like crazy, and it cannot grow unless you invest. The real issue is the targeting of borrowed funds.\n\nDo I see the plans that these borrowings will facilitate the diversification of the economy? My straight answer is No, I do not see the plan.\n\n\u201cAm I convinced that the targeting is enough to drive the kind of growth that will facilitate the economy to grow in a sustainable manner? I have not been given enough information to believe that it is the case.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons Nigeria is where it is today, is that oil price dropped during the heat of last year, compounded by supply chain challenges brought about by the lockdown, which led to revenue shortfall of a significant nature, because we have failed to do something we said we are doing, which is to diversify the base of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cDo I see the plans that these borrowings will facilitate the diversification of the economy? My straight answer is No, I do not see the plan.\n\n\u201cWe need to develop a clear national strategy, which looks at how growth can take place in sustainable manner in this economy, then we can borrow, twice or three times as much as we are borrowing, and I won\u2019t be afraid,\u201d he urged",

Gen. Onyeama Nwachukwu stated this during a tour of the Theatre Command\u2019s headquarters, Operation Hadin Kai Maimalari, in Maiduguri, Bornu State, on Sunday.\n\nAccording to The PUNCH, the Director stated that the military would not back down in its war against terrorism.\n\nHe did, however, warn residents to be vigilant in their neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cI will like to mention that the ISWAP, very recently, having been depleted by the surrendering of their member, as well as and conflict between them, they have embarked on what I will call a massive recruitment drive and I consider it very important to engage the media to block this recruitment.\n\n\u201cThe Boko Haram insurgents have been surrendering. People have questioned the authenticity of the surrendering of these insurgents and why they are surrendering at this time.\n\n\u201cThere are also the questions on the reintegration of these insurgents. Another question is what the plight of the victims of the insurgency is.\n\n\u201cThat is the essence of this tour. The military is not resting on its oars in the fight to end insurgency and insecurity in the country,\u201d Nwachukwu said.\n\nHe said the fight against insurgency had recorded some success.\n\n\u201cAt some point, the insurgents almost took over the three state capitals of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe in the North-East. Some three years back, Boko Haram was advancing towards the Federal Capital Territory. Today they have been boxed into the Timbuks,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Maj. Gen. Christopher Musa, Commander, Theater Command, Operations Hadin Kai, emphasized that the military does not have the authority to prosecute rebels, but rather profiles and investigates them before passing them over to the appropriate authorities.",

This is made worse by the red carpet reception given to him, which he doesn\u2019t deserve.\n\n\u201cBut since it has happened, there is no need to cry over spilled milk. What is very clear is that our leaders, especially President Buhari have forgiven Fani-Kayode and embrace him as one of us.\n\n\u201cContrastingly, those who are consistent and loyal to our party and our leaders hardly gained the deserved respect they should have.\n\n\u201cThis may not necessarily be intended, but it is there. Be that as it may, members need to move forward with every confidence and commitment to engage our leaders.\n\n\u201cTo that extent, therefore, party members should respect the decision of our leaders to admit Fani-Kayode and welcome him with a red carpet reception.\n\n\u201cOn no account should we be distracted. If Fani-Kayode needs a red carpet reception to be a member of APC, millions of party members have demonstrated that they don\u2019t need any form of recognition to work for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBeing very consistent and stable members of the APC, we should also recognise that the party is partly what it is today on account of our little contributions over the years.\u201d",

          "text": "The debate around who succeeds Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 continued weekend as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) insisted democracy is a game of number and nothing stops the region from producing his successor in 2023 if it garnered majority votes.\n\nThe position came as Ondo state Governor Rotimi Akeredolu said the South is waiting for the national leader, All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to return from his medical trip abroad and speak up on his 2023 plans.\n\nAkeredolu, who described Tinubu as our \u2018capon\u2019 (leader), said the former Lagos state governor would give the direction to people of the South.\n\nThe debate/controversy\n\nThere has been heated controversy over zoning between the ruling APC and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe Southern Governors Forum (SOGF) had made it abundantly clear at the end of its several meetings that the zone would produce the next president.\n\nAlthough the forum which comprises the APC, PDP and the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) governors, unanimously agreed via a communiqu\u00e9 late last week, Ebonyi state Governor David Umahi mocked his PDP colleagues that their body language was not in favour of the forum\u2019s position.\n\nAnd in a swift response, the PDP and its governors via separate statements cautioned Umahi to face his business and focus on APC, a party he defected to from the PDP.\n\nAlso, some northern leaders have spoken up on the need for the South to take another shot at the Presidency in 2003, even as some others argued that rotational presidency is not in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nFor instance while Kaduna state Governor Nasir El-Rufai backs power shift to the South in 2023, a lawmaker and former governor of Nasarawa state, Senator Adamu Abdullahi, believes the north won\u2019t back down on its bid for the nation\u2019s top seat in 2023.\n\nNEF\n\nAnd joining the controversy, the NEF said heaven won\u2019t fall if another northerner emerges Buhari\u2019s successor.\n\nNEF Director of Publicity Hakeem Baba-Ahmed made the position known weekend while speaking at the maiden Maitama Sule Leadership Lecture Series organised by the student-wing of Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria.\n\nBaba-Ahmed, who said northerners were not second-class citizens of Nigeria, insisted the north would not accept to serve as a second fiddle in 2023 when the region has the population to go to the first position and win.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe North is not for sale and northerners will surprise those waiting for them to queue up in 2023 and be given money in exchange for their votes.\u201d\n\nThe NEF spokesman also charged the students to be proud of whom they are as northerners, challenging them not to accept being treated as second-class citizens in their own country.\n\nBaba-Ahmed said: \u201cWe will lead Nigeria the way we have led Nigeria before, whether we are President or Vice President, we will lead Nigeria. We have the majority of the votes and the democracy says vote whom you want. Why should we accept second class position when we know we can buy form and contest for first class and we will win?\n\n\u201cWhy does anybody need to threaten us and intimidate us? We will get that power, but be humble because power comes from God. We inherited leadership, being honest is not being stupid.\n\n\u201cThere are Nigerians who believed that because the economy of the North is being crumbled; we are running away from insecurity, we are politically vulnerable, they think they can buy us for 2023; they are making a mistake.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for this, we will consider every economic adversity, challenge, we will fix the Northern economy and we are the only one who can fix this Northern economy. For that reason, we are not for sale. We are in the process of rebuilding the North and we will rebuild the North from 2023.\u201d\n\nThe NEF image maker further said whether a northerner occupies the office in 2023 or not, those with penchant to see the country break up won\u2019t stop as they would continue to look for excuses.\n\nWhile charging the youths to stay relevant in politics, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t accept second class status because you are a northerner, no northerner is a second-class citizen in this country. If we want to support a southerner, we will support a southerner because that will be in our own interest and we can decide for ourselves.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, a Commissioner in the Police Service Commission (PSC), Hajia Naja\u2019atu Bala Muhammad, urged the youths to stop being intellectually lazy and selling their rights to leadership for peanuts.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cEthical Reorientation for Positive Attitudinal Change: An Urgent National Imperative,\u201d the guest lecturer, Dr. Riyahuddeen Zubair Maitama, called for urgent ethical reorientation for positive attitudinal change among Nigerians.\n\nAkeredolu\n\nHowever, Governor Akeredolu said the South would decide when Asiwaju Tinubu returns from his medical tour in the United Kingdom.\n\nHe spoke while featuring on \u2018Arise TV Sunday Talk Show\u2019 and monitored in Akure.\n\nThe governor said his visit to the former lawmaker was not 2023-related, assuring the former governor would return to the country soonest.\n\nOn whether he would back the APC national leader on 2023, the governor said: \u201cAPC is a party. APC will decide who the candidate will be. I have said it several times. I\u2019m going nowhere. If I leave APC, I am going back to my chamber. For me, whatever APC decides, I will follow.\n\n\u201cWe went to London because it was important for us to go and see for ourselves how he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s the capon for us here. By the time he comes, we can make some serious decisions.\u201d\n\nThe governor also spoke on the VAT controversy, saying the amendments sought by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) at the National Assembly would not sail through at the state assemblies.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the position of the law. The FIRS seeking for amendment is a confirmation that they don\u2019t have the power. The amendment will be dead on arrival. Why seek an amendment to a constitution when the provision is so clear?\u201d Akeredolu asked.\n\nOn what FIRS could do, he said: \u201cYou can only collect VAT on behalf of the states and hand their money over to them.

A lot has been happening on climate change and it can be traceable back to the emission of Carbon dioxide and other gases in to the air, these are called Green House gases. To treat the issues of climate change you have to go back to the history. Economies have been developing with invention of machines. Carbon dioxide used to fuel these machines as well as these Green House gases does a lot to the atmosphere and causes climate change and causing temperature of the earth rising to some degree temperature before pre mechanized era. The excess energy trapped in the air causes the weather to change abnormally. Extreme weather effects such as cyclone, tsunami are caused by extreme climate change. And NiMet with is newly sophisticated hardware and equipment is doing it\u2019s best to give appropriate weather forecast. The Agency is picking up things to ensure accuracy in it\u2019s weather forecast and to keep pace with it\u2019s contemporaries. The country at the out break of Ebola has been able to assist other African countries with accurate weather forecast. The WHO requested for our highly recommended forecast and that was how our service of giving weather forecast to other countries to enable health workers cope with the climate of a particular region or country in order to deliver proper health care services. Also NiMet\u2019s project of Saving Life at Sea, is one of the ways the Agency can increase it\u2019s IGR so as to improve the country economic growth and development,\u201d Dr. Anuforom explained.\n\nHe stressed that there were few comprehensive reports and papers that provided useful evidence and discussion of the various impacts of climate change throughout Nigeria.\n\nAnuforom explained that the vast majority of the literature that provided evidence of climate change impacts and responses, however, focused on the agricultural sector and on individual farming communities in particular regions of the country.",

Lukman has warned leaders and members of his party to be circumspect in reposing their trust in Femi Fani-Kayode following his defection to the party.\n\nFani-Kayode, a one time Minister of Aviation under the administration of president Olusegun Obasanjo, last Thursday defected from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP to the ruling APC and was received with a red carpet treatment by president Muhammadu Buhari in company of Yobe State governor and Chairman APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, CECPC, Mai Mala Buni as well as Zamfara State governor, Bello Matawalle at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja.\n\nThe defection of Fani-Kayode, a notorious critic of APC and president Buhari, has since sparked off negative commentaries from analysts across the media space in the country, and outrage from disenchanted members who felt the party was yet to accord them the honour accorded the decampee despite their loyalty.\n\nHowever, in a statement titled, \u201cAPC\u2019s High-Profile Membership Recruitment and Issues for 2023\u201d, issued Sunday and made available to newsmen in Abuja, Dr. Lukman stated that though Mr Fani-Kayode joined the party as a reformed and repentant critic, he should not be blindly trusted.\n\n\u201cHis (Mr. Fani-Kayode\u2019s) statement to the effect that \u2018let\u2019s focus on unity, peace and togetherness\u2019 is an encouraging testament.

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has vowed that the north will continue leading Nigeria, arguing that the region has the majority to produce a leader through the ballot.\n\nWith the 2023 presidential polls in view, leaders and politicians of southern extraction have been clamoring for a shift in power, arguing that the region must provide the nation\u2019s next leader.\n\nBut NEF, in its most recent submission on the nation\u2019s polity, rejected the push to have Nigeria\u2019s next president come from the southern region.\n\n\u201cWe will lead Nigeria the way we have led Nigeria before. Whether we are president or vice president or whatever, we will lead Nigeria,\u201d NEF spokesman, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said on Sunday at a lecture in memory of the late Maitama Sule in Zaria Kaduna State.\n\nAccording to him, NEF will not allow the 2023 presidency to be zoned to the southern part of the country, insisting that the position is a democratic office that will be determined by the majority.\n\nHe maintained that there is nothing wrong if the north produces the next president after Muhammadu Buhari, adding that this is possible not because the north is superior to others, but because the rules of politics avail the region a great opportunity.\n\nThe NEF spokesman stressed that the north will never be cowed into submission, nor forced to give up in the quest to retain power in 2023 considering its huge human population that gives the region an advantage over others.\n\nWhile stating that the future of the north is not for sale, Baba-Ahmed also maintained that the region will not be threatened, intimidated or blackmailed into giving up its right to a democratic office.\n\nHe said the region should not be compelled to give up a democratically elected office that can be sought by any person irrespective of where he or she comes from.\n\nThe NEF spokesman further reminded those calling for power rotation to bury such thoughts, saying Nigeria is running a democratic government, whereby decisions over where the next president comes from are basically decisions that will be made by voters who will elect the leaders of their choice.\n\nREAD ALSO: Southern Governors Back VAT Collection By States, Zoning Of 2023 Presidency To South\n\nWhile addressing those present, Baba-Ahmed said: \u201cThe vote says vote who you want. We have the majority of the votes. Why do we need to accept a second class position when we can fight and get a first class position. Why?\n\n\u201cWhy does anyone need to threaten us and cajole us and intimidate us? If you don\u2019t bring the presidency here, you will see, okay let\u2019s see, we are waiting to see.\n\n\u201cBut when we get the power, in the name of God be humble because power comes from God\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf they tell you the north must play second fiddle, say No! If the rule of the game says you should vote for the candidate of your choice, vote for the candidate of your choice.\n\n\u201cIf they do not like the fact that it might be a northerner that will emerge as president, too bad. If we want to support a southerner, we will support a southerner because that will be in our own interest, rather than in somebody\u2019s interest.\n\n\u201cAnd we can decide for ourselves, we do not need anybody to tell us what to do,\u201d Baba-Ahmed added.\n\nThe NEF spokesman\u2019s comments came a few days after governors from the southern region of Nigeria declared their support to have the 2023 presidency zoned to their region.\n\nRising from a meeting in Enugu, Chairman of the Forum and Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu said the leaders have resolved that the next president of Nigeria must come from the southern part in line with politics of equity, justice, and fairness.",

          "text": "Shares of Evergrande on Monday plunged to over 11-year lows, extending losses as executives try to salvage its business prospects and as default fears grow over a looming deadline for payment obligations this week.\n\nEvergrande has been scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders, suppliers and investors, with regulators warning that its $305 billion of liabilities could spark broader risks to the country\u2019s financial system if not stabilised.\n\nAs of 0740GMT, the stock was off 12.2% to HK$2.23, after earlier plummeting 19% to its weakest level since May 2010.\n\nThe company\u2019s property management unit dropped 12%, while its electrics car unit declined 2%. Movie streaming company Hengten Net, majority-owned by Evergrande, plummeted 11.2%.\n\n\u201cThe stock will continue to fall, because there\u2019s not yet a solution that appears to be helping the company to ease its liquidity stress, and there are still so many uncertainties about what the company will do in case of a restructuring,\u201d said Kington Lin, managing director of Asset Management Department at Canfield Securities Limited.\n\nLin said Evergrande\u2019s share price could fall to below HK$1 if the company is forced to sell most of its assets in a restructuring.\n\nOne of Evergrande\u2019s main lenders has made provisions for losses on a portion of its loans to the embattled developer, while some creditors are planning to give it more time to repay, four bank executives told Reuters.\n\nThe developer said on Sunday it has begun repaying investors in its wealth management products with real estate.\n\nPolicymakers are telling Evergrande\u2019s major lenders to extend interest payments or rollover loans, and market watchers are largely of the view that a direct bailout from the government is unlikely.\n\nEvergrande is due to pay $83.5 million interest on Sept 23 for its March 2022 bond. It has another $47.5 million interest payment due on Sept 29 for the March 2024 notes. Both bonds would default if Evergrande fails to settle the interest within 30 days of the scheduled payment dates.\n\nIn any default scenario, Evergrande will need to restructure the bonds but analysts expect a low recovery ratio for investors. Trading of the company\u2019s bonds underscored just how dramatically investor expectations of its prospects have deteriorated this year.\n\nThe 8.25% March 2022 dollar bond was traded at 29.156 on Monday afternoon, yielding over 500%, compared to around 13.7% at the beginning of year. The 9.5% March 2024 bond was at 26.4, yielding over 80%, compared to 14.6% at the start of 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs said last week that because Evergrande has dollar bonds issued by both the parent company and a special purpose vehicle, recoveries in a potential restructuring could differ between the two sets of bonds, and any potential restructuring process may be prolonged.",

          "text": "France\u2019s defence minister has cancelled talks with her UK counterpart amid the row prompted by a new security deal between Britain, the US and Australia.\n\nParis is angry after Australia signed the Aukus pact to build nuclear-powered submarines, pulling out of a major contract with France in the process.\n\nUK PM Boris Johnson said France had nothing to worry about from the deal.\n\nBut Florence Parly\u2019s meeting with UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace in London this week has been called off.\n\nLord Ricketts, a former British ambassador to France who was due to co-chair the two days of talks, confirmed the meeting had been \u201cpostponed to a later date\u201d.\n\nThe Aukus agreement brokered last week, widely seen as an effort to counter China\u2019s influence in the contested South China Sea, ended a deal worth $37bn (\u00a327bn) signed by Australia in 2016 for France to build 12 conventional submarines.\n\nFrench foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has described it as a \u201cstab in the back\u201d that constituted \u201cunacceptable behaviour between allies and partners\u201d.\n\nAnd in a virtually unprecedented step among allies, French President Emmanuel Macron ordered the recall of the French ambassadors to Washington and Canberra.\n\nSpeaking on a flight to New York, where he will take part in the UN General Assembly, Mr Johnson said France should not \u201cworry\u201d about the alliance, insisting that Anglo-French relations were \u201cineradicable\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister said Britain and France have a \u201cvery friendly relationship\u201d, which he described as being of \u201chuge importance\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur love of France is ineradicable,\u201d he told reporters.\n\n\u201cAukus is not in any way meant to be zero-sum, it\u2019s not meant to be exclusionary. It\u2019s not something that anybody needs to worry about and particularly not our French friends.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson is being joined on the trip with new Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, who launched her own defence of the agreement in an article for the Sunday Telegraph.\n\nMs Truss said the deal showed the UK\u2019s readiness to be \u201chard-headed\u201d in defending its interests and had the potential to create hundreds of new skilled jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, Australia has defended scrapping its deal with France in favour of the Aukus pact.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison rejected accusations that Australia had lied, saying France should have been aware it was prepared to break the deal.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday, Mr Morrison said: \u201cUltimately, this was a decision about whether the submarines that were being built, at great cost to the Australian taxpayer, were going to be able to do a job that we needed it to do when they went into service and our strategic judgement based on the best possible of intelligence and defence advice was that it would not.\u201d\n\nThe agreement means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines.\n\nThe pact will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies.\n\nBut it has been criticised by China, which has accused the three powers of having a \u201cCold War mentality\u201d.\n\nAnd on Monday, North Korea, which has its own closely-watched nuclear weapon and missile programmes, warned it could spark a \u201cnuclear arms race\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese are extremely undesirable and dangerous acts which will upset the strategic balance in the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d state media KCNA quoted a foreign ministry official as saying.",

          "title": "UN Chief Warns China, US to Avoid New Cold War",
          "text": "Warning of a potential new Cold War, the head of the United Nations implored China and the United States to repair their \u201ccompletely dysfunctional\u201d relationship before problems between the two large and deeply influential countries spill over even further into the rest of the planet.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke to The Associated Press this weekend ahead of this week\u2019s annual United Nations gathering of world leaders \u2014 a convening blemished by COVID, climate concerns and contentiousness across the planet.\n\nGuterres said the world\u2019s two major economic powers should be cooperating on climate and negotiating more robustly on trade and technology even given persisting political fissures about human rights, economics, online security and sovereignty in the South China Sea.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, today we only have confrontation,\u201d Guterres said Saturday in the AP interview.\n\n\u201cWe need to re-establish a functional relationship between the two powers,\u201d he said, calling that \u201cessential to address the problems of vaccination, the problems of climate change and many other global challenges that cannot be solved without constructive relations within the international community and mainly among the superpowers.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Guterres warned global leaders of the risk of the world splitting in two, with the United States and China creating rival internets, currency, trade, financial rules \u201cand their own zero-sum geopolitical and military strategies.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated that warning in the AP interview, adding that two rival geopolitical and military strategies would pose \u201cdangers\u201d and divide the world. Thus, he said, the foundering relationship must be repaired \u2014 and soon.\n\n\u201cWe need to avoid at all cost a Cold War that would be different from the past one, and probably more dangerous and more difficult to manage,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nThe so-called Cold War between the Soviet Union and its East bloc allies and the United States and its Western allies began immediately after World War II and ended with the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. It was a clash of two nuclear-armed superpowers with rival ideologies \u2014 communism and authoritarianism on one side, capitalism and democracy on the other.\n\nThe U.N. chief said a new Cold War could be more perilous because the Soviet-U.S. antipathy created clear rules, and both sides were conscious of the risk of nuclear destruction. That produced back channels and forums \u201cto guarantee that things would not get out of control,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow, today, everything is more fluid, and even the experience that existed in the past to manage crisis is no longer there,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nHe said the U.S.-Britain deal to give Australia nuclear-powered submarines so it could operate undetected in Asia \u201cis just one small piece of a more complex puzzle \u2026 this completely dysfunctional relationship between China and the United States.\u201d\n\nThe secretly negotiated deal angered China and France, which had signed a contract with Australia worth at least $66 billion for a dozen French conventional diesel-electric submarines.\n\nIn the wide-ranging AP interview, the secretary-general also addressed three major issues that world leaders will be confronting this week: the worsening climate crisis, the still-raging pandemic and Afghanistan\u2019s uncertain future under its new Taliban rulers. They took power Aug. 15 without a fight from the government\u2019s U.S.-trained army as American forces were in the final stage of withdrawing from the country after 20 years.\n\nWhat role will the United Nations have in the new Afghanistan? Guterres called it \u201ca fantasy\u201d to believe that U.N. involvement \u201cwill be able all of a sudden to produce an inclusive government, to guarantee that all human rights are respected, to guarantee that no terrorists will ever exist in Afghanistan, that drug trafficking will stop.\u201d\n\nAfter all, he said, the United States and many other countries had thousands of soldiers in Afghanistan and spent trillions of dollars and weren\u2019t able to solve the country\u2019s problems \u2014 and, some say, made them worse.\n\nThough the United Nations has \u201climited capacity and limited leverage,\u201d he said, it is playing a key role in leading efforts to provide humanitarian aid to Afghans. The U.N. is also drawing the Taliban\u2019s attention to the importance of an inclusive government that respects human rights, especially for women and girls, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is clearly a fight for power within different groups in the Taliban leadership. The situation is not yet clarified,\u201d he said, calling it one more reason why the international community should engage with the Taliban.\n\nWhile former U.S. president Donald Trump was wedded to an \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, President Joe Biden \u2014 who will make his first appearance as chief executive at the General Assembly\u2019s high-level meeting Tuesday \u2014 has reaffirmed U.S. commitment to multilateral institutions.\n\nGuterres said Biden\u2019s commitment to global action on climate, including rejoining the 2015 Paris climate agreement that Trump withdrew from, is \u201cprobably the most important of them all.\u201d\n\nHe said there is \u201ca completely different environment in the relationship\u201d between the United Nations and the United States under Biden. But, Guterres said, \u201cI did everything \u2014 and I\u2019m proud of it \u2014 in order to make sure that we would keep a functional relationship with the United States in the past administration.\u201d\n\nGuterres also lamented the failure of countries to work together to tackle global warming and ensure that people in every country are vaccinated.\n\nOf the past year of COVID-19 struggles, he said: \u201cWe were not able to make any real progress in relation to effective coordination of global efforts.\u201d\n\nAnd of climate: \u201cOne year ago, we were seeing a more clear movement in the right direction, and that movement has slowed down in the recent past . So we need to re-accelerate again if we are not going into disaster.\u201d\n\nGuterres called it \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d that 80% of the population in his native Portugal has been vaccinated while in many African countries, less than 2% of the population is vaccinated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely stupid from the point of view of defeating the virus, but if the virus goes on spreading like wildfire in the global south, there will be more mutations,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that mutations are making it more transmissible, more dangerous.\u201d\n\nHe again urged the world\u2019s 20 major economic powers in the G20, who failed to take united action against COVID-19 in early 2020, to create the conditions for a global vaccination plan. Such a plan, he said, must bring together vaccine-producing countries with international financial institutions and pharmaceutical companies to double production and ensure equitable distribution.\n\n\u201cI think this is possible,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cIt depends on political will.\u201d\n\nThe secretary-general said rich, developed countries are spending about 20% of their GDP on recovery problems, middle income countries about 6% and the least developed countries 2% of a small GDP. That, he says, has produced frustration and mistrust in parts of the developing world that have received neither vaccines nor recovery assistance.\n\nThe divide between developed countries in the north and developing countries in the south \u201cis very dangerous for global security,\u201d Guterres said, \u201cand it\u2019s very dangerous for the capacity to bring the world together to fight climate change.\u201d",

          "text": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele has said the apex bank is ready to approve legitimate foreign exchange (FX) demand that exceeds the approved transaction cap if such applications meet stipulated requirements.\n\nThe CBN governor gave the assurance against the backdrop of complaints that the current FX policy which limits transactions to $5,000 may not fulfil consumers\u2019 actual needs.\n\nBut Emefiele, while addressing journalists over the weekend, said the CBN was ready to approve requests from commercial banks to go beyond the caps if it is proven that the extra demand for FX is for legitimate purposes.\n\nHe said, \u201cIndeed, I want to put it on record; if the amount you want is even above the limit that is recognised and we find that the reason you are making those demands is legitimate, your bank will speak to us and we will give you more than what is even the limit.\u201d\n\nHe further insisted that the Investors and Exporters (I&E) Window of the central bank remains the major market which anyone seeking to procure or sell foreign exchange should patronise.\n\nWhile urging customers to go to their banks for their FX needs, the CBN Governor said, \u201cThe only exchange rate that I recognise today in the Nigerian foreign exchange market which is the dominant market remains the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sorry to say that I do not and I do not intend to recognise that there are any other rates in the market,\u201d he added.\n\nThe CBN governor also reiterated that the much anticipated Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) also known as the eNaira would debut on October 1, adding that the bank has all the approvals and mandate to launch on the said date.\n\nHe explained, \u201cBut it is important to note that the eNaira is not a one-off but a journey that start on October 1. October 1 marks the beginning of the eNaira journey. On October 1, a Nigerian should be able to download the eNaira App from either Google Play Store or Apple Apps Store and onboard themselves and find their eNaira wallets using their bank accounts or with cash at a registered agent located across the nation and conduct transfers.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cLet\u2019s imagine a bank has about N10 billion in physical cash in its account. We can decide that out of the N10 billion we move N2 billion into an electronic wallet for the bank.\n\n\u201cSo if you are a customer and you have say N10 million with your bank, for your comfort of spending and making purchases, you could tell the bank to load N2 million out of your N10 million and so your bank balance sitting in physical currency drops to N8 million while the eWallet carries N2 million. With that you can make purchases both within and across the country.\u201d\n\nThe apex bank boss also explained that there are many variants of the eNaira adding that other components would be introduced whenever it is deemed fit to do so.\n\nHe said,\u201d We are not going to pretend that there are no risks in opening your system up. We will look at the various products, determine the risks, determine the best way to mitigate the risks before opening it up.\n\n\u201cBut it is a journey that we are determined and decided that we will start on October 2021.\u201d\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja",
