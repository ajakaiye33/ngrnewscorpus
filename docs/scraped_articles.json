          "text": "As Nigeria, other WAMZ countries begin test-run\n\nSystem to reduce transaction cost by $5bn\n\nBy Yinka Kolawole, with agency report\n\nThe pilot phase of Pan African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) aimed at facilitating the smooth implementation African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has commenced in Nigeria and other countries of the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ)\n\nThe six member countries of WAMZ are Nigeria, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\nPAPSS is a centralised payment and settlement market infrastructure for processing, clearing and settling of intra-African trade and commerce payments.\n\nThe Secretary-General of AfCFTA, Mr Wamkele Mene, disclosed this yesterday, in Abuja, while on an official tour to Nigeria.\n\nMene said that the system which would be ready at the end of 2021 was the first major step taken in addressing some challenges related to the cost of currency convertibility under AfCFTA implementation.\n\n\u201cWe have started a piloting phase of the Pan-African payment and settlement platform of six countries in West Africa who have switched on to the platform. Transactions are already happening within these six countries that are at an advanced stage of the pilot project.\n\n\u201cSo, the platform will make a significant contribution and our estimate is that it will reduce the cost of transactions by $5 billion annually, being the aggregate amount that is spent on currency convertibility,\u201d he said.\n\nMene noted that Africa has 42 currencies and the cost of the currency convertibility was actually a constraint to intra-Africa trade. This, he said, was making trade unnecessarily expensive, thereby adding to the cost of doing business, especially the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).\n\n\u201cWhen the system is fully up and running, you will be able to transact with somebody in Kenya in Naira and they will receive Kenya shillings and Afreximbank will be the correspondent facility.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to have a common currency overnight in Africa, we are still going to grapple with this issue of different currencies. But with the payment and settlement system we have taken the first major step in addressing some of the challenges that are related to the cost of currency,\u201d he noted.\n\nAccording to Mene, the way the six piloting countries understand the importance of the system to African economy is encouraging.\n\nPAPSS was adopted in July 2019 by the African Union Heads of State as the payment and settlement system to support the implementation of the AfCFTA, and is expected to create new financial flows and successfully facilitate trade and other economic activities among African countries.\n\nAfreximbank is the operator and the main settlement agent for PAPSS and expected to provide settlement guarantee on the payment system as well as overdraft facilities to all settlement agents.",

Thus, the development and deployment of physical capability will contribute significantly to the defense and security of our nation.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army must of necessity be creative and improve its problem solving skill to be able to defeat all forms of adversaries, particularly non-state actors. To achieve this, the prudent utilization of finance and indeed all resources can never be over emphasized , especially in the state of building national resources\u201d\n\nIn order to achieve the aforementioned objectives, the COAS said the theme of the training week was aptly crafted as \u2018Repositioning Nigerian Army Finance Corp: Warrant Officers, Senior Non-Commissioned Officers for professional and innovative financial service delivery to the Nigerian Army\u2019.\n\nHe advised the Corps to provide professional and innovative financial services in line with financial and other extant regulations , expressing delight that the training week was taking place at a time where there was a greater demand for openness, prudence, accountability in the use of public funds.\n\nThe COAS explained that \u201cthe prudent and efficient use of the public fund also becomes compelling given the anti corruption drive of the Federal Government of Nigeria as well as dwindling national revenue due to the advert effect of global Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWe need to be more open in managing the scarce resources that are allocated to the Nigerian Army and we need to be more open to justifying whatever has been appropriated to us.\n\n\u201cI would like to acknowledge the Nigerian Army Finance Corps\u2019 efforts towards an effective delivery of quality professional financial advisory tasks and taking special note of the positive reform towards the prompt payment of troops operation allowances across the spectrum of operation and other related allowances in the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cPayment of men that are in various theaters of operation has always been going on very well. It is going to be sustained . As long as we receive whatever that is required from the federal government of Nigeria, we on our part, will do the needful\u201d, the COAS stated.\n\nIn his opening remarks, the Chief of Account and Budgeting, Nigerian Army, Major General Adekunle Adesope, explained that the training week was designed to strengthen and improve the performance of Warrant officers and senior non commissioned officers in executing their core functions as the vital link between officers, soldiers and junior leadership in the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe fundamental objective of this particular training according to him, aligned a with the imperative of the Finance Corps mantra \u201cwhich is to professionally and relatively discharge financial services in support of all Nigerian Army constitutional duties.\n\n\u201cThis has become expedient considering the dynamics of the contemporary environment that places a premium on requisite expertise in meaningful decision making and complex strategic thinking in prioritizing need due to acutely scarce resources.\n\n\u201cExpectedly, the \\warrant officers and senior non commissioned officers training is coming against the backdrop of a mirage of security challenges besetting our nation.\n\nRelevant topics have been carefully selected for deliberation to achieve the aim of the theme for this year\u2019s training week. It is believed that the training will provide the prerequisite for improving skills and professional capability of participants in the very changing financial sector which is highly regulated and guided by government policy and internationally accepted best practices.\n\n\u201cYour roles are quite distinct and very important, being the link between the soldiers and junior leadership in the hierarchy of the Nigerian Army towards the attainment of our premium objective for this year\u201d, Maj.GenAdesope stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

People are saying I\u2019m borrowing money. If I borrow money to develop my place (state) is there any offense there? They that borrow, did they do the road? If I\u2019m borrowing and doing the work, have I not done well?\n\n\u201cBut in any case, I am not borrowing money. It is a matter of how you manage the resources of the people.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m not owing any bank. I challenge any bank to say Rivers State government is indebted to them. The only money we took for agriculture, which Central Bank gave us, N5 billion, as I speak to you, we have not touched one Naira. The money is still in there.\u201d\n\nWike recalled that in 2009, the previous administration in the state implemented a payment module that clearly lacked interest in either constructing or completing the Trans-Kalabari Road.\n\nHe said nobody would ever deceive Kalabari people with the promise of constructing Trans-Kalabari Road in the name of politics because the phase one of the project would be completed in 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have not only awarded the contract, we have awarded it in such a way that they (contractor) have nothing to do with us about funding.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have signed an irrevocable standing order where every month the contractor collects from the bank N1 billion. So, as this month is ending that\u2019ll be the third billion they\u2019ve collected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you here that we\u2019ve instructed the banks, take N1 billion off from our IGR account every month and give to the contractor to do the project. So, we are not borrowing money from any bank.\u201d",

It\u2019s a government thing and it\u2019s the Minister that can talk about it. So, thank you,\u201dhe clarified when he spoke to State House Correspondents after the weekly meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC).\n\nAsked to react to ECOWAS Court ruling against Nigeria for suspending the micro-blogging platform, Twitter, Adesina said the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, was studying the ruling that Twitter users cannot be arrested or prosecuted and would advise the federal government on the next step to take.\n\nAdesina affirmed that the committee made up of ministers to engage with Twitter has begun to meet.\n\nAdesina said that President Muhammadu Buhari has approved that the Second Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report should be done.\n\n\u201cThe only thing of interest I would like to talk about is the second Peer Review Country\u2019s Self-assessment Report.\n\n\u201cNigeria is ready for the second Peer Review Country Self -assessment Report to be done by AUDA-NEPAD. I think the last self-assessment report was done 10 years ago in Nigeria. Now, Nigeria is ready for the second review self-assessment report.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been discussed at the Council and the President has granted the approval that that peer review report can be conducted on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cActually, if you have an insight into the report that was presented, which the woman in charge of NEPAD, Mrs. Akobundu, can give you, Nigeria has made progress in several areas and on several fronts.\n\n\u201cWhile 10 years ago, petroleum contributed more than 70%, even up to 90%, to GDP, you will find that today, petroleum contributes just about 45% and non-oil products contribute about 55% to the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cSo, if Nigeria had been talking of diversification for 40, 50, 60 years, the economy can now be said to be diversified because our GDP, non-oil revenue, contributes about 55% to 45% of oil.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s one of the highlights of the Peer Review Country Self-assessment Report that was presented at the Council meeting today. Details of that can be gotten from the AUDA-NEPAD office.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, has said the reported roof leakage at the National Assembly has vindicated its request for the approval of N37 billion for the renovation of the complex.\n\nLawan stated this in his remarks on two Points of Order raised by Senate Deputy Chief Whip, Sen. Sabi Abdullahi, during plenary, yesterday.\n\nHe had raised Points of Order 14 and 15 of the Senate Standing Rule in reaction to a report credited to a news medium on \u201croof leakage of the National Assembly complex.\u201d\n\nThe National Assembly, was on Tuesday, thrown into chaos, following a massive leakage in the roof of the building housing the chambers of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It obstructed Senate plenary session\n\nIn his remarks, Lawan said media reports that the money had been approved and siphoned by the leadership of the National Assembly was false.\n\nHe explained how they secured President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s approval to ensure the dilapidated structure was fixed immediately.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there was a leakage, to me it is a clear testimony, confirmation and vindication of the position the National Assembly took initially.\n\n\u201cBy the time we came into office and our endorsement, the Speaker and I found it necessary to go round this Senate and we found out dilapidation and degradation.\n\n\u201cIn fact, anyone who sees what we have here knows that this place is overdue for rehabilitation. It is even worse downstairs.\n\n\u201cSo, we complained to the president that there is the need to rehabilitate and renovate the National Assembly complex after in use for about 20 years and not rehabilitated at all.\n\n\u201cThe president was gracious and he asked us to come back, engage the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) who are the owners of this building and the technical side of the National Assembly and some contractors to come up with what we need to rehabilitate here and the cost.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I fought against the initial submissions because I was to take the document directly to the President.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw what they were bringing, I say there was no way I could take that to Mr President, go and rework until they came up with N37 billion and I took that to the president.\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, when we approved the budget of N37 billion for the rehabilitation of this complex, it was not a National Assembly budget, it was an FCDA budget, we have nothing to do with this,\u2019\u2019 Lawan said.\n\nTwenty four hours after an early morning downpour flooded the lobby of the two chambers of the National Assembly, Acting Executive Secretary of FCDA, Mrs Zalihau Ahmed, said all the necessary paperwork had been concluded, but said the delayed approval by the Federal Executive Council (FEC), was hampering the take off of the work.\n\nMrs Ahmed said a no objection from the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) had already been given, paving the way for the take off of the old structure.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the leakage that happened on Tuesday in the National Assembly. Everything is in the table. The National Assembly approved the N37 billion in the 2020 budget. We have done everything. We have also gotten a no objection from the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP).\n\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t proceed until the Federal Executive Council (FEC) approves the contract. As soon as they approve the contract, full renovation work will commence. As you know, we can\u2019t award a contract of that nature without an approval from FEC. So, we are aware and on top of the matter.\u201d",

          "text": "By Michael Olugbode\n\nA former Minister of Aviation, Osita Chidoka, has said the need to ensure that the rule concerning federal character and quota system is enforced in employment and promotion in civil and public service should not be elevated over merit.\n\nChidoka, also a former Corps Marshal and Chief Executive of the Federal Road Safety Commission, speaking on the topic: \u201cGetting Big Things Done- Improving the Effectiveness of Cross-Over Professionals in Government\u201d, a public discussion organised by Nextier and Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) in Abuja on Wednesday, said quota system or the need to ensure federal character in employment and promotion should not make someone walks into a position that he never merited.\n\nHe lamented that this remains the greatest corruption in the country, where people that do not merit a position are given job over people better qualified than them.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is an aberration that we have introduced in Nigeria. Someone that scored 15 per cent is entering into a place where people are scoring 95 per cent. It is the worst of all crime; it is the biggest corruption that is in Nigeria and what can destroy the Nigeria public service.\u201d\n\nChidoka lamented that it has been difficult to reform the Nigerian Civil Service because \u201ccivil servants live in eternity,\u201d they have the patience to wait for the tenure of politicians to expire and get back to doing whatever they want and throw out whatever reform.\n\nHe said the civil servants will always outlive a politician who may not have more than eight years to spend whereas a civil servant has 35 years.\n\nThe former minister said one of the greatest disservice to the nation is that ministers do not have power over civil servants in their ministries and may have to work with people who do not share their ideas, dreams and visions.\n\nHe said that how can somebody move along with a strange bed fellow \u201cwho you cannot even determine if he/she stays on your team or leave\u201d.\n\nHe said something needed to be done in this regard to allow for progress in the nation\u2019s civil service structure and subsequently make Nigeria to work.\n\nIn her goodwill message, the Programme Coordinator, Open Society Initiative for West Africa, Catherine Angai, lamented that: \u201cThe bureaucracy in Nigeria presents one of the problems that a senior colleague always references as wicked problems. It is a systems problem. The system is not working as effectively or efficiently as it should, the system is failing. This has a direct impact on one of the fundamental obligations of government \u2013 the delivery of public goods. What again is the benefit of democracy if there is no good governance?\u201d\n\nShe said according to the OSIWA strategy document, the biggest challenge facing the West African region is poor governance, noting that: \u201cPoor governance is exacerbated by rapid urbanization and population explosion. These factors are not waiting for the system to catch up. Poor governance, according to our context analysis, is the root cause of extractive and abusive political, social and economic systems which in turn frustrates key areas OSIWA is particularly interested in \u2014 justice sector reforms, inclusive economic growth, citizens access to basic public services, such as health and education. Indeed, poor governance compromises democratic institutions and creates the conditions that are conducive for insecurity and fragility.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, the Founding Partner of Nextier, Patrick Okigbo, said that\n\nNigeria\u2019s public service has a myriad of challenges.\n\nHe said something needed to be urgently done, insisting that the government should create an enabling environment while the private sector drives economic growth and development.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Government of Nigeria goes fishing in non-public sector waters for talents to drive such results. Many Nigerians who \u2018cross over\u2019 from civil society and private sector organizations to work in government have challenges adjusting to public service realities and demands. Although hitherto successful in their former roles, they contend with the different rules, incentives and motivations governing the service.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says all hands on deck to secure the country\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo has expressed optimism that the current security challenges facing Nigeria will soon become a thing of the past.\n\nHe also stressed that the federal government has intensified efforts aimed at adequately securing the country with the recent supplementary budget sent to the National Assembly for approval for the procurement of military hardware for the use of the military and other security agencies.\n\nSpeaking while receiving in audience the Oluyin of Iyin Ekiti, Oba Adeola Adeniyi Ajakaiye, at the State House, Abuja, the vice-president emphasised that all and sundry must support the nation\u2019s security services to ensure that Nigeria is safe, saying: \u201cI can assure you that soon, the issue of insecurity will be a thing of the past, and that we will all live in peace and prosperity in this country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the recent supplementary budget sent to the National Assembly, on enhancing the capacity of the military and other security agencies, is part of the concerted efforts of the federal government to beef up its response to the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe president has recently constituted a committee that will look at the whole security infrastructure with a view to looking at the needs of the military, as well as the police and security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe result of that is a bill before the National Assembly, a supplementary bill. The purpose of that bill is to present some of the needs of the military, as well as of security agencies in order to be able to beef up our response to the security challenges.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also stressed the need for traditional rulers, local and state governments to collaborate with the federal government to tackle insecurity.\n\n\u201cAny country with this number of security challenges must respond as robustly as possible. But it is also important to bear in mind that it takes a combined effort of all of us, at the local government level, state and federal levels; all of the levels; we need to come together to tackle this issue of insecurity,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to the vice-president, even as the federal government is very concerned, and will continue to ramp up efforts towards improving security nationwide, community efforts is also vital in tackling the issue from the roots.\n\nHe emphasised that it is a foregone conclusion that at the level of community, there is need to take decisive action, as most of the security issues occur at the community level.\n\nOsinbajo expressed happiness that the traditional ruler has a committee in place in his domain organised for the purpose of tackling insecurity \u201cand that you\u2019ve been able to contain the menace that we see in different parts of the country in your community\u201d.\n\nHe added that the federal government will provide necessary support to the community in tackling its challenges, adding that the federal government is also working with the Ekiti State Government in dealing with insecurity, as well as other various issues.\n\nIn his remarks, the Oluyin of Iyin Ekiti, Oba Ajakaiye, thanked the vice-president for granting them audience and listening to their demands, including support for the establishment of a Federal University of Medical and Health Sciences in the community.\n\nOba Ajakaiye said: \u201cAgain, as a community, we have come to appreciate you (vice-president) for your diligence, hard work, commitment and loyalty; and that, we from the South-west, are very proud of you. We want to assure you that we are very much in support of you. From our own end, we are doing a lot to ensure that the menace of insecurity will not remain in our domain.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A pressure group known as Isoko Monitoring Group (IMG) Worldwide has berated Delta state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, over his management of the tertiary schools in the state.\n\nThe group accused the governor of \"nepotism and clannishness\", describing it as \"cancerous\".\n\nDelta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa\n\nThe group, in a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of an enlarged emergency extraordinary meeting held Thursday, at its headquarters, Ivrogbo-Irri, Isoko South Local Government Area, Delta state, said, \"Following cumulative occurrences in the state, the Isoko Monitoring Group (IMG) is pushed to conclude that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has and is entrenching nepotism in all facets of his administration of our dear Delta State\".\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9, titled: \"Neglect Of Delta State University, Oleh Campus And The Poor Development Of Delta State University Of Science And Technology Ozoro Unacceptable\", was signed on behalf of the group by Kingsley Oroh.\n\nThe group warned the governor not to take the simplicity of the people of Isoko nation for stupidity.\n\nThe statement said, \"We wish to express our total dissatisfaction at the manner with which the Delta State Governor, His Excellency, Sen. (Dr.) Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa is piloting the affairs of our dear state, especially as it affects the development of tertiary institutions in Delta state.\n\n\"Suffice it to say that the Law and Engineering Faculties of Delta State University, Oleh Campus, which have been in existence for decades have been wickedly deprived of development and have been perpetually abandoned by the state government for no justifiable reason. The campus lacks functional facilities, good laboratories, manpower, and good road network.\n\n\"It is a shame on the government that Isoko sons and daughters have been funding the supposed state university after several pleas to the state government have fallen on deaf ears. While this unwarranted underdevelopment persisted, the state governor hurriedly established three new state universities, among which is the University of Science and Technology, Ozoro.\n\n\"Unknowing to us, this was a well concocted plot by the governor to kill all tertiary institutions in the state in favour of the newly created University of Delta, Agbor that has a campus in the governor's hometown, Owa-Alero. While both the old Oleh campus and newly established university in Ozoro lay fallow and undeveloped, the same government is speedily and massively developing the Faculties of Law, Engineering and Medicine at the Owa-Alero Campus of the University of Agbor.\n\n\"A proposed University of Education (as the Governor wanted Deltans to believe) now has Faculties of Law, Engineering and Medicine with massive construction ongoing funded by proceeds of Crude Oil and gas from six (6) flow stations and four (4) gas plants in the Isoko nation whereas the governor by his actions and inactions, has already declared the death sentence on the Oleh Campus of the Delta State University which hosts the Faculties of Law and Engineering.\n\n\"To show the Governors\u2019 true intent, a bill has been hurriedly put together and sent to the House of Assembly to give legal backing to the establishment of the Faculties of Law, Engineering and Medicine in addition to the Faculty of Education which the university was meant to focus on being a University of Education.\n\n\"Governor Okowa may want to make us believe that the huge infrastructural and manpower investment the University of Delta State, Agbor is receiving is because the university was just recently upgraded from a College of Education to a university. If that is the case, we want governor Okowa to explain to the Isoko people why the Delta State University of Science and Technology, Ozoro which was also recently upgraded from a polytechnic to a university status is not receiving similar level of investment.\n\n\"The IMG thinks the only reason this is the case is because the Delta State University of Science and Technology is not located at Owa-Alero, Okowa\u2019s hometown.

Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Konga to mPharma, logistics for health products is growing in Africa",
          "text": "\u201cPeople order drugs on Jumia?\u201d\n\nThat was the reaction from the most ardent online shopper I know. She buys running shoes, mom jeans and hair products but doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would buy drugs online. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for her to buy ingestible medicines on the same website she shops for underwear.\n\nBut a search under Jumia\u2019s \u2018medications & treatments\u2019 tab reveals syrups, nasal sprays, and pain relief capsules. At the bottom of their healthcare page, a blurb assures visitors that products listed on the website are from \u201cvarious trusted brands that will meet your health needs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, African e-commerce marketplaces are venturing into the delivery of health care products as part of a strategy to broaden their value to customers.\n\nThese platforms are part of a broader crop of innovators at an interesting intersection of healthcare and logistics on the continent. Going by recent data, this sub-sector has grown over two years.\n\nAt least 61 companies are using tech for health distribution across sub-saharan Africa, a growth of over 100% in the number of active players (28) captured in 2018. That\u2019s according to a report by Salient Advisory, an Africa-focused healthcare consultancy.\n\nThese health logistics companies include e-commerce players like Jumia, Copia and Konga, and also core health startups like mPharma, Lifestores Pharmacy, Chekkit and Sproxil. Salient\u2019s report focuses on companies delivering over-the-counter products, hence it does not include LifeBank which specializes in blood and oxygen products.\n\nMost of these companies are in Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya with only 6 spotted in the francophone region. 31% of the companies surveyed were founded within the last two years and 62% operate in a single African country.\n\nSnapshot of innovators in the health products distribution space in Africa. Source: Salient Advisory.\n\nSalient categorizes the landscape of companies into three groups by the type of service they deliver: consumer-facing companies, producer-facing companies and product data companies.\n\nThe first group of companies (like Drugstore.ng) deliver over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as virtual patient care to individuals. Provider-facing ones serve healthcare businesses either by delivering to them, hosting an online marketplace, providing inventory management tools (an example here is Lifestores Pharmacy) and/or offering financing.\n\nThe third group offers data related services like product analytics and drug authenticity verification. An example in this category is Chekkit, a verification technology startup that was recently accepted into Google for Startups accelerator programme for 2021.\n\nTraditional e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Copia and Konga are able to play in the consumer and provider-facing buckets. Because of their presence in multiple African countries, all three companies surpass the combined reach of other direct-to-consumer startups in the health product distribution space.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing can accelerate access to medicines and have an incredible impact on public health,\u201d says Yomi Kazeem, one of the authors of Salient Advisory\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to Konga\u2019s co-CEO Nick Imudia, the e-commerce company\u2019s plan to deliver health products started shortly after they were acquired by the Zinox Group three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe started building warehouses and logistics assets to enable us to reach every local government area in the country,\u201d Imudia says to TechCabal.\n\nKonga.com is a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies can list health products like medicines. Konga delivers orders from those pharmacies to individual consumers.\n\nBut beyond fulfilling orders to individuals, Konga plans to go bigger by working on bulk orders between pharmacies and businesses or government agencies, Imudia says. That will require some investments on infrastructure for cold distribution and ensuring warehouses are of the right temperature.\n\nSalient Advisory\u2019s report notes that \u201cclear and harmonised regulations\u201d could boost this entry of e-commerce players into the health products distribution space.\n\nKonga has two licenses to directly distribute products for drug manufacturers and import drugs from the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Imudia says. But he clarifies that Konga will not act as a pharmacy by selling drugs directly to consumers \u2013 but will rely on its marketplace platform that allows merchants to sell on Konga.com\n\nHow big can this new business line be for Konga? Imudia declines to share what health products logistics currently contributes to Konga\u2019s overall business. But he believes it will be \u201ca major part\u201d of Konga\u2019s business in the future.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "A Nigerian-Taiwanese couple, on their love for online gaming",
          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "The unique case of Africans with learning disabilities and assistive technology",
          "text": "In 2020, Manchester United\u2019s Marcus Rashford tweeted that reading and books are cool. But, unfortunately, this is not the case for everyone.\n\nReading is cool. Books are cool.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the tweet \ud83d\udcda \u2014 Marcus Rashford MBE (@MarcusRashford) November 18, 2020\n\nMary*, a dyslexic Nigerian, shared her struggles with reading under Rashford\u2019s tweet. And in a few minutes, his fans in the UK criticised her, explaining how technology has made learning easier for people with dyslexia and other learning disabilities like dyscalculia and dysgraphia.\n\nA 2017 World Bank research in 19 middle and low-income countries reveals that 3 in 10 children with disabilities have never enrolled in school, and more than half who enrol don\u2019t complete primary school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLikewise, while one in six children with disabilities is literate, only two complete their secondary school education.\n\nLiving with learning disabilities in Africa\n\nPhoto by Santi Vedr\u00ed on Unsplash\n\nLearning disabilities are neurological disorders that affect how children and adults receive and process information.\n\nThe American National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) established that learning disabilities affect children\u2019s abilities to understand or use spoken or written language, do mathematical calculations, coordinate movements, or direct attention.\n\nAfrica on the Blog, a blog that addresses social issues in Africa, describes how some Ugandan schools rejected a dyslexic boy because of his learning disability (LD).\n\nAnother study shows that slow learners and children with learning disabilities (LDs) in Africa are on the rise; but determining the number in some countries is nearly impossible because of inadequate data.\n\nA World Health Organization (WHO) fact sheet reveals that assistive products are only available to one in ten people who need them.\n\nIn 2017, the International School of Disability Studies (ISDS) concluded that most people with LDs are not diagnosed. As a result, their families are not well informed about providing the necessary care and support.\n\nPerhaps, Mary typifies the average African who is unaware of what learning disabilities are or doesn\u2019t know enough of assistive technology to get it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFejiro, a young adult who was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \u2014 a common disorder that co-exists with learning disabilities \u2014 in 2016, says, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of assistive technology. Whenever I read, I use ebooks and web searches, but I\u2019m easily distracted. Studying is hard, I won\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\nConsequently, some people with LDs are tagged stupid or other derogatory names.\n\nOladoyin Idowu is the founder of One Word Africa \u2014 a dyslexia-focused initiative in Africa. A person with dyslexia herself, she said that teachers called her stupid, which affected her self-esteem.\n\nShe left school and didn\u2019t return until she found her confidence in interior design.\n\nDare*, a young Nigerian in his mid-20s \u2014 who has run personal diagnosis tests online \u2014 says, \u201cLast year, I found out that I might have been dealing with dyslexia and ADHD. Perhaps, that is why I struggled through school and eventually became a dropout. Concerning assistive technology, I haven\u2019t heard of it.\u201d\n\nAlthough children with learning disabilities find it hard to cope in school and are more likely to be withdrawn, assistive technology (AT) can make learning easier with devices and services that develop or improve children\u2019s capabilities.\n\nWhat is assistive technology (AT)?\n\nAccording to the Assistive Technology Industry Association, AT is any item, piece of equipment, software program, or product system that increases, maintains, or improves the functionality and capabilities of persons with disabilities.\n\nAT improves learning disability difficulties affecting listening, writing, reading, math, organisation, and memory. And it ranges from low-tech like special writing instruments to high-tech like iPads designed to meet a child\u2019s specific learning needs.\n\nHardware like the voice amplification system and speech-generating device, software like the text-to-speech systems, and inclusive to specialised learning materials and curriculum like modern devices with specialised apps support learning.\n\nTypes of accessible assistive technology\n\nText-to-speech AT\n\nThis software helps children and adults with learning disabilities like dyslexia and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) comprehend texts when read out to them.\n\nThis easily accessible type of AT can influence decoding, word recognition, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. However, it\u2019s only useful for people who retain information by listening rather than reading.\n\nLikewise, it offers reading, writing, studying, and organisational support for people with dyslexia and dysgraphia.\n\nIn a 2009 research, Hsin-Yu Chiang and Karen Jacobs mention that this type of AT improves children\u2019s work perception and makes their writings expressive. Some of the examples of this are NaturalReader, Ivona, and iSpeech.\n\nSpeech-to-text AT\n\nWriting includes low transcription skills like handwriting, spelling, punctuation, grammar; it also contains high composition skills like planning, generating content, and revising.\n\nThus, this type of software transcribes words that help people with dyspraxia and dysgraphia.\n\nIt is believed that the software increases students\u2019 productivity since they help them to avoid typing or handwriting.\n\nThis type of AT improves word recognition, spelling, and reading comprehension skills among children with learning disabilities.\n\nOther assistive technology tools\n\nPhoto by Jukka Aalho on Unsplash\n\nTools like audiobooks and publications, abbreviation expanders, electronic math worksheets, proofreading programmes, information/data managers, optical character recognition, variable speed-tape recorders, word prediction programmes, talking calculators, speech recognition programmes, speech synthesisers/screen recorders, and alternative keyboards support people with learning disabilities.\n\nIn a 2018 fact sheet, WHO describes how technology is helping people with learning disabilities to live healthily, independently, productively. It also highlights their full involvement in education, the labour market, and civic life, which means learning disabled people can recognise, unleash, and reach their full potentials.\n\nWhy assistive technology?\n\nLearning disabilities do not affect intelligence but impair one or more cognitive processes related to learning.\n\nConsequently, adopting assistive technology helps improve an individual\u2019s learning skills like math, reading, writing, organisation, abstract reasoning, long and short-term memory, attention, and time planning.\n\nSpeaking on why she adopted AT, Idowu says, \u201cI use assistive technology, and it really makes my life easy. The Speechify app and OneNote Immersive Reader help me to scan my notes and convert them to audio. I can also upload my notes on them. I use Grammarly, QuillBot, and The Mind app.\u201d\n\nBesides, having a sound support system as a learning disabled person is helpful.\n\n\u201cI cannot overemphasise the power of a good support system \u2014 having people that genuinely care and want to help. I have a friend who helps restructure, proofread, and edit all my writings,\u201d she points out.\n\nShe adds, \u201cthere was a time I developed physical panic episodes before an exam I was to write. I was so scared, and it was about to be a public nightmare, but my friends took the initiative and helped to manage the situation.\u201d\n\nThere is currently no cure for learning disabilities. However, AT has been proven to improve learning for children with learning disabilities, as reflected in this research where students with learning disabilities used Dragon \u2014 a speech-to-text tool \u2014 for dictations.\n\nThe result revealed a significant impact, proving that assistive technology eliminates barriers based on learning disabilities.\n\nThe causes of learning disabilities are unknown. However, they have been linked to premature birth, maternal illnesses, and complications during childbirth reducing oxygen supply to the child\u2019s brain; in some cases, they are hereditary. What they aren\u2019t are the results of witchcraft activities.\n\nWith no cure in sight, children with LDs can unleash their potential and succeed with a good support system while adopting assistive technology.\n\n* \u2013 Not real name",

          "text": "The emergence of Charles Chukwuma Soludo, a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Anambra State, has been received with excitement in some quarters.\n\nSoludo has remained a respected economic policy authority in Nigeria since leaving the CBN, credited as the only CBN governor in recent times to ensure a single-digit inflation rate for 24 consecutive months.\n\nFor some observers, Soludo\u2019s emergence and eventual success at the poll may perhaps be the beginning of a new chapter for Anambra State based on his track record and excellent performance while in public office.\n\nA third quarter 2020 data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that Anambra State had the lowest unemployment rate in Nigeria.\n\nThe data show that only 13 percent of the 2.3 million working people in the state are unemployed in a nation where the national average unemployment rate is over 27 percent.\n\nOf course, this is a great feat by the Willie Obiano administration, which has shown great leadership promise in transforming the infrastructure of the state, attracting industries and creating a socially stable, business-friendly environment.\n\nHowever, there is the feeling among the populace that the state is not where it should be, considering its potential and promise.\n\nPundits say that based on his track record as governor of the CBN where he embarked on major transformation of the banking sector through a banking consolidation that provided trillions of naira credit to thousands of businesses and created unprecedented employment, Soludo has what it takes to transform Anambra State.\n\nThey believe he can take the state to an enviable position by creating a conducive business environment for great indigenous entrepreneurs to invest in the state, and extending the same to the whole of South Eastern region.\n\nHowever, others say the position of a state governor is a sharp contrast from being the head of the CBN, while so many factors could also count and decide his success or failure in office as state governor.\n\n\u201cSoludo should understand that the state governorship position is not like being a CBN governor, and Anambra is not like Lagos State or Rivers State that is commercial based, where there is money to execute projects.\n\n\u201cSo, if he wants to perform he may adopt stricter policy in taxation to get money from people, which may be misunderstood. I think he would perform, if the people can be patient with him, but his policies may be misunderstood initially,\u201d political commentator, Tade Ademola, says.\n\nSince 2009, when he narrowly lost the Anambra State gubernatorial election as a candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) to Peter Obi, Soludo has never hidden his intention to govern the state.\n\nAnd since moving to APGA, he has thrown his hat in the ring on several occasions without success, while consistently being a supporter of Obiano\u2019s administration. So, his decision to contest the November 6, 2021, election did not come as a surprise to many.\n\nSpeaking recently, while declaring his ambition, Soludo had said he hoped to leverage his international connections to transform the state. He said having served the global community, he was now poised to serve and develop Anambra.\n\nSoludo won the Wednesday\u2019s primaries by polling a total of 740 votes out of a total of 792 votes cast in the election.\n\nHe won three other contestants that included the member representing Orumba-North/Orumba-South Federal Constituency, Okwudili Chukwu Ezenwankwo, who scored 41 votes; Damian Okolo, 7 votes, and ThankGod Ibe, who polled 4 votes.\n\nSpeaking on the exercise, Anambra State governor, Willie Obiano, described the conduct of the primaries as most peaceful, free, fair and transparent.\n\nHe charged APGA members to brace up for the challenges of making sure that the party wins the main election, and expressed optimism that the party would repeat its victory that returned him for a second term.\n\nIn 1998, Soludo was appointed to the position of professor of economics at the University of Nigeria; the next year he became a visiting professor at Swarthmore in Swarthmore, USA.\n\nSoludo joined the Federal Government in 2003, and became the CBN governor from May 2004 to 2009.\n\nPrior to his May 2004 appointment, he held the positions of chief economic adviser to former President Obasanjo and chief executive of the National Planning Commission of Nigeria.\n\nHe is also a member of the British Department\u2019s International Advisory Group, and currently serves on the Chief Economist Advisory Council (CEAC) of the World Bank.\n\nHe is also a consultant and strategic adviser to institutional investors in Africa; a member of the Technical Advisory Group of the Natural Resource Charter, Oxford, and member and chairman of boards of several companies.\n\nIn 2019, he was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as a member of an eight-man Economic Advisory Council, which reports directly to him.",

          "text": "Most digital banking solutions focus more on payment services while the availability of credit receives little attention when it comes to digitised banking. Ergo, players in the Fintech space are making a call toward the digitisation of credit to boost the economy.\n\nThe gains of digitising the credit processes both for organisations and businesses in need of loans were discussed at a stakeholder meeting organised by the Committee of E-Business Industry Heads (CeBIH) in Lagos.\n\nIn line with the central topic, stakeholders were urged to transform credit through digital optimisation as it would foster equal access to credit facility to everyone, especially those at the bottom of the pyramid.\n\nDigital lending is seen as the process of offering loans that are applied for, disbursed, and managed through digital channels. The process is instant, automated, and remote.\n\nThe chairman of CeBIH Adeyemi Atanda said he believes that availing credit is one of the major avenues to drive economic empowerment.\n\nRead Also: 5 funding opportunities for SMEs in Nigeria\n\nSpeaking to our correspondent, he said Nigeria is at the level of two to three percent credit availability to the bottom of the pyramid, whereas in other developed countries, that ratio is about 40 percent.\n\nFurther checks show that Nigeria\u2019s overall financial inclusion target was 80 percent by 2020. EFInA data shows that only 64 percent of Nigerian adults were financially included by the end of 2020, meaning that 36 percent of Nigerian adults, or 38 million adults, remain completely financially excluded.\n\nOn the issue of financial inclusion, women remain more financially excluded than men, with only 45 percent of women using formal financial services, compared with 56 percent of men.\n\n\u201cThis means that Nigeria is very far from the target,\u201d Atanda said. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t make credit available to people, SMEs will not grow, businesses will not be able to expand and we\u2019ll not be able to create employment which actually is supposed to drive our economy.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he said there is a need for home-grown solutions to be able to drive digital credit optimization as every solution imported is paid in FX and there\u2019s a lot of pressure on the Naira right now.\n\n\u201cSo, to reduce that, we need to grow our own solutions locally,\u201d he adds.\n\nAlthough cultural behaviour, regulation and enabling environment, IT infrastructure, and organisational structure were some identified challenges at the event, Anino Akperi, CEO, Money Mall, said digital innovations should be designed in such a way that Nigerians can have access to loans.\n\nHe argued that a lot has changed in the credit space as the sector has moved beyond manual processing of things: manual customer acquisition, manual credit processing, disbursement, and other processes.\n\nCommending CeBIH for being able to bring to show that every aspect of banking can be digitalised, and not just payment systems and money transfers, he noted that the credit area is a critical aspect of banking and if digitised, it will help the banks to reduce their cost of customer acquisition, cost of credit administration, and also help those that are seeking facilities to be able to get money easily.\n\nMost importantly, the issue of credit concentration is eliminated with digitized credit, according to Akperi, who said more than 40 percent of loans granted in Nigeria are within three sectors: oil and gas, construction, and maybe government.\n\n\u201cWhat happens to the rest,\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cAnd that also points out something: whenever we have issues around oil price, non-performing loans in the industry go up. So, critically, every lender will need to diversify, spread out these loans.\n\n\u201cLet the loans no longer be concentrated in Lagos. Let the man in Damaturu, and Eket have equal access such that the opportunities that exist there, the people can take advantage of it and do well and it helped the entire economy.\u201d\n\nSteve Bireley, chief technology officer, Lokyata, advised Fintechs to find ways to measure the effectiveness of digital optimisation because with measurement, they will not know how effective their optimisation is.\n\nCeBIH is constituted of the upper echelon of electronic business industry practitioners in all Banks in Nigeria with its major and most important objective being the promotion of electronic banking services in line with global best practices.\n\nThis event is one of its activities at driving awareness across the industry.",

          "text": "During the ongoing 47th regular session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva, Switzerland, 65 countries made a joint statement to express support for China amid a rampant anti-China campaign at the UNHRC started by some Western countries.\n\nIn the statement, they stressed that respecting the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of each sovereign state without interfering in its internal affairs is the requirement of the basic norms governing international relations, and that affairs concerning Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet are China\u2019s domestic affairs and should not be interfered by external forces.\n\nThe statement also advocated abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and respecting the right of people from all countries to independently choose the path of human rights development according to their own national conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, it opposed double standards or politicization of human rights issues, groundless accusations against China based on disinformation or political purposes, and making use of human rights as an excuse to interfere in China\u2019s domestic affairs.\n\nAside from the 65 countries, six countries from the Gulf Cooperation Council sent a message to support China, and more than 20 countries delivered separate speeches to support China.\n\nThe sonorous and forceful voices of justice made by a total of over 90 countries at the UNHRC have been spread across the globe and will be heard by people in every corner of the world.\n\nIn stark contrast, Canada, the U.S., the U.K, and some other Western countries have fabricated and disseminated false information to attack and smear China under the guise of human rights, and undermined international human rights dialogues and cooperation for the political purpose of suppressing and containing China.\n\nAs a vast number of developing countries have expressed firm support for China, the voices of these Western countries, which can neither represent human rights standard nor public opinion, seem particularly out of place and harsh.\n\nIronically, these Western countries that have acted as self-styled judges of human rights have a poor record of human rights issues, which were discussed and criticized by many countries at the UNHRC.\n\nThe remains of more than 200 indigenous children were recently discovered at a boarding school in Canada, which reminds people once again Canada\u2019s historical atrocities of killing the indigenous people and eradicating their culture.\n\nAbout 150,000 indigenous children in Canada were forcibly taken away from their parents and sent to boarding schools, where at least 4,000 children died of unnatural causes.\n\nSystematic and institutional racial discrimination are becoming more intense in the U.K. One-third of the families with children under the age of 15 live in poverty, and the rights of a large number of refugees and immigrants have been seriously violated.\n\nBesides, British soldiers randomly torture and kill civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan, and yet are free from punishments because of the protection of the government.\n\nThe U.S., the so-called \u201cbeacon of human rights\u201d, seems to have always made irresponsible remarks about the human rights situation in other countries, but turned a blind eye to its own problems.\n\nEven after the tragedy of George Floyd, an African American who died in violent law enforcement, systematic racial discrimination and violence in law enforcement are still common in the U.S.\n\nData suggest that from January to November 2020, there were only 17 days when the U.S. didn\u2019t see any death caused by law enforcement personnel.\n\nSince 2001, the U.S. has carried out the so-called counter-terrorism operations in more than 80 countries, causing the death of more than 800,000 people in direct war violence, including about 335,000 civilians, and displacing tens of millions of people.\n\nSince it was founded 100 years ago, the CPC has made its mission striving for people\u2019s human rights and freedom.\n\nThe CPC has always focused its efforts on helping people live a better life, and devoted itself to continuously protecting and improving human rights in the development process, trying to benefit all the Chinese people with the fruits of development.\n\nIt is because of the efforts of the CPC that the New China has seen earth-shattering changes since its reform and opening-up and secured historic achievements and transformation with the cause of the CPC and the nation since the 18th National Congress of the CPC in 2012.\n\nXi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, stressed that living a happy life is the primary human right.\n\nNo matter how times develop and how circumstances change, China has remained consistent in believing that human rights are the common pursuit of all mankind, rather than a patent of a few countries or be used as a tool to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and incite the subversion and overthrow of regimes.\n\nChina will continuously adhere to its people-centered approach in protecting human rights, uphold the universal values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom, and conduct constructive dialogues and cooperation with various parties on human rights protection on the basis of equality and mutual respect.\n\nAs China is about to comprehensively build a moderately prosperous society, the country will certainly bring its human rights cause to a higher level and make greater contributions to the healthy development of the world\u2019s human rights cause.",

          "text": "A High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Maitama has nullified the elections held by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State on June 10 and 11 to elect a three-man ad-hoc ward delegate that would participate in the voting at the primary of the PDP scheduled for June 26, 2021.\n\nJustice Olukayode Adeniyi, in a ruling, held that all activities engaged in by the party after the court\u2019s June 9, 2021 judgment sacking the Anambra PDP\u2019s Executive Council (EXCO), including the June 10 and 11 elections, were null and void because they were done in violation of orders contained in the judgment.\n\nJustice Adeniyi also rejected the request by the PDP and two of its chieftains \u2013 Chief Ndubisi Nwobu and Barr. Uchenna Obiora \u2013 for an order staying the court\u2019s June 9 judgment.\n\nIn the ruling on the three applications by the PDP, Nwobu and Obiora, Justice Adeniyi held that they failed to make out a case to warrant the grant of their application that sought to stay the judgment pending the determination of the appeal.\n\nJustice Adeniyi came down hard on the applicants for denigrating the court in their reaction to the judgment and proceeded to hold that they did not show that the non-staying of the judgment would either render their appeals nugatory or make it impossible for the party to conduct its primary for the forthcoming governorship election.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe first applicant (the PDP), which is the principal party, has maintained in the face of this court that its judgment is null and void for want of jurisdiction. The same party cannot, at the same time, seek equitable reliefs from the same court.\n\n\u201cA party that has no regard for the judgment of a court and described it in derogatory terms to the whole world, as shown in Exhibit C, cannot quietly return to the same court to seek equitable relief to stay the same judgment that it defied and defiled.\n\n\u201cAn assessment of the totality of the circumstances that have been presented before me by the instant applications leads to only one conclusion, which is that the applicants do not have an iota of respect for the authority of this court, they issued a release to embolden their members not to reckon with the judgment of the court and followed it up by taking of definite contemptuous steps in disregard of the court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\u201cFor them to come back with a motion for stay of execution and injunction pending the determination of their appeal, in my view, is a clear afterthought. I there say that no court worth its authority will grant any such application, no matter how well presented and argued,\u201d Justice Adeniyi said.\n\nThe June 9 judgment, which they sought to stay, was on a suit marked: HC/CV/774/2021 filed by Samuel Anyakolah (for himself and all local government chairmen and ward executives that emerged from the Anambra PDP congress conducted on November 28 and December 1, 2017 under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba, as Acting Chairman State Caretaker Committee).\n\nThe judge agreed with the plaintiff/claimant that the PDP violated its constitution in the conduct of the Southeast zonal congress of March 6, 2021 and the appointments made therein.\n\nHe declared among others, that \u201call congresses, designations or appointments made by the first defendant (the PDP), with respect to the positions of the state chairman, EXCO members and local government chairmen, as contained in pages 14,15 and 16 of the Southeast zonal congress brochure of 6th March 2021 are hereby nullified and set aside.\u201d\n\nThe judge ordered the PDP to henceforth, recognise and adopt only the list of the already inaugurated party officers and delegates that emerged from the Anambra PDP congresses conducted on November 28, 2017 and December 1, 2017 validated by Senator France Bent Ward Congress Appeal Panel report and Barrister Ukpai Ukairo Local Government Appeal Panel report, under the supervision of Sir Chukwudi Umeaba, who shall continue to act in the capacities for which they were duly elected.",
          "summary": "Justice Adeniyi also rejected the request by the PDP and two of its chieftains \u2013 Chief Ndubisi Nwobu and Barr.\nHe said: \u201cThe first applicant (the PDP), which is the principal party, has maintained in the face of this court that its judgment is null and void for want of jurisdiction.\nThe same party cannot, at the same time, seek equitable reliefs from the same court.\nI there say that no court worth its authority will grant any such application, no matter how well presented and argued,\u201d Justice Adeniyi said.\nThe judge agreed with the plaintiff/claimant that the PDP violated its constitution in the conduct of the Southeast zonal congress of March 6, 2021 and the appointments made therein.",

When the youth started the #EndSARS protest, Mr President supported the genuine agitation and approved the demand of the youths by disbanding SARS immediately until anarchists took over the situation and began to cause destruction.\n\n\u201cWe hereby call on all youths to support President Buhari who has shown uncommon love for the youth. The President swiftly disbanded SARS when the youths took to the streets to protest. Truly President Buhari ended SARS before anarchy took over the movement. We are at a critical moment in our national life and as youth we must not be part of those who seek to cripple the country.

The only option left is for use to borrow responsibly, utilise prudently and economically, and ensure that the projects are self-sustaining; that they can pay back the loans,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Lawan added, \u201cOur options are really very limited as a country. First, we do not have the necessary revenue; Nigeria is poor, we should not deceive ourselves. Nigeria is not rich given the circumstances we live in, given the challenges we have.\n\n\u201cOur resources are so low, our revenues are so low; therefore, the option of not doing anything just to sit (because we have no money, we should not go for infrastructure development) is not an option worthy of consideration. You cannot keep the economy stagnant.\u201d\n\nInvestors Not Willing\n\nHe gave the assurance that the National Assembly would give legislative approval to the Executive loan request to fund the 2021 Appropriation Act before it embarked on a recess in July.\n\nThe lawmaker reiterated that the 2021 Supplementary Bill would also go through final consideration before the recess to fast-track the government\u2019s procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and military hardware to tackle insecurity.\n\nWhile stressing the need to borrow funds, he stated that the Legislature would not just support or approve loans for the executive.\n\nThe Senate President noted that this would be done only after investigating the implementation of such loans through oversight functions to ensure that they were directly deployed for intended projects.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria has no other choice than to borrow money and the option of private-public partnerships and Internally Generation Revenue (IGR) was not worthy of consideration.\n\nSenator Lawan said, \u201cWhat I want to assure Nigerians here is that we are not going to be frivolously supporting or approving loans for the Executive arm of government; whenever we have to approve any loan, we will insist on the details of the funding to look at the conditions that are attached to the loans and they must be favourable conditions before we approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other option is probably private partnership \u2013 you need to create the environment to attract investors to come into your country. Because of the security challenges we face today, not many investors would like to come to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn fact, even those inside Nigeria may not like to invest properly in the sector of infrastructure development,\u201d he said.",

But from now, this will be replaced by extra-time and penalties.\n\nA UEFA statement read: \u201cFollowing the recommendation of the UEFA Club Competitions Committee and the UEFA Women\u2019s Football Committee, the UEFA Executive Committee has today approved a proposal to remove the so-called away goals rule from all UEFA club competitions (men, women and youth) as of the qualifying phases of the 2021/22 competitions.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the abolishment of the away goals rule, UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin said: \u201cThe away goals rule has been an intrinsic part of UEFA competitions since it was introduced in 1965. However, the question of its abolition has been debated at various UEFA meetings over the last few years. Although there was no unanimity of views, many coaches, fans and other football stakeholders have questioned its fairness and have expressed a preference for the rule to be abolished.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the rule now runs counter to its original purpose as, in fact, it now dissuades home teams \u2014 especially in first legs \u2014 from attacking, because they fear conceding a goal that would give their opponents a crucial advantage. There is also criticism of the unfairness, especially in extra time, of obliging the home team to score twice when the away team has scored.\n\n\u201cIt is fair to say that home advantage is nowadays no longer as significant as it once was. Taking into consideration the consistency across Europe in terms of styles of play, and many different factors which have led to a decline in home advantage, the UEFA Executive Committee has taken the correct decision in adopting the view that it is no longer appropriate for an away goal to carry more weight than one scored at home.\u201d",
