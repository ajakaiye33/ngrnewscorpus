          "text": "The Gombe State government has appealed to the governments of Lagos and Rivers concerning their decision on the collection of Value Added Tax.\n\nThe Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, had signed a bill on VAT followed by an order requiring businesses to henceforth pay VAT to the state and not to the Federal Inland Revenue Service.\n\nHe announced that the payment of VAT to the state will commence this September.\n\nThis was after a judgment by a federal high court in Port Harcourt restrained the FIRS from collecting VAT in the state.\n\nThe Lagos State government, in line with the judgment, also passed a VAT bill and asked the FIRS to stop collecting VAT from businesses in the state.\n\nThis is despite the FIRS insisting that until the court of appeal or supreme court issues a final verdict, it still has the right to collect VAT in states.\n\nReacting, the Gombe State Commissioner of Finance and Economic Development, Muhammad Magaji, appealed to Lagos and Rivers to be their brothers\u2019 keeper by contributing to the centre.\n\nMagaji, who spoke at the technical workshop organised by the state on the medium-term sector strategy, warned against a trajectory that will not augur well for the federation.\n\nHe was quoted by TheCable, \u201cThe VAT issue will have adverse effects not only on Gombe state but almost all the states of the federation. I was part of the discussion a few weeks ago by all commissioners of finance across the country,\u201d Magaji said.\n\n\u201cThe realisation was that only Lagos, Rivers and probably Delta states would be able to pull through without this VAT being administered centrally, and it is our appeal that we all put sentiments behind and work towards a federation that is one, by being our brothers\u2019 keepers and ensuring that what is pull together at the centre is distributed to be able to balance resources across the country.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that the oil-producing states collect only 13 per cent derivation, so if you say every state will take whatever resources it has, that it means we are starting a very dangerous trajectory that will not augur well for the federation called Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "Rivers State is leading the fight in the country to stop the Federal Inland Revenue Service from collecting Value Added Tax generated by states.\n\nVAT is a consumption tax paid when goods are purchased and services are rendered. It is charged at a rate of 7.5 per cent.\n\nAccording to Governor Nyesom Wike, Rivers generates an average of N15bn in VAT every month but gets a paltry 25% from the Federal Government as monthly allocation.\n\nLast month, the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, in a judgment in suit number FHC/PH/CS/149/2020, held that the Rivers State Government had the powers to collect VAT within its territory.\n\nAlthough the FIRS applied to the court for a stay of execution, Justice Stephen Pam rejected the application, saying granting it would negate the principle of equity.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that the FIRS, in a bid to retain the collection of the tax, wrote to the National Assembly to seek the inclusion of VAT collection in the exclusive legislative list.\n\nSpeaking at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting on Wednesday in Port Harcourt, the governor ordered companies based in the state to start paying their VAT to the state government beginning this September.\n\nHe also insisted that Rivers VAT does not belong to \u201cAbuja people\u201d.\n\nWike lamented the injustice in the country, saying Rivers State generated N15bn VAT revenue in June this year, but got N4.7bn in return, while Kano generated N2.8bn in the same month and got the same N2.8bn back.\n\nThe governor also said N46.4bn was collected from Lagos State in the same month but the Federal Government gave Lagos N9.3bn. \u201cSometimes, you don\u2019t want to believe these things exist,\u201d he added.\n\nWike had assented to the Rivers State Value Added Tax Law 2021 in August after it was passed by the state House of Assembly.\n\nHere are things you should know about the 15-page document sighted by The PUNCH.\n\n1. Section 7 of the law specified that the Rivers State Board of Internal Revenue shall administer and implement the law including the collection of VAT from all taxable persons and companies.\n\n2. Section 8 of the law stated that taxable persons or business entities must register with the Board within six months of the commencement of the law or earlier. Failure to do so attracts N50,000 fine for the first month and N100,000 fine for subsequent months.\n\n3. Section 9 of the law noted that non-resident companies transacting businesses in the state are also required to pay 7.5% VAT on taxable goods and services to the Board.\n\n4. Section 15 of the law stated that taxable persons or companies are required to render an account to the Board on or before 21st day of the succeeding month of the goods and services purchased or supplied in the previous month.\n\n5. Section 22 of the law specified that evasion of tax attracts not more than three years imprisonment or twice the amount of tax evaded\n\n6. Section 35 clearly stated that the state government will get 70% of the total revenue that accrues from VAT while the local government where the transactions were performed will get 30%.\n\n7. The law exempted VAT collection on goods and services including medical and pharmaceutical products, food items, books and educational materials, baby products, fertilizers and farming equipment, amongst others.",

          "text": "*Say blackout destroying our economy\n\n\n\n*Govt won\u2019t play politics with the challenge, says NDPHC\n\n\n\n*Restoring electricity in south my major concern \u2014Akeredolu\n\n\n\n*Power supply challenge in Ondo South beyond us\u2014BEDC\n\nBy Dayo Johnson\n\nFOR the residents of the six council areas that consist of Ondo South Senatorial District in Ondo State, the economic hub of the state, numbering almost three million, it has been lamentations over perpetual blackout and the deplorable state of electricity in their communities for almost 15 years.\n\n\n\nHundreds of communities in the six councils have been without electricity for these years.\n\n\n\nSome of the affected council areas include Okitipupa, Ile-Oluji/Oke-Igbo, Odigbo, Irele, Ese-Odo and Ilaje.\n\n\n\nSuccessive governments, both at the state and federal level, have raised their hope and also dashed it as the problem remained unsolved.\n\n\n\nThe total blackout has destroyed the socio-economic development of the districts following the disconnection of the riverine communities from the national grid by Benin Electricity Distribution Company, BEDC.\n\n\n\nThe power outage was reportedly caused by trees that fell on power lines in Odigbo Local Government Area, where the sub-station that feeds the entire coastal area is located.\n\n\n\nIt was also reported that a huge debt of about N2 billion owed by the residents in the affected communities was the major reason for their disengagement from the national grid.\n\n\n\nHowever, the BEDC said the problems had gone beyond the issue of debt owed by the residents but that the power supply challenge in the communities was beyond them.\n\n\n\nBlackout has destroyed our economy, residents lament\n\nA rights activist, Mr. Kolade Omoyeni, in Sabomi, Ilaje/Ese-Odo area of the state said the total blackout has destroyed the socio-economic development of the districts.\n\n\n\nIn his open letter to the president, entitled: \u2018President Buhari, Save Ondo South From Decades Of Darkness Now,\u2019 he said: \u201cThe social, economic, and moral growth and development of our people are now in obvious disarray.\n\n\n\n\u201cEven politicians have worked to get BEDC to the needy but the electricity distributor is hell-bent on keeping over three million people in darkness.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere can\u2019t be an industry in Ondo South where the people have been living in darkness for about 15 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need President Buhari to ask the National Electricity Regulations Commission and the Ministry of Power: is the BEDC more powerful than the regulatory agencies or even the presidency? And can\u2019t another service provider take over Ondo South instead?\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will be happy if this injustice against Ondo South is corrected immediately.\n\n\u201cThe absence of electricity in Ondo South is a real threat to the livelihood of Apoi, Ilaje, Ikale, Odigbo, and Ijaw/Arogbo people. These are nations that have contributed in no small measure to what Nigeria is today.\n\n\n\n\u201cHistory will note if your presidency, as you envisioned on ending on good notes, would correct the injustice against us and restore our electricity fully and unconditionally very soon.\n\n\n\nForum petitions NERC\n\nVanguard gathered that prominent people from the district including traditional rulers and political office holders under the aegis of Ondo South Consultative, OSCF, said they have written several petitions to the National Electricity Regulations Commission, NERC, on their plight.\n\n\n\nThe forum said: \u201cWe scrutinised the bills tendered by BEDC and discovered several irregularities, jumbled figures and duplications of names and addresses. Indeed, BEDC bills clearly showed disjointed claims, bogus, fraudulent and unverifiable amounts.\n\n\n\nThey said that the rate of criminality was unprecedented and unduly high, as the basic local economic activities like welding, hair-cut and hair-dressing had become moribund.\n\n\n\n\u201cKeeping millions of people in darkness for this long certainly negated the lofty and good rural and urban development programme by the government to discourage migration from the rural environment to the cities.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re ready to contribute toward restoring electricity\u2014Residents\n\n\n\nResidents of the affected communities described the crisis as a deliberate move not to restore the affected communities to the national grid after years of disconnection by the Benin Electricity Distribution Company, BEDC.\n\n\n\nThey noted that the development has brought untold hardship to them, making life meaningless, as commercial activities had been paralysed in the areas.\n\n\n\nAccording to them, \u201cthose who rely on electricity for their businesses have relocated to other areas to secure their livelihoods.\u201d\n\n\n\nA community leader in Irele, Chief Amos Adegoroye appealed to President Buhari and Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to look into their plight and put an end to their problem, adding that not even a series of protests embarked upon by residents changed their plight.\n\n\n\nHe said the youths and community leaders had protested on several occasions with no positive result, saying the authorities promised to assist but nothing concrete had been done.\n\n\n\nAnother resident of Okitipupa, Goke Adetarami, said the problem started when the BEDC disconnected electricity over some accumulated bills and claimed that some of its equipment had been vandalised by miscreants who also stole some properties belonging to the company.\n\n\n\nWhile noting that past governments have paid lip service to restoring electricity in the four local government areas, he noted that \u201cWe are ready to contribute toward restoring electricity; we are appealing to government to support us and together we can restore electricity to the district.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso, Yomi Afolabi from Igbokoda, urged Akeredolu to write his name in gold, saying the governor is on the verge of turning the southern region of the state into an industrial hub with the construction of the largest seaport in West Africa and the commencement of bitumen exploitation in the area.\n\n\n\nAfolabi said: \u201cI want to urge the governor with all sense of responsibility that the major priority of this government to the people of this area is to restore power so that the Ondo seaport and bitumen exploration will come to reality. We know the importance of this seaport to the economy of this state and the nation of Nigeria in general.\u201d\n\n\n\nGovt won\u2019t play politics with issues of electricity \u2014 NDPHC boss\n\nHowever, speaking on the efforts of the government in restoring electricity after over 10 years of total blackout, the Executive Director of the Niger Delta Power Holding Company, NDPHC, Mr. Ife Oyedele said that serious efforts were being made toward ensuring the people of the district are connected to the national grid.\n\n\n\nOyedele said: \u201cWe must get it right that government has no business in restoring power to communities but the government of President Buhari has taken a conscious decision to ensure that government is for the people.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe maintained that NDPHC and the Federal Government would not play politics with issues of electricity, disclosing that all necessary resources were being deployed for the quick restoration of electricity.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are not in the business of tricking the people; we are serious about what we are doing. We want a lasting restoration of power to that area to ensure that when we eventually switch on the light, it will be all-encompassing. We have sub-stations in the area now. We have a government that is supportive.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to assure the people of Ondo South senatorial district that work is going on and by the time light is restored they will be proud of this government. We are working to ensure that the people are not short-changed.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy organisation, with the support of the Vice President, will ensure that the 122 KVA being financed by NDDC from Omotosho to Ode Erinje is completed\u201d, he said.\n\n\n\nRestoring electricity in South, Akeredolu\u2019s major concern \u2014 Ojogo\n\nReacting, the state government said it has met with the people of the area several times to find a lasting solution in restoring electricity to the affected areas in the southern senatorial district.\n\n\n\nInformation and Orientation Commissioner, Donald Ojogo, said restoring electricity in the area had been a major concern of the present Akeredolu-led administration in the state since its assumption of office.\n\n\n\nOjogo said: \u201cMr Governor is clearheaded about the fact that the wealth of the state is in the belly of the southern district and therefore can\u2019t allow the people to live in darkness.\n\n\n\n\u201cAkeredolu in his determination and commitment to restore electricity to the areas met with stakeholders from the areas and this will be achieved soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nPower supply challenge in Ondo South beyond us, says BEDC\n\nAlso reacting, the Corporate Affairs Manager, BEDC Electricity, Ondo State, Michael Barnabas said: \u201cThere are power challenges within the Southern senatorial district but there is nothing like total blackout as it is being painted.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is the power supply in Ode-Aye, Okitipupa and some few other areas in that axis.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe acute power supply limitation and inability to connect more communities in Ondo south zone which comprises; Okitipupa, Ilaje, Ese-Odo and Irele local government areas to the national grid is due to a damaged breaker at the Ondo 132/33KV station and the inability of Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) to make bulk power available for evacuation in the area.\n\n\n\n\u2019Power supply to Ondo south zone has always been grossly inadequate due largely to availability from Ondo 132/33KV injection substation which is the only source of supply now. This limitation has further been made worse by a faulty breaker on one of the 2X30MVA transformers which tied customers from Ondo town down to Okitipupa on one 30MVA transformer thereby reducing what could be wheeled out at any particular time.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe starting point of getting power to customers in the value chain is the TCN which makes bulk power available to distribution companies to evacuate at different locations which unfortunately has not been met in this case.\n\n\n\n\u201cOndo TCN where Ondo south currently gets supply is about 150km away, with network traversing thick vegetation and farmlands which results to low quality of supply.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot until TCN embarks on the prompt repair of the faulty breaker, the challenge in Ondo south would persist.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a strong commitment towards getting a sustainable solution to the power crisis in Ore and Ondo south, BEDC has entered into a third-party arrangement to connect the region through an off-grid embedded power which is billed to materialise soon.\n\n\n\nBarnabas, however, said \u201cwe are hopeful that the ongoing construction of Erinje 2X60 MVA 132/33KV injection substation by the NDDC will complement all the efforts already put in place by BEDC when it is completed.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Calabar zone, has described as an aberration and fraudulent, the N250,000 senior lecturers that should be promoted to professors are required to pay an assessment fee.\n\nThe union insisted that there is no clause in the act establishing the universities where a lecturer should pay for his own assessment.\n\nIn a statement signed by all the chairpersons comprising Calabar zone and read by the zonal coordinator, Dr Aniekan Brown, at Melany Hotel and Suites, Uyo Akwa Ibom State capital, the union said such a fee is not within the confines of the law regretting that those who refused to pay the sum had their promotions stagnated.\n\nAccording to Brown, \u201cthere is no place that a lecturer should pay for his assessment. How can ill paid staff who have invested a lot of money in research and publishing, when the time for assessment for promotion comes, they will be asked to pay a whooping N250,000?\n\n\u201cASUU views that as a case of criminality, because it\u2019s not within the confines of the law. Infact, it\u2019s an aberration, fraudulent and unconstitutional. Secondly, what do you mean I pay such huge sum and I don\u2019t get favorable assessment? Please note that some of our colleagues who stand by the truth and refused to pay; their promotions are stagnated, even if their promotions are announced it is notional, no financial backings.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the insistence of the Federal Government that universities, as well as other agencies, should migrate to the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS), the union said at no point had it supported the scheme and would never do describing it as a cesspool of corruption.\n\nDr Brown said it would be a case of historical irresponsibility for the union to accept what is not good for members stressing that ASUU was inaugurated with the mandate of advancing the course and welfare of members.\n\nButtressing his points, the Zonal Coordinator said, \u201cIt will be difficult for them to say that IPPIS stands for transparency. IPPIS is illiterate because it cannot read and understand the peculiarities of the Nigerian universities system. That is why we have salary fluctuations.\n\n\u201cOur union has always come against this IPPIS, legally, it goes against University autonomy and it failed to understand the peculiarities of Nigeria University system. IPPIS has no room for payment of salary promotion arrears.\u201d\n\nThe union also condemned the proliferation of universities by state governors without taking care of the existing ones saying, \u201cState governments proposing to establish new universities should be barred from accessing TETFund grants to support their projects for at least ten years. Owners of the proposed universities whether federal or State should provide verifiable growth plans for providing not less than 75% of their pensionable academic staff complement in addition to provision of requisite Infrastructural facilities.\u201d\n\nASUU also condemned the failure of the Federal Government to honor it\u2019s part of the bargain which made the union suspend the nine months strike action saying that there is a limit to which their patience can reach.\n\nIt also made some demands which included: payment of staff emoluments starting with 2022 budgets, domestication of the universities act of 2012 in all universities, provision of functional pension scheme in line with the 2014 pension act.\n\nOthers included: payment of salaries, payment of allowances, third party deductions and other entitlements owed staff with a consciousness of a regular payment subsequently as well as constitution of visitation panels to all universities that have not been visited in at least, last five years.",

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nRivers Governor, Nyesom Wike, yesterday, said that with the infraction of the constitutional provision on collection of Valued Added Tax (VAT) addressed, his administration has commenced full implementation of the state\u2019s VAT law without hesitation.\n\nThe governor, at an interactive session with representatives of corporate organisations at the Banquet Hall , Government House, Port Harcourt, yesterday, ordered the business community in the state to be ready to pay VAT for the month of September, 2021, and subsequent months to the Rivers State Internal Revenue Service.\n\nHe said it was necessary for him to address them and to state the position of the law to the business community in the state.\n\nHe said such understanding would enable them not to fall prey to antics that could be deployed by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), whom he accused of contemplating using force to collect what did not belong to them.\n\nThe governor warned corporate organisations not to feign ignorance of the state VAT law, declaring the state government would not hesitate to seal up premises of any company that defaulted in tax remitance to the state.\n\nWike said FIRS had in the past collected VAT in the state with impunity, knowing it was unconstitutional for them to do so.\n\nHe described as morally offensive a situation where Rivers State government would award contracts for state roads worth N200 billion and FIRS would illegally receive 7.5 per cent of the amount as VAT to be distributed among other states.\n\nHe said his administration challenged their impunity in court and the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, in its declarative ruling, stated that the constitution was right in vesting powers to collect VAT with state governments. He described as unfortunate FIRS\u2019s resort to writing threatening letters to intimidate corporate organisation to pay to them, even after they had lost an appeal that sought a stay of execution of the declarative ruling on VAT collection in the state.\n\nWike said his responsibility in office included making sure that Rivers people were not denied their entitlements.\n\n\u201cWe are going to inaugurate the Tax Appeal Commission by Friday, which will be headed by a retired judge of the state.\u201d\n\nWike described the disparity in VAT proceeds and what is given to the states as an inexplicable form of injustice that weakens the performance potential of states.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you the injustice in this country. In the month of June, 2021, which we shared in July, VAT collected in Rivers State was N15.1 billion. What they gave us was N4.7 billion. See the gross injustice and these money includes contracts awarded by the Rivers State Government.\n\n\u201cThis is not an issue of party, it is the issues of infraction of the constitution, issues of illegality. Look at Lagos, it is not the same party with me. In the month of June, 2021, the VAT collected in Lagos was N46.4 billion. But, see what Lagos got, N9.3 billion. Have you seen the injustice in the country? VAT collected in Kano was N2. 8 billion and they gave them N2. 8 billion. Is there any justice in this country? So, you allow me to call the big companies, award contracts to them, then, you, FIRS, come and collect the tax and then go and distribute it to other states who are not awarding contracts. How does it sound?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rivers government has debunked a report alleging that Governor Wike in his recent broadcast had said states which forbid sales of alcoholic beverages would no longer enjoy Valued Added Tax (VAT) generated from the state.\n\nSpecial Assistant to the Governor on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, in a statement, yesterday, said the report credited to the governor was the handiwork of purveyors of lies, who want to cause public disaffection.\n\n\u201cThe attention of the Rivers State Government has been drawn to a false online publication credited to Governor Nyesom Wike. In the said publication circulating on social media, the purveyors of lies alleged that Governor Wike in a statewide broadcast on Monday, September 6, 2021, asserted that states which forbid sales of alcoholic beverages within their jurisdiction can no longer continue to enjoy Value Added Tax, (VAT) receipts generated from Rivers State.\n\n\u201cWhile it is true that Governor Wike made a statewide broadcast on the aforementioned date, shortly after the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt dismissed Federal Inland Services (FIRS) request for a stay of execution on the judgement of the court which declared Rivers State as constitutionally empowered to collect VAT and other related taxes in the state, he never said states that forbid sales and consumption of alcoholic beverages will no longer benefit from VAT generated in Rivers State. The Rivers State government considers this obnoxious publication malicious, politically motivated and intended to fan the embers of hatred and cause public disaffection.\u201d\n\nThe government urged members of the public to disregard the said publication.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

Also, most transport hubs and markets in Abuja, not to talk about the other states, have no toilets or place of convenience. In cases where there are, they are poorly managed and the hygiene situation is nothing to write home about.\n\n\u201cSchools and health centres equally suffer from lack or inadequate toilet, safe water and hygiene facilities\u201d he lamented.\n\nTo this end, UNICEF, said it is providing water chlorination for 1,799 patients, 2,735 houses and 20,765 schoolchildren with access to potable water.\n\nBesides, it would train village hygiene volunteers and community WASHCOMs in the use of chlorine tables. Disinfection of water, he assured, is going on in the affected states.\n\nThe UNICEF representative said the agency had embarked on the construction of seven water supply facilities benefiting 5,500 people in Zamfara State while 41 facilities are under construction.\n\nMinister of Environment, Dr Mohammad Abubakar, expressed surprise on the ravaging effect of the disease even after all the measures have been observed.\n\n\u201cOver the years, the Federal Ministry of Environment in collaboration with stakeholders cutting across government at all levels, organised private sector, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Community Based Organisations (CBOs), academia, development partners, has taken steps to deliver adequate sanitation and hygiene services to the citizenry.\n\n\u201cThese measures include development of policies, regulatory and legislative framework, implementation of relevant programmes and projects, establishment of relevant regulatory and enforcement agencies e.t.c\n\n\u201cDespite all these efforts, the country continues to suffer from cholera epidemic and other sanitation and hygiene-enabled diseases every year. This is largely due to our collective behaviour and attitude towards environmental sanitation and hygiene practices which are very poor.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s outbreak is very serious and has continued to ravage many states with more fatalities being reported on a daily basis\n\n\u201cIn responding to the recent cholera outbreak, the Federal Ministry of Environment immediately activated the sanitation desks in the 36 state ministries of environment and FCT urging them to carry out environmental sanitation activities in their various states aimed at containing the outbreak,\u201d he said.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\nFor the third time since it was established 44 years ago, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday officially released its Audited Financial Statement (AFS) for year 2020.\n\nWith the development, the corporation has now joined other state-owned global oil concerns that publish the details of their operations, to among others, boost investors\u2019 confidence and enhance business transparency.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari last month announced a profit after tax (PAT) of N287 billion for the NNPC for the financial year ended 2020 and had directed the corporation to ensure prompt publication of its AFS in line with the requirements of the law.\n\nThe latest financial statement of the national oil company showed that aside the already announced PAT, from a loss position of N1.7 billion in 2019, to N287 billion in 2020, NNPC\u2019s total current assets increased by 18.7 per cent compared with that of 2019, while its total current liabilities increased by 11.4 per cent within the same period.\n\nIn addition, the group\u2019s working capital remained below the line at N4.56 trillion in 2020, as against N4.44 trillion in 2019, while the corporation\u2019s group revenue for the 2020 financial year stood at N3.718 trillion as against N4.634 trillion in 2019.\n\nAccording to the national oil company, the decrease in the group\u2019s revenue could be attributed to the decline in production and price of crude oil due to global impact of Covid-19.\n\nThe corporation first published its AFS last year, the first being for 2018 and the second dealing was on its activities for 2019.\n\nBut the NNPC\u2019s independent auditors, namely PriceWaterhouse Coopers (PwC), SIAO Partners and Muhtari Dangana & Co, drew attention to a section of the document which indicated that the corporation\u2019s liabilities still outstripped its assets.\n\nThe auditors stressed that though the NNPC announced a profit of N287 billion, but the large discrepancy between assets and liabilities cast some uncertainty on the corporation\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cWe draw attention to note 42 of the consolidated and separate financial statements, which indicates that the group recorded a net profit of N287.2 billion (Corporation: N235.3 billion) during the year ended 31 December 2020 and, as at that date, the group\u2019s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by N4.6 trillion (Corporation: N729.1 billion).\n\n\u201cAs stated in note 42, these events or conditions, along with other matters as set forth in note 42, indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the group and corporation\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter,\u201d they noted.\n\nThe newly released AFS also indicated that the NNPC recorded a profit before tax of N719 billion in 2020, compared with N93 billion loss in 2019, and a total comprehensive income of N655 billion compared to a loss of N20.1 billion last year.\n\nThe financial statement was signed by the Group Managing Director of the corporation and the Chief Financial Officer, Mallam Mele Kyari and Mr Umar Ajiya respectively and was dated September 3.\n\nHowever, despite their misgivings, the auditors stated that records showed an improvement from prior year based on several group improvement efforts put in place by management, including elimination of the cost drivers responsible for the accumulation of the shortfalls in settling domestic crude obligation to Federation Account.\n\nThe auditors further acknowledged the introduction of the Price Modulator mechanism in the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) template designed to eliminate the major cause of the losses as well as minimising the breaches to pipeline networks.\n\nUnder the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), they projected that the NNPC when given the autonomy, would operate profitably, noting that the recapitalisation of the corporation would enable the resolution of all outstanding related party payables and receivables to enable NNPC start on a clean slate.\n\nKyari had while explaining how the NNPC arrived at the profit, attributed it to aggressive cost cutting, automation of the NNPC system and renegotiation of contracts downwards by about 30 per cent, among other tough measures.\n\nDuring the year, the NNPC said it donated a total sum of N3.6 billion and N9 million respectively to various charitable organisations, higher education institutions and other organisation, while no donation was made to any political party.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says it works only at a national level and not at sub-national\n\n\u2022Wike alleges plan to move appeal from Port Harcourt to Abuja court\n\n\u2022Lagos, Ekiti move to join Rivers in legal tussle\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) yesterday explained its opposition to the administration of Value Added Tax (VAT) by states in the country, saying it might stifle businesses and investments.\n\nThe federal agency insisted that the decision of the Federal High Court to grant powers to states to administer VAT would make it difficult for businesses to thrive.\n\nThis is just as it was gathered that the FIRS recently wrote to the National Assembly for an amendment of the constitution to accommodate VAT in the Exclusive Legislative List of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe development followed rising agitation by some states to collect and utilise proceeds of consumption tax, after Rivers State secured victory in court on the matter.\n\nNotwithstanding, the Rivers State government announced the commencement of full implementation of its VAT law.\n\nAlso yesterday, the Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, alleged that he had been informed that some people in government are scheming to move the appeal hearing from the Court of Appeal in Port Harcourt, to the Court of Appeal in Abuja in the hope of securing a stay of execution of the judgment.\n\nHe stated this when THISDAY contacted him for a reaction to the alleged plan. \u201cWell, I heard about the development while attending the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) meeting in Abuja.\n\n\u201cI was told that the FIRS is working to move the appeal to Abuja, but I have not confirmed whether it is true or not. But let it be known that I am standing on the principle of justice and constitutionalism. What I feel is that the right thing should be done. Whether they want to hear the appeal in Kafanchan or in America, let the law take its course.\n\n\u201cI believe the right thing must be done at the right time. This country must move forward and justice must be done. This is an issue of constitutionalism, it\u2019s not about Wike,\u201d the governor declared.\n\nTHISDAY also learnt yesterday that the Lagos and Ekiti State governments, have concluded plans to file application to be joined in the ongoing legal battle between the FIRS and Rivers.\n\nJust like the Rivers State government, which recently enacted its VAT Law 2021 to regulate the effective administration of VAT in the state, Lagos and Ekiti states have taken steps to enact similar laws on VAT collection. THISDAY learnt that some southern states were equally in the process of enacting laws in a bid to start collecting VAT.\n\nOn its part, FIRS has maintained that the decision of the Federal High Court to grant powers to states to administer VAT could be counterproductive.\n\nThe Group Lead, Special Operations Group, FIRS, Mathew Gbonjubola, insisted that there was nowhere in the world, where the administration of VAT was done at the sub-national level, adding that the service cannot afford to devolve such powers to states.\n\nSpeaking during a media briefing, he said contrary to speculations, the FIRS administers the consumption tax on behalf of the three tiers of government and not for the federal government alone.\n\nHe added that revenue from VAT was administered under an arrangement that allows the federal government to collect 15 per cent, states 50 per cent, and local government 35 per cent. He pointed out that the existing arrangement allowed states and local governments to take about 85 per cent of VAT proceeds.\n\nGbonjubola stated: \u201cThe VAT is not paid to the federation account but to VAT pool account for distribution to the three tiers of government. It is after the sharing that the portion of the federal government is paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund Account.\n\n\u201cVAT works only at a national level but not at a sub-national level. There is no country in the world where VAT works at the sub-national level.\u201d\n\nHe said the VAT Act differentiated between the Input and Output VAT, explaining that in the former, tax is paid to suppliers on the purchase of taxable goods and services, while output VAT is the tax received from customers on the value of taxable goods and services sold or rendered.\n\nGbonjubola further explained that the VAT Act allowed taxpayers to offset their input VAT (Allowable Input VAT) against their output VAT, to the extent that such input VAT only related to such goods that were purchased or imported for resale or form the taxpayers\u2019 stock-in-trade used for the production of new products on which output VAT would be charged.\n\nHe said where the output VAT exceeded the recoverable input VAT; the taxpayer was expected to remit the excess to the FIRS.\n\nIn the instance where the input VAT exceeded the output VAT, he explained that taxpayer would be entitled to a refund of the excess after following the due process as contained in the FIRS Establishment Act.\n\nBut with the decision of some states to go ahead with the implementation of the court judgement, Gbonjubola said such refund might not be possible, because the administration of VAT would be done by different tax authorities in the states.\n\nHis words, \u201cAs to the incidence of VAT, VAT is practiced on an input and output mechanism. What it means is that for a business either importing or buying products, that business will pay VAT either at the port if it is importing or with the manufacturer if it is buying from a local manufacturer.\n\n\u201cAnd when that business pays VAT, it is accounted for that business as an input tax, such that if it begins to sell in any part of Nigeria, and charges VAT from its own customers, it is able to rescue the importers payment either by port if it is an imported item or to the manufacturer if it was obtained from local producers.\n\n\u201cAnd this works only at the national level, VAT can\u2019t work at the sub-national level and there is no country in the world where VAT works at a sub-national level. This is because the VAT depends on the input-output mechanism\n\n\u201cFor instance, if a business person buys an item in Osun State and paid VAT, takes the goods to Sokoto State to sell, remember this business person had paid VAT when purchasing the product in Osun State.\n\n\u201cSo, when selling in Sokoto State, he will be charged VAT and by the operation of the input-output mechanism, this business person will deduct the input VAT payment in Osun state, from the output charged in Sokoto State, and remit any difference to the relevant tax authorities, in this case because there is a single tax authority handling VAT, it is the same authority that will receive the VAT in Osun and Sokoto states.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to work out the input-output mechanism, businesses won\u2019t be short-changed; there is no issue of consumers having to pay VAT more than once.\n\n\u201cHowever, if this is operating at a sub-national level, it will mean that when businesses are paying VAT at the state level, the business would have to pay VAT twice in two different states.\u201d\n\nFIRS Seeks to Move VAT to Exclusive Legislative List\n\nTo stem the agitations by state governments to be the ones to collect VAT, the FIRS had written a letter, dated July 1, to the National Assembly for the sponsorship of a bill to amend the 1999 Constitution and place VAT administration on the Exclusive Legislative List, as well as establish a Federal Revenue Court (FRC) to sit over tax-related disputes.\n\nThe letter was written by its Executive Chairman, Mr. Muhammad Nami, to Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Idris Wase, who also doubles as Chairman, Special Committee on Review of the Constitution.\n\nIn the letter titled, \u201cRequest for Sponsorship of a Bill for the Establishment of the Proposed Federal Revenue Court of Nigeria and the Insertion of Value Added Tax Under Item 68 of the Exclusive Legislative List,\u201d was dated July 1, 2021. The letter was written to the National Assembly while the FIRS was still contesting a suit filed on the collection by Rivers State.\n\nNami had highlighted the increasing pushback by states to collect and retain the VAT proceeds in their respective states.\n\nSpecifically, the FIRS proposed the insertion of VAT immediately after Stamp Duties item 58 Part II, 2nd schedule of the 1999 Constitution, as amended. It expressed concerns that the number of tax cases was increasing annually at both the Federal High Court and the Tax Appeal Tribunal\n\nAs a result, Nami said there was an urgent need to establish FRC to speed up the resolution of the tax disputes.\n\nIn the letter, the FIRS is pointedly proposing an amendment of Section 251 (1)(1b) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, by removing the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court only on anything connected or related to federal tax matters since same would be vested on the proposed FRC.\n\nHe said the exclusive jurisdiction of the proposed FRC shall include adjudication of tax disputes arising or connected to the federal tax laws, including Company Income Tax Act (CITA), Petroleum Profit Tax Act (PPTA), Personal Income Tax Act (PITA), Capital Gains Tax Act (CGTA), STAMP Duty Act (SDA), Value Added Tax Act (VATA) and Taxed and Levies (Approved list for collection) Act as well as other laws, regulations, proclamation, government notices or rules related to these Acts.\n\nIn addition, the FIRS proposed for the insertion of Section 254G to 254L in the 1999 Constitution to provide for the establishment of the FRC, the appointment of Chief Judge for the proposed court, power to make rules for the proceedings of the FRC and the appointment of judges of the court as well as craving for the exclusive jurisdiction of FRC on federal tax matters.\n\nThe service boss said the proposed court would among other things provide both the tax authority and taxpayers a platform for quick resolution of tax disputes and invariably increase tax revenue generation for the federal government.\n\nNami also said though the judges of the Federal High Court that presently handled tax matters were well grounded in the general practice of laws in the country, there was need for tax matters to be handled by individuals with cognate experience in taxation and tax practices for effective adjudication of tax disputes in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cTax disputes are one of the fundamental factors that impede tax revenue generation in Nigeria, hence the need to establish a globally accepted practice of mechanisms for tax dispute resolution in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out, \u201cThe number of tax dispute cases are increasing yearly at both the Federal High Court and the Tax Appeal Tribunal. There is, therefore, an urgent need for the establishment of the Federal Revenue Court to speed up the resolution of these tax disputes.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the success stories of the tax appeal tribunals could be replicated better and more effectively if the FRC was established.\n\nNami stated that there were currently over 156 disputed tax liability cases across the six geopolitical zones, valued at over N379.43 billion, including $3.38 billion and \u20ac800,500.00.\n\nThe service said it intended to take advantage of the on-going constitution amendment exercise to realise its objectives.\n\nRivers Commences Implementation of VAT Law\n\nWike raised the alarm over underhand moves by the federal government to move the appeal it had filed on the VAT matter from the Court of Appeal in Port Harcourt to the appeal court in Abuja, where the government hoped it could mount pressure on the appellate court to win a stay of execution of the judgement.\n\nThe governor, who disclosed this to THISDAY, said he was informed of the development while attending a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) meeting in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nWike stated, \u201cI was told the FIRS is working to move the appeal to Abuja, but I have not confirmed whether it is true or not. But let it be known that I am standing on the principle of justice and constitutionalism. What I feel is that the right thing should be done. Whether they want to hear it in Kafanchan or America, let the law take its course.\n\n\u201cToday, it is my turn, it can be another person\u2019s turn tomorrow. I believe the right thing must be done at the right time. This country must move forward and justice must be done. This is an issue of constitutionalism.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY also learnt yesterday that the governments of Lagos and Ekiti states had concluded plans to file applications to be joined in the on-going legal battle between the FIRS and Rivers.\n\nBut in spite of the controversy the VAT issue has generated, Rivers State, yesterday, said it had commenced full implementation of its VAT Law. Wike made this known yesterday during an interactive session with representatives of corporate organisations in Port Harcourt.\n\nWike said the enforcement would prevent members of the business community from falling prey to the antics that could be deployed by FIRS officials, whom he said could attempt to use force to collect \u201cwhat does not belong to them.\u201d\n\nWike alleged that FIRS had in the past collected VAT in the state with impunity, knowing it was unconstitutional for them to do so. He pointed out that his administration challenged the matter at a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, where it secured a positive judgement on the matter.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cWhen we challenged the federal government, through the Office of the Attorney-General, and FIRS in court, do you know what they did? They wrote a letter dated July 1, 2021. Remember, it was in 2020 that we filed this action against them. But see how corrupt this country is.\n\n\u201cCorruption is not only about kickbacks, it is also about doing something illegally. We were in court in 2020. Then on July 1, 2021, the chairman of FIRS wrote to the National Assembly through the office of the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cHe was asking them to amend the constitution and insert VAT under item 58 of the Exclusive Legislative List, when we were already challenging that it is not their responsibility to collect VAT. They knew that what they were doing was not the right thing.\u201d\n\nHe described as unfortunate the allegation that the FIRS had resorted to writing threat letters to intimidate corporate organisation to pay VAT to the federal agency even after they had lost an appeal that sought a stay-of-execution of the declarative ruling on VAT collection in the state.\n\nWike urged business operators to be ready to pay VAT for the month of September 2021 and subsequent months to the Rivers State Internal Revenue Service. He said he had already assented to the Rivers State VAT law passed by the State House of Assembly.\n\nThe governor warned corporate organisations not to feign ignorance of the state VAT law and declared that the government would not hesitate to seal up the premises of any company that defaulted.\n\n\u201cWe are going to inaugurate the Tax Appeal Commission by Friday, which will be headed by a retired judge of the state,\u201d Wike hinted, calling the disparity in VAT proceeds and what is given to the states as an inexplicable form of injustice that weakened the performance potential of the states.\n\nHe explained, \u201cLet me tell you the injustice in this country. In the month of June 2021, which we shared in July, VAT collected in Rivers State was N15.1billion. What they gave us was N4.7 billion. See the gross injustice, and the money includes contracts awarded by the Rivers State Government.\n\n\u201cThis is not an issue of party, it is the issue of infraction of the constitution, issues of illegality. Look at Lagos, it is not the same party with me. In the month of June 2021, the VAT collected in Lagos was N46.4 billion but see what Lagos got \u2013 N9.3 billion.\n\n\u201cHave you seen the injustice in the country? VAT collected in Kano was N2. 8 billion and they gave them N2. 8billion. Is there justice in this country?\u201d\n\nWike described as morally offensive a situation where Rivers State government would award contracts for state roads worth N200 billion and the FIRS would allegedly receive 7.5 per cent of the amount as VAT to be distributed among the states.\n\n\u201cSo, you allow me to call the big companies, award contracts to them, then you, FIRS, come and collect the tax and then go and distribute it to other states, who are not awarding contracts. How does it sound,\u201d he asked.\n\nThe governor said nobody had been courageous enough to challenge the alleged illegality perpetrated by the FIRS, saying history would be kind to Rivers State to have mustered the courage to speak out and also challenge it.\n\n\u201cI overheard the FIRS chairman saying I\u2019ll soon know the power of the federal government,\u201d Wike stated. He added, \u201cAnd that they\u2019ll show me that they have the power to muzzle the judiciary. You can muzzle them as you want. Let the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court interpret the law so that all of us will go and rest.\n\n\u201cUse all the power you want to use, but history will be written one day and those who will allow themselves to be used to muzzle and misinterpret the law will face God one day.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Stockpile of seized state arms after\n\nattacks sustained 12-year insurgency\n\n\u2022Findings cite corruption, diminished morale for loss of equipment\n\n\u2022We\u2019re winning the war against insurgency, says DHQ\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nA research paper prepared for the European Peace Facility (EPF), a European Union project for peace support operations across the globe, has revealed that terrorist groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP), had launched 500 attacks on military bases and formations of the Multi-national Joint Task Force (MNJTF) between 2015 and 2020.\n\nThe paper presented by a Researcher and Director, S4 Initiative (Safeguarding Security Sector Stockpiles) based in Borex, Switzerland, Mr Eric Berman, titled: \u201cThe Management of Lethal Materiel in Conflict Settings: Existing Challenges and Opportunities for the European Peace Facility\u201d, said lethal weapons including small and light arms seized from the military bases during attacks by terrorists, sustained the 12-year insurgency in Nigeria and the Lake Chad region.\n\nWhile the report cited corruption and diminished morale as being largely responsible for loss of equipment, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) has however said the Armed Forces of Nigeria were winning the war against insurgency in all the theatres of operations, including the North East and the North West regions sof the country.\n\nDefence Spokesman, Maj. Gen. Olufemi Sawyerr, said the fact that thousands of insurgents were surrendering with their families and laying down their arms, was an indication that government was winning the war against insurgency, adding that the act of surrender wasalso a sign of victory for the nation.\n\nBut the research paper claimed that between 2015 and 2020, some 2,368 \u201cuniformed personnel fatalities were recorded\u201d, stressing also that the insurgents launched 500 attacks on MNJTF bases within a six-year period, where no fewer than 2,368 military personnel were killed.\n\nA breakdown of the figure showed that Nigeria recorded 1,952 fatalities while Chad recorded 217; Niger, 132 and Cameroon 67.\n\nFurther, the figures showed that Nigeria lost 134 personnel in 2015, 157 in 2016, 171 in 2017, 425 in 2018, 642 in 2019 and 423 in 2020. The report said Chad recorded loss of one soldier in 2015, four in 2016, nine in 2017, zero in 2018, 34 in 2019 and 169 in 2020.\n\nNiger, however, recorded 14, 2015; 57, 2016; zero, 2017; 19, 2019; 22, 2019 and 20, 2020. Cameroon recorded the death of 36 personnel in 2015, nine, in 2016, one in 2017, zero in 2018, 21 in 2019 and zero in 2020.\n\nYearly totals within the period under review showed that the four troop-contributing member nations \u2013 Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon \u2013 lost 185 personnel in 2015, 227 in 2016, 181, 2017; 444, 2018, 719, 2019 and 612 in 2020.\n\n\u201cOfficial data concerning attacks on security sector personnel is difficult to obtain, but reports suggest that more than 2,000 uniformed security sector personnel have died in the conflict.\n\n\u201cAs alarming as these numbers are, they likely under-estimate the true scale and scope of the losses incurred concerning the security personnel of the four Lake Chad Basin countries.\n\n\u201cA memorial to fallen comrades since 2013 at the headquarters of the Nigerian military\u2019s operations in Northeast Nigeria had in 2018 listed the names of more than 1,300 soldiers inscribed on it,\u201d it said.\n\nAn estimated 600 soldiers lost their lives in attacks by Boko Haram and died within a six month period in 2018 alone,\u201d the report stated, citing research authorities.\n\nMore than 100 Cameroonian soldiers lost their lives in attacks by Boko Haram in 2014 and 2015, even as three separate attacks on police targets in N\u2019Djamena in June 2015, resulted in more than 100 casualties, including dozens of deaths, many of whom were members of the police.\n\nThe report also detailed reasons why weapons are lost to insurgents.\n\n\u201cThe loss of materiel as a direct consequence of these attacks is substantial. A gun truck, fitted with a machine gun will frequently transport several tins of linked cartridges totalling hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Sometimes substantial quantities of weaponry kept at the base as reserves can be taken from military positions the insurgents had themselves attacked.\n\n\u201cWhen a base is overrun, crew-served weaponry such as machine guns, mortars and towed artillery\u201d are carted away, \u201cyet, a lot of that materiel is in good enough condition to be of use to the militants,\u201d it said.\n\nContingent-owned equipment secured through seizure from regional security forces likely dwarfs materiel check points, forward operating bases, \u201cSuper Camps\u201d and sector headquarters,\u201d it said.\n\nThe research paper also cited as reasons for the loss of personnel and materiel, \u201cinsufficient quality and quantity of both lethal and non-lethal materiel for the security sector\u201d and ammunition, as well as \u201ctanks only firing twice, armoured personnel carriers running for 10 to 15 from boots to tanks\u201d, and has compiled a number of soldiers\u2019 grievances about insufficient body armour minutes before overheating, machine guns jamming, and mortar shells failing to detonate.\n\n\u201cThese long-standing issue summarises the scope of the problem in Nigeria, \u201cranging concerns are not based on anecdotal accounts. They are systemic\u201d, it said, citing research authorities, \u201cA similar situation affected Cameroonian security forces\u2019 early efforts against Boko Haram.\u201d\n\nBerman, also citing research works, said, \u201cCorruption goes a long way to explaining why equipment is lacking. It is endemic within Nigerian society to implicitly accuse the military of purposely prolonging the conflict for their own ends and current President Muhammadu Buhari, acknowledged this, pledging to counter it as a central part against entrenched corruption within the military, ranging from extortion at checkpoints of his first presidential campaign in 2015.\n\n\u201cBut the challenge facing the country is enormous and progress has been slow and uneven. Malfeasance within the defence sector is by no means limited to Nigeria. It is a problem throughout much of the world, including elsewhere in the sub-region,\u201d it explained.\n\nThe report also found that the regional response to the \u201cBoko Haram\u201d conflict underscored both the need for EU support\u2014for example through the provision of lethal materiel and training via European Peace Facility (EPF) and the assessment of risks inherent in any kind of engagement.\n\n\u201cThe levels of loss of uniformed personnel and lethal materiel from state stockpiles in the Lake Chad region are astonishingly high. In six years (between 2015 and 2020) several times as many uniformed personnel serving in and alongside the Multinational Joint Task Force were killed due to \u2018malicious acts\u2019 than those, who have served in UN peacekeeping operations over a span of more than 70 years.\n\n\u201cReporting suggests that Boko Haram factions have seized Contingent-owned Equipment (COE) that includes a wide-range of heavy weapon systems. Some of the armoured vehicles and towed artillery lost to Boko Haram originated from EU member states. The quantity of small arms and light weapons\u2014many of which also were manufactured in the EU\u2014is so great that it has sustained the insurgency for over a decade,\u201d Berman said.\n\nThe report, therefore, recommended EU\u2019s further engagement with the African Union (AU) and the ECOWAS in addressing issues raised by the report.\n\nThese notwithstanding, Maj. Gen Sawyerr, the defence spokesman, who was not comfortable with the report, told THISDAY that the Armed Forces of Nigeria were winning the war against insurgency and armed banditry.\n\n\u201cWe are winning the war in the North East and North West and the terrorists are surrendering in large numbers. Why is it that it is now that we are clearly winning the war that such report is coming up to drag us back. We are winning the war and thousands of them are surrendering with their families. What else are we saying?\u201d he queried.\n\nMNJTF\u2019s Director of Public Communication, Col Muhammed Dole, was yet to respond to questions about the report billed for presentation today as at the time of filling this report.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "West Africa\u2019s main political and economic bloc suspended Guinea\u2019s membership on Wednesday following a weekend military coup that ousted President Alpha Conde and dealt the latest in a flurry of setbacks to democracy in the region.\n\nDuring a virtual summit, leaders from the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) demanded a return to the constitutional order and Conde\u2019s immediate release, and also agreed to send a high-level mission to Guinea as soon as Thursday, said Burkina Faso\u2019s Foreign Minister Alpha Barry.\n\n\u201cAt the end of that mission, ECOWAS should be able to re-examine its position,\u201d Barry told reporters.\n\nHe did not announce any immediate economic sanctions against Guinea, as ECOWAS imposed against Mali following a coup there in August 2020.\n\nSome experts say ECOWAS\u2019s leverage with Guinea could be limited, in part because the country is not a member of the West African currency union and not landlocked like Mali.\n\nThe economic bloc\u2019s response is being closely watched amid criticism from pro-democracy advocates that it has not stood up robustly enough in recent months against democratic backsliding in West Africa.\n\nECOWAS remained silent last year as Conde and Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara sought third terms after changing constitutions that would have forced them to step down, moves denounced as illegal by their opponents.\n\nActivists say this has contributed to West Africans\u2019 loss of faith in democracy and made military coups more likely.\n\nMali\u2019s military staged a second coup in May this year. ECOWAS said on Tuesday it was concerned transitional authorities there had not made sufficient progress toward organising elections next February as promised.\n\nPRISONER RELEASES\n\nGuinea\u2019s coup leader, Mamady Doumbouya, a former French legionnaire, has pledged to install a unified, transitional government but has not said when or how that will happen.\n\nIn an apparent gesture to Conde\u2019s civilian opponents, at least 80 political prisoners detained by the president were released on Tuesday evening, many of whom had campaigned against his constitutional change.\n\nDoumbouya also met the heads of Guinea\u2019s various military branches for the first time on Tuesday, hoping to unify the country\u2019s armed forces under the junta\u2019s command.\n\nGuinea\u2019s main opposition leader, Cellou Dalein Diallo, who finished runner-up to Conde in three successive elections, told Reuters on Tuesday he would be open to participating in a transition back to constitutional governance.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, Conde\u2019s party said it \u201cnoted the advent of new authorities at the head of the country\u201d and called for the president\u2019s swift and unconditional release.\n\nSince the putsch, life in the streets of Conakry appears to have returned to normal, with some military checkpoints removed.\n\nFears that the power struggle could hinder Guinea\u2019s production of bauxite, a mineral used to make aluminium, have begun to ease. The country\u2019s largest foreign operators say they have continued to operate without interruption.\n\nAluminium hit a fresh 10-year high on Monday after news broke of unrest in Guinea, which holds the world\u2019s largest bauxite reserves.

          "title": "How Wave became Francophone Africa\u2019s first unicorn startup with \"radically affordable\" money transfers",
          "text": "Within four years, Wave has gone from a spinoff from Asia and Africa-focused cheap remittance company, Sendwave, to a mobile money service provider worth $1.7 billion; the latest unicorn startup in Africa and the first in the French-speaking region.\n\nThe billion-dollar valuation comes after it raised $200 million in a Series A round led by payments giant Stripe; Sequoia Heritage, a private investment fund and unit of Sequoia; Founders Fund; and Ribbit Capital, with participation from other existing investors.\n\nNo other startup operating in Africa has raised as much in a Series A. OPay\u2019s recent $400 million raise is the region\u2019s largest venture round, followed by Interswitch\u2019s $200 million investment from Visa and Flutterwave\u2019s $170 million fundraise. All were Series C rounds.\n\nTaking on incumbents\n\nSenegal is one of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing mobile money markets, according to a 2020 GSMA report.\n\nIn 2015, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), the common central bank of eight French-speaking countries in the region (including Senegal), allowed nonbanks to operate mobile money in its member states. Mobile money adoption has expanded since then, driven by early telecom entrants that had the requisite infrastructure and user base (mobile networks and subscribers) to establish the service.\n\nOrange is Senegal\u2019s largest mobile operator and controls around 50% of the telecom market share with nearly 8 million mobile users, twice as many as runner-up Free, which has 4.4 million subscribers. Expresso Telecom, a unit of the UAE\u2019s Expresso Telecom Group Limited, holds 22% of the market share, with over 3 million subscribers.\n\nAll three telecom firms provide mobile money services under the Orange Money, Free Money, and E-Money brands respectively, and along with banks, dominate the digital financial services space. Other third-party providers like fintech have had to make do with small market shares while competing with incumbents.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut Wave, a product created by two Americans (Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk) to lower the cost of mobile money transactions, piloted in 2016 and officially launched in Senegal a year later, entered the market with a 70% cheaper service.\n\nWave offers free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application and applies a fixed transaction fee of just 1% for money transfers between individuals. Unlike its competitors, Wave passes additional fees on bill payments from users on to businesses. For users without a smartphone, it provides a free QR-card to transact with agents, who are able to open accounts, receive deposits, and execute withdrawals.\n\nAccording to co-founder Drew Durbin, Wave is building a mobile money service that is \u201cradically affordable\u201d. The startup has had to build its own infrastructure, including agent and consumer applications, an agent network, and QR cards in order to provide its super cheap service.\n\nWave\u2019s co-founders, Drew Durbin (left) and Lincoln Quirk.\n\nThe startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nWave\u2019s strategy has managed to shake Orange in particular. To match the ultra-competitive offer that the startup has operated with since May 2020, the telecoms company was forced to lower its prices as well, bringing down bill payment fees to 1% from June 1.\n\nPressure on the network operator also saw it stop users in Senegal from purchasing Orange airtime via Wave\u2019s mobile application, a move that\u2019s been described as anti-competitive by the fintech company and resulted in a dispute currently in the hands of the country\u2019s telecoms regulator.\n\nWave\u2019s branch in Dakar \u2013 which is led by IT veteran Coura S\u00e8ne \u2013 claims to be the largest mobile money player in Senegal with over half of the country\u2019s adults, between four and five million people, making up its several million monthly active users. The Wave app has more than 5 million downloads on Google PlayStore. As reported by TechCrunch, the startup processes billions of dollars in annual volume and has partnerships with UBA and Ecobank for its Senegal operations.\n\nHaving previously raised just $13.8 million since its creation, Wave was able to attract the landmark Series A funding from investors to expand its disruptive business model, which has seen it become one of the most-used mobile money services in Senegal and achieved unicorn status \u2013 startups valued at or above $1 billion \u2013 as a fintech in Africa.\n\nOther African unicorns include fintech startups OPay, Flutterwave, Interswitch, Fawry as well as e-commerce giant Jumia.\n\nWith the fresh investment, Wave plans to deepen its presence in Senegal and Ivory Coast, a country it expanded into recently and is currently running communication campaigns to raise awareness. The startup also intends to grow its 800-man team across product, engineering, and business, as well as expand into other markets it considers regulatory-friendly, like Uganda and Mali.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "With Awabah, Tunji Andrews wants to make pensions as popular as banking",
          "text": "Between November and December 2020, Tunji Andrews co-piloted a project to help informal workers save for the future. Those efforts culminated in the January rollout of Awabah, a digital platform that provides micro pension access to self-employed Nigerians and informal workers.\n\n\u201cMany people in Nigeria and Africa do day-to-day financial transactions in markets but don\u2019t have access to the benefits that the formal financial system offers,\u201d Andrews told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cSo when I wanted to get into the fintech space, it had to be something that would drive financial inclusion on a very strong basis.\u201d\n\nA flexible, \u20a6500 plan\n\nCo-founded with Tina Ajishebiyawo and Gboyega Olatunde, Awabah Nigeria automates micro-pensions and target-savings for self-employed Nigerians and workers in the informal economy. An understanding of the unique characteristics of its target market has been key to Awabah\u2019s operations and ensuring last-mile delivery.\n\nLower-income members of the informal economy can be difficult to capture and most engage in local cooperatives and market associations. Awabah has leaned heavily on town hall meetings to reach these people in large numbers, introducing its product via group presentations and one-on-one sessions.\n\nAfter onboarding them, the company uses either its web platform or a network of local banking agents to continue taking collections from, educating, and further engaging with contributors.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIncome levels vary in the informal sector. Thus, Andrews explains that contributors with as little as \u20a6500 can start a micro-pensions account. Subsequent amounts contributed are based on an individual\u2019s capacity.\n\nContributions are also flexible. Taking into account the irregular cash flow of informal workers, they can be made daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, similar to local savings groups (popularly known as Ajo or Esusu).\n\nDue to the constant need for cash flow in the informal sector, users have the option of withdrawing up to 40% of their savings at any point after the initial 3 months of contributions. Whenever someone deposits \u20a61,000, for instance, \u20a6600 is locked in the retirement account while the rest goes into the customer\u2019s mobile wallet as contingent savings.\n\n\u201cThey always come and ask for their 40% after the first three months as a way of testing the product, and we make sure that they get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cOnce they get their money back and see alerts every time they put in their \u20a6500, they\u2019re able to test the system.\u201d\n\nAwabah has achieved impressive results within months of operation, having onboarded more than 5,000 customers so far. It makes money primarily by earning a commission on every contribution made.\n\nAwabah Nigeria Co-founder, Tunji Andrews.\n\nExtending pensions to the informal economy\n\nIn Nigeria, a good number of elderly parents are financially dependent on their children \u2013 partly because societal norms deem it necessary for children to care for aging parents; and also because there is an evident lack of working systems for retirement savings.\n\nEven where pension schemes are available, they often only cover people who are formally employed. Nigeria has a large informal workforce and about 88% of the entire labour force without pensions is from the informal economy. The result? A large group of citizens becomes financially vulnerable as they get older.\n\nWorse still is that relatively young Nigerians currently dominate the labour force and the lack of retirement savings means they are susceptible to living below the poverty line in their old age.\n\nNigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PenCom) has a target of growing the country\u2019s pension coverage to 30% of the entire labour force \u2013 formal and informal \u2013 by 2024. As of the first quarter of this year, the figure stood at 12%.\n\nA provision in the Pension Reform Act of 2014 ushered in a new micro-pension plan, effectively opening the door for the informal economy to participate in the national Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Awabah\u2019s operation is backed by this provision.\n\nThe micro pension scheme was formally introduced in 2019 but is yet to gain traction. Thus, Andrews has made it his and Awabah\u2019s mission to make the services available to those in the informal sector and whose employers are not legally required to deduct and remit pension.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the new micro pension scheme two years ago, I was excited as I had been thinking about pensions. But there weren\u2019t a lot of conversations and awareness about it. So for me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said.\n\nExpanding Awabah\n\nAwabah is less than a year old and has had to deal with manpower and logistics challenges. Still, Andrews has big ambitions.\n\nGoing forward, the startup plans to leverage the penetration of mobile phones in Nigeria to reach even a wider audience, starting with the planned launch of a USSD option.\n\nThrough a shortcode, existing and potential customers will be able to learn about and sign up to Awabah, as well as get financial literacy lessons in local languages. For those who have smartphones, Awabah will engage them via WhatsApp.\n\nThe Awabah team.\n\nThe startup raised $200,000 from early-stage angel investors ODBA and Co Ventures and Correlation Capital in July, which helped it expand into Ibadan. Awabah also recently gained acceptance into the Techstars London accelerator programme, where it will get some funding.\n\nAndrews reveals that a new fundraising round is in the works, which will help fund a larger expansion. Over the next few months, the startup has plans to enter into five more Nigerian cities. It is also mulling an expansion into Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe bigger goal is to create a larger awareness of micro pensions in Africa,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe want pensions to be popular as banking and insurance are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Awabah has partnerships with three Pension Fund Administrators, including Leadway Pensure, which holds the PenCom license under which it operates; a microfinance bank via which it provides mobile wallets; as well as two agent banking networks.\n\nAndrews aims to expand the list of partner organisations and, in the long term, plans to push conversations with Nigeria\u2019s pensions regulator on the possibility of issuing micro pension licenses for small players like Awabah.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have a one-size-fits-all pension license, unlike Ghana where there\u2019s a three-tier system,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lack of micro pension licenses can be a drawback as we believe we are best positioned to drive the product. But it\u2019s still very early days.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time. Today, we have gone on to get a place of our own, and we\u2019re growing each passing day.\u201d \u2014 Onyekwere, CEO, Queen\u2019s Fruits.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, there are a lot of things that make a business thrive. And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "Businesses suffer over soaring cost, poor services at inland ports",
          "text": "Importers and manufacturers are now counting losses due to the high cost of doing business and poor service delivery at inland dry ports, popularly known as bonded terminals or inland container depots (ICDs).\n\nBuilt for the sole aim of easing or averting congestion at the main port terminals, many bonded terminals in Nigeria have failed to meet up with the purpose of their existence as containers also get trapped in their premises.\n\nConsequently, importers that have their containers transferred to these terminals end up experiencing delays that result in payment of extra cost as demurrage to shipping companies. This is such that an importer could pay as much as N3 million per container to cover transfer charges and demurrage to shipping companies due to the longer dwell time of the container.\n\nBusinessDay understands that Nigeria is yet to leverage the existence of inland ports to deal with the issue of port congestion, as ships still wait for 21 days in the anchorage before having access into the port to berth and discharge cargoes.\n\nRead Also: Cargo movement to river, inland ports, maritime security top agenda for maritime agencies\n\nIbrahim Tanko, national coordinator of the 100 percent Compliance Team of the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), says some bonded terminals in Nigeria do not have sufficient equipment and infrastructure to enable container examination in their premises.\n\n\u201cOur containers are being dropped on flooded grounds for examination, especially when it rains, and we must put on a rain boot to be able to access some of these terminals. This has led to some of the content of these containers being damaged, most especially those in cartons, thereby resulting in loss for the importer,\u201d he explains.\n\nAccording to Tanko, some of these bonded terminals do not have forklifts to drop containers for Customs examination, and in most cases, it takes weeks to drop containers for examination, thereby increasing the demurrages paid by importers to shipping companies.\n\nWhile noting that the Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council (NSC) had mandated bonded terminal owners to put an end to collection of transfer charges, he says importers still pay transfer charges at these terminals.\n\nGiving an insight into the problems associated with doing business at inland ports, Tony Anakebe, a maritime analyst, says it takes time for containers to be assigned from the mother port to inland ports.\n\n\u201cIt also takes time for bonded terminal owners to move containers to their terminals when ships are allocated to them due to challenges with gridlock on the port road. When they finally do, they charge transfer charges to cargoes, which is an extra cost to the importer. And if the barge or truck used in transferring the container encounters a problem on the way, it will take longer and incur extra charges for the importer,\u201d he states.\n\nCiting an example, he says if a container is allocated to Denca Services, it will hire barges or trucks to move the container to its terminal, and this takes weeks or months.\n\nThe delay in moving the containers to the inland ports leads to payment of demurrages by the importer, he states, adding that some of the terminals are mostly located in inaccessible areas due to bad roads.\n\n\u201cBonded terminals still collect transfer charges from importers because the last container my company cleared at Denca in Amuwo-Odofin in Lagos, we paid over N170,000 as transfer charges, which is an added cost to the cost of transporting the container to the importer\u2019s warehouse,\u201d he says.\n\nRecall that in 2020, the NSC under the immediate past leadership abolished the collection of transfer and storage charges by bonded terminal owners to streamline the cost of doing business.\n\nInterestingly, containers transferred to bonded terminals come with bills such as transfer charges to cover the cost of transporting the container from the mother port to the bounded terminal where the owner can carry out Customs\u2019 clearing processes before the container can be taken to the owner\u2019s warehouse.\n\nIn some cases, importers also pay storage charges for containers not lifted directly from the ship but allowed to overstay the rent-free days in the mother port.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Police has announced that its officers of the Intelligence Response Unit have arrested eight suspects who allegedly kidnapped and murdered 92-year-old Dariye Dafwan, father of a former Governor of Plateau State, Joshua Dariye.\n\nIn a statement signed by its spokesperson, Frank Mba, and sent to PREMIUM TIMES, the police said the arrest was made following investigation of the killing of the nonagenarian.\n\nMr Mba, while parading the suspects in presence of some journalists on Wednesday, explained that Mr Dafwan Dariye, whose son was a two-term governor, was held incommunicado for about eight days under unsanitary conditions.\n\nHe said after a protracted negotiation, a ransom of N10 million was paid to the kidnappers and rather than setting him free, he was murdered.\n\nMr Mba said the incident happened in June 2020, adding that the police investigation began immediately after recovery of the victim\u2019s body whose son is currently serving a jail term in Kuje correctional facility over corruption.\n\nThe police spokesperson also noted that most of the kidnappers were indigenes of Bokkos, where Mr Dariye was kidnapped\n\n\u201cThis crime is laced with wickedness. He was kept and treated in a manner that was unbefitting of his status and age,\u201d the police statement said.\n\n\u201cAfter a protracted negotiation, a ransom of 10 million Naira was paid to these kidnappers.\n\n\u201cRather than let the innocent old man go home, the kidnappers, in addition to the trauma they made Pa Dariye to go through, in addition to the extortion of N10 million that they had successfully executed, they went on to murder Pa Dariye in cold blood.\n\n\u201cWithin the last 30 days, the police were able to make tremendous progress that led to the arrest of the eight key suspects that played major roles in the kidnap and murder of the ex-governor\u2019s father.\n\n\u201cAll the suspects, except very few of them, were from the same village in Bokkos Local Government Area with the murdered victim. This perhaps explained why they took the very wicked and costly decision of murdering the old man.\u201d\n\nRead full statement released by the police after parading the suspects:\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nPOLICE ARREST KILLERS OF 93YRS PATRIARCH OF FORMER PLATEAU GOVERNOR, DARIYE\n\n\u00b7 NAB 2 OTHERS FOR VIRTUAL KIDNAPPING, RECOVER 1 AK49 RIFLE, 26 AK47 MAGAZINE\n\nOperatives of the Intelligence Response Unit of the Nigeria Police Force have arrested eight (8) notorious high-profile kidnapping suspects indicted in Police investigations for the abduction and eventual murder of Pa Dariye Dafwan, the late father of former Governor of Plateau State, in Horop community, Bokkos LGA of Plateau State. Pa Dariye was abducted on 17th June, 2020 and shot dead eight (8) days after the criminals (had) collected a ransom of ten (10) million naira from the family of the deceased. The arrest of the suspects follows unrelenting efforts by the Police to ensure perpetrators of the dastardly act are arrested and made to face the wrath of the law.\n\nThe breakthrough that led to the arrest of the suspects began with the arrest of one Abubakar Mohammed a.k.a Buba \u2018m\u2019 23yrs, native of Gada Biyu in Daffo district, Bokkos LGA, Plateau State. Buba is one of the principal suspects in the kidnap operation.\n\nThe confession of the suspect, which revealed how they abducted and murdered the nonagenarian, assisted the Police team in apprehending seven (7) other members of the gang \u2013 Ya\u2019u Saidu aka Ya\u2019u Kaban m\u2019 40yrs, from Kaban Village, Bokkos LGA, Plateau State, Titus Ezekiel 34yrs from from Horop, Bokkos LGA, Dauda Isah \u2018m\u2019 30yrs, from Horop, Sunday Ibrahim m\u2019 35yrs, Mushere tribe from Horop, Mangut Shumwar \u2018m\u2019 30yrs, from Horop, Henry Amos \u2018m\u2019 35yrs native of Horop, and Jethro Ngusen \u2018m\u2019 57yrs, native of Horop.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nInvestigations further revealed that it was Jethro Ngusen, the mastermind and convener of the gang, that instructed one of the gang members, Mangut Shumwar to kill Pa Dariye, because he feared that Pa Dariye might recognize the suspects since majority of them are from the same village with the deceased. Jethro was also identified as the one who took custody of the ransom and later shared the proceeds of the crime amongst the gang members.\n\nSimilarly, the Police team arrested one Sadiq Abubakar \u2018m\u2019 31yrs old from Kogi State and one Peter Moses \u2018m\u2019 25yrs old from Kaduna State who abducted a 22yr-old lady to a location in Suleja. The suspects held the young lady hostage, had repeated canal knowledge of the victim and extorted money from her parents as ransom before her release.\n\nInvestigations by the Police team show that the suspects, who are serial virtual kidnappers, usually meet their victims on social media platforms particularly, Facebook, and thereafter lure them to their criminal hideout before subjecting them to sexual molestation and further obtaining ransom from their families.\n\nThe Police operatives also intercepted three (3) suspects, Emmanuel Joel 42yrs, Ayuba Joel, 30yrs, Hassan Umar, 30yrs on 28th August, 2021, in possession of one AK49 rifle loaded with fourteen live ammunition and twenty-six (26) AK47 magazines, at a border town between Nasarawa and Taraba State.\n\nInvestigations by the Police team revealed that the suspects are criminal arms dealers who supply weapons to criminal elements in Nasarawa and Taraba States. Efforts are being intensified to arrest members of the gang currently at large.\n\nThe Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, psc (+), fdc, NPM has assured that the Force is committed to working with law abiding citizens to secure the nation and reduce crimes to the barest minimum in the country. He advised users of the social media to remain circumspect and protect themselves from cyber crooks masquerading as online friends.\n\nAll the suspects will be charged to court on completion of investigations.\n\nCP FRANK MBA\n\nFORCE PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICER\n\nFORCE HEADQUARTERS\n\nABUJA\n\n8th September, 2021",

Health sector brain drain rising (e.g. about 500 doctors moving to Saudi Arabia).\n\n\u201cPositive GDP growth yet to have a significant impact on socioeconomic conditions.

          "text": "A medical doctor, Morenikeji Oluwaniyi, has been reportedly strangled by a four-man gang in the Abule Egba area of Lagos State.\n\nThe 27-year-old was said to have converted his Toyota Corolla to a Uber ride to raise money for his sustenance.\n\nPUNCH Metro gathered that one of the hoodlums, identified only as Ahmed, requested to be conveyed to Ikeja around 10pm on Sunday.\n\nThe suspect was said to have been joined by three other members of the gang.\n\nAs the vehicle got to the Underbridge area in Abule Egba, the hoodlums reportedly pounced on him and strangled him.\n\nAfter perpetrating the crime, Ahmed and his accomplices were said to have dumped the victim\u2019s corpse on the ground and fled with the car.\n\nOluwaniyi\u2019s girlfriend, Adeola Adesanwo, who was with him when he confirmed Ahmed\u2019s request for the ride, said she became worried when his number was not reachable, adding that she tracked his car to a mechanic\u2019s workshop on Oyadeyi Close, Abule Egba.\n\nShe said, \u201cAfter tracking the car to that location, I noticed that the number plate of the car and the tyres had been removed. I went to report at the Meiran Police Station. Some policemen followed me to the scene and we picked up the mechanic and one of the culprits.\n\n\u201cAt the station, they told us that the trip was a set-up, as they had planned to rob any Uber driver and it was unfortunate that it had to be him. They did not even give him an option; they strangled him from the back seat, pushed him out of the car and drove to the Afrika Shrine to celebrate.\n\n\u201cThey took us to where the crime was committed at the Underbridge in Abule Egba and that was where we found his corpse. They could have asked for the car and he would have dropped it because he was a medical doctor who cherished life.\u201d\n\nAdesanwo explained that the victim was supposed to resume a new job a day after he was killed, adding that his family members had been contacted.\n\nShe said, \u201cOluwaniyi just got a medical job and was supposed to resume at 8am on Monday; he accepted to do the trip so he could have extra cash at hand when he resumes.\n\n\u201cHe left the house around 10.20pm and by 12 midnight, his phone was switched off and he didn\u2019t return home. When he was still not reachable, I called the company he got the car from and they had already implanted a tracker in the car. The company assisted in tracking the car to the address where it was found.\u201d\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, CSP Adekunle Ajisebutu, in a statement on Wednesday, said detectives attached to the Meiran Police Division arrested three suspects in connection with the crime.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe suspects, Rilwan Nasiru, 27; Sodiq Taiwo, 23 and Oladimeji, 20, booked a Uber service online, lured the driver to the Meiran area and strangled him. The suspects, after the dastardly act, dumped his body on the Abule Egba Bridge, along the Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway and made away with his Toyota Corolla saloon car.\n\n\u201cFollowing a report by the victim\u2019s fianc\u00e9e at the police station on September 6, detectives immediately put in motion investigation mechanisms which led to the arrest of the suspects in their criminal hideouts, and recovery of the stolen car.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

The Lagos State House of Assembly has also begun the process of enacting a value-added tax law.\n\nSolomon Kumangar, Director-General, Media and Communications, Adamawa State Government, expressed interest in the project, stating that it will increase the northeastern state\u2019s Internally Generated Revenues (IGR) and lessen its reliance on federal subsidies.\n\nThis is despite the fact that FIRS has already filed an appeal against the verdict.\n\n\u201cAnything to extend and improve on our IGR is welcomed.

          "text": "Following the landmark decision by Justice Stephen Pam of the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt to throw out the stay of execution suit brought before the honourable court by the Federal Internal Revenue Service(FIRS), News Direct can exclusively reveal that plans are being made to move the case file from Port Harcourt to Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nWe are told that there is panic in the seat of power following the order of court that granting the request of the FIRS was akin to committing murder and the fact that Lagos State which is the largest contributor to the Value Added Tax (VAT) pool is already on the verge of passing a new law like Rivers State to start VAT Collection.\n\nNews Direct learnt from very reliable sources that though the FIRS has kept insisting on its legal right to collect the said tax and actually held a press conference today after losing the suit against the Rivers State Government, panic-stricken top functionaries of the federal government are designing plans to frustrate the implementation of the judgment because it will not only lead to serious revenue shortfall but throw FG\u2019s financial projections overboard.\n\nIt will be recalled that on August 9, 2021 the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt had declared that it is the Rivers State Government and not the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), that should collect Valued Added Tax (VAT) and Personal Income Tax (PIT) in the State.\n\nThe court, presided over by Justice Stephen Dalyop Pam, had also issued an order of perpetual injunction restraining the Federal Inland Revenue Service and the Attorney General of the federation, both first and second defendants in the suit, from collecting, demanding, threatening and intimidating residents of Rivers State to pay to FIRS, personnel income tax and Value Added Tax.\n\nJustice Pam made the assertion while delivering judgement in Suit No. FHC/PH/CS/149/2020, filed by the Attorney General for Rivers State (plaintiff), against the Federal Inland Revenue Service (first defendant) and the Attorney General of the Federation (second defendant).\n\nThe Court, which granted all the eleven reliefs sought by the Rivers State Government, stated that there is no constitutional basis for the FIRS to demand for and collect VAT, Withholding Tax, Education Tax and Technology levy in Rivers State or any other State of the Federation, being that the constitutional powers and competence of the Federal Government is limited to taxation of incomes, profits and capital gains which does not include VAT or any other species of sales, or levy other than those specifically mentioned in items 58 and 59 of the Exclusive Legislative List of the Constitution.\n\nThe judge dismissed the preliminary objections filed by the defendants that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the suit and that the case should be transferred to Court of Appeal for interpretation.\n\nJustice Pam, who also dismissed objection raised by the defendants that the National Assembly ought to have been made a party in the suit, declared that the issues of taxes raised by the State government are issues of law that the court is constitutionally empowered to entertain.\n\nHe declared that after a diligent review of the issues raised by both the plaintiff and the defendants, the plaintiff has proven beyond doubt that it is entitled to all the eleven reliefs it sought in the suit.\n\nThe court agreed with the Rivers State Government that it is the State and not FIRS that is constitutionally entitled to impose taxes enforceable or collectable in its territory of the nature of consumption or sales tax, VAT, education and other taxes or levies, other than the taxes and duties specifically reserved for the Federal Government by items 58 and 59 of Part 1 of the Second Schedule of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\nAlso, the court declared that the defendants are not constitutionally entitled to charge or impose levies, charges or rates (under any guise or by whatever name called) on the residents of Rivers State and indeed any state of the federation.\n\nLead counsel for the Rivers State Government, Donald Chika Denwigwe (SAN), who spoke to journalists after the court session, explained that the case is all about the interpretation of the constitution as regards the authority of the government at the State and Federal levels to collect certain revenue particularly, VAT.\n\n\u201cSo, during the determination of the matter, some issues of law were thrown up like, whether or not the case should be referred to the Court of Appeal for the determination of some issues.\n\n\u201cThe court noted that the application is like asking the Federal High Court to transfer the entire case to the Court of Appeal. In which case, if the court so decides there will be nothing left to refer back to the Federal High Court as required by the constitution.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the implication of the judgement, Denwigwe said it is now, unlawful for such taxes as VAT in Rivers State to be collected by any agency of the Federal Government.\n\nFIRS has revealed to journalists today that it has begun the process of appealing the judgment, but from all indications, the agency which is now beginning to fight like a wounded lion is bent on taking unusual steps to continue with what the high court has termed an illegality.",

          "text": "Fulani socio-cultural group, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore has described the anti-opening grazing law as satanic and a unanimous decision of southern governors to destroy pastoralists means of livelihood.\n\nThe organisation said the laws will destroy livestock production and send into poverty millions of people that depend on the livestock value chain Butchers, transporters, livestock dealers and consumers who are used to affordable sources of beef and milk.\n\nMiyetti Allah group disclosed this in Masaka community, Abuja suburb on Monday at a press briefing, jointly delivered by its national president, Alh. Abdullahi Bode and the national secretary, Engr. Saleh Alhassan.\n\nThe briefing was attended by national stakeholders of the group with the theme, \u201cNational Cohesion As a Panacea For Peaceful Coexistence Between Farmers And Herders In Nigeria,\u201d and investiture of HRH Queen Mother, Amina Temitope Ajayi Mama Diaspora, as Miyatti Allah brand ambassador.\n\nAlhassan while speaking on behalf of the organisation, called on the National Assembly and President Muhammad Buhari to intervene and stop current attempt by some states governors to criminalise their means of economic livelihood of cattle rearing through the enactment of satanic and obnoxious laws \u2013 \u2018Anti-open Grazing Laws\u2019 targeted at Fulani Pastoralists.\n\nHe further called for proper funding of the National Commission for Nomadic Education and the expansion of its mandate.\n\n\u201cThis oppressive laws and hostile policies being enacted by state governors are fundamentally going against the Fulani Pastoralist culture, economic interest and constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that inter-state movement of pastoralists is analogous to inter-state commerce, which is an exclusive preserve of the legislative powers of the National Assembly under item 62 of the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\n\u201cTo this effect any action taken by any state Assembly that is in conflict with an above section of the 1999 Constitution as amended is null and void. These laws do not take into cognizance the sociology, economic, production system, climate variations and other push factors that are inherent in pastoralists movements across ecological zones.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that Nigeria\u2019s mode of agricultural practice is still primitive all over the country are not consistent with global best practices, so why singling out the pastoralists who have been suffering from the cumulative years of neglect in terms of development from both federal and state governments,\u201d they added.\n\nIn similar a vein, the organisation called on the governor of Benue state, Samuel Ortom to offer an apology to the Fulani race for what it described as tissues of lies, propaganda profiling of the Fulani pastoralist and falsehood against them.\n\n\u201cOur organisation totally condemn the continuous extortion and profiling of the Fulani pastoralists by the Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state and call on him to offer an apology to the Fulani race.\u201d\n\nThe organisation also called on the National Assembly to resuscitate and pass the Grazing Reserves Commission Bill and other Assembly and livestock management bills that were initiated by the previous National Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur Organisation totally condemn the vituperations of one Emir of Muri in Taraba state for the genocidal propaganda against Fulani Pastoralist and have since taken the necessary legal steps against the misguided local monarch and also written to the Taraba state Governor to immediately dethrone him.\n\n\u201cWe commend the courageous efforts of the federal government under the progressive leadership of President Mohammadu Buhari for listening to our consistent call to restore the existing grazing reserves and routes and create new ones, as it is the only sustainable solution to the farmers /herders conflicts in the country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the security issues in Katsina and other north-west states, the organisation condemned the banned of interstate cattle movement in Katsina by Governor Aminu Bello Masari, describing him as a confused and unserious governor.\n\nThe body attributed the security challenge in Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and other northern states to failure of governance.\n\n\u201cGovernor Masari is confused and unserious. Most of the herders are from Katsina and the governor should have created ranches for herders to serve as a good example for other state governors to emulate instead of playing to the gallery by ban interstate movement of castles\n\nWhat is happening in Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and other northern states is the failure of governance because the governments failed to provide education for teeming youths, leading them to the bandit.\u201d",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nChairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig. Gen. Mohammed Buba Marwa on Wednesday said N6 billion worth of drugs meant for insurgents were intercepted by the agency.\n\nMarwa, who spoke at a media briefing to update the public on the seizure, said loads of Captagon, a brand of Amphetamine were intercepted by operatives of the agency at the Apapa Port in Lagos State.\n\nAccording to him, sometime in March 2021, the agency received intelligence from its international partners on the shipment of illicit narcotics to Nigeria from the Middle East through the Apapa Port.\n\nThe container passed through three countries and was trans-loaded in a North African country, but the NDLEA kept track of it along with its partners, he explained.\n\nREAD ALSO: NYSC Member Nabbed As NDLEA Intercepts Drugged Candies From UK\n\n\u201cWe made the first attempt to examine the container on Thursday, August 26, 2021, and what we found inside the container were three (3) pieces of marble polishing machines, otherwise called sanders,\u201d he said while narrating how the seizure was made.\n\n\u201cFurther scrutiny on Monday, August 31, with the NDLEA sniffer dogs turned up a positive indication on the rotor coil of one of the three machines. The next day, Wednesday, 1st September, 18,560 tablets of a drug suspected to be Amphetamine (Captagon) weighing 3.2kg was found deeply concealed in one of the coils.\n\n\u201cThe following day, Thursday, September 2, the other two machines were dismantled, and in all, a total of 451, 807 tablets, weighing 74.119 kilograms, were discovered hidden inside their rotor coils.\n\n\u201cGoing by the street value of about $25 per tablet, the importer would have raised $11.3million, which is equivalent to N6 billion.\n\n\u201cImagine the impact of this drug in the hands of criminal gangs or a fraction of the profit from its sale being used to fuel criminalities across the country, we can think of our worst-case scenarios and they will still be farther from the repercussions that could be unleashed on the country.\n\n\u201cIt may interest you to know that, as far as we know, this is the first time this drug is being brought into any African country South of the Sahara. This tiny, highly addictive pill, widely available across the Middle East, produces a euphoric intensity in users, allowing them to stay awake for days, making them fearless, predisposes them to reckless action that puts the lives of people around them in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cWhat should give any discerning Nigerian a nightmare concerning this drug is the fact that its production and sale is controlled by militias and large criminal groups in the Middle East. And beyond any doubt, Captagon has been linked to the escalation of the Syrian Civil War.\n\n\u201cA lot of seizures have been made since 2017, mostly in the Arabian Peninsula, and in Italy and Turkey, and the point of origination, almost all the time, were traced back to Syria and Lebanon. This gave rise to the theory that ISIS is behind the production and sale of Captagon as a means of generating funds for weapons and combatants, and for use as a stimulant to keep them fighting.\n\n\u201cLest we forget, Captagon was the name of the drug found on the phone of the French-Tunisian terrorist who killed 84 civilians in France on Bastille Day in 2016. That is the drug we have on our hands now. If these facts are not grim enough, we should all remember a lesson from history, when in World War Two, Nazi Germany wreaked havoc across Europe with chemically-enhanced soldiers that the combined forces of Europe could not tame.\n\n\u201cThis is the same condition we have presently with insurgents, bandits, cultists, robbers, kidnappers and herders spilling rampaging across the country.\n\n\u201cGiven the dark and dangerous background of Captagon, it is not difficult to guess correctly that the destination for the seized drug is none other than the camps of insurgents and bandits all over the country.\u201d\n\nMarwa condemned the intent of those behind the importation of the illicit substance into the country at a very critical time when the nation is facing some security challenges.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer of the NDLEA vowed that the agency would not rest until everyone connected to the consignment was arrested and prosecuted.\n\nMr Marwa assured Nigerians that the agency would continue to work with support from local and international partners to block availability and access to illicit substances across the country.\n\nHe added that the NDLEA\u2019s zero tolerance for production, trafficking and abuse of any illicit substance shows that the agency\u2019s approach to this discovery was not casual.",

          "text": "The Federal Government has approved the National Policy on the fifth-generation (5G) network in Nigeria.\n\nThis is according to the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, who addressed journalists in Abuja after the weekly Federal Executive Council meeting on Wednesday.\n\nHe explained that the benefits that accrue from using the 5G network include larger capacity, higher data rates, among others.\n\n\u201cMine is a memo which I presented before the Federal Executive Council, which has also been approved after deliberation. That is the National Policy on Fifth Generation Networks for Nigeria\u2019s digital economy, the national policy on 5G,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat policy has been approved by the Federal Executive Council today. Furthermore, the policy discusses the benefits to be attained through the deployment of 5G in Nigeria and in any part of the world which includes lower latency, larger capacity, and higher data rate.\n\n\u201cThese are the three major benefits of the fifth-generation (network). In a simple language, we can say it will open many opportunities economically, academically, educationally and even in the health sector. It will also support our security institutions, particularly in areas where they need high-quality services.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Minister, the radiation from the 5G has proven to be lower than the 4G, televisions or microwaves, contrary to stories peddled on social media.\n\nREAD ALSO: Igboho\u2019s Aides Sue DSS, Seek N100m As Compensation\n\nThere have been concerns about the deployment of the 5G communications network, especially over its purported linkage with the COVID-19 outbreak. The claims have been repeatedly denied by authorities.\n\nOn May 19, the Senate asked the Federal Government to suspend plans to deploy the 5G network pending a six-month investigation into possible health risks associated with the technology.\n\nIn telecommunications, 5G is the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, which cellular phone companies began deploying worldwide in 2019, and is the planned successor to the 4G networks which provide connectivity to most current cellphones.\n\nAway from the 5G network, the Minister also reacted to the security situation in the North-West.\n\nHe clarified that telecommunications shut down in Zamfara State did emanate from him but was at the request of security institutions to enhance strategies.\n\nAccording to Pantami, the government is willing to take any action including compromising economic benefits to render full support towards the security of the country.\n\nAlthough he declined to disclose if the same measure would extend to other states affected by banditry, he pleaded for greater support towards the security agencies to allow them to deliver on their mandate.\n\nMobile telephone networks were shut down in Zamfara State on Monday after authorities ordered a telecoms blackout to aid the armed forces in tackling banditry in the area.",

          "text": "As a nurse at one of Kabul\u2019s main hospitals, Latifa Alizada was the breadwinner for her family, providing for her three young boys and unemployed husband.\n\nNow \u2014 since the Taliban rolled into Afghanistan\u2019s capital \u2014 she too is jobless, and worried about the future.\n\nThe 27-year-old left her role at Jamhuriat Hospital because the hardline Islamist group said salaries would not be paid, and imposed rules that would force her to wear a face veil and be segregated from male colleagues.\n\n\u201cI have left my job because there is no salary. There is no salary at all,\u201d she said, holding the hands of two of her boys who chewed on sweetcorn cobs.\n\n\u201cIf I go there, they say \u2018do not work with this style of dress. Do not work with men. Work with women\u2019. This is impossible,\u201d she told AFP at a street market in Kabul.\n\n\u201cFor us, there is no difference between men and women, because we are medical workers.\u201d\n\nAfghans like Alizada worry about what lies ahead under the Taliban.\n\nFood prices have gone up at markets, the cost of fuel has risen and there are fewer opportunities to make money.\n\nThe United Nations this week warned prices for essential goods were soaring in Afghanistan, adding: \u201cThere are fears of food shortages, higher inflation, and a slump in the currency all resulting in an intensification of the humanitarian emergency across the country.\u201d\n\nMany government services are no longer functioning, while the international community \u2014 which has long propped up the aid-dependent economy \u2014 hesitates over funding Afghanistan.\n\nREAD ALSO: [Exhausted And Abandoned] Why Afghanistan\u2019s Army Collapsed\n\nCash in short supply\n\nIn some sectors that are operating, the Taliban have offered wildly different salaries.\n\nA former customs official, who did not want to be named for security reasons, told AFP he had worked at the Spin Boldak border crossing with Pakistan for more than seven years.\n\nUnder the previous government he earned about $240 per month, but the Taliban said they would pay him just $110.\n\n\u201cIt is up to you if you want to continue your job, or quit,\u201d the Taliban told him.\n\nThe official said he resigned after weighing up his salary against the cost of the long commute to work.\n\nThe sight of big crowds queueing to get into banks to access cash is now commonplace across Afghanistan.\n\nThe country\u2019s central bank only has access to a fraction of its usual financing, cut off from the international banking system and access to the country\u2019s foreign currency reserves.\n\nIt means cash is in short supply and the Taliban are enforcing a withdrawal limit of $200 per person each week.\n\nIn the capital on Wednesday about 150 men jostled in the midday sun outside a branch of Kabul Bank, where government employees under the last administration held accounts.\n\nAn armed security guard clutched an electric cable to use as a whip in case the crowd grew too boisterous as they queued for one of the two ATMs.\n\nAbdullah told AFP he travelled overnight from the northeastern province of Takhar, which borders Tajikistan, to get to the branch at the crack of dawn \u2014 and he was still at the back of the queue at noon.\n\nWorried about the future\n\n\u201cThe problem is that after the collapse of the government, all the banks were closed,\u201d the 31-year-old former army commando said.\n\nHe told AFP that some soldiers like him could not access their salaries in the months leading up to the Taliban takeover in mid-August.\n\n\u201cI was at my post for three or four months. My salary was in the bank and I couldn\u2019t get it,\u201d he said.\n\nOther members of the security forces complained of not getting paid at all in the months leading up to the Taliban takeover.\n\nA kitchenware shopkeeper in the capital, who did not want to give his name for security reasons, told AFP had no customers.\n\n\u201cSince the changes, all business has stopped,\u201d he said, sitting on a stool in front of his empty store.\n\n\u201cWe are facing lots of problems. People are staying in their homes because there are no jobs. There is no-one to buy from us.\u201d\n\nWith high rents and next-to-no income, he worried about looking after his family of five.\n\n\u201cWe cannot find the money to feed ourselves. People are concerned about how to find their meals, morning and night. Everyone is worried about their future.\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Morocco\u2019s long-ruling party has suffered a crushing defeat to liberal rivals in parliamentary elections, according to provisional results announced by the interior minister.\n\nThe Justice and Development Party (PJD) saw its support collapse from 125 seats to just 12, far behind its main liberal opponents, the National Rally of Independents (NRI) and the Authenticity and Modernity Party (PAM), and the centre-right Istiqlal Party (PI). The results were announced early on Thursday.\n\nAt the NRI headquarters, celebrations erupted when it was announced by election officials that the party won at least 97 seats, so far the highest among the parties that contested the polls.\n\nPAM ranked second with 82 seats closely followed by PI with 78.\n\nTurnout in Wednesday\u2019s parliamentary election was just over 50 percent, higher than in 2016.\n\nNew voting rules were expected to make it harder for bigger parties to win as many seats as before, something analysts said could cost the moderate PJD, which has been the biggest party in the past two parliaments.\n\nMorocco is officially a constitutional monarchy but the king holds sweeping powers. He picks the prime minister from the party that wins the most seats in the 395-member parliament and appoints key ministers.\n\nThe palace also sets the economic agenda for the North African country of 37 million people and has commissioned a development model that the new government is being asked to implement.\n\nThe monarchy\u2019s dominant role means political parties espouse similar platforms focusing on education, health, employment, and social welfare.\n\n\u201cWhy should I vote? I do not expect voting to improve my situation because politicians care only about themselves,\u201d said a worker at a hotel in Rabat who said his name was Khalid.\n\n\u201cI voted for a young man from a party that offers realistic promises to develop this country,\u201d a pensioner, who gave his name as Ibrahim, said as he was leaving a polling station in Rabat.\n\nDespite having been the largest party since 2011, the PJD has failed to stop laws it opposes, including one to bolster the French language in education and another to allow cannabis for medical use.\n\nThe new voting rules, seen by PJD leaders as having been introduced specifically to target their majority share, change the way seats are allocated.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the PJD accused rivals of electoral violations including buying votes, without providing any details.",

          "text": "West Africa\u2019s main regional bloc has suspended Guinea\u2019s membership, days after a military coup that removed President Alpha Conde.\n\nDuring an extraordinary virtual summit on Wednesday, leaders from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) demanded a return to the constitutional order and the immediate release of Conde, who was arrested by special forces led by Lieutenant Colonel Mamady Doumbouya on Sunday.\n\nThe ECOWAS leaders also agreed to send a high-level mission to Guinea as soon as Thursday.\n\n\u201cAt the end of that mission, ECOWAS should be able to re-examine its position,\u201d Alpha Barry, Burkina Faso\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters in Ouagadougou after the meeting.\n\nThe bloc\u2019s decision comes after the coup sparked broad diplomatic condemnation, but was also met jubilation in some parts of the capital, Conakry, where residents turned out on the streets to applaud passing soldiers.\n\nThis week, a team of special forces arrested Guinea\u2019s President Conde and seized power in a coup.\n\nThe 83-year-old became the first democratically elected president in 2010 and was re-elected in 2015. But last year, Conde pushed through a constitutional change to allow himself to run for a third term, a move his opponents said was illegal. Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara also won a third term last year after changing his country\u2019s constitution.\n\nECOWAS was criticised at the time by activists for remaining silent about Conde and Ouattara\u2019s third-term bids.\n\nElsewhere in the region, Mali\u2019s military staged coups in August 2020 and then again in May this year. ECOWAS condemned the coups and temporarily imposed sanctions. It said on Tuesday it was concerned that Mali\u2019s transitional government had not made sufficient progress towards organising elections next February as promised.\n\nReporting from Conakry, Al Jazeera\u2019s Ahmed Idris said ECOWAS\u2019s decision to suspend Guinea was \u201ca protocol we have seen over and over again\u201d.\n\n\u201cSteps taken by ECOWAS, whenever there is an unconstitutional change in government \u2026 while the fear is such that unconstitutional change of government in West Africa could be a norm unless they take strategic steps and stern measures against people who organise coups to unconstitutionally unseat a democratically elected president in the region,\u201d he added.\n\nDoumbouya, Guinea\u2019s coup leader, has pledged to install a unified, transitional government but has not said when or how that will happen.\n\nIn an apparent gesture to Conde\u2019s civilian opponents, at least 80 political prisoners were released on Tuesday evening, many of whom had campaigned against the constitutional change.\n\nDoumbouya also met the heads of Guinea\u2019s various military branches for the first time on Tuesday, hoping to unify the country\u2019s armed forces under the coup makers\u2019 command.\n\nGuinea\u2019s main opposition leader, Cellou Dalein Diallo, who finished runner-up to Conde in three successive elections, told the Reuters news agency on Tuesday that he would be open to participating in a transition back to constitutional governance.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, Conde\u2019s party said it \u201cnoted the advent of new authorities at the head of the country\u201d and called for the president\u2019s swift and unconditional release.\n\nSince the coup, life in the streets of Conakry appears to have returned to normal, with some military checkpoints removed.\n\nFears that the power struggle could hinder Guinea\u2019s production of bauxite, a mineral used to make aluminium, have begun to ease. The country\u2019s largest foreign operators continued to operate without disruption on Tuesday.\n\nAluminium hit a fresh 10-year high on Monday after news broke of unrest in Guinea, which holds the world\u2019s largest bauxite reserves. Doumbouya has pledged that mining will continue unhindered.\n\nDoumbouya, hours after taking power, appeared on television and accused the government of \u201cendemic corruption\u201d and of \u201ctrampling on citizens\u2019 rights\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are no longer going to entrust politics to one man, we are going to entrust politics to the people,\u201d Doumbouya told public television on Sunday, with the national flag draped over his fatigues.\n\nAnalyst Paul Melly, from the Chatham House, said there are big challenges ahead for the new military rulers.\n\n\u201c[Doumbouya] is clearly saying all the rights thing now about a transition, about an inclusive political approach, reminding people of the need for the reforms, all the governance failures of the past,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cBut the real test is going to lie really in a couple of phases over the next few weeks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, in his internal discussions, he has got to secure the acquiescence of a broad \u2026 political class and civil society in this transition. And although a lot of people are expressing relief \u2026 that\u2019s not quite the same thing as signing up for all the details of the new transition.\n\n\u201cAnd the next stage will be a difficult negotiation with ECOWAS, which really has a pretty firm constitutional law that soldiers cannot take long term power by force.\u201d\n\nAl Jazeera",

          "text": "Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, on Wednesday, warned that the food crisis being experienced in the country could worsen if urgent and resilient steps were not taken to address the situation. Emefiele made the assertion while presenting a keynote address at the 2021 CBN Executive Seminar in Uyo.\n\nThe CBN governor expressed worry over severe disruptions to the agricultural value chain due to security challenges in the country and the COVID-19 health crisis.\n\nEmefiele, who was represented by CBN\u2019s Deputy Governor, Economic Policy, Dr Kingsley Obiora, recalled that the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) had reported that at least 9.2 million people in Nigeria faced food crisis between March and May 2021.\n\nThe CBN governor said the fact that the United Nations projected Nigeria\u2019s population to be 398 million by 2050 challenged Nigeria\u2019s common will to implement strategies targeted at achieving food security.\n\nHe said the theme of the seminar, \u201cFood Security in Nigeria: Options for Policy,\u201d was apt now that security issues, climate change, and COVID-19 related disruptions were challenging food production and supply, not only in Nigeria but also in the global economy.\n\nEmefiele stated, \u201cI note with concern the severe disruptions to the agricultural value chain caused by the security challenges in the country and the COVID-19 health crisis, as households continue to grapple with the production, processing, and distribution of food with undesirable effects on livelihoods.\n\n\u201cTo amplify this concern, the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organisation has reported that at least 9.2 million people in Nigeria faced a food crisis between March and May 2021.\n\n\u201cDue to insecurity and the effects of COVID-19 health crisis, as well as climate change, the figure could increase further if no urgent and resilient actions were implemented.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, a glimpse into the future would reveal an imminent food crisis.\n\n\u201cThe United Nations has projected Nigeria\u2019s population to be around 398 million people by 2050, far exceeding that of the United States of America. This number challenges our common will to implement strategies targeted at achieving food security and safety, as failure to do so could subject the population to the risks of hunger and diseases.\u201d\n\nHe tasked the participants to painstakingly discuss the issues around the theme of the seminar with a view to articulating innovative and workable solutions that would lead to improved productivity and increased food supply for the nation.\n\nEmefiele said the CBN on his watch had engaged in several development initiatives aimed at increasing food production, creating job opportunities, and diversifying the economy, including the release of N987.825 billion under its N 1 trillion Real Sector Facility to 262 real sector projects on agriculture, manufacturing, mining and services sectors.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe CBN has disbursed over N802.920 billion to 3,038,899 (three million, thirty-eight thousand, eight hundred and ninety-nine) farmers cultivating more than 4.7 million hectares of land across the 36 states and FCT under the Anchors Borrowers Programme (ABP).\n\n\u201cThe programme has helped the participating farmers to improve their yields, especially maize, from initial 1.5-2.0 metric tons per hectare, to an average of 5.0 metric tons per hectare, while that of rice improved to 4.0 metric tons per hectare, from 1.5-2.0 metric tons.\n\n\u201cUnder the scheme the Bank has disbursed N134.568 billion to about 38,140 beneficiaries. Under the Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme, the Bank has disbursed more than N708.388 billion to finance about 652 projects since inception.\n\n\u201cUnder the Targeted Credit Facility (TCF), more than N343.206 billion has been disbursed to 726,198 beneficiaries. The scheme was established in 2020, as a stimulus package to support households and businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic across the country.\u201d\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, while declaring the seminar open, praised the CBN administration for selecting the state to host the forum.\n\nRepresented by his deputy, Mr Moses Ekpo, Emmanuel stated, \u201cI love the theme of this seminar. One of the defining elements of the social contract, apart from physical security and shelter, is food security.\n\n\u201cIn the past six years, a recurring decimal of most of my speeches has been the need for responsible governments not to shirk or negate this all-important social responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources, Dr Glory Edet, urged the apex bank to liaise with the agriculture ministries in the states on its loan schemes to farmers so that the real farmers could access such facilities.\n\nEdet said, \u201cI wish to appreciate the developmental initiatives of the CBN, particularly, the interventions in the agricultural sector.\n\n\u201cHowever, I wish to suggest that CBN, in giving loans to farmers\u2019 groups, associations and cooperatives, should always inform ministry in charge of agriculture in every state on information about the real farmers.\u201d\n\nOkon Bassey in Uyo",
