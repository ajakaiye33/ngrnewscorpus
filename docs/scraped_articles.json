It is very pathetic and unbearable,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe governor expressed his condolence to the wife, children, family, the university community and the Nigeria Union of Journalists.\n\nAkeredolu said he had directed security agencies to ensure the perpetrators of the crime were apprehended and brought to book.\n\nAlso, the All Progressives Congress has described Afuye\u2019s killing as shocking, adding that it smacks of callousness.\n\nIn a statement on Friday by its Publicity Secretary in the state, Mr Alex Kalejaye, the party said, \u201cOndo State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress laments the demented and heartbreaking operation.\u201d\n\nKalejaye described Afuye as a clear and penetrating voice that was always captivating and attention-catching.\n\nAccording to him, the deceased is unarguably one of the best around, amiable and courageous, even till his untimely end.\n\nThe publicity secretary urged security agents in the state to leave no stone unturned in bringing those behind the dastardly act to book.\n\n\u201cWithout contention, the APC-led government places an unequalled premium on the security of lives and property.\n\n\u201cThis singular event will further ginger the government to spread its security tentacles even deeper.\n\n\u201cThe party urges security agencies to swing into action and track down the mindless killers of Afuye and others, so they could face the wrath of the law,\u201d Kalejaye said.\n\nThe party commiserated with the Nigerian Union of Journalists, particularly the state branch, and the immediate families of the deceased; and prayed God to grant the departed eternal rest.\n\nSeven days of mourning has been declared by the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Ondo State Council, to honour their departed colleague, Afuye.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by the NUJ State Chairman, Mr Adetona Aderoboye, and Mr Leke Adegbite-Adedoyin, the State Secretary in Akure.\n\n\u201cHis untimely killing by dare-devil armed robbers at Ilara-Mokin is the highest level of callousness, wickedness and unforgivable act of cutting short the life of one of our Brightest, Cerebral and Versatile colleagues.\n\n\u201cIt is indeed a case of \u2018Sunset at Noon\u2019 in Ondo State journalism fraternity,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement further said that the NUJ would miss his huge contributions to Ondo NUJ and unionism in the state as he anchored the 2020 December\u2019s Press Week and Workers\u2019 Day celebrations free of charge.\n\nIt said that many of its members have also benefitted from his media expertise.\n\n\u201cWe register our sincere and heartfelt condolences to the wife, children, family, Media Professionals (especially ORANGE FM/OSRC), friends and Elizade University, Ilara-Mokin, where Bunmi was recently appointed as the Public Relations Officer, over this irreparable loss.\n\n\u201cWe equally condole families and colleagues of the policeman and motorcyclist killed in the bank robbery.\n\n\u201cWhile declaring Seven Days of Mourning, the Ondo NUJ demands that security operatives should do everything humanly possible to bring the perpetrators of the heinous act to justice within the shortest time,\u201d it said.

But it\u2019s now looking more of an attack on every prophet.\n\n\u201cIn this post titled \u2018The Prophets See Nothing\u2019, he spoke about \u2018failed\u2019 prophecies of Primate Ayodele, his prophecy about Nigeria breaking before 2040 and boasted that nothing will happen. He blamed the man of God for giving negative prophecies.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious they don\u2019t listen to men of God who speak the truth but prefer pastors who say \u2018All Is Well\u2019 when clearly, nothing is well. They have engaged in buying prophets over to the extent of keeping them shut.\n\n\u201cSome who were very vocal in speaking to power don\u2019t do that anymore due to this deliberate action of force or by contracts. Thank goodness some prophets have singled themselves out \u2013 Joshua Iginla, Apostle Okikijesu, Prophet Fufeyin, Prophet, Odumeje, Primate Elijah Ayodele, Rev. Fr. Mbaka.\n\n\u201cPrimate Elijah Ayodele has given prophecies that have come to pass. He prophesied the death of Abba Kyari, Isa Funtua, Aso rock crisis, death of Abubakar Shekau, Nigerian economy situation, COVID-19 in the presidential villa, to mention a few.\n\n\u201cFemi Adesina\u2019s post is just an attempt to downplay the prophetic ministry of Primate Ayodele. The Nigerian government is fast becoming the King of Judah in the old testament that locked up Prophet Jeremiah for prophesying.\n\n\u201cWe will leave Femi Adesina with a bible verse from King Solomon. Proverbs 29:18 says \u201cWhere there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint, but blessed is he who keeps the law\u201d, the statement added.",

          "text": "By Gabriel Dike and Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nNo fewer than 34 students of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Akoka, have tested positive for the Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease.\n\nA source at the school said five staff have also been confirmed to have the disease.\n\nA senior management staff said the initial figure was 15 staff.\n\nAccording to the source, after the medical centre drew attention of the university management to the third wave, another 19 students and two workers were infected.\n\nThe source told Daily Sun that the university\u2019s management through the medical centre is investigating whether the disease was brought into the campus by a staff or student.\n\nManagement of the school have begun contact tracing of staff and students who came in contact with those infected.\n\n\u201cInitial case was discovered on students who showed signs of flu-like symptoms. Later, some staff showed same symptoms. Following these symptoms by staff and students, the medical centre alerted the management and thorough analysis were carried out and the results came out positive. From there the figures rose to more students and staff infected.\n\nThe school authorities have extended by 24 hours directive to students to evacuate their halls of residence. The Senate had on Wednesday asked students to evacuate their hostels by 12 noon yesterday.\n\nA statement by the Dean, Students Affairs, said the decision to extend the deadline was to ease the burden of transportation which some students faced on Wednesday while leaving for home.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has reported the loss of a life in the cause of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nThe agency ascribed the death to wrong drug combination saying the vaccinee did not disclose his health condition to health workers that administered the vaccine.\n\nThis camd as the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH), announced the death of Dr. Odii Stanley, senior registrar in the Department of Anaesthesiology, from COVID-19 complications.\n\nNAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, at a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, who announced the passage of a patient after taking COVID-19 jab, said the agency had approved three new COVID-19 vaccines for use in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe case was that the vaccinee had dental problem and was on diclofenac medication. Diclofenac is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, that could cause blood clotting when combined with COVID-19 vaccine. Unfortunately, the person passed away after taking the vaccine.\u201d\n\nShe demanded that there should be a brief dialogue between a potential vaccinee and health worker before COVID-19 vaccines are administered.\n\n\u201cThe essence of the brief dialogue is to find out the health status of the person taking the vaccine, to know if he or she is on a particular drug that could work contrary to the content of the vaccine. If it shows red flag, then the person is advised to temporarily drop the plan. We have discovered that some people who may have COVID-19 or recently treated the disease need to wait for one month or more before they take can the vaccine.\u201d\n\nShe dismissed the fear that AstraZeneca vaccine is harmful to the body even as she encouraged Nigerians to submit themselves to the vaccination as a strong measure against Coronavirus, insisting that its benefit outweigh the risk.\n\nThe NAFDAC boss said the new approved vaccines are two from Korean \u2013 AstraZeneca Korea and Moderna vaccines, and one Russian, Sputnik vaccine, which was granted conditional approval by NAFDAC vaccine committee.\n\nAdeyeye said the approval was granted after a thorough review of the vaccines and the confirmation that they are safe for use and that the benefits outweighs its risk. The new additions join the recently approved Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine which was okayed earlier this year by the regulatory agency.\n\nShe confirmed that NAFDAC vaccine committee carefully reviewed the vaccines despite the fact they were approved by stringent regulatory conditions and had received World Health Organisation (WHO) Emergency Use Listing (EUL).\n\nAdeyeye confirmed that a COVID-19 vaccine that had gone through approval from either of these two sources, had undoubtedly, gone through quality, safety and efficacy evaluation which is a pre-requisite for acceptance by COVAX Facility.\n\n\u201cMost regulatory agencies across the world use the mechanism to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines. Besides, NAFDAC spent at least 15 days to thoroughly examine the dossier or submission package of the vaccines to ensure that the benefits far outweigh the risks and any side effects are well noted for monitoring after vaccination by respective NAFDAC and Primary Health Officers.\u201d\n\nShe said about four million people have received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines across the country, but through the Med Safety App, the country had recorded over 4,500 adverse effects following immunisation.\n\n\u201cWe are still compiling the cases because some people could not use the digital tool. Some reported theirs on yellow paper. But in total, the reported adverse case reaction are not up to 10, 000, out of the four million immunisation given. Undoubtedly, there are serious adverse events following immunisation. But we have less than five per cent of such cases. It\u2019s always advised that vaccinees stay around the area of the vaccination for 45 minutes so he or she can be monitored.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "*How senators voted\n\n*Commotion forces House to adjourn decision till today\n\n*New law may be unconstitutional\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Alex Enumah, Adedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu, John Shiklam in Kaduna and Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nDespite the independence conferred on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) by the 1999 Constitution (as amended), on the conduct of elections, the Senate yesterday passed the\n\nElectoral Act Amendment Bill, which requires the commission to seek clearance from the Nigerian National Communication Commission (NCC) and the National Assembly before deploying electronic transmission of election results in any area.\n\nBy the decision, the National Assembly, statutorily designed as a law-making organ of government, seeks to assume powers to approve a decision exclusively within the purview of the executive arm of government.\n\nThe senators, with marching orders from their party, All Progressives Congress (APC), buckled and deployed their majority in the Senate to weaken the quest for electronic transmission of poll results in the 2023 election cycle\n\nSenators from the ruling party, with two opposition lawmakers who broke ranks with their party, at the consideration of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, voted 52 to 28 to amend clause 52 of the bill that would have empowered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to transmit election results electronically during the 2023 general election.\n\nTwenty eight other senators were absent to cast their votes. But THISDAY gathered that many of them were in the chambers before voting begun.\n\nThe senators\u2019 tactical rejection of electronic transmission of election results drew flaks yesterday from a Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal; the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); the Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere; the pan-Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, and some senior lawyers.\n\nBut the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) endorsed the senators\u2019 action.\n\nIf the House of Representatives concurs with the Senate in passing the clause, INEC would require the permission of the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) and the National Assembly before it could transmit election results electronically.\n\nThe House couldn\u2019t conclude the legislative process of passing the bill yesterday due to commotion over allegation that the presiding officer, House Deputy Speaker, Hon. Ahmed Wase, was trying to rig the voice votes in favour of opponents of electronic transmission of results.\n\nYesterday\u2019s proceedings at the Senate confirmed THISDAY\u2019s exclusive report on Monday of plot by APC senators to delegitimise future elections and undermine the nation\u2019s democracy with their insistence on prohibiting electronic transmission of results.\n\nSources told THISDAY last night that while some of them were ready to shift ground on Wednesday to vote for electronic transmission of election results yesterday, they had to fall in line when the party ordered them to water down clause 52.\n\nIt was gathered that the APC leadership, a few hours to the commencement of plenary, directed the Leader of the Senate, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi (APC Kebbi North), to inform the party\u2019s members to amend clause 52 of the bill to mandate INEC to seek NCC\u2019s nod before it could transmit election results electronically in a particular area.\n\nDuring the consideration of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, containing 154 clauses, it was looking like a smooth passage for the draft legislation until the senators got to clause 52(3) of the bill, that provided for electronic transmission of election results.\n\nThe stage for partisan bickering among senators was set when Senator Abdullahi Sabi (APC, Niger North) sought an amendment to clause 52 (3,) which read inter alia \u201cThe Commission may transmit results by electronic means where and when practicable.\u201d\n\nBut he prayed the Senate to amend the section to read, \u201cthat the Commission may consider electronic transmission of election results provided the network coverage in the area concerned is adjudged to be conducive for transmission of results, by the National Communication Commission (NCC).\u201d\n\nSenator Albert Bassey (PDP Akwa Ibom North East) countered with a motion that the amendment should reflect that INEC may allow for electronic transmission of results where and when practicable.\n\nAttempts by the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, to rule in favour of Sabi\u2019s motion was rejected by the Senate Minority Leader, Senator Senator Eyinnaya Abaribe (PDP Abia South), who called for a division of the senators to vote on clause 52 (3) of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nAbaribe, egged on by other like-minded colleagues, rebuffed attempts by APC senators and Lawan to withdraw his motion for division.\n\nTo douse tension, Lawan called for an executive session.\n\nBut after the closed-door session that lasted for about 40 minutes, Abaribe insisted on Order 73, which called for division of the upper chamber to enable voting on any contentious issue by each senator.\n\nThe ruling party put more pressure on Abaribe to recant his position with Senator Ali Ndume (APC Borno South) warning that lawmakers must be wary of anything that would affect cohesion in the Senate.\n\nSenate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu (APC, Abia), cautioned Abaribe over demands for electronic transmission of election results.\n\nHe claimed that the South-east had neither stable electricity nor sufficient telecommunication coverage to guarantee efficient transmission of results.\n\nOthers who voted against Bassey\u2019s motion said Nigeria was not ripe for electronic voting and transmission of result.\n\nThough the Senate leader and Senator Opeyemi Bamidele (APC Ekiti Central), separately made spirited efforts to make Abaribe withdraw his motion on division, the minority leader stood his ground.\n\nThereafter, Lawan told the senators that those in favour of amendment made by Abdullahi should say No, while those for the counter amendment made by Bassey should say yes.\n\nAt the end of the voting, which lasted for about 40 minutes, a total of 80 senators participated, out of which 52, voted for the amendment made by Abdullahi, and 28 voted for the original provision of the clause.\n\nAs announced by the Clerk, 28 senators were absent during the division and voting session.\n\nHowever, sources told THISDAY that some of the absentee senators were in the chambers before the commencement of voting and excused themselves later.\n\nAmong those who didn\u2019t vote were Senators Theodore Orji (PDP, Abia), Gabriel Suswam(PDP, Benue North East), Ifeanyi Ubah (YPP, Anambra South) and Stella Oduah (PDP, Anambra North), who are under investigation and trial by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for alleged corruption.\n\nAlso, all the three senators from Ogun State were not around at the beginning of the voting, the same way two out of the three senators from Oyo State left the chamber before the commencement of voting.\n\nIn his remarks after voting, Lawan explained that the 28 absentees were on official oversight functions in national interest.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have gone through probably the most rigorous process we ever had. We had at a point had to go through a division, but that is democracy. No hard feelings and I\u2019m sure that Nigerians will appreciate the debt of concern by all of us here. Those who voted for amendments and those who voted against, each one of us did so out of conviction for what we believe will be better for this country.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the Electoral Amendment Bill has now been passed by the Senate and we expect that the House of Representatives, our counterparts, will do the same. If in any case we have even if it\u2019s a single difference between our version and theirs, there will be a committee to harmonise, the conference committee. If, however, there is no difference between what we have passed here and what they would have passed in the House, this bill will now be sent to Mr. President for his presidential assent.\n\n\u201cBut I want to assure all Nigerians that what the Senate did was to show serious concern and care about the divergent views of Nigerians on the election process in this country. All of us want to see an election process that is all inclusive, that is fair, that is equitable and just to everyone, whether someone is in the city or in the villages or in the hamlets.\n\n\u201cI wish INEC the best and Nigerians to support INEC at all times to ensure that our elections are done quite in time without postponment due to one reason or the other. We pray that this bill will guide the 2023 general elections so well. And we hope to have a better and more improved election process in 2023.\u201d\n\nAddressing newsmen after the plenary, Senate spokesman, Senator Ajibola Basiru, said the lawmakers tried to persuade Abaribe to have a change of mind.\n\nAccording to him, the lawmakers supported electronic transmission of election results, but provided the network is adequate as adjudged by NCC, subjected to approval of the National Assembly.\n\nHe added that all over the world, there is no where there is total network coverage.\n\nMeanwhile, THISDAY learnt that many of the Southern senators who voted against electronic transmission of election results broke their pledge to Southern governors to support the system.\n\nThe Southern governors, rising from a meeting in Lagos on July 5, had, among others, called for the inclusion of electronic transmission of election results in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nSources told THISDAY that Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, later met with senators from the region to extract a commitment from them to support the forum\u2019s position.\n\nAfenifere, Ohanaeze, Tambuwal, PDP, SANs Knock Lawmakers\n\nReacting to the decision of the senators, the PDP yesterday expressed shock over the decision of the Senate to undermine the electoral process by refusing to approve the demand of Nigerians for the electronic transmission of election results without conditionalities.\n\nPDP said in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, that the action of the APC senators was an assault on the sensibilities of Nigerians, who looked up to the Senate for improvement in the electoral process in a manner that will engender free, fair and credible process.\n\nThe party said: \u201cIt is outrageous that the APC and its senators, in their desperate bid to annex the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), seek to route a statutorily independent commission to the approval of an individual masquerading in the Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC); an agency under executive control in addition to an extra endorsement of the legislature, before conducting elections.\n\n\u201cThis action of the APC senators is a direct affront, novel in its recklessness and a defilement of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), which clearly conferred operational independence to INEC to conduct elections, free from interferences and regulations from any other agency of government.\u201d\n\nAlso, National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, described the decision of the Senate as disappointing.\n\n\u201cBy voting against electronic transmission of election results, most senators of the Federal Republic of Nigeria have clearly shown that they are democrats only when they are favoured or when it suits them.\n\n\u201cOf the 109 members, whopping 28 were absent when such an important decision was going to be taken. It was disgraceful.\n\nThat the voting pattern, for and against, cut across party line was a further proof that when it comes to taking decisions on important national issues, the driving force for most politicians would be \u2018self\u2019 rather than what would best serve the people,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo also lampooned the Senate for rejecting electronic transmission of results.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, the organisation said the action cast a doubt on both the image and quality of the lawmakers in the upper chamber.\n\n\u201cThe essence of electronic transmission of results is to put to an end to such things as manipulation of results, thuggery, stuffing of ballot box and other forms of electoral malpractices.\n\n\u201cThe Senate of any country should always be futuristic, statesmanly and answerable to the public conscience and posterity,\u201d it added.\n\nOn his part, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mr. Ahmed Raji said: \u201cCredible election is very crucial to the sustenance of democracy. Electronic transmission of results will boost the credibility of the election and invariably good governance\u201d.\n\nHe stated that INEC is supposed to be independent in line with constitutional provisions. \u201cAny law that attempts to compromise the independence will be unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cAny law requiring INEC to be liaising with a body like NCC and the National Assembly will appear to be unconstitutional as such law directly interferes with the independence of INEC,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, Professor Konyinsola AJayi (SAN) said the excuse given by lawmakers who voted against electronic transmission was not tenable because Nigeria currently boasts the best penetration rate and internet reach.\n\n\u201cNCC is a regulator and not an operator; therefore, one cannot fathom why anyone will say that NCC should be the one to decide how election results are transmitted.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, with advancement in IT, deployment of telecommunication in Nigeria, we have one of the best penetration rate, in terms of internet reach.\n\n\u201cTo think it will be fair that there should be no election transmission of election results from polling units is a shame,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso reacting, the Governor of Sokoto State, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal, faulted the manner the Senate decided the issue of electronic voting, describing it as unconstitutional\n\nIn a statement he signed, the governor, who was House of Representatives speaker, said the decision of the Senate to subject INEC\u2019s constitutional power to conduct elections to the NCC and National Assembly was unconstitutional.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Section 78 of the Constitution provides that \u2018the registration of voters and the conduct of elections shall be subject to the direction and supervision of Independent National Electoral Commission.\n\n\u201cIn Third Schedule, Part 1,F, S.15: INEC has power to organise, undertake and supervise all elections. The constitution further provides that INEC operation is not to be subject to the direction of anybody or authority.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the mode of election and transmission are critical parts of the conduct, supervision, undertaking and organisation of elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOf course the National Assembly has power to flesh out the legal framework but that has to be consistent with the constitution,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) said it supported the Senate\u2019s rejection of electronic transmission of elections results as it may it may \u201cshort change\u201d some voters.\n\nSpokesman of the forum, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, also expressed concern about the capability of INEC to cover the whole country.\n\nYawe, in an interview with THISDAY, said: \u201cIf the electronic transmission will work throughout Nigeria, fine \u2013 that is our preference.\n\n\u201cBut if by using it, we are going to shortchange some Nigerian voters, then we support the decision by Senate.\n\n\u201cWe have no objection to electronic transmission. We are, however, more concerned about the capability of INEC to cover the whole country\u201d.\n\nCommotion Forces House to Adjourn Decision Till Today\n\nAt the House, the clause-by-clause consideration of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill degenerated into an uproar among lawmakers.\n\nThe disagreement forced plenary activities to be halted for about four times.\n\nIt was during the stormy session that lawmakers threw caution to the wind and engaged in physical combat, especially between Hon. Ifeanyi Momah (APGA/Anambra) and Hon. Sheu Koko; Yusuf Gagdi (APC/Plateau) and Hon. Mark Gbillah.\n\nThe clause-by-clause consideration was almost enjoying smooth sailing in the House until they got to Section 52(2) of the proposed legislation which gives discretion to the INEC to adopt electronic voting or any other method of voting in any election, as it may deem fit.\n\nTo amend the section, Hon. Sheu Koko moved a motion that under Section 52(2), accreditation and voting should be done electronically, while collation should be done manually, but lawmakers rejected the motion.\n\nThe Deputy Minority Leader in the House, Hon. Tobi Okechukwu, however, moved a different motion, suggesting that voting, accreditation and transmission of results shall be done electronically.\n\nThe Deputy Speaker of the House, Hon. Idris Wase, who presided over the consideration of the bill, put the motion moved by Okechukwu to vote, but while the \u2018Ayes\u2019 had it, Wase ruled in favour of the \u2018Nays\u2019.\n\nIt was at this point that the chamber became rowdy and the lawmakers who voted in favour of electronic transmission of results left their seats and moved towards Wase\u2019s seat to protest against the injustice.\n\nAfter normalcy returned about 40 minutes later, Wase warned that he would not take exception to lawmakers approaching his seat to insult him.\n\nHe stated that as parliamentarians, they should conduct themselves, adding that language conduct is important.\n\nWase said: \u201cI make bold to ask, those who are insisting that you must transmit electronically, what about our brothers in Borno and Yobe?\u201d\n\nBut the Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, interjected, and suggested that the lawmakers should vote individually to properly settle the matter.\n\nIn his submission, Hon. Onofiok Luke (PDP Akwa Ibom) said the lawmakers should vote, bearing in conscience the interest of Nigerians who gave them the mandate to represent them.\n\nHowever, the House Leader, Hon. Ado Doguwa, cited the rules of the House that when a matter had been ruled on, it could not be revisited.\n\nOn his part, the Minority Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu (PDP Delta) supported Gbajabiamila\u2019s suggestion, saying it was in order.\n\nWase, however, ignored Elumelu\u2019s suggestion and opted for a voice vote on Hon. James Faleke\u2019s suggestion.\n\nFor the second time, he again ruled in favour of the \u201cNays\u201d despite \u201cAyes\u201d having the majority vote.\n\nAfter Wase\u2019s ruling, the plenary again became rowdy as the proponents of electronic transmission again left their seats and moved towards Wase to protest.\n\nIt was during the heated arguments among lawmakers that it degenerated to physical fighting.\n\nDoguwa therefore moved that the House return to plenary but his motion was voted against by the members.\n\nWhen it appeared that the situation was getting out of hand, Gbajabiamila ruled that the adjourned till today for the consideration of the controversial Section 52(2) of the proposed legislation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nOil mogul and richest woman in Africa, Mrs. Folorunsho Alakija, yesterday recounted how she transited from being a fashion entrepreneur to an investor in the oil industry, saying her path was designed by God.\n\nAlakija, who joined the septuagenarian club yesterday, in an interview on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, gave glory to God for her successes in the oil industry, fashion and her humanitarian gestures.\n\nShe recounted her long battle to secure an oil licence, adding that it took three years under the military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida (rtd).\n\nShe also recalled the difficulties she encountered after she was awarded an offshore oil block, but oil exploration companies declined to partner her company to drill for oil.\n\nShe spoke of her involvement in the campaign against COVID-19, which led her foundation, Rose of Sharon, to donate N1billion in support of the fight against the pandemic.\n\nShe said: \u201cAs I look back now, I can say that there is nothing to regret. My only regret in life is not coming to Christ earlier, which is almost 30 years. That is my only regret in life.\n\n\u201cI transitioned from fashion to oil to the glory of God,moving from fashion to the oil industry. First of all, I would say fashion is my passion. A friend of mine, we met on the plane, a family friend and she said you know what, there is something I would like to talk to you about when we get back to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlakija added: \u201cWhen we got back to Nigeria, she brought some bid documents and said that we are looking to lift crude oil from Nigeria and she wanted to know if I can speak to some of our clients, one of whom was the late Mrs. Mariam Babangida.\n\n\u201cI said okay, I will go and see what she can do about it and I got there and she (Mrs. Babangida) said I can book an appointment for you to see the petroleum minister.\n\nI went to see the petroleum minister and what they wanted to do was to lift crude and the petroleum minister said the administration at that time wanted to move away \u2013 they preferred to get Nigerians to be involved (in the oil industry) rather than giving it out to foreigners and he said if they want to invest in Nigeria rather than lift crude, then they will be willing to do that.\n\n\u201cI took it back to my friend, she took it back to her clients and her clients said \u2018no we don\u2019t want to invest in Nigeria, we only wanted to lift;\u2019 so, we parted ways and I said to myself now that I have an inroad to that place, why don\u2019t I go find something I can do what I wanted was a contract to boost my pocket.\n\n\u201cI still wanted to keep on doing my fashion, I love it so I went back to Mrs. Babangida and asked her to help me get another appointment and I went back and told the minister that I can do something. I can do something with NNPC and I was giving all sorts of different options and possibilities.\u201d\n\nShe stated that after several appointments with the then petroleum minister, it took three years to secure the oil licence.\n\nAlakija, who was named Forbes Magazine\u2019s richest woman in Africa in 2020, said after securing the oil licence, oil exploration companies declined involvement owing to the fact that it was \u201coffshore and about 5,000 feet.\u201d\n\nAlakija added: \u201cThe rest was what God wanted to do. What He wanted to at first by giving me that opening through my friend because I would have never looked at the oil industry.\u201d\n\nShe said when she got the licence, she found out that it was an oil block that nobody wanted.\n\n\u201cNobody in the industry wanted it. It was deep offshore, it was 5,000 feet and technology had not reached that water depth. It was too expensive to explore and nobody knew what was deep under. Only God knew and He closed the eyes of every human being on earth to it,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to her, it took another three years for her to find technical partners.\n\nShe recalled meeting with multinational (Texaco) a company before the eventual signing of the papers.\n\nOn her philanthropy, she said it was anchored on the principle of giving.\n\n\u201cI know that the more you give, the more God gives back to you. That\u2019s for sure but that shouldn\u2019t be the reason why you should give\u201d, she said.\n\nOn the activities of her foundation, Rose of Sharon Foundation, she said: \u201cI asked God if there\u2019s any way, He will want me to help Him. As Christians, we should not be going to God, give me this, give me that. We should also ask God, what can I do for you today?\u201d.\n\nOn that premise, she set about rendering assistance to widows and children.\n\nSpeaking on her N1 billion donation to CACOVID, she stated that her foundation sought assurances of judicious application of the donation before it was made.\n\n\u201cWe requested that when it gets to CACOVID, it will get to the right quarters, where we wanted our money to go. We donated N1billion,\u201d she said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kasim Sumaina and Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano\n\nThe Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, yesterday told President Muhammadu Buhari to step up efforts by his administration to end the sufferings of Nigerians.\n\nThe emir told the president who paid him a courtesy call in his palace in Kano as part of his itinerary during his official visit to Kano State, that the present economic situation in the country is inflicting untold hardship on Nigerians.\n\nAs part of his engagement during the state visit, the president was in Zawaciki, Dawakin Kudu Local Government Area of Kano State, to perform the ground-breaking for the 203.8km segment of the Kano-Kaduna rail project.\n\nHe also told governors not to abandon projects initiated by their predecessors so as to speed up the development of their states.\n\nBayero, while receiving Buhari, said: \u201cNigerians are suffering, and something urgently needs to be done.\n\n\u201cThe present economic situation in the country is inflicting untold hardship on Nigerians, coupled with the insecurity.\u201d\n\nThe emir called on the government to do everything possible to control inflation.\n\nHe also urged the federal government to find a lasting solution to ease the suffering of the common man, more specifically with the high cost of essential commodities that are clearly above their reach.\n\nHe called on Buhari to intensify more efforts in tackling insecurity and the economy.\n\nBayero said: \u201cWe are excited with your visit to the palace. We appreciate your visit to the palace from time to time even during the time of the late emir.\n\n\u201cWe want to commend the president for the infrastructural development across the country, particularly those sited in Kano just as the governor listed some of such projects despite the shortfalls in the global economy.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on the president to look into various sectors of life and find ways of ameliorating the sufferings and hardships faced by the masses, especially in the areas of security, economy, especially food and commodities.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping the presidential aides would continue to advise the president on the condition and wellbeing of the poor masses, especially in those aspects where he would need to be informed on certain developments for necessary action. This is a responsibility upon us, which we need to discharge accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe often pray for divine intervention for our country. To the followers, we urged them to sustain constant prayers for the leaders and pray to God to heal our land from COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe emir appealed to Nigerians to support and pray for the success of the Buhari administration.\n\nHe also assured the president of the emirate\u2019s continued prayers for his administration, and applauded him for finding Kano worthy of citing federal government\u2019s critical infrastructural projects, which has turned the state to an economic hub.\n\nHe also expressed delight over the way the federal government is executing people-oriented projects, particularly in Kano State.\n\nEarlier, Buhari, who spoke in Hausa, had said: \u201cI am delighted over how Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje is developing Kano State. I am also happy about his continuity policy. I have seen a number of projects of previous administrations which he has completed.\n\n\u201cI urge other state governors to emulate the continuity policy of Governor Ganduje. I am very happy for the warm reception I received in Kano.\u201d\n\nBuhari Performs Ground Breaking for 203.8km Kano-Kaduna Rail Line\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari yesterday in Zawaciki, Dawakin Kudu Local Government Area of Kano State, performed the ground-breaking for the 203.8km segment of the Kano-Kaduna rail project.\n\nThe segment starts from Rigasa station, Kaduna, and runs to Kano.\n\nThe length of the main line is 203.8 kilometres. It connects two important states in the North: Kaduna and Kano.\n\nWhen completed, it will be connected to the already functional Abuja-Kaduna railway line, and it will be possible to travel directly from Kano to Abuja by train.\n\nThe project adopts China Railway standard, with a designed speed of 150 km/h. It is a single-track standard gauge railway, using diesel traction and automatic blocking system.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony, the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Amaechi, said the proposed Kano-Kaduna railway project would boost trade and present an opportunity for Nigerians to traverse between Abuja and Kano with ease.\n\nAmaechi stated that the project is part of the third and outstanding segment of the Lagos-Kano railway modernisation project.\n\nHe added that the first segment, Abuja-Kaduna line, was launched for commercial operation in July 2016 and the second segment, Lagos-Ibadan railway line, was inaugurated for commercial operation on June 10 2021.\n\n\u201cSuccinctly speaking, having delivered Abuja- Kaduna and Lagos- Ibadan railway project, the remaining stretch of Ibadan-Kano, which traverses Oyo, Osun, Kwara, Niger, Abuja, Kaduna and Kano has been segmented as follows: Kaduna-Kano segment, Ibadan- Minna segment and Minna-Abuja segment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis project will link the Federal Capital, Abuja with the commercial city of Kano and also link the ongoing Kano-Maradi project. The outstanding addendum, Ibadan- Abuja, will link the sea ports in Lagos to Maradi, Niger Republic.\n\n\u201cThis, I believe, will greatly boost trade between the two countries and foster economic development. This railway line will present an opportunity for Nigerians to traverse between Abuja and Kano via Kaduna with relative ease,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the project will improve the standard of living of citizens within its corridor, create employment, promote trade and eventually the railway help to decongest the Lagos port complex.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Apple\u2019s new MagSafe battery pack just made power banks cool again",
          "text": "A few days back, someone on Nigerian Twitter asked if women would date a man who always moved around with a power bank. Seems like a harmless question, right? Well, that singular tweet snowballed into a denouncement of power banks and all who wielded it\u2014laughs in irregular power supply. Well, I wonder what they\u2019d say when they see Apple\u2019s new MagSafe Battery Pack.\n\nAfter teasing us with the spanking new magsafe feature on its iPhone 12 series last year, Apple has finally launched the long-awaited MagSafe Battery Pack\u2014its wireless charging option. This exciting piece of hardware is currently available on the Apple website at $99 and is compatible with all iPhone 12 models.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nMagSafe Battery Pack Specs: the lowdown\n\nYes, yes, we know it sounds corny, but I couldn\u2019t resist.\n\nThe MagSafe Battery pack sports a battery capacity of 1460mAh at 7.62V. Compared to other magsafe power banks, like Anker\u2019s PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless with its 5000mAh battery, Apple\u2019 new battery pack just doesn\u2019t cut it. Especially since the Anker option is a little above half of the Apple MagSafe price.\n\nHowever, the MagSafe may have some redeeming qualities.\n\nFor one, it is wireless, and has a slim, classy build\u2014way slimmer than the Anker option. That increases the cool factor and forgives the low battery capacity\u2014somewhat.\n\nIt also packs a charge. According to Apple Insider, the MagSafe Battery Pack might fully charge an iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro with little issue. Though this depends on how much energy it wastes during charging\u2014wireless charging produces a lot of heat, and this reduces the charge.\n\nThe battery pack also has a reverse-charge feature. This means that not only can your plugged\u2014and attached\u2014MagSafe Battery charge your phone, you can also charge your attached MagSafe while your iPhone is plugged to a power supply.\n\nYou can also charge both if you attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone, then plug your iPhone into a power source. You might want to charge this way if you need to connect your iPhone to another device while charging, like if you\u2019re using wired CarPlay or transferring photos to a Mac. If you charge your iPhone and MagSafe Battery Pack at the same time, your iPhone might charge to 80% or higher before your MagSafe Battery Pack begins charging. \u2014 Apple Support\n\nFun fact: When connected to a 20W or higher power source, the MagSafe Battery can charge with up to 15W of power.\n\nYou can also see your charging status and battery pack percentage on your lockscreen when charging. However, your MagSafe-compatible iPhone should run the iOS 14.7 update or later.\n\nAre these features worth $99? You tell me.\n\nBut one thing\u2019s for sure, your date will probably not run when they see you with this stylish gear.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Why food-on-demand can be Gokada\u2019s ticket to super app stardom",
          "text": "Gokada\u2019s motorcycle-hailing business in Nigeria did not hibernate because there was no demand.\n\nThe evidence is on the streets of Lagos today where motorcycle transport has returned. If GRide had a death certificate, the cause of death would be head-on collision with sudden government policy. It was a near-death experience but Gokada scrapped itself for parts and started a rebirth in March 2020.\n\nIt has now been 18 months since the company pivoted from being a ride-hailing provider to a logistics company.\n\nGRide became GSend to help businesses and individuals in Lagos with intra-city deliveries. Since this pivot, delivery volume has increased by a hundred fold, revenue has increased 10 times and $100 million has been realised in annualized transaction value, according to the company.\n\nBut in its boldest step since it was founded in January 2018 by Fahim Saleh, Gokada now identifies as a super app. In addition to other items that can be packaged in a motorcyclist\u2019s delivery box, food is taking the centre stage.\n\nGokada\u2019s super app is entering the market at a time when Lagos residents are consuming \u20a65 trillion ($12 billion) worth of food annually. \u201cIf the population is to grow to about 30 million by 2030, Lagos will likely need food worth \u20a66.3 trillion on an annual basis,\u2019\u2019 the state\u2019s commissioner for Agriculture said in May.\n\nDika Oha, a former senior executive at Andela and Konga who leads Gokada\u2019s product development, says Gokada delivers more food than any other delivery service in Nigeria.\n\nDika Oha, VP of Product at Gokada. Image credit: Gokada\n\nThe claim is hard to verify without numbers from other players. But Gokada\u2019s evolution from transport provider to food aggregator could help ecosystem players understand the future of super apps in Africa.\n\nA standing fleet is an asset in emergencies\n\nIn August 2019, Gokada took a two-week break to readjust its business strategy following OPay\u2019s sensational entry into Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing market.\n\nA new fleet of 200cc motorcycles were fitted with new tracking features. A higher standard of quality was demanded of drivers who, in many users\u2019 eyes, looked rather unkempt for a technology business.\n\nPerhaps not anticipated at inception, but these changes would serve the company effectively six months later.\n\nFacing existential questions about its future, Gokada repurposed the tracking feature from the ride-hailing business to begin winning customers over to GSend. \u201cWe decided we could not launch without that ability for customers to track,\u201d Victor Daminabo, Gokada\u2019s head of operations, tells me.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, Gokada set an audacious target: have drivers pick-up and complete every delivery in Lagos within two hours. They set up a goods-in-transit insurance policy to cover cases of damage or loss of items in their custody, Daminabo explains.\n\nStarting off as a service for sending individual packages, Gokada iterated to enable one driver to book and fulfill multiple deliveries. That iteration birthed \u2018Gokada for business\u2019 which helps enterprises create different user profiles for staff in various branches. The organisation uses one Gokada account but each unit can monitor deliveries separately.\n\nThis was how Gokada acquired Fan Milk and Jumia Foods as enterprise customers. Rather than invest in their own assets, these companies readily adopted Gokada\u2019s logistics fleet of over 1,000 motorcycles which is already integrated with payments systems like Paystack and Flutterwave.\n\nEating into other verticals\n\nAs the ghosts of GRide gave way to a thriving GSend, the data showed something interesting: Gokada says it has recorded over 1 million deliveries so far in 2021 and about 40% have been food deliveries.\n\nThis volume was driven by formal partnerships, like with Jumia Foods. But small and medium restaurants downloaded the app and used it to find drivers who would deliver food to customers.\n\nImage credit: Rotimi Daramola\n\nSusan*, who lives in the Surulere area of Lagos, tells me the food she ordered directly from a restaurant in her neighborhood in May was delivered by a Gokada driver.\n\nWith this happening frequently, it encouraged Gokada to float GShop, a service that aggregated restaurants, opening the door for the company to bundle all it offers onto one app.\n\nSo why a super app? On one level, it is a practical decision.\n\nUsers enter the company\u2019s ecosystem of services through one channel. That singular funnel makes it easier for the company\u2019s developers to manage updates. Growth and sales teams focus resources on selling one app.\n\nBut Oha, Gokada\u2019s VP of product, explains their motivation is also to take advantage of Nigerians\u2019 increasing familiarity with ecommerce as more businesses \u2013 food, fashion and furniture outlets \u2013 use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to find and sell to customers.\n\nSocial media platforms grow through network effects \u2013 the presence of more users doing more things improves the quality and usefulness of the platforms. Super apps emulate this playbook too, following users\u2019 lead to add more products to the stack.\n\nLike Grab in Singapor and Gozem in francophone Africa, Gokada\u2019s super app journey started with transportation | Graphic by Boluwatife Sanso/TC Insights\n\nBut as Yinka Adegoke explained in this insightful piece, apps become super by offering essential services within large markets. WeChat and Alibaba serve 2 billion users a month across China and parts of Southeast Asia; but can Gokada find a market that large and homogenous?\n\nFrom food, back to ride-hailing\n\nThe only way to reach those exalted heights, then, is by aggressively focusing on customer satisfaction for high-demand products, making the app sticky and top of mind.\n\nOr as Oha puts it, ensuring Gokada is the first thought a user has when they need to order food \u2013 arguably a bigger need than sending parcels.\n\nTo assure users, Gokada is sticking with the simplicity and transparency that has made ride-hailing platforms universal: tap to order, input destination and track your order in real time as it arrives.\n\nGokada\u2019s food service notifies the user of each step along the delivery process to maintain engagement and offer assurance.\n\nAnd yes, pay on delivery.\n\nPerfecting this cycle also means paying attention to renowned global food delivery services like Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats and Deliveroo. The reward is that perfecting a time, quality and culture-sensitive business like food delivery in Africa can be a springboard for getting people to trust and use other products en masse.\n\nThose other products, according to Oha, could be groceries, fashion and electronics. And in cities that permit, motorcycle-taxi \u2013 the company\u2019s first love.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Westa.Solar sets its sights on West Africa after debut in Nigeria",
          "text": "With the increasing adoption of renewable energy use globally, a new player has emerged in the solar photovoltaic (PV) market for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in Africa.\n\nWesta.Solar was recently launched as a joint venture between Oolu Solar, a solar home systems provider and RP Global, a renewable energy investment company.\n\nThe new company offers solar systems that range from 50kW to 5MW and has commenced operations in Nigeria. Last month, it deployed its first rooftop plant at Kano-based Petrichor Industries, a packaging products manufacturing company and subsidiary of the Petrichor Group.\n\nJointly financed by Westa.Solar and the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Development Office, the 500 Kilowatts peak (kWp is the peak power of a PV system) solar power plant provides Petrichor with, significantly, almost a quarter of its electricity needs in a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Westa.Solar.\n\nA solar PPA is an arrangement in which a third-party developer owns, operates, and maintains a PV system that is located on an industrial customer\u2019s property. The latter then buys the electric output from the solar system for a predetermined period and at a set price.\n\nPetrichor\u2019s massive 500kWp rooftop solar plant was installed by Westa.Solar in Kano, Nigeria.\n\nThe plant at Petrichor represents a perfect start to life for Westa.Solar, a company that has its sights set on the larger West African market. But its debut project was not without challenges, no thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that continues to disrupt business operations.\n\n\u201cWe started the project at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, which wasn\u2019t the best time for procuring and shipping from anywhere in the world. Getting the equipment out of China, shipping, and then clearing them at the port was challenging. We also experienced tough delays at the port in Lagos,\u201d Westa.Solar\u2019s Country Manager in Nigeria, Kolawole Akinboye, told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThings kicked into overdrive once the logistics component of the project was resolved and the equipment got to the site in Kano. By then, Westa.Solar could manage the construction process, enabled by its technical know-how ability and the partner it was working with.\n\nHelping businesses save cost and hedge energy prices\n\nMany businesses in Africa grapple with expensive electricity tariffs, frequent power outages, and load shedding. These issues limit production and increase operating and maintenance costs, thereby hindering growth. In Nigeria, enterprises rely on diesel generators to make up for the significant lapse in power supply.\n\nWesta.Solar\u2019s customised solutions for commercial and industrial businesses can help overcome some of the power-related challenges businesses face and in the process, provide direct savings and a hedge on energy prices for its clients.\n\nThe decreasing costs of solar systems, relative to either grid or diesel generators, have helped on-site solar microgrids become economically viable alternatives for commercial and industrial use.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, on-site solar power is cheaper than the electricity tariffs paid by C&I companies in seven of the 15 Sub-Saharan Africa markets studied. While electricity tariffs ranged from $0.028/kWh in Ethiopia to over $0.232/kWh in Senegal, a 250kW solar project cost between $0.10-0.14/kWh in the countries assessed.\n\nThe report predicts that the cost of on-site solar will decline further to about $0.05/kWh by 2030, which will only add to its appeal to commercial users.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the cheaper rates paid for solar, as an industrial company, coming into a long-term agreement with us allows you to predict what your energy cost would be over the next few years instead of having to face rising diesel prices at some point in the future. So yes, our plants serve as a hedge for energy costs for companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\nThe power deal with Westa.Solar is expected to see Petrichor reduce dependence on Nigeria\u2019s unstable national grid, save money \u2013 as much as \u20a6235 million over the next 10 years \u2013 on electricity bills, as well as minimise its carbon footprint by cutting its use of diesel.\n\nMore projects and expansion\n\nOn the back of its successful installation of the massive 500kWp plant in Nigeria, Westa.Solar plans to develop and implement a large pipeline of C&I solar projects across West Africa.\n\nThe company currently has no fewer than 30 companies that it has opened discussions with and is in advanced negotiations with at least seven of them. The country manager expects to announce more partnerships within the next few months.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of what we hope will be many solar power projects for C&I companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting calls from various people because of the Petrichor project, because of how successful it was. We have people that are already calling to say, \u2018Wait, can you look at my own facility? What can you do with us?\u2019 So it is a door-opener because it opens the door for more success.\u201d\n\nBut for now, Westa.Solar is focused on establishing itself in Nigeria, a market that is saturated but offers many opportunities for solar energy providers.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a huge unmet need, so we are focusing on conquering the market. Then in the next year or two, we start our expansion plans across West Africa.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfrica is rich in renewable resources but has an unmet demand for power. Many providers are currently moving to fill this gap and, in the process, help to diversify sources for generating electricity in Africa away from environmentally harmful fossil fuels.\n\nThrough its on-site grids, Westa.Solar expects to support the business of its clients while increasing the penetration of renewable energies across the region, which is yet to reach an inflection point.\n\nWesta.Solar is well-positioned to seize the opportunities that will come its way as the market in Africa expands, helped by Akinboye and his team\u2019s efforts to develop resilient microgrid projects across West Africa.\n\nOver the next five to ten years, the company aims to become the leading commercial and industrial renewable energy provider in the region. \u201cThat is our goal and that is where we are going. We\u2019re changing the narrative of commercial and industrial projects in Africa.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

This partnership will enable Somalians to enjoy both global and local cashless payment opportunities.\n\n\u201cFor Visa to come to Somalia, it means that we are on the right path of growth and progress. We will continue to make partnerships and bring convenient and innovative financial solutions to the people,\u201d said Mahat Mohamed, the CEO of IBS Bank.\n\nSomalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headways in reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nIn 2014, 47 years after the Automated Teller Machine was invented and 25 years after it was introduced in Nigeria and Kenya, Salaam Bank installed the first-ever ATM in Somalia in Mogadishu, the capital state. The ATM was to facilitate cash withdrawals (dollars) for only diaspora returnees and foreigners.\n\nThen a year later in June 2015, MasterCard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market in partnership with Premier Bank and issued 5,000 debit cards to be used by Premier Bank account holders, for domestic transactions.\n\n\u201cNew players are coming on board now. Two years ago, we had about five licensed banks, and today we are talking of 13 licensed commercial banks. That goes to demonstrate the appetite that is there.\u201d Mohamed added.\n\nAccording to Somalia\u2019s Central Bank Governor, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, the Visa partnership will connect Somalia to the global financial system and show the growing confidence in the country\u2019s banking and finance sector.\n\nThe presence of both Mastercard and Visa in Somalia will help position its market as arable land ready to receive seed and produce a bounty harvest.\n\n\u201cWe plan to install an electronic verification system that will ease biometric identification of customers opening bank accounts or transacting in Somalia. We believe this will help to build international trust and confidence in transactions originating from Somalia to other financial markets,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\nWith more partnerships like this, popular conversations around Somalia can increasingly focus on innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra Nnamdi Kanu has given more details of how he was kidnapped in Kenya, tortured for eight days and handed over to Nigerian security operatives.\n\nHe gave the details to his Special Counsel Aloy Ejimakor, who visited him in a DSS detention centre in Abuja.\n\nEjimakor, who spoke with the BBC Igbo said Kanu was held incommunicado and chained to bare floor for eight days in a nondescript private facility in Kenya.\n\n\u201cI met with His Excellency today for nearly 3hrs. He greets you all. He\u2019s in high spirits despite the tribulations. He\u2019s looking forward to overcoming this damned rendition sooner than later. He requests that there should be no disunity; that the Family must remain focused.\u201d\n\nEjimakor said Kanu was blindfolded and flown to Abuja on a private jet on Sunday, June 27th, 2021 from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi as the only passenger onboard.\n\nHe said during his meeting with the IPOB leader, Kanu revealed he was driven to the airport tarmac and very close to the plane without passing through Immigration.\n\n\u201cThe people that abducted him said that they were told by their sponsors that Kanu was a Nigerian terrorist linked to the Islamic terrorists in Kenya, presumably Al-Shabab.\n\n\u201cBut after several days when they discovered his true identity, they tended to treat him less badly. Despite that, they told him they felt committed to hand him over to those that hired them,\u201d Ejimakor said.\n\nHe said no warrant of arrest was provided.\n\n\u201cKanu was in point of fact tortured and subjected to untold cruel and inhuman treatment in Kenya. He said his abductors disclosed to him that they abducted him at the behest of Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cHe was blindfolded and driven to the tarmac very close to the plane without passing through the airport immigration. The plane departed Nairobi at about 12 pm and arrived Abuja in the evening.\n\n\u201cKanu was flown to Abuja in the private jet on Sunday 27th June, 2021 from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi and that he was the lone passenger,\u201d he said.\n\nEjimakor said Kanu was interviewed for the first time by three DSS operatives in his presence.\n\n\u201cThe interview was revealing as it contained certain new allegations that were never heard of before. But all the questions relate directly or indirectly to his status as the leader of IPOB.\n\n\u201cI observed that despite what he has passed through, he was in high spirits and looked forward to overcoming the extraordinary rendition that brought him to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn my assessment of how the case now stands, I wager that before any court can subject Kanu to trial for any offences, it has to first conduct a trial within trial on the grievous incident that forced him to leave Nigeria and the equally grievous incident that forced him back to Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo court of law, conscience and equity will overlook those two incidents and proceed to trial,\u201d Ejimakor said.\n\nEjimakor also said in another interview that he delivered two forms to Mr Kanu during the visit on Wednesday.\n\nOne of the forms was from the British High Commission and the other was from a law firm in London, Bindmans. Kanu is also a British citizen.\n\n\u201cThe forms will open a whole new chapter of legality, including the filing of a Writ of Mandamus, against the Nigerian government in a UK court to compel it to produce Kanu, because his detention is illegal under the British law. It was an extraordinary rendition, which is an international crime by which a state kidnaps a suspect or a fugitive without the due process of law,\u201d the lawyer told PUNCH.\n\n\u201cThey will be filing all these processes in the UK and there is a prospect of a UK court assuming universal jurisdiction or extra-territorial jurisdiction and reaching into Kenya so that they can arrest every Kenyan official, either authorised or not, and every Nigerian official involved in this case.\u201d\n\nMr Ejimakor said the DSS collected the forms, saying they must first go through the vetting of its legal unit.",

In the Akute area of Ogun State, he received the game from one of the company\u2019s agents.\n\nAs soon as the winning number flashed on the bet shop\u2019s screen, yells of delight filled the room as other customers joined in the celebration. But their elation would be short-lived due to Bet9ja\u2019s refusal to pay the winnings.\n\nThe public servant took leave from work and traveled to Bet9ja\u2019s head office in Ojuelegba, Lagos, where he was attended to by a trio of Yetunde, Raji, and Joseph, a super agent, who were all surprised by the bet company\u2019s attitude.\n\nAfter going back and forth for roughly seven days, Bet9ja paid N5 million from the prize on Monday, July 12, 2021, and another installment of N2.5 million the next day, \u201cwhile the trio of Yetunde, Raji, and Joseph have claimed that the remaining N3.350 million will not be paid.

It is really painful that when the compensation eventually came, some representatives of Bet9ja want to rob me of the joy,\u201d he further told Newscarte.\n\nSo far, several efforts by the civil servant to get the balance of his winning has proved abortive. \u201cWhen I called Bet9ja customer care line, the representative that picked the call said I should send a letter if I\u2019m not satisfied with the amount paid from my winning. The whole thing has really been frustrating.\u201d\n\nWhen Newscarte called Raji, one of the accused Bet9ja representatives on his Airtel mobile number, he boasted \u201cI can\u2019t talk to you on phone.

While bringing information on security to the doorsteps of Nigerians is a necessity, there is a need for caution as too many details may have an adverse implication on the efforts of our security officials who are duty-bound to deal with the insurgency.\n\n\u201cThe Commission, therefore, enjoins broadcasters to collaborate with the government in dealing with the security challenges by;\n\n\u201cNot glamourising the nefarious activities of insurgents, terrorists, kidnappers, bandits etc.\n\n\u201cAdvising guests and/or analysts on programmes not to polarise the citizenry with divisive rhetoric, in driving home their point.\n\n\u201cNot giving details of either the security issues or victims of these security challenges so as not to jeopardise the efforts of the Nigerian soldiers and other security agents.\u201d\n\nThe Commission also reminded the broadcast stations to be guided by provisions of Sections 5.4.1(f) and 5.4.3 of the NBC Code which states thus:\n\n\u201cThe broadcaster shall not transmit divisive materials that may threaten or compromise the divisibility and indissolubility of Nigeria as a sovereign state.\n\n\u201cIn reporting conflict situations, the broadcaster shall perform the role of a peace agent by adhering to the principle of responsibility, accuracy and neutrality.\u201d\n\nNigeria has been fighting insurgency for over a decade, particularly in the north-eastern section of the country. The Nigerian Army and the Presidency have stated that Boko Haram and its splinter organization, the Islamic State in West Africa Province, have been crushed on several occasions, but the marauders continue to strike with unbelievable savagery and guts. Since 2009, rebels have killed almost 350,000 women, children, and farmers in Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa, among other violent areas, according to Global Conflict Tracker.\n\nOn the other hand, the President\u2019s regime, led by Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) and his Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has recently attempted to stifle the press in Nigeria by pressuring the National Assembly to amend the Nigeria Press Council Act and the National Broadcasting Commission Act, which has been fiercely opposed by media stakeholders.\n\nOn June 4, 2021, the Federal Government announced the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, alleging \u201cthe ongoing use of the site for actions that are capable of damaging Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d",

          "title": "SENATE ON ELECTORAL ACT AMENDMENT: Network coverage to determine e-transmission of results",
          "text": "\n\nProvisions of Clause 52(3) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 Thursday tore senators apart along party lines during consideration of the entire report containing 154 clauses.\n\nThe clause which, as recommended by the Senate Committee on Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), provides for electronic transmission of election results by INEC where and when practicable, was rejected via an amendment made by Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi (APC Niger North).\n\nWhile calling for the amendment through a point of order, Senator Abdullahi added a proviso that such electronic transmission of results by INEC should be subjected to certification of network coverage by the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC).\n\nWhile the clause, as originally recommended by the committee states: \u201cThe Commission may transmit results of elections by electronic means where and when practicable\u201d\n\nThe amended version adopted by the Senate after voice votes and votes counted during division states: \u201cINEC may consider electronic transmission of results provided the National Network coverage is adjudged to be adequate and secure by the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC).\u201d\n\nThe clause which took Senate about three hours to consider and approve, first created stalemate when Senator Albert Akpan Bassey (PDP Akwa Ibom North East), countered the amendment made by Abdullahi. Bassey Akpan sought for retention of the provision as originally proposed by the committee which was however voted against when put to voice votes as ruled by Senate President Ahmad Lawan.\n\nAfter the ruling, the Senate was in stalemate for about 15 minutes, which led to a hurried closed door session.\n\nAs the lawmakers apparently failed to reach consensus on the matter at the closed door session which lasted about one hour, Senate Minority Leader Enyinnaya Abaribe rose through Order 73 of the Senate Standing Rules to call for division on amendment sought by Senator Akpan.\n\nAlthough Senate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi (APC Kebbi North), and Senator Michael Opeyemi Bamidele (APC Ekiti Central), separately made spirited efforts to prevail on Abaribe to withdraw his motion on division, Abaribe however stood his ground for the division and physical counting of votes.\n\nBefore the physical voting of the lawmakers\u2019 one after the other on state basis, Senate President persuaded them to vote on ayes and nay basis for and against the two motions.\n\nFollowing this, therefore, Clerk of the Senate Ibrahim El-Ladan presided over the election by calling the senators one after the other on state by state basis.\n\nAt the end of the physical voting which lasted about 40 minutes, a total of 80 senators voted, out of which 52 voted for the amendment made by Senator Sabi Abdullahi and 28 voted for original provision of the clause.\n\nAs announced by the Clerk, 28 senators were absent during the division and voting session.\n\nWhile all the 52 senators who voted for the amendment belonged to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), 26 out of the 28 Senators who voted against the amendment belonged to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), indicating a party line of voting.\n\nIronically, Chairman of Senate Committee on INEC Kabiru Gaya, who presented the report with original provision of clause 52(3), voted against it by saying no to Senator Bassey\u2019s call for its retention.\n\nAll the three senators from Anambra and Ogun states left the chamber at the start of the physical voting, the same way two out of the three lawmakers from Oyo state did.\n\nThose who voted No\n\nOn the basis of \u2018yes\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 voting for the original provision of the clause , those who voted no were Senators Orji Uzor Kalu (Abia North ) , Ishaku Elisha (Adamawa North) , Dahiru Aishatu Binani (Adamawa Central ), Jika Daudu Haliru (Bauchi Central) , Bukachuwa Adamu Muhammad (Bauchi North) and Degi Eremienyo (Bayelsa East) .\n\nOthers are Senators Abubakar Kyari (Borno North), Shettima Kashim (Borno Central), Ali Ndume (Borno South) , Stephen Odey (Cross River North) , Ovie Omo-Agege (Delta Central ), Peter Nwaoboshi (Delta North ) , Francis Alimikhena (Edo North) and Opeyemi Bamidele (Ekiti Central).\n\nThe rest are Danjuma Goje (Gombe Central), Amos Bulus (Gombe South), Alkali Saidu (Gombe North), Frank Ibezim (Imo North), Hadeija Hassan Ibrahim (Jigawa North East) , Abdul \u2013 Kwari Suleiman (Kaduna North) , Uba Sani ( Kaduna Central), Kabiru Gaya (Kano South) , Ahmad Babba Kaita (Katsina North) , Mundiya Bello (Katsina South) and Abdullahi Barkiya (Katsina Central) .\n\nOthers are Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North) , Abdullahi Adamu Aliero (Kebbi Central) , Oseni Yakubu (Kogi Central) , Smart Adeyemi (Kogi West ), Isah Jibrin (Kogi East ), Lola Ashiru (Kwara South) , Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nHighly surprising within the no category were the Lagos lawmakers, excluding Senator Tokunbo Abiru, who was absent.\n\nAlso on the \u2018no\u2019 list were , Adamu Abdullahi (Nasarawa West), Tanko Al -Makura (Nasarawa North) , Akwashiki Godiya (Nasarawa South) , Mohammed Sani (Niger East) , Abdullahi Aliyu Sabi (Niger North), Bima Enagi (Niger South) , Robert Boroffice (Ondo North) , Basiru Ajibola (Osun Central) , Adelere Oriolowo ( Osun West ) , Dimka Ayuba( Plateau Central ) , Ibrahim Gobir (Sokoto East) Yusuf Yusuf (Taraba Central), Isa Shuaibu Lau (Taraba North) Bomai Ibrahim Mohammed (Yobe South) , Sahabi Ya\u2019u (Zamfara North) and Lawali Hassan Anka (Zamfara West) .\n\nThe \u2018yes\u2019 senators\n\nThose who voted yes were Senators Adenugba Fadahunsi, Clifford Ordia\n\nMatthew Urhoghide, Kola Balogun, Gyang Istifanus, George Sekibo,\n\nBiodun Olujimi, Mpigi Barinada , Betty Apiafi, Abdullahi Danbaba and\n\nPhilip Aduda.\n\nOthers are Chukwuka Utazi, Abdullahi Ibrahim Danbaba, Francis Onyewuchi, Danjuma La\u2019ah, Patrick Akinyelure , Enyinnaya Abaribe etc.\n\nReps in fisticuffs\n\nAnd at the House of Representatives Thursday, members engaged in fisticuffs as tempers rose over disagreement on a clause in the Electoral Act amendment Bill currently being considered.\n\n\n\nThis was as Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila announced invitation of Chairman Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Mahmood Yakubu and Executive Vice Chairman Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) Umar Danbatta to appear before the House to offer insights into some of the knotty issues.\n\n\n\nPlenary had earlier turned rowdy when Deputy Speaker Idris Wase, who was presiding over the consideration, gave majority nod to negating voice votes over a proposal that \u201cconduct of elections and transmission of results shall be done electronically\u201d, leading to protest by members who voted in support of the proposal.\n\n\n\nHowever, the House which was initially billed to proceed on its summer holiday Thursday, was forced to suspend the consideration until 10am today (Friday), during which the INEC and NCC bosses will appear, as it became obvious no progress could be made beyond clause 52 of the over 150-clause Bill.\n\n\n\nWhile Wase made moves after the session was reverted to plenary from the Committee of the Whole to report what transpired.\n\nHowever, some members got provoked when he added the controversial clause as what had been adopted. The shouting bouts between opposing members was to degenerate into physical attacks.\n\n\n\nThe consideration of the Electoral Act amendment report was smoothly progressing until clause 52 was mentioned.\n\nAt this point, Deputy Minority Leader Toby Okechukwu proposed an amendment to the effect that the \u201cconduct of election and transmission of results shall be done electronically.\u201d\n\n\n\nSame proposal was seconded by Deputy Whip Nkiruka Onyejeocha, after which Deputy Speaker Wase, who chairs the committee of the whole put question for voice votes.\n\nHe had earlier expressed opinion that there were places where GSM network may not be accessed.\n\n\n\nHis ruling that the \u201cnays have it\u201d against the thunderous ayes instantly threw the House into uproar with members accusing him of bias.\n\n\n\nEven at the return of a seeming normalcy, he insisted that if the electronic voting and transmission of results was adopted, \u201cWhat happens to our brothers in Yobe and Maiduguri where the masts are down?\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter about an hour of no progress due to the disagreement, it took the intervention of Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila to address his colleagues on the need to continue the process this morning.",

          "text": "\u2026Lauds Reps\n\nFormer Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Aminu Tambuwal on Thursday said the decision of the Senate to subject INECs constitutional power to conduct elections t o the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), and National Assembly is patently unconstitutional.\n\nReacting to the decision of the Senate to stop INEC from the electronic transmission of votes, the Sokoto state governor said the powers of INEC on how to conduct elections are entrenched in the constitution and cannot be subject to anybody.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the Senate to subject INECs constitutional power to conduct elections to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) , and National Assembly is patently unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, S.78 of the Constitution provides that \u2018The Registration of voters and the CONDUCT of elections shall be subject to the direction and supervision of Independent National Electoral Commission.\n\nIn the Third Schedule, Part 1, F, S.15: INEC has the power to organize, undertake and supervise all elections. The Constitution further provides that INEC operations shall not be subject to the direction of anybody or authority.\n\n\u201cUnquestionably, the mode of election and transmission are critical parts of the conduct, supervision, undertaking, and organization of elections in Nigeria. Of course, the National Assembly has the power to flesh out the legal framework, but that has to be consistent with the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThese constitutional powers have been solely and exclusively prescribed by the Constitution to INEC, and cannot be shared with the NCC, or any other Authority, and certainly not a body unknown to the Constitution. The Senate decision to subject INECs constitutional power to conduct elections to NCC is consequently patently VOID, unconstitutional, and unlawful.\n\n\u201cWe had earlier counseled that the mode of conducting elections and in particular the transmission of votes be left with INEC who would monitor developments and determine at every election the type of technology to be deployed to ensure free, fair, and credible elections. INEC also has constitutional power backed by the Electoral Act to make rules and guidelines to ensure that every vote is counted and that every vote counts.\n\nHon Tambuwal added that if INEC determines that in any part of the country, electronic transmission is not possible, it would by regulations determine the appropriate thing to do.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the House of Representatives to call on INEC to address the House and nation on its readiness by 2023 to deploy electronic transmission technology for our elections, seems to be a wise one, I, therefore, commend the Leadership and Hon Members of the House for this decision and further admonish them to remain on the path of patriotism and deepening of our democracy by engendering and strengthening the free and fair electoral process\n\n\u201cIn any case, I still believe that the best option is to leave this matter in the hands of INEC.\n\n\u201cWe admonish INEC to be solely guided by the National interest and the desire of all Nigerians for a credible, free and fair elections in using its constitutional powers and in the deployment of error-free technology.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s consumer price index (CPI), a measurement of the rate of change in prices of goods and services, has declined to 17.75% in June from 17.93 recorded in May 2021.\n\nThe \u2018Consumer Price Index Report for June\u2019 released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday, means that the prices have continued to increase in June 2021. However, it was at a slower rate than it did in the last month.\n\n\u201cThe CPI measures the average change over time in prices of goods and services consumed by people for day-to-day living,\u201d the NBS noted in its report.\n\n\u201cThe construction of the CPI combines economic theory, sampling and other statistical techniques using data from other surveys to produce a weighted measure of average price changes in the Nigerian economy.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s Headline Index, on a month-on-month basis, moved by 1.06% in June 2021. This figure was 0.05 percentage points higher than what was recorded in May 2021 \u2013 pegged at 1.01%.\n\nThere was also an increase in the urban inflation rate as it jumped by 18.35 %(year-on-year) in June 2021 from May 2021\u2019s 18.51%. On the other hand, the rural inflation rate moved by 17.16% in June 2021 from 17.36% in May 2021.\n\nThe NBS report equally noted that the composite food index increased by 21.83 % in June 2021. This is against the 22.28% reported in May 2021.\n\nThe implication is that prices of food rose in the month under review but at a little slower pace than what was recorded in May 2021.\n\nIncreases in prices of bread, cereals, yam, and others, drove the food price index.\n\nDeepened Woes Of The Poorest\n\nGlobal food prices are rising at their fastest rate in a decade, exacerbating the troubles of the world\u2019s most vulnerable nations as they struggle with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is worried that soaring prices could foment further social unrest in countries already mired in political turmoil.\n\nWhere Are Food Prices Headed?\n\nAccording to the FAO, food prices were nearly 40 percent higher in May than a year ago, the sharpest increase since September 2011.\n\nOn a 12-month basis, the price of corn has skyrocketed by 88 percent, soybean by 73 percent, grain and dairy products by 38 percent, sugar by 34 per cent and meat by 10 percent.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s very concerning,\u201d said Arif Husain, chief economist of the World Food Programme.\n\nIn 2007-2008, brutal increases in the price of basic foodstuffs sparked riots in a number of cities around the world. Peaking in 2010-2011, the price rises acted as a harbinger for the Arab Spring uprisings.",

          "text": "South Africa has begun deploying more than 20,000 troops to assist police in quelling week-long unrest, as the death toll soared to 117 people in the rioting and looting following the jailing of former President Jacob Zuma, authorities said on Thursday.\n\nIn one of the largest deployments of soldiers since the end of white minority rule in 1994, the government said 10,000 soldiers were on the streets by Thursday morning and the South African National Defence Force has also called up all of its reserve force of 12,000 troops.\n\nIn a show of force, a convoy of more than a dozen armoured personnel carriers brought soldiers on Thursday into Gauteng province, South Africa\u2019s most populous, which includes the largest city, Johannesburg, and the executive capital, Pretoria.\n\nBuses, trucks, aeroplanes and helicopters were also being used to move the large deployment of troops to trouble spots in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal province that have seen a week of violence in mainly poor areas.\n\nThe unrest, which began last Friday, was triggered by the jailing of former President Zuma but widened into grievances over inequality and poverty.\n\nMore than 2,200 people have been arrested, the acting minister in the presidency, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, told a news conference, adding that Johannesburg was now \u201crelatively calm\u201d.\n\nBut in KwaZulu-Natal province, the epicentre of the violence, the minister said the \u201csituation remains volatile, but much improved and moving towards stability\u201d.\n\nAbout 100 acts of violence had been recorded on Wednesday, but fewer than three dozen on Thursday, she said.\n\nThe violence has so far not spread to South Africa\u2019s seven other provinces, where police are on alert.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Bernard Smith reporting from Johannesburg said it was \u201cmuch calmer\u201d in the country\u2019s economic hub.\n\n\u201cMembers of the [Johannesburg] community are going with the army door-to-door finding people who have been looting from the shops and getting them to give stuff back,\u201d he added.\n\nMeanwhile, in Durban in KwaZulu-Natal province, where there has been much more violence, there are fears that the situation could get worse, Smith said.\n\n\u201cThere are already queues outside supermarkets where people are panic buying, and where a refinery was forced to stop operating because \u2026 workers couldn\u2019t get to the refinery. And so that has prompted panic buying a fuel hand in the supermarkets.\u201d\n\nThe unrest has also disrupted hospitals struggling to cope with a third wave of COVID-19. They say they are running out of oxygen and drugs, most of which are imported through Durban.\n\nSome vaccination centres have been forced to shut.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa told leaders of political parties that parts of the country \u201cmay soon be running short of basic provisions\u201d following disruption to supply chains.\n\nMembers of the South Africa Defence Force (SANDF) stand guard outside the Chris Hani Mall in Vosloorus, on the northern outskirts of Johannesburg [Guillem Sartorio/AFP]\n\nSecurity forces increased their presence in the Durban suburb of Phoenix, where the riots caused racial tensions to flare.\n\nThe predominantly Indian residents of Phoenix had been patrolling their area against the unrest and are accused of shooting Black people suspected of being rioters.\n\n\u201cLives have been lost. The communities have a standoff and are in a bad way because it is the Indian community and the neighbouring communities, who are African,\u201d Minister of Police Bheki Cele told a news conference on Thursday in Phoenix, where he said 15 people had been killed.\n\nA woman holds empty beer bottles outside a liquor store as others sort rubble while volunteering to clean the Diepkloof Square following looting and vandalism in Soweto, Johannesburg [Phill Magakoe/AFP]\n\nCele had earlier said that about 12 people were being investigated for inciting and planning the unrest.\n\n\u201cThe Indian nation here in KZN is the second largest outside of India,\u201d the new Zulu king, Misizulu Zulu, said in an appeal to his community on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have lived in peace for many years alongside them. Therefore I ask: Let us be understanding and thoughtful towards each other.\u201d\n\nZuma, 79, was sentenced last month for defying an order to give evidence at a judicial inquiry probing high-level corruption during his time in office from 2009 to 2018.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty in a separate case on charges including corruption, fraud, racketeering and money laundering.\n\nHe says he is the victim of a witch-hunt by his political foes.\n\nZuma\u2019s fall from grace has opened up a power struggle within the African National Congress (ANC), which has ruled since the end of apartheid in 1994.\n\nThe former president\u2019s loyalists make up the strongest faction opposed to President Ramaphosa.",

          "text": "Los Angeles County will again require masks be worn indoors in the nation\u2019s largest county, even by those vaccinated against the coronavirus, while the University of California system also said Thursday that students, faculty and staff must be inoculated against the disease to return to campuses.\n\nThe announcements come amid a sharp increase in virus cases, many of them the highly transmissible delta variant that has proliferated since California fully reopened its economy on June 15 and did away with capacity limits and social distancing. The vast majority of new cases are among unvaccinated people.\n\nThe rapid and sustained increase in cases in Los Angeles County requires restoring an indoor mask mandate, said Dr. Muntu Davis, public health officer for the county\u2019s 10 million people. The public health order will go into effect just before midnight Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis is an all-hands-on-deck moment,\u201d Davis said during a virtual news conference.\n\nHe didn\u2019t fully detail what would be some exceptions to the mask rule but said, for example, people could still take off their masks while eating and drinking at restaurants.\n\nDavis said officials will focus on education rather than enforcement. Handing out citations to people who don\u2019t comply is \u201cnot something we really want to have to do,\u201d he said.\n\nLos Angeles County has been recording more than 1,000 new cases each day for a week, and there is now \u201csubstantial community transmission,\u201d Davis said. On Thursday, there were 1,537 new cases, and hospitalizations have now topped 400.\n\n\u201cThe next level is high transmission, and that\u2019s not a place where we want to be,\u201d he said.\n\nIt comes after a winter where Los Angeles County experienced a massive surge in infections and deaths, with hospitals overloaded with COVID-19 patients and ambulances idling outside, waiting for beds to open.\n\nNow, hospitalizations in California are above 1,700, the highest level since April. More than 3,600 cases were reported Thursday, the most since late February, but a far cry from the winter peak that saw an average of more than 40,000 per day.\n\nOther counties, including Sacramento and Yolo, are strongly urging people to wear masks indoors but not requiring it.\n\n\u201cThe drastic increase in cases is concerning \u2014 as is the number of people choosing not to get vaccinated,\u201d Sacramento County Public Health Officer Olivia Kasirye said.\n\nThe Los Angeles County decision came within hours of the University of California\u2019s announcement that students, faculty and staff must be vaccinated for the upcoming semester.\n\nUC President Michael V. Drake said in a letter to the system\u2019s 10 chancellors that unvaccinated students without approved exemptions will be barred from in-person classes, events and campus facilities, including housing.\n\n\u201cVaccination is by far the most effective way to prevent severe disease and death after exposure to the virus and to reduce spread of the disease to those who are not able, or not yet eligible, to receive the vaccine,\u201d Drake wrote.\n\nHe said the decision came after consulting UC infectious disease experts and reviewing evidence from studies on the dangers of COVID-19 and emerging variants like the delta strain.\n\nIn San Francisco, cases are rising among the unvaccinated. Black and Latino people are getting shots at a lower rate than others, and Mayor London Breed urged them to get the vaccine.\n\nShe said Thursday that every person hospitalized with COVID-19 at San Francisco General Hospital is unvaccinated and most are African American.\n\nSan Francisco Supervisor Shamann Walton said the highest number of cases are in the Bayview district, a largely Black neighborhood, \u201cbecause we are not doing everything we can to protect each other. This is a cry to my community. \u2026 We need you to get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco has one of the highest overall vaccination rates in the nation\u2019s most populated state. At least 83% of residents 12 and older have received at least one dose.\n\nMeanwhile, north of San Francisco, at least 59 residents at a homeless shelter have tested positive for the virus. Of those infected at the Santa Rosa shelter, 28 were fully vaccinated, Dr. Sundari Mase, Sonoma County\u2019s health officer, said Wednesday. Officials were reviewing an additional 26 possible positive cases.\n\nOf those with confirmed infections at Samuel L. Jones Hall, nine were hospitalized, including six who were fully vaccinated and had \u201cmultiple, significant\u201d underlying health conditions, including diabetes and pulmonary disease, health officials said.\n\nFewer than half of the shelter\u2019s 153 residents had received at least a partial vaccination, officials said, and they don\u2019t know if the outbreak started with a vaccinated or unvaccinated resident.\n\n\u201cWe know congregate settings are at much higher risk,\u201d Mase said. \u201cWe also know there is a very high proportion of unvaccinated individuals that were in this setting.\u201d\n\nMost of the 69 vaccinated residents had received the single-shot Johnson & Johnson dose, but Mase said it was hard to determine whether that was a factor in the outbreak.\n\nVaccines decrease the severity of the illness, reduce hospitalizations and decrease the risk of death. Clinical trials showed that a single dose of the J&J vaccine was 72% effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 in the United States, compared with 95% for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.\n\nA Food and Drug Administration analysis cautioned that it\u2019s not clear how well the vaccines work against each variant.\n\nSo-called breakthrough cases among the fully vaccinated are unusual. Between Jan. 1 and June 30, California identified 8,699 such cases out of the more than 20 million who have received the vaccine.",

          "text": "For many, it\u2019s a common courtesy or a sensible precaution. For others, it\u2019s an imposition, a daily irritation.\n\nThe face mask \u2014 a highly charged source of debate, confusion and anger around the world during the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 is now dividing people as the crisis eases.\n\nBritain is bracing for acrimony on Monday, when the government lifts a legal requirement to wear face coverings in most indoor settings, including shops, trains, buses and subways. Donning a mask in many places will stop being an order and become a request.\n\nAlready, people are split about how to respond.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d said London caf\u00e9 owner Hatice Kucuk. \u201cI don\u2019t think they really help much.\u201d\n\nBut Lucy Heath, a filmmaker, said she would prefer to see masks remain mandatory on the subway and in supermarkets.\n\n\u201cI just think vulnerable people will feel that they don\u2019t want to venture out,\u201d she said.\n\nThe end of many pandemic restrictions next week \u2014 once touted in British newspapers as \u201cfreedom day\u201d \u2014 comes as the U.K. faces soaring coronavirus cases and rising deaths, despite an inoculation program that has given two-thirds of adults both doses of vaccine.\n\nThis week Britain recorded more than 40,000 cases in one day for the first time in six months. Globally, the World Health Organization says cases and deaths are climbing after a period of decline, spurred by the more contagious delta variant. Last week there were nearly 3 million new infections and more than 55,000 lives lost around the world.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, British politicians\u2019 talk of freedom has been replaced with words of caution.\n\n\u201cThis pandemic is not over,\u201d Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week. \u201cWe cannot simply revert instantly from Monday the 19th of July to life as it was before COVID.\u201d\n\nSo while people no longer have to wear masks, they\u2019re being told that they should.\n\nThe government says it \u201cexpects and recommends\u201d masks to be worn by workers and customers in crowded, enclosed spaces such as shops. London\u2019s mayor says masks will continue to be required on the city\u2019s public transit system, and the National Health Service will insist on them in hospitals. And while the rules are changing in England, masks will still be mandatory in Scotland and Wales, which make their own health regulations.\n\nOpposition politicians and some doctors have urged the government not to remove the mask mandate, while businesses and unions worry the change from mandatory to optional is a recipe for chaos.\n\n\u201cIt is a real mess,\u201d said Paddy Lillis, general secretary of retail workers union USDAW. \u201cProtection for retail workers through wearing face coverings and maintaining social distancing in busy public areas like shops should be backed up by the law.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister has appealed to Britons\u2019 common sense. \u201cI generally urge everyone to keep thinking of others and to consider the risks,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nIt\u2019s not always obvious, though, what the risks are. Most scientists say masks can help curb the spread of COVID-19 by preventing people who may be unknowingly carrying the virus from passing it on to others. But studies suggest masks may be useful only if a high percentage of people wear them.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence to suggest it does good, but only if everybody does it,\u201d said Graham Medley, a professor of infectious disease modelling who is on a panel of scientists advising the British government. \u201cI understand the government\u2019s reluctance to actually mandate it. On the other hand, if it\u2019s not mandated, it probably won\u2019t do any good.\u201d\n\nBut Robert Dingwall, a professor of sociology at Nottingham Trent University who is also a government science adviser, said letting people \u201cfind their own comfort level\u201d is a sensible move.\n\n\u201cWe need to tolerate each other\u2019s different risk appetites,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had all this behavioral science in the background, trying to encourage compliance through amplifying fear and anxiety. And that really needs to reverse tack. We should stop talking about the dangerous situations and start talking much more about the safe ones.\u201d\n\nBritain is not alone in grappling with masks. In recent months, Israel has reopened businesses, schools and event venues, lifting nearly all restrictions after it inoculated some 85% of its adults. Now cases are rising again, and authorities have reimposed a rule requiring people to wear masks indoors, as the country scrambles to contain the delta variant.\n\nIn the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says fully vaccinated people don\u2019t need to wear masks in most settings, in contrast to the WHO, which advises them to cover up. Some U.S. states and cities are trying to decide what to do as cases rise again.\n\nIn many East Asian countries, it was common even before the pandemic for people to wear masks when sick or on high-pollution days. There is little in the way of an anti-mask movement.\n\nIn the United States, however, they have become an often partisan issue, epitomized during the 2020 presidential election by the contrast between often maskless Republican Donald Trump and mask-wearing Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nEuropean nations are less divided, but recent research by King\u2019s College London and pollster Ipsos MORI identified masks as a \u201cculture war\u201d fault line, dividing people in the U.K. in a similar way to Brexit and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe large majority who supported masks and other coronavirus restrictions tended to regard the minority who opposed them as selfish, hypocritical and closed-minded. A lower proportion of lockdown opponents said the same about the other side.\n\n\u201cThe face mask is such a minimal object \u2014 this small piece of fabric, it\u2019s a very low-tech device. But it\u2019s become imbued with so much symbolic power,\u201d said Deborah Lupton, professor at the Center for Social Research in Health at Australia\u2019s University of New South Wales and co-author of the book \u201cThe Face Mask in COVID Times.\u201d\n\nA mask against COVID-19 \u201cis an object which can offer some degree of certainty and protection in this very, very chaotic and uncertain and constantly changing risk environment,\u201d she said. \u201cI think for that reason alone, it has incredible power and significance.\u201d",
          "summary": "The face mask \u2014 a highly charged source of debate, confusion and anger around the world during the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 is now dividing people as the crisis eases.\nBritain is bracing for acrimony on Monday, when the government lifts a legal requirement to wear face coverings in most indoor settings, including shops, trains, buses and subways.\n\u201cWe cannot simply revert instantly from Monday the 19th of July to life as it was before COVID.\u201dSo while people no longer have to wear masks, they\u2019re being told that they should.\nIn many East Asian countries, it was common even before the pandemic for people to wear masks when sick or on high-pollution days.\n\u201cThe face mask is such a minimal object \u2014 this small piece of fabric, it\u2019s a very low-tech device.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has approved three additional Covid-19 vaccines for use.\n\nAhead of the arrival of more vaccines doses in Nigeria, the agency said that its vaccine committee had recommended Moderna (Rovi Pharma Madrid, Spain); AstraZeneca AZD1222 (South Korea Bioscience Co Limited); Sputnik V (Gamaleya National Centre of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia) for emergency use.\n\nThe agency added that following observations of some avoidable effects during vaccination, it has recommended that health officials carry out preliminary checks on individual\u2019s health status before administering the vaccine on anyone.\n\nNAFDAC had earlier granted emergency use authorisation approval for Astrazeneca from India, Pfizer Bio-N-Tech and Johnson and Johnson (Jassen) vaccines to be deployed in the country against COVID-19.\n\nNAFDAC Director-General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, told reporters Thursday in Abuja that the agency was the first national regulatory body in Africa to have guidance on regulatory preparedness for Emergency Use Authorisations (EUA), licensing or access to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nShe said: \u201cNAFDAC is announcing the approval of Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines and conditional approval of Sputnik V vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe NAFDAC Vaccine Committee has been carefully assessing several vaccines despite the fact the vaccines have been approved by stringent regulatory countries or have received WHO\u2019s Emergency Use Listing (EUL). A COVID-19 vaccine that has gone through the prior approval from either of these two sources had gone through quality, safety and efficacy evaluation, which is a prerequisite for acceptance by COVAX Facility.\u201d\n\nShe added that most regulatory agencies across the world use this mechanism to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe agency did a thorough assessment of each vaccine and were found to have the quality, safety and efficacy attributes, with the benefits far outweighing the risks,\u201d she stated.\n\nAccording to her, the agency spends at least 15 days to examine the dossier or submission package of the vaccine to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks and that any side effects are well noted for monitoring after vaccination by the respective NAFDAC and primary health officers.\n\nShe added that the EUL will allow Nigeria to receive supplies of the vaccines from the COVAX facility.\n\nAdeyeye explained the processes involved in the vaccine approval mechanism to include: submission of dossiers by manufacturers and market authorisation holders, assessment of dossier through different mechanisms and using the common technical document for the rolling submission.\n\nOther stages in the process are emergency use authorisation, expedited approval, full review, post-marketing, pharmacovigilance and Surveillance.\n\nAdeyeye explained that Moderna and AstraZeneca AZD1222 vaccines have received WHO EUL listing and were given expedited approvals.\n\nShe, however, said the Russian Sputnik V was yet to receive the EUL approval and therefore was subjected to full six-month review by NAFDAC.\n\nShe said the agency was granted access to the dossiers and prior assessment reports of Moderna and AstraZeneca from the WHO website at different times over the past two months.\n\nShe said Pharmacovigilance/Post-marketing Directorate would conduct safety and monitoring studies on the vaccines to record the side effects and adverse effects following immunisation.\n\nIn addition, Adeyeye said the agency would be using its recently-launched Med Safety App for active pharmacovigilance of the vaccines in collaboration with other agencies.\n\nWhile giving NAFDAC\u2019s assessment of the outcome of the first phase COVID-19 vaccination rollout, Adeyeye said about 4,500 adverse effects were recorded out of the four million doses of Astrazeneca vaccines administered nationwide.\n\nAccording to her, as part of measures to further reduce the incident of adverse effects of the vaccine, the agency has recommended that health officials will hold pre-vaccination interaction with individuals to understand their health conditions before administering the vaccine on anyone.",
