          "text": "\n\nBy: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja\n\n**Vows NDLEA will burn down any drug production farm/site found in any state\n\n**Warns, Traditional Rulers found conniving with drug barons will be arrested, prosecuted.\n\nThe Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Gen Buba Marwa (rtd), has disclosed that the Agency has recorded substantial loss of its operatives/personnel in the fight against illicit drugs trafficking and trade with over 100 widows and Next of Kin\u2019s awaiting Federal government\u2019s intervention in the payment of death benefits for their late breadwinners.\n\nSpeaking at the unveiling of a week-long of activities to commemorate the United Nations International Day Against Drug and Illicit Drug Trafficking, in Abuja, Marwa however stated that the situation has been brought to the knowledge of President Muhammadu Buhari adding that \u201cMr. President has approved the payment of all benefits to the widows and NOKs. This approval will go a long way in further motivating officers of the agency\u201d.\n\nCommenting on a recent suggestion that the growth of Cannabis be legalized in the country as it is a money spinning venture as ascribed to a South West Governor, Marwa said, \u201cThe fact of the issue is one between saving lives and making money. From the drug survey of the United Nations Department on Drugs UNODC, 10.6million Nigerians use drugs and it will be 20million in 2030. We are the highest users of cannabis in the world and the consequences are there for everyone to see\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe World Health Organization says usage of cannabis has health issues. With Nigeria having the highest prevalence ratio, this is not the time to be talking about legalizing the illicit drug. Ondo State is the greatest producer if this substance and NDLEA will continue burn down any farm or production site where we find this drug in accordance with the law. It is dangerous to our health and it has dire consequences\u201d\n\nOn the activities of some traditional rulers conniving with, or providing cover for illicit drugs traffickers and producers, Marwa said, \u201cTraditional Rulers are not exempted from the law. On one or two occasions, when seized drugs from palaces, we arrested the traditional rulers and they are facing the music. So nobody is exempted but we are partnering with majority of the traditional rulers and state governments through advocacy visits to tackle the menace\u201d.\n\nThe Chairman dismissed insinuations that some personnel of NDLEA were re-selling seized drugs to drug barons and others insisting that \u201cNDLEA Staff do not sell drugs which are seized. They are our exhibits which we use in court for prosecution. We have exhibit keepers who are trusted and well selected. We have not had NDLEA staff apprehended for selling drugs\u201d.\n\nEarlier, he said the 26th of June is earmarked by the United Nations as International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking with this year\u2019s day appropriately themed \u201cShare Facts On Drugs, Save Lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe theme is very significant considering the unquantifiable and enormous danger posed by substance abuse. Abuse of narcotics has incapacitated the workforce of organizations and ruined communities and societies. It has brought about family disintegration, decimated the capacities of our youths and given rise to all types of crimes such as insurgency, terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, rape and violent extremism which have befallen nations including our dear country Nigeria with attendant health consequences on the users.\n\n\u201cThe dynamism of the drug problem has made it imperative for us to continue to deepen our knowledge and understanding of this deleterious conundrum. In this regard, sharing facts about drug abuse and illicit trafficking in narcotics, as captured by this year\u2019s theme, will go a long way in shedding some light on hitherto hidden factors that aid predisposition to substance abuse, especially the question of new psychoactive substances.\n\n\u201cDrug abuse as an enabler of all forms of criminality is a hydra-headed monster that must be crushed if we must move forward as a nation. The solution lies in having hyper-efficient anti-drug machinery, which is what the NDLEA stands for.\n\nSince my assumption of office as Chairman/CEO in January this year, we set machinery in motion to reposition the Agency. I am glad to report to you today that after five months, we are making a definite headway in repositioning the NDLEA for efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n\u201cWe have succeeded in boosting the morale and confidence of officers and men of the NDLEA through practical steps taken to address welfare and career stagnation issues. To this end, we instituted, among other measures, a bi-monthly assessment and cash-backed award for Best Performing Commands to motivate officers and men on the field.\n\n\u201cRecently, the agency promoted 3, 506 officers who have stagnated in the past years, some for upward of 10, 15 and even 20 years on one rank. One person actually stayed 21 years on one rank.\n\n\u201cMajor administrative steps were taken to restore the visibility of the Agency for local and international partnerships. And in five months, we have made appreciable progress. So far, the image of the Agency has tremendously improved, so much so that today, people are now aware of the existence of the NDLEA unlike before.\n\n\u201cOur interaction with the public has been enhanced and people come freely to volunteer information to us. By the same token, we have been able to attract international support that has yielded donations of operational equipment, technical assistance, training and pledges of support by the UNODC, EU, US, UK, French, Indian and German governments and others.\n\n\u201cExpectedly, our painstaking and strategic operational efforts have translated into encouraging results. The Agency\u2019s offensive action against drug cartels across the country launched some five months ago, has yielded over 2,180 arrests of drug traffickers and the seizure of over 2 million kilograms of assorted illicit drugs. We have filed at least 2,100 drug cases in court, recording over 500 convictions with 1,549 cases pending in court.\n\n\u201cThese results have given us big insights into the magnitude of the drug problem. The work ahead is enormous. NDLEA cannot win the drug war without the help of citizens. We need the cooperation of all and sundry. We all owe Nigeria the duty of ensuring that drug abuse and trafficking do not thrive in this country. For us all, it is an urgent assignment, because if we must end youth radicalization, violent extremism, cultism, banditry, wanton kidnapping, insurgency and the like, drug abuse and trafficking must be dealt a decisive blow.\n\n\u201cTo win the drug war, NDLEA must synergize with other law enforcement and sister agencies and stakeholders for maximum impact. The simplest contribution that we ask of every patriotic citizen is what is captured by the theme of this year\u2019s International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking: \u201cShare Facts on Drugs, Save Lives.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nBy Soni Daniel\n\nThe Nigerian Guild of Editors, NGE, has rejected the bid by a member of the House of Representatives, Odebunmi Olusegun, to amend the law establishing the Nigerian Press Council, NPC, and the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC.\n\nThey said the envisaged amendments would kill free press in Nigeria and render journalists captives in the land.\n\nThe Guild, in a statement by the President, Mr. Mustapha Isah and General Secretary, Iyobosa Uwugiaren, yesterday, described both the NPO and NBC amendment bills as draconian, given the provisions inserted into them by the sponsor of the bills Odebunmi Olusegun, a member of the House of Representatives from Oyo State, who is neither a journalist nor a social scientist.\n\nThe Guild argued that while the sponsors of the bills claimed that the amendments were geared towards moderating the \u2018recklessness of the media, the bills are actually criminalising journalism practice in the country.\n\nThe body of editors argued that the media, which serve as the \u2018oxygen of democracy\u2019 would be strangulated if the bills are passed into law.\n\n\u201cAt a time there is a popular ongoing global conversation about the need for a #NewDealForJournalism\u201d, for immediate and sustained action from, and collaboration between governments and other influential actors to improve the policy, funding, and enabling environment for independent professional journalism, we see the proposed laws as unhelpful.\n\n\u201cWhile we are not opposed to an Act that will promote media stakeholders-driven regulatory council, the many draconian provisions in the Odebunmi Olusegun-sponsored bills are actually aimed at criminalising media practice in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhile the intention of the sponsor of the bills is suspicious, the bills negate all known features of media regulatory bodies in the world,\u2019\u2019 the Guild said.\n\nIt contended that while the NPC Act CAP N128, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1992, created by the military dictatorship gave the Council board full responsibility to administer the council, the proposed Act restricts the council board to \u2018\u2019advisory capacity on a part-time basis without direct interference in the day to day administration of the council\u201d, and gives the Executive Secretary all the powers.\n\nThe Guild stated further that \u201cWhile the proposed NPC Act says the Board shall consist of one representative each from the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ); Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE); Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN); Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria (BON); Ministry of Information; two representatives of the general public, one of whom shall be a legal practitioner and a woman and Executive Secretary of the council, who shall serve as the secretary to the Board, the board is a mere advisory body.\n\n\u201cThe Bill also says that the Chairman of the Board shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Minister in charge of Information.\n\n\u201cAnd that all other members of the Board shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation by the Minister of Information. The intention of this kind of Council is suspicious.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe body of editors is of the view that the professional body doesn\u2019t need the approval of the Minister of Information to establish and disseminate a National Press Code and standards to guide the conduct of print media, related media houses and media practitioners and approves penalties and fines against violation of the press code, as provided for in the bill.\n\n\u201cThe Guild is not aware of any media regulatory council in the world, which says media regulatory council shall establish a National Press and Ethical Code of Conduct for media houses and media practitioners, which shall come into effect and be disseminated after approval by the Minister of Information, and that the code shall be binding on every media houses and journalists.\n\n\u201cAgain, apart from the fines for journalists or media houses that violate the Act, the bill also says that in an extreme case, the council shall order the striking out of the name of the journalist from the register;\n\n\u201cAnd suspend the person from practice by ordering him not to engage in practice as a journalist for a period not exceeding six months; as may be specified in the directive.\n\n\u201cThis kind of media regulatory council will neither serve the interest of the media industry, strengthen its constitutional role of holding public officers accountable to the people nor serve the general interest of the public, who are the original trustees of the media,\u201d the Guild explained.\n\nThe NGE noted that in the proposed NPC legislation, the sponsor mischievously smuggled in the controversial \u2018\u2019fake news\u201d provision, stating that any person who carried news established to be fake thereafter, committed an offence;\n\n\u201cAnd was liable on conviction to a fine of N5 million or a term of two-year imprisonment or both, as well as a compensation of N2 million payable to the person(s), group(s), corporate bodies, government or any of its agencies whom the news was carried against.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NGE, the bill also states that any print media house whose m edium is used to carry such news is liable on conviction to a fine of N10million or closure of such media house for a period of one year or both;\n\n\u201cAnd compensation of N20 million to the person, group, corporate body, government or any of its agencies, whom the news was carried against.\u201d\n\nOn the proposed NBC amendment legislation, the Guild said Section 23 of the bill which gave the Minister of Information powers to participate in the making of regulations, was unhelpful, saying the participation of the minister will turn NBC into a tool for political interference.\n\nThe Guild noted that the provisions of the two bills gave the impression that the Federal Government was out to crush its enemy, insisting that the media was not an enemy of the state.\n\nThe NGE added that the two bills if passed, would compound the nation\u2019s negative image in the global community.\n\n\u201cNigeria comes in at No. 120, the rough equivalent of a D+ in this year\u2019s index by Reporters Without Borders.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find similar results on the Democracy Index where Nigeria is ranked No. 110\u2014 the lowest-ranking Hybrid Regime, one slot away from Authoritarianism,\u2019\u2019 the NGE said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Abia is among states in the southeast geographical zone of Nigeria that are being ravaged by the unknown gunmen, with attacks on security formations and federal assets.\n\nThere is no doubt that the heinous attacks by the unknown gunmen in Abia State had so far claimed many lives, particularly that of the security agents.\n\nIt has recorded cases of attacks ranging from burning down of the Police Criminal Investigation Department (CID) office situated at Umuagu Umuahia, Uzuakoli Divisional Police station, Nigerian Immigration Service office, Ubakala and Ubakala Police station in Umuahia South Local government area of the State.\n\nIrked by the serial attacks on its formations across the states of the southeast region, the Nigeria Police High Command had accused the members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the security outfit of the proscribed Indigeneous People of Biafra (IPOB) led by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu of the attack on its facilities. Amid the notion that the Eastern Security Network, ESN, was established to attack security operatives and formations, Kanu insisted that the group had not been involved in any criminal activity.\n\nAbia: Panic as gunmen strike in Umuahia\n\nRecall that Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, on December 13, launched the ESN security outfit due to the rising insecurity in the region. According to Kanu, ESN was established to defend the people of the Eastern region from terrorists and bandits allegedly trooping in from the North. He further insisted that the ESN was only established against herdsmen militias. According to him, operatives of the security outfit are too disciplined to be involved in criminal activities.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have said it before but let me say it again that the Eastern Security Network I command is strictly organized to deal with terrorist herdsmen in our land. ESN is a highly disciplined group of volunteers that do not engage in any act of criminality or terror\u201d.\n\nPeeved by the activities of the unknown gunmen, which had taken dangerous dimension in the state, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu imposed curfew in major cities of Abia State as part of his government\u2019s proactive measures to curtail further attacks on security personnel by the yet to be known armed men. Ikpeazu vowed to make Abia unsafe for criminal elements, warning criminal elements to desist from acts capable of truncating the peace and security of the state. He described it as a whirlwind that will blow no one good.\n\nFollowing the spate of attacks by the unknown gunmen, residents of the Abia state were thrown into fear, with many deserting and scampering from being hit by stray bullets as a result of the confrontation between men of Nigeria security agencies and the dreaded gunmen. However, a critical assessment of the general security situation in Abia state as carried out by DAILY POST on Tuesday, showed that normalcy had returned to the state as residents have continued to attend their businesses in parts of the State.\n\nBut, as part of its measures to curb the dastardly acts of the unknown gunmen on its facilities, the Abia State Police Command has restricted the movement of vehicles around its formations in Umuahia and Aba. A tour embarked upon by our correspondent revealed that there was blockage of a lane of the dualized Bende Road in Umuahia capital city where the headquarters of the State Police Command and Central Police Station are situated. Also, a lane of the dualized Aba road in Umuahia town where the main offices of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS) are situated were equally blocked to forestall further attacks on security facilities and federal assets in the state by yet-to-be-identified gunmen.\n\nAbia\u2019s unknown gunmen: Attacks linked to destruction of Kanu\u2019s family house, arrest of IPOB members\n\nIn Aba, DAILY POST gathered that normalcy has equally returned after police stopped some hoodlums who planned to carry out mob action on personnel in the city.\n\nAba is one of Nigeria\u2019s commercial hubs after Lagos and Onitsha.\n\nIn response to the wicked attacks on police formations by the unknown gunmen in Aba, our correspondent gathered that the State Police Command blocked all the access roads to the Central Police Station (CPS) as a precautionary measure to repel any attack. Aside from the blockage of the access roads to the Central Police Station (CPS) at Azikiwe Road in Aba, different teams of security agencies ranging from the police, army and Defence Corps were seen battle ready, patrolling the major streets of the commercial nerve centre (Aba).\n\nThe security agencies were equally spotted manning different strategic locations within and outside Aba, ensuring the safety of lives and properties of the residents and visitors to the commercial city.\n\nMeanwhile, DAILY POST trip to the cities of Umuahia and Aba revealed that residents are crying out on alleged harassment by men of the Nigeria security agencies manning the areas.\n\nThe Abia residents were also dissatisfied with the rules of engagement of the security agents in quelling the violent and criminal attacks in the state.\n\nThey cried out that the men in khaki uniform, whose responsibility is to secure lives and properties had resorted to unwholesome acts whereby the residents of Umuahia and Aba are being made to raise their hands at every security checkpoints while walking on the roads. Another unwholesome act of the security operatives as claimed by the residents of the areas included beating of young persons, especially the boys with plated dreadlock hairs. They are either being made to swim flooded dirty water on the roadside or beaten mercilessly, and later would allow the victim to go home in severe pain.\n\nIn a chat with DAILY POST on Tuesday, an Aba resident, David Nwaogboso decried the unbearable inhuman treatments being meted to the innocent populace in the town by the security agents under the guise of hunting hoodlums ravaging Abia.\n\nNwaogboso stated that the security operatives had abandoned their main objective of securing the citizenry from internal and external attacks, urging the government and heads of security agencies to review the mode of operations of their personnel in the current fight against unknown gunmen attacks.\n\nOn his part, Samuel Aguiyi, a quantity surveyor and resident of Umuahia capital city, lamented that the unholy activities of some disgruntled security agents had left many in fears as the security officers had deliberately resorted to manhandling innocent people on a mere and false suspicion of being criminals.\n\nHe called on the government at all levels to map out a well defined and everlasting template on which her security agencies should rely upon in achieving an end to the myriads of challenges emanating from unknown gunmen attacks in Abia, southeast and the country as a whole.\n\nMr. Aguiyi further used the medium in calling on aggrieved parties and separatist agitators, including the gunmen ravaging the state and southeast to sheathe their swords and embrace dialogue for a peaceful resolution in the overall interests of the people and Nigeria.\n\nAmid the earlier outbursts by the Nigerian government and her security agencies accusing the proscribed Indigeneous People of Biafra led by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu of instigating the attacks on security formations and federal assets in the southeast region, our correspondent who visited Afaraukwu Ibeku clan, the hometown of the IPOB Leader situated in Umuahia North LGA, gathered that there was total calm in and outside Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s residence in Afaraukwu community, as people were seen going about their various businesses without harassment by the security forces who have been on the trail of members of IPOB-backed Eastern Security Network ESN.\n\nIn the same development, the Commissioner of Information in Abia State, Chief John Okiyi Kalu has reiterated the total commitment of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu led administration on the security of lives and property of the citizens of the State.\n\nOkiyi Kalu maintained that the state government had already taken efficient and drastic steps, which included imposition of curfew in major cities of Abia, and as well as provision of necessary logistics to the security agencies in the State to combat the disastrous menace of the unknown armed men.\n\nThe Information Commissioner, who spoke during a private radio interactive programme monitored by DAILY POST on Monday, in Umuahia, warned criminal elements to desist from such arsonist acts or leave the State, as the government and its security agents were determined and on ground to make Abia unsafe haven for bandits, kidnappers, killer herdsmen and unknown gunmen causing havoc in the State and the southeast as a whole.",

There is no local government you will go without seeing them (the government) doing one road or the other.\n\n\u201cWhat they are saying is that we should hold on about our constituency projects. We understand. But the truth of the matter is that no honourable member; apart from our salaries and allowances, in the last two years, has gotten anything,\u201d Oluomo stated emphatically.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the legislators, while marking their second anniversary Tuesday, made a unanimous call for the implementation of more infrastructural projects, especially road construction and rehabilitation in their respective constituencies.\n\nThey appealed to Abiodun to release their constituency project allowances to enable them implement projects to complement the existing infrastructure put in place by the State Government in their constituencies.",

          "text": "By John Ofikhenua, Abuja\n\nThe Abuja Electricity Distribution Companies (AEDC) has began the implementation of its N75 billion five years Performance Improvement Plan (PIP).\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s Head, Corporate Communications, Mr. Oyebode Fadipe, the firm plan is to spend an average of N15 billion per annum.\n\nHe revealed that for the first year, the AEDC will spend N17billion as follows: N5.9 billion on customers\u2019 meters and N11.9 billion on equipment.\n\nFadipe said: \u201cWe have commenced. There are preliminary things to be done and one of them is to engage in procurement process which we have started.\n\n\u201cThe PIP is a five year plan. It is expected to take off at N75 billion. So, it is almost about N15 billion per year. We are doing N17billion for the first year. Of that amount, N5.9 billion is going for customers\u2019 meters. N11.5 billion is going for various plants equipment and systems\u201d.\n\nHe explained that essentially, the plan is a strategic plan to transform the business for a period of five years.\n\nAsked how it is tied to tariff rate or has it resulted in tariff adjustment, he said: \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, there is no issue of tariff adjustment irrespective of the plan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThat is not the issue now. The issue is this, it is a five year plan.

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Godwin Tsa and Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government and the House of Representatives clashed yesterday over the suspension of Twitter.\n\nOn June 4, government banned Twitter after the microblogging site pulled down a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIn reaction, the House mandated its Committees on Information, Communication and Justice to investigate the legal backing for government\u2019s action.\n\nAt the resume hearing yesterday, government said it suspended operations of the micro-blogging and social networking site in line with the Terrorism Act 2011 and other extant laws.\n\nMinister of Information and Orientation, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who appeared before the lawmakers, alongside the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) and the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), insisted that the suspension had nothing to do with the pulling down of Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nHe also read the riot act to Facebook and other social media operators saying government would not hesitate to wield the big stick if they crossed the red line.\n\n\u201cWe suspended Twitter because Twitter became a platform of choice for those that want to bring down this country. If any other platform does it, we will suspend their operations too. It is because there is a country called Nigeria that they have business here. Social media is a menace everywhere in the world. We believe that the best way to start is regulating them.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIncidentally, the Twitter suspension is indefinite; it\u2019s not banned. The doors are not closed. We are willing to speak to Twitter. Twitter has written a letter seeking for government dialogue and just today, I did issue a statement which I announced the government\u2019s team that is ready to meet Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhen I leave here, I intend see whether we can have a preliminary meeting of that committee. We hope that the committee will be able to meet first and that the committee would have a good dialogue with Twitter. But like we said, there are two basic things that Twitter or any OTT or social media needs to do: they must first be registered as a Nigerian company after which they will apply for license. Other conditions will come up as we go along.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the minister had said that the Federal Government has said that it suspended the operations of micro-blogging and social networking site, Twitter, in the country in line with the Terrorism Act 2011 and other extant laws.\n\n\u201cIf you look at section 3 of the National Security Act which cloth the State Security Service with the powers to preserve the internal security of Nigerians, it is very instructive that any platform that threatens the internal security of Nigeria will not be allowed to operate.\n\n\u201cThis is a case where the Federal Government deemed it necessary that the activities of twitter in Nigeria in particular is inimical to stability in the country.\n\n\u201cThe right to freedom of expression on the Twitter platform is further qualified by section 45 of the constitution in light to the provisions of section 5 (1) and (2) of the Terrorism Act 2011 which states that any person who knowingly, in any manner directly or indirectly solicits or render support or the commission of an act of terrorism or to a terrorist group commits an offence under this act.\n\n\u201cWe all know that IPOB is proscribed by a High Court in Nigeria and yet, twitter is the platform of choice through which IPOB direct its people to kill soldiers, kill policemen and burn public institutions.\n\n\u201cSo, it is clear that Twitter operations in Nigeria is inimical to our growth, both in common law and national security and so, we had to suspend their operations.\u201d\n\nHowever, a member of the joint committee, Shaba Ibrahim, said while he agreed that everything pales into insignificance when national interest and security is at stake, government\u2019s action smacked of incipient totalitarianism.\n\n\u201cWe are at the mercy of people who handle social media irresponsibly. All it took to wake to that responsibility was for Twitter to bring down Mr President\u2019s tweet. With all due respect sir, I don\u2019t think that was good enough.\n\n\u201cI agree that no right is in absolute terms. But again, we must mind the timing of it so that proactive actions are taken to nip these things in the bud, because what you have done whether you like it or not looks like symptoms of emerging totalitarianism.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the court of the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) has restrained President Buhari and agents of the Federal Government from unlawfully imposing sanctions or doing anything whatsoever to harass, intimidate, arrest or prosecute Twitter and other social media service providers, media houses, radio and television broadcast stations and other Nigerians who are Twitter users, pending the hearing and determination of the suit.\n\nThe ruling of the court was predicated on the suit filed against the government by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians where they argued that \u201cthe unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, criminalisation of Nigerians and other people using Twitter have escalated repression of human rights and unlawfully restricted the rights of Nigerians and other people to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom in the country.\u201d\n\nThe court gave the order after hearing arguments from Solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana (SAN) and lawyer to the government Maimuna Shiru.\n\nLai, Pantami make govt\u2019s reconciliation team\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved a Federal Government\u2019s team to engage with Twitter over the suspension of its operations in the country.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the composition of the team in a statement in Abuja by Segun Adeyemi, special assistant to the President on Media, office of the Minister of Information and Culture.\n\nThe team which is chaired by Mohammed the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama; Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola and Minister of State, Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, and representatives of relevant government agencies as members.\n\n\u201cFollowing the indefinite suspension of its operations in Nigeria, for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence, Twitter wrote to President Buhari seeking to engage with the Federal Government over the suspension, with a view to charting a path forward,\u201d the statement read.",

We are already witnessing positive outcomes from our investment in the safety and viability of our waterways as a safe alternative to road transportation.\n\n\u201cIn the last one year, LAGFERRY has moved over 500,000 passengers across our waterways, including the Super Eagles, who were successfully ferried to and from Benin Republic for their AFCON qualifying match. In addition to commuting people, it is heartwarming to know that LAGFERRY promotes tourism and commerce by providing logistics solutions to business owners who move their trucks and cargoes through the waterways within Apapa and through regular charter services.\n\nSanwo-Olu also urged the private sector to invest in water transportation, saying the economic potential is limitless.\n\n\u201cI assure you that we will continue to support private sector participation in water transportation by putting in place the most appropriate regulatory framework for high returns on investment.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the state was building and rehabilitating 15 jetties and dredging the waterways to open up more jetties for public use.\n\n\u201cOur administration will continue to prioritise absolute safety on our waterways by ensuring total compliance with safety protocols and\n\nregulations including regular use of life jackets by both operators and passengers, conducting seaworthiness inspections bi-annually, and removing wrecks from navigable channels. We will not relent in doing our best for Lagosians and making their daily commute safe and less stressful. We have concluded plans to boost our water transportation safety measures and protocols with the deployment and installation of technological devices for improved navigation, the development of nautical charts and the purchase of state-of-the-art patrol boats and safety equipment to upgrade LASWA\u2019s SAR unit.\u201d\n\nManaging Director of LAGFERRY, Abdoulbaq Ladi-Balogun, said the seven new boats brings the total number of boats to 20 running concurrent commercial operations.\n\n\u201cWe boast of an impressive safety record as we can proudly tell you that we have never recorded any accident since the agency started commercial operations on February 6, 2020.\u201d",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nA High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has sentenced former chairman of the House of Representatives\u2019 probe panel, Farouk Lawal, to seven years imprisonment for demanding a $3 million bribe from an oil magnate, Femi Otedola.\n\nJustice Angela Otaluka, in her judgment, yesterday, convicted the ex-lawmaker on all three count charges the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) preferred against him.\n\nLawan was the chairman of the committee probing the multi-billion naira fuel subsidy fraud in 2012.\n\nHe was accused of demanding $3 million from Femi Otedola to remove Zenon Petroleum and Gas Limited (Otedola\u2019s company) from the list of oil companies allegedly involved in the fuel subsidy fraud in 2012.\n\nThe ex-lawmaker was alleged to have collected a $500,000 bribe from Otedola. The charge was later amended to three counts.\n\nOtedola, while giving evidence as the fifth prosecution witness, said the defendant demanded $3 million from him with a threat to indict his company.\n\nThe businessman said he proceeded to report the issue to the Department of State Services (DSS) and was given $500,000 in marked notes. Also, the DSS had planted a camera in Otedola\u2019s house.\n\nEarlier, Justice Otaluka dismissed the preliminary objection filed by Farouk Lawan against his trial to set the stage for his conviction.\n\nDismissing his preliminary objection to trial, yesterday, Ms Otaluka said the argument of the defence lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, that Mr Lawan was not a public officer going by the Section 2 of the ICPC Act was untenable.\n\nThe judge held that a public officer is anyone who occupies a public office and who is remunerated with public funds as against Mr Ozekhome\u2019s argument that Mr Lawan was a \u201cmere political office holders.\u201d\n\nJustice Otaluka held that Lawan acted in breach of section 17 (1) (a), section 8(1) (a) (b) (ii), and section 23 (i) of the Corrupt practices and other Related Offences Act, 2000, and committed an offence punishable under section 8 (1) 17 (1) and 23(3) of the same Act.\n\nThe court said it was satisfied that the ICPC successfully established a criminal case against the defendant.\n\nWhereas the defendant was handed seven years jail term on counts one and two of the charge, the court sentenced him to five years on count three.\n\nJustice Otaluka held that the sentence would run concurrently. Lawan was the chairman of an ad hoc committee set up by the House in 2012 to investigate massive petrol subsidy fraud.",

          "text": "\u2022Calls for equity in distribution of key political posts\n\n\u2022Seeks incorporation of security chiefs\u2019 positions in FCC document\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan yesterday attributed Nigeria\u2019s failure to properly manage its diversity and continuing inability to give ethnic and religious minorities their proper place in the country as part of the reasons for disenchantment in the polity.\n\nThe former president, in his address at the 13th Joe-Kyari Gadzama Public Lecture said aside from the South-west, no other area in the country has been able to balance religion and development.\n\n\u201cThat is the only part of Nigeria where we feel has been able to manage religion and development very well. So, we must look at our own unique circumstances and come up with the right form of government,\u201d he said.\n\nHis address during the event, which held both virtually and physically in Abuja, was titled: \u201cRedefining Democracy: Yearnings of the Minority in a Democratic Setting.\u201d\n\nJonathan stated that he decided to honour the invitation to speak on the state of the nation, despite the likely misinterpretation of his treatise, out of his respect for the host, Mr. Joe-Kyari Gadzama (SAN), and because a society that does not respect the rule of law would breed anarchy where life becomes nasty, brutish and short, making real progress difficult.\n\nAccording to him, in Nigeria, the complications associated with the marginalisation of minority groups and tribes were identified many years ago and efforts have been made across generations to solve the problems, including the Willinks Commission set up during the colonial era.\n\nHe added that although the Federal Character Commission (FCC) is a product of such efforts, it has not fully rectified the anomalies, having been tailored to deal with mainly the civil service.\n\nJonathan said: \u201cThe Federal Character Commission over many decades may have been doing its best to give everyone fair representation and a fair sense of belonging, but there are still many who feel that this agency of government has not fully addressed the challenges of accommodating minorities.\n\n\u201cThis is because it has managed to pursue with varying degrees of success emphasis on the civil service. However, many are of the opinion that it does not really go far enough, since it currently does not address inequalities in political appointments into sensitive areas such as the military and public sector appointments.\u201d\n\nHe stated that Nigeria now faces the challenge of managing diversity and minority interests, and even in the parliament, it has been struggling with the task of accommodating disadvantaged groups like women and people with disability.\n\nHe traced the country\u2019s problems to its foundation, saying that the growing dissent cannot be divorced from the country\u2019s failure to manage its differences and play down on its fault lines.\n\n\u201cFrom the independence and post-independence crisis, the coups and the counter-coups and the different republics to date, the swelling disenchantment is the fallout of our inability to manage our diversity and downplay our differences. It is obvious that calls for fragmentation seem to be getting louder among some segments of our nation.\n\n\u201cThis is because we have not been able to positively harness and harmonise our enviable size and the ingenuity of our people and project our greatness,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut beyond the grandstanding from some quarters, the former president stated that Nigeria needs to unite and face the problems that have been holding it down, further pinning it down to \u201ca failure to properly manage our diversity and harness our potential.\u201d\n\nFor a multi-ethnic country to make progress, Jonathan said that there must be a conscious effort to give a democratic sense of fairness, equity and justice and guarantee minority groups access to the political space.\n\nHe added that the refrain that Nigeria is potentially great was going out of tune, as the younger people had begun to query whether Nigeria will ever operate within its full capacity.\n\n\u201cBy now, we should be running an advanced economy and the social system and standard services that support that economy just like other nations like Singapore or Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates who share the same political and economic evolution with us. However, we are lagging behind so far away from them.\n\n\u201cThe stories of these countries clearly confirm that the journey to the transformation of a nation does not take a lifetime. That Nigeria still remains potentially great after over 60 years of independence shows that there are fundamental lessons in the political evolution of our nation that we have not really learnt,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, although there is a school of thought which blames the country\u2019s colonial experience for its seeming backwardness, while the proposition may have some element of truth, Nigeria was not the only country that was colonised.\n\nHe said a second school of thought blamed the huge size of the nation, describing it as the dilemma of the whale, which is feared for its weight, and yet dies by its weight.\n\nHe added: \u201cI share the sentiments of many political commentators that at the crux of our challenge of national transformation is the problem of our political and governance structures and the inability to harness our diversity towards shared prosperity.\n\n\u201cI believe that from independence, the political evolution of leadership in Nigeria has been too concentrated along tribal and religious lines and that is still haunting us today.\u201d\n\nHe said it was the reason he conveyed a national conference in 2014 which sought to look at the political leadership structure, saying that the nation is currently trapped in the dilemma of an \u201cimperceptible giant\u201d that needs to work harder to realise it\u2019s destiny.\n\nHe said what many countries might be doing better than Nigeria was that they had developed systems and institutions that ensured that the political recruitment process offered a space for all, including the minorities.\n\n\u201cWhere the minority feels that they are not relevant, there\u2019s always the tendency to fulfil their destiny with a different approach. This is the beginning of the unending agitations and resistance movements across the world,\u201d he added.\n\nHe decried the winner-takes-all approach to politics, stressing that enough space must be created for those who may be at a disadvantage, a situation that has fuelled the practice of cross-carpeting in the country because there\u2019s usually nothing for the loser.\n\nHe also stated that bestowing maximum powers on one individual may not be the right form of government.\n\nAccording to Jonathan, the inequity in the polity runs from the federal to states to local governments and even in wards where certain minorities can never dream of becoming top leaders because of their areas of origin.\n\n\u201cLooking to the future, I can say that our leaders can do a lot more to eliminate ethnic sentiments in our society, enthrone merit and build a system that gives citizens equal opportunities to excel.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a united, strong and cohesive Nigerian nation of patriotic citizens for any structure or system to yield the promise of our shared prosperity,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, Gadzama, who praised Jonathan for averting bloodshed by handing over peacefully to his successor had said that in every democracy, majority rule was endorsed and guided by the constitution, which also protects the rights of the minorities.\n\nHe stated that the participation of persons belonging to the minority in public affairs and in all aspects of the political are essential to preserving their identity as a minority.\n\nHe added that democracy is likely to develop and endure when all members of society are free to participate and influence political outcomes.\n\nAside from Jonathan, other dignitaries at the event included the National President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Mr. Olumide Akpata; Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Alhaji Mohammed Bello; Chairman, House Committee on Judiciary, Mr. Onofiok Luke, former Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Mohammed Adoke (SAN) and members of the diplomatic corps.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022ECOWAS Court restrains FG from prosecuting users\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan, Adedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday kick-started the process of resolving its dispute that led to the suspension of the operations of the microblogging platform, Twitter, in Nigeria, with President Muhammadu Buhari raising a team to negotiate with the United States-based company.\n\nThe team, comprising cabinet members, will be led by Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed.\n\nAccording to a statement yesterday by the Special Assistant to the President (Media), Office of the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Segun Adeyemi, the Attorney-General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN); the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami; the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama; the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola (SAN), and the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr. Festus Keyamo (SAN), will join Mohammed in the talks.\n\nThe engagement followed a letter from Twitter informing the federal government of its readiness for talks following the suspension of its operations on June 5 for deleting the president\u2019s tweet, warning the Igbo of a potential repeat of the civil war that might result from the escalation in insurgency traced to the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nBesides, the federal government accused Twitter of being part of a plot to destabilise Nigeria for allegedly funding and promoting last October\u2019s #EndSARS protests, that Buhari considered an agenda to oust him from power, and for condoning Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Leader, Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, tweets inciting attacks on security personnel in the South-east.\n\nAlso yesterday, the federal government, again, defended the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in the country, saying it was done under the National Security Act, Terrorism Prevention Act, Cyber Space Act and Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA).\n\nHowever, Twitter users got a legal cover to continue tweeting, despite the federal government\u2019s threat to prosecute violators of the ban on using the platform, as the ECOWAS Court of Justice in Abuja restrained the federal government from imposing sanctions, or doing anything whatsoever to arrest or prosecute any Nigerian and media houses using Twitter, pending the hearing and determination of a suit before it.\n\nAgain, FG Defends Suspension, Says Freedom of Expression Not Absolute\n\nThe federal government has again justified the suspension of the operations of Twitter in Nigeria, insisting that the freedom of expression is not absolute.\n\nMohammed, who appeared before the House of Representatives Joint Investigative Committee on Twitter Suspension, yesterday told the lawmakers that the federal government suspended the operations of micro-blogging platform, under the National Security Act, Terrorism Prevention Act, Cyber Space Act and Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA).\n\nHe referred to the provisions of Section 45 of the 1999 Constitution as altered, which he said left no one in doubt that the provisions of Section 39 of the constitution on freedom of expression was not absolute.\n\nAccording to him, the right to free expression within the contemplation of Section 39 makes it a qualified right in light of the aforementioned Section 45, which allows restrictions of civil liberties in the public interest.\n\nRelying on Section 45 (1) of the 1999 Constitution, he said: \u201c45 (1) Nothing in Sections 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41 of this Constitution shall invalidate any law that is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society: (a) in the interest of defence, public safety, public order, public morality or public health or; (b), the purpose of protecting the rights and freedom of other person.\u201d\n\nThe minister also justified the Twitter ban by relying on Section 3 of the National Security Act.\n\nHe quoted the section as charging the State Security Service with the duty to preserve the nation\u2019s internal security and prevent and detect within its borders any crime against its internal security.\n\nHe stated that the ban of Twitter was pursuant to security reports of the SSS.\n\nMohammed added: \u201cFurthermore, the right to freedom of expression on the Twitter platform is further qualified by Section 45 of the constitution in light of the provisions of Section 5(1) and (2) of the Terrorism Act of 2011. For clarity, the section reads:\n\n\u201cAny person who knowingly in any manner directly or indirectly solicits or renders support for the commission of an act of terrorism; or to a terrorist group, commits an offence under this Act and is liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term of not less than 20 years.\u201d\n\nHe interpreted the \u201csupport\u201d in the sub-section 1 to include incitement to commit a terrorist act through the internet or any electronic means or through the use of printed materials or through the dissemination of terrorist information.\n\nHe added that Section 14(2)(b) of the Constitution provides that the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of the government.\n\nMohammed stated that from the purview of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020, as it regulates the operations of a foreign company in Nigeria, Twitter is not licensed to do business in the country.\n\nAccording to him, having failed to register as a separate entity in Nigeria, as required by Section 78 (1) of CAMA Act 2020, Twitter cannot do business in the country or exercise any powers of a registered company.\n\nMohammed said the operations of Twitter in the Nigerian social space was not legally permissible when it was used in airing information that endangered the lives and security of the majority of Nigerians.\n\nHe said the principles of the law were clear on the exercise of personal human rights in the face of national security threats affecting the larger citizens.\n\nThe minister added that provisions in Articles 24, 25 of the African Union on Cyber Security and Personal Protection, Article 19 (2) and (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as Section 1,2, 3 and 4 of the Cyber Crimes Prevention Act provide the requisite legal backing for the federal government to regulate and protect the country\u2019s cyberspace, including social media such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram as well as applications, internet platforms, and cloud computing platforms.\n\n\u201cFollowing the above, the Federal Government of Nigeria is further empowered to take all reasonable steps to defend its cyberspace where it perceives or finds that a cybercrime is threatened to be committed, has been committed, or is being committed on and through its cyberspace,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister, however, dismissed claims that the operations of Twitter were suspended because it pulled down Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to make two clarifications. The first is that we did not ban Twitter; we simply suspended indefinitely the activities of Twitter. The second is that we did not suspend the activities of Twitter because they deleted Mr. President\u2019s tweet. Not at all. We are very unambiguous on why we suspended Twitter.\u201d\n\nAsked if the federal government took into consideration Nigerians doing business on Twitter, the minister stated that it is because there is a country called Nigeria that people can do business on any platform.\n\nAsked why the federal government waited for the president\u2019s tweet to be deleted before the suspension even though the government knew all along that IPOB has been using the Twitter platform, Mohammed spoke of the federal government\u2019s efforts to rid Nigeria of fake news and disinformation, which started in 2017.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen we organised a national council on information in Jos, Plateau State, to address the issue of fake news and disinformation, there we said that the next war would be caused by fake news.\n\nHow prophetic we were! In 2018, we started an advocacy programme whereby we went from one media house to the other, seeking their support in weeding out fake news. Some supported us, some did not. When we were convinced that they were not going to listen, we said that we were going to regulate social media. We wrote to the NUJ; we wrote to the Guild of Editors. They snubbed us.\u201d\n\nECOWAS Court Stops FG from Prosecuting Twitter Users\n\nMeanwhile, the ECOWAS Court of Justice in Abuja has restrained the federal government from imposing sanctions, or doing anything whatsoever to arrest or prosecute any Nigerian and media houses using Twitter, pending the hearing and determination of a suit before it.\n\nThe court gave the order after hearing arguments from solicitor to Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), and lawyer to the government, Mr. Maimuna Shiru, following a suit filed on June 8 against the government by SERAP and 176 concerned Nigerians.\n\nThe court said: \u201cThe court has listened very well to the objection by Nigeria.

          "text": "\u2022Extra expenditure to cover COVlD-19 vaccine programme, procurement of military equipment\n\nDeji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has transmitted a 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill of N895.842 billion to the Senate for passage into law.\n\nThe Federal Executive Council (FEC) at its virtual meeting last Wednesday in Abuja had approved the supplementary appropriation bill for onward transmission to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe bill was transmitted via a letter dated 15th June 2021, and addressed to the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan.\n\nBuhari, in the letter which was read yesterday at plenary said the amount captured in the bill was proposed to fund the COVID-19 vaccine programme.\n\nHe added that part of the supplementary budget would be used to also fund health-related expenditures for the treatment of additional 50,000 patients under Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Programme in states and to procure additional equipment to tackle security challenges nationwide.\n\nAccording to the president, the supplementary budget will be funded through facilities sourced from the World Bank and available new facilities.\n\nBuhari said the supplementary budget was promoted by the need to make provision for procurement and administration of COVlD-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe availability of COVlD-19 vaccines and the procurement terms were still uncertain as at the time of finalising the 2021 budget. Hence, there was no provision in the 2021 Appropriation Act for the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) has now developed a COVID-19 vaccine programme for the country. Under the vaccine programme, 70% of eligible Nigerians are to be vaccinated between 2021 and 2022.\n\n\u201cIn addition, our security and law enforcement agencies urgently need to procure additional equipment and other resources in response to the prevalent security challenges across the country.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Defence has carefully scrutinised these procurement needs, which the military authorities claim to represent the minimum requirements to secure our country and address current external and internal security challenges,\u201d he added.\n\nPart of the funds required will also be used to meet the federal government\u2019s commitment to treat additional 50,000 patients under the Nigeria Comprehensive AIDS Programme in States (NCAPS), due to the reduction in the amount provisioned in 2021 Appropriation Bill by the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIn order to address the urgent problem of oxygen availability in the country and avoid the potential loss of lives, provision was made for the procurement and installation of new oxygen plants nationwide and repairs of oxygen plants in FCT hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt is also necessary to provide additional funds for public service wage adjustment to cater for sundry wage-related issues in the health and other sectors, which if not resolved can add to the prevalent sense of instability in the polity,\u201d Buhari stated.\n\nOf the N895,842,465,917 proposed, N45.63 billion is for the COVlD-19 vaccine programme, which will be sourced from existing World Bank loans and other grants totalling US$113.22 million.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cThe balance of N37.93 billion required for COVlD-19 vaccines, salaries and other health-related expenditures totalling N41.69 billion and the N48.20 billion recurrent components of defence/security expenditure will be funded by drawing N135 billion from some Special Reserve/Levy Accounts, which will be captured as revenues to the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN).\n\n\u201cWe propose to fund the balance of N722.40 billion for capital expenditure on defence/security and capital supplementation from new borrowings, in the absence of any supplementary revenue sources.\n\n\u201cUnderstandably, needs currently abound in many other sectors. However, we have limited the supplementary budget proposal to just these critical and emerging areas of need due to our severe fiscal constraints.\n\n\u201cAll other needs would be deferred to the 2022 budget, which we plan to present in September of this year.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It is because there is a country called Nigeria that they have business here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think it is a good opportunity for our very resourceful Nigerians to also look at how they can have an app that can replace Twitter, and it would be patronised by all of us. We have received a few approaches and we want to encourage them.\u201d\n\nThe minister said for those whose businesses are affected by the Twitter suspension, there are other social media platforms operating in the country.\n\nHe said the government is open to discussion with Twitter and its suspension may be reversed after meeting the conditions imposed by the government.\n\n\u201cLike I have said, we owe no responsibility to Twitter. It is not registered in Nigeria. It does not employ Nigerians. It does not pay taxes to Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf Nigerians do make money through Twitter, unfortunately, Nigeria has to be a country first before they can make that money. Like I said, there are other platforms available to them. Hopefully, if we are able to resolve this matter quickly, they will resume use of Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe doors are not closed. We are willing to speak to Twitter. Twitter has written a letter seeking for government dialogue and just today, I did issue a statement which I announced the government\u2019s team that is ready to meet Twitter,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen I leave here, I intend to see whether we can have a preliminary meeting of that committee. We hope that the committee will be able to meet first and that the committee would have a good dialogue with Twitter.\n\n\u201cBut like we said, there are two basic things that Twitter or any OTT or social media needs to do \u2014 they must first be registered as a Nigerian company after which they will apply for licence.

Otedola also promised to send the balance of $2.5 million.\n\nAfter collecting the money, he moved a motion during the house of representatives plenary seeking to remove the name of Zenon Oil and Gas from the list.\n\nOtedola would later testify in court that he gave Lawan $500,000 as instructed by the DSS.\n\nBelow is a video of Otedola\u2019s meeting with Lawan, during which the former lawmaker received part of the money:",

          "text": "\u201cPeople order drugs on Jumia?\u201d\n\nThat was the reaction from the most ardent online shopper I know. She buys running shoes, mom jeans and hair products but doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would buy drugs online. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for her to buy ingestible medicines on the same website she shops for underwear.\n\nBut a search under Jumia\u2019s \u2018medications & treatments\u2019 tab reveals syrups, nasal sprays, and pain relief capsules. At the bottom of their healthcare page, a blurb assures visitors that products listed on the website are from \u201cvarious trusted brands that will meet your health needs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, African e-commerce marketplaces are venturing into the delivery of health care products as part of a strategy to broaden their value to customers.\n\nThese platforms are part of a broader crop of innovators at an interesting intersection of healthcare and logistics on the continent. Going by recent data, this sub-sector has grown over two years.\n\nAt least 61 companies are using tech for health distribution across sub-saharan Africa, a growth of over 100% in the number of active players (28) captured in 2018. That\u2019s according to a report by Salient Advisory, an Africa-focused healthcare consultancy.\n\nThese health logistics companies include e-commerce players like Jumia, Copia and Konga, and also core health startups like mPharma, Lifestores Pharmacy, Chekkit and Sproxil. Salient\u2019s report focuses on companies delivering over-the-counter products, hence it does not include LifeBank which specializes in blood and oxygen products.\n\nMost of these companies are in Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda, with only 6 spotted in the francophone region. 31% of the companies surveyed were founded within the last two years and 62% operate in a single African country.\n\nSnapshot of innovators in the health products distribution space in Africa. Source: Salient Advisory.\n\nSalient categorizes the landscape of companies into three groups by the type of service they deliver: consumer-facing companies, producer-facing companies and product data companies.\n\nThe first group of companies (like Drugstore.ng) deliver over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as virtual patient care to individuals. Provider-facing ones serve healthcare businesses either by delivering to them, hosting an online marketplace, providing inventory management tools (an example here is Lifestores Pharmacy) and/or offering financing.\n\nThe third group offers data related services like product analytics and drug authenticity verification. An example in this category is Chekkit, a verification technology startup that was recently accepted into Google for Startups accelerator programme for 2021.\n\nTraditional e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Copia and Konga are able to play in the consumer and provider-facing buckets. Because of their presence in multiple African countries, all three companies surpass the combined reach of other direct-to-consumer startups in the health product distribution space.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing can accelerate access to medicines and have an incredible impact on public health,\u201d says Yomi Kazeem, one of the authors of Salient Advisory\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to Konga\u2019s co-CEO Nick Imudia, the e-commerce company\u2019s plan to deliver health products started shortly after they were acquired by the Zinox Group three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe started building warehouses and logistics assets to enable us to reach every local government area in the country,\u201d Imudia says to TechCabal.\n\nKonga.com is a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies can list health products like medicines. Konga delivers orders from those pharmacies to individual consumers.\n\nBut beyond fulfilling orders to individuals, Konga plans to go bigger by working on bulk orders between pharmacies and businesses or government agencies, Imudia says. That will require some investments on infrastructure for cold distribution and ensuring warehouses are of the right temperature.\n\nSalient Advisory\u2019s report notes that \u201cclear and harmonised regulations\u201d could boost this entry of e-commerce players into the health products distribution space.\n\nKonga has two licenses to directly distribute products for drug manufacturers and import drugs from the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Imudia says. But he clarifies that Konga will not act as a pharmacy by selling drugs directly to consumers \u2013 but will rely on its marketplace platform that allows merchants to sell on Konga.com\n\nHow big can this new business line be for Konga? Imudia declines to share what health products logistics currently contributes to Konga\u2019s overall business. But he believes it will be \u201ca major part\u201d of Konga\u2019s business in the future.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos.

          "title": "How to avoid investment scams in Nigeria",
          "text": "\u201cDo you want to double your money in 10 days?\u201d\n\nInvestment scams tend to start off the same way.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a social media advert or a video of a celebrity telling you that an \u2018investment platform\u2019 made them millionaires overnight.\n\nThey all echo an alarming promise: \u201cgive us your money and we will give you more returns than you\u2019ve ever seen in the market \u2013 oh and did we mention your money is sure to come back to you?\u201d\n\nThese offers always seem too good to be true. And they usually are.\n\nOver the past few weeks, two different scams have been uncovered in Nigeria. Insha-Allahu Investment is the latest of them.\n\nWith a business name that roughly translates to \u2018If God Wills\u2019, the company\u2019s CEO is currently on the run after promising investors up to 20% Return on Investment (ROI) in two months. Many of the investors put in their life savings and in one case, their inheritance in a bid to multiply their money.\n\nInvestment is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires work. The work on your part as the investor is to perform due diligence and ensure your money is going to the right place.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that many more investment scams will continue to spring up. Days after Brisk Capital\u2019s CEO was arrested for fraud, a tweet featuring a popular celebrity made the rounds.\n\nThe power to become a millionaire is in your hands. Start your journey to become a millionaire today by Joining the great @mcivip known as Millionaire Club where you can invest and earn big.\n\n\n\nOfficial website: https://t.co/HMfsRY9aCspic.twitter.com/i0gqGXYzjJ \u2014 Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) May 28, 2021\n\nIn it, the actor claimed that the company, Millionaires Club Investment, would give you 50% ROI (Return on Investment) in 3 days.\n\n\u201cOkay, but how?\u201d\n\nThis is a question that should follow every claim of returns. If a company tells you they plan to give you 30% of your money back in say, a month as Brisk Capital did, it\u2019s important to ask for details of how exactly they plan on making those returns.\n\nI spoke to Adedayo Bakare, COO of Money Africa and Oluwatomi Solanke, CEO of Trove Finance to get an idea of how to gauge if a deal is too good to be true.\n\nThey both agree that there is a relative benchmark to employ when discussing investments in the country \u2013 it\u2019s called the MPR (Monetary Policy Rate) \u2013 it\u2019s usually around the price of most of the government\u2019s debt instruments \u2013 like bonds and treasury bills.\n\nAs of March 2021, the MPR for Nigeria was 11.5% per year. To find out how much that is monthly, we just need to divide by 12 and we have roughly 0.96% per month.\n\nSo as a rule of thumb, if you have any \u2018investment platform\u2019 offering you significantly more than 0.96% ROI per month then you should proceed with caution. If they\u2019re offering less, then you shouldn\u2019t bother with them at all because you could get more by buying debt instruments directly from the government.\n\nInvestment is, by nature, risky. Legitimate investment platforms are usually keen to inform you of the risks involved when you\u2019re putting your money with them. If a person is promising you 30% monthly and telling you it is low-risk then they are already lying to you and you should not bother doing business with them.\n\nThis is the first step in finding out if an \u2018investment opportunity\u2019 is a scam \u2013 investigate their ROI claims and how they intend to turn them into a reality.\n\nIf a company tells you they are investing in the stock market \u2013 which admittedly can give you high returns \u2013 you must be aware of the risks. The market is volatile and can move up or down very quickly.\n\nIf they say they are investing in real estate then, as an investor, the onus is on you to ask questions about the real estate offerings. Are they selling land? Renting out buildings? How exactly are they able to make that much money from renting or selling land within a short time frame.\n\nIf you find that a company\u2019s explanation for the \u2018how?\u2019 is satisfactory, then you should go on to the next item on our checklist: Regulation.\n\n\u201cAnd you are licensed by\u2026?\u201d\n\nThis is probably one of the most essential checks you must perform before you hand over funds to an investment company.\n\nIt is not enough that a company is \u2018registered\u2019 as a business. Any street-smart hustler can register a business.\n\nAn investment platform you are considering must be either: registered with the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), or be affiliated with a company that is licensed by the SEC or the CBN.\n\nA company claiming to be a financial services company of any kind that has no connection to the SEC or CBN is one to approach with extreme caution.\n\nTo be extra sure, when a company tells you they are licensed with the SEC or gives you their affiliate company (or trustee), you can click here to confirm their eligibility.\n\n\u201cWho did you say you were again?\u201d\n\nContinue your due diligence by looking into the company\u2019s track record.\n\nIt is important to find out what credentials the owners or managers of these companies have. In the case of Dominic Joshua, a quick search would have raised some doubt about the veracity of a 21-year-old investment wunderkind with no real track record.\n\nThis step is especially important when you speak with referees or the company\u2019s brand ambassadors. You shouldn\u2019t put your money into a company just because a friend or family member told you it was great.\n\nYou should also check the company\u2019s track record and find out if fraud allegations have been levelled against its founders, senior leaders, or board members.\n\nPlatforms like ours, Nairaland and even Facebook have been around long enough to have picked up news on all kinds of scams and their perpetrators. It would be good to search for the names of those people and companies and see what comes up.\n\nFinally, making wise and well-informed investment decisions is a great idea but the journey to financial freedom is no walk in the park and requires careful research.\n\nSo the next time you or a loved one are faced with a new \u2018investment opportunity,\u2019 we recommend you share this article with them.\n\n*This is not investment advice\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Two unhealthy decades later\n\nOnly Rwanda, Botswana and Zambia have budgeted over 15% to health in the last two decades. In Nigeria, budget allocation for healthcare was 4.15% and 3.91% in 2017 and 2018 respectively, as data by TechCabal Insights shows.\n\n\n\nWith governments\u2019 poor performance, the burden of funding African healthcare has largely fallen on the shoulders of the private sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of financing. The continent relies on private providers for nearly 50% of its healthcare needs.\n\nEast and Southern Africa remain the regions most affected by HIV in the world. But as other diseases like Ebola and COVID-19 have shown, Africa\u2019s healthcare concerns are systemic, broad and in need of huge capital injection.\n\nAfrica has an estimated $66 billion-a-year health financing gap and in the absence of serious government efforts, donors and the private sector have come through.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the value of PE and VC investments in African healthcare increased from 3% to 16% of total investments in the continent, according to the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA).\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, 97 private equity and venture capital fund investments worth $1.3bn were made in health care in Africa. Most healthcare deals in that period happened in Nigeria (15%), Morocco (11%), Egypt (10%), South Africa (8%) and Ghana (8%). Boluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nHealth care, as an investment sector, can be narrowed down to a number of segments, according to the GICS classification system: Equipment & Supplies, Providers & Services, Technology, Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, and Life Sciences Tools & Services.\n\nAnd health technology (healthtech) has received the most attention recently in Africa.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, AVCA estimates that healthtech accounted for 35% of health care investments in Africa. In 2020 alone, healthtech was the bright star too \u2013 gulping 45% of health care investments.\n\nOne of the more eye-catching healthcare companies is mPharma. The Ghana-based startup is now present in 7 other countries and has raised over $40 million. It became a crucial partner in the Ghanaian government\u2019s vaccine distribution strategy this year and is tipped as one of Africa\u2019s next big companies..\n\nOther breakout healthcare startups in Africa include LifeBank, Helium Health and 54Gene in Nigeria, Ilara Health in Kenya, and Healthlane in Cameroon. These startups are filling critical gaps in blood products logistics, genetics data and hospital management technology to improve service delivery. More are coming on board.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nAs with mPharma, new innovative health startups are relying on VC funding to rise to popular consciousness. To close the $66bn-a-year gap, the PE and VC community will be expected to invest larger checks at a faster rate in more startups. COVID-19, while an unfortunate pandemic, has spurred a welcome boost in visibility for healthcare startups.\n\nBut tough questions will have to be asked of governments as well.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "The ECOWAS Court sitting in Abuja has given an order restraining the Nigerian government from imposing sanctions or harassing, intimidating, arresting, or prosecuting Twitter or its users in the country.\n\nThis injunction also prevents the government from carrying out those actions against other social media platforms, media houses, radio, and television broadcast stations. This order stands pending the determination of the case.\n\nThe Court gave the order in the suit filed by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians against the federal government over the suspension of Twitter in the country.\n\nAfter hearing arguments for and against the matter, the Court decided that it was cloaked with jurisdiction. As a suit bordering on the infringement of human rights, the Court determined that it had the right to hear the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe microblogging site was suspended after it deleted a tweet by the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari, which mentioned the Nigerian-Biafran war.\n\nSubsequently, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami ordered the prosecution of anyone found using the platform.\n\nThis was met with varying levels of criticism which eventually led to the suit filed by SERAP. Currently, SERAP has also filed a claim against the government in the Federal High Court on the same matter.\n\nSERAP\u2019s suit is one in the string of cases filed or threatened to be filed against the Nigerian government on this issue.\n\nAlthough this appears to be good news, the Nigerian government is not known to obey orders or judgments given by the ECOWAS Court. A good example is another case, SERAP v. Federal Republic of Nigeria & Anor, filed by the organisation in the sub-regional court. Judgment was given in 2010 but has not been implemented to date.\n\nOther suits include Sambo Dasuki v. Federal Republic of Nigeria and SERAP v Federal Republic of Nigeria and Universal Basic Education Commission\n\nWhile recent history is not kind to all the parties involved, the suit has not been heard in its entirety yet.\n\nInterestingly, the Nigerian government today approved a team of ministers to manage the negotiation process with Twitter. Perhaps, events might unfold differently in the coming days.",

          "text": "Today, June 22, 2021, Africa-focused renewable energy finance platform, Nithio FI announced that it has secured $4.5 million in funding to offer sustainable and renewable off-grid energy solutions for homes and small businesses in Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda.\n\nThis round was led by FSD Africa Investments (FSDAi), the investment tier of FSD Africa, a financial sector development and catalyst programme based in Nairobi and funded by the UK Aid.\n\nThis funding, which complements Nithio FI\u2019s total raise of $23 million, will support access to renewable energy for households, smallholder farmers and micro-entrepreneurs who otherwise will not be able to meet the costs. It wants to do the same for energy providers in Africa.\n\nNithio FI plans to continue its innovative approach, integrating repayment data and geospatial population mapping into its AI model to produce a standardised credit risk assessment and forecast of cash flows.\n\nIt is also looking to achieve its five-year goal of providing financing to more than 224,000 energy access products, like productive use appliances and solar home systems(SHS), across Africa.\n\nNithio Holdings \u2014 the parent company \u2014 is an AI-enabled energy financing platform whose mission is to standardise credit risk assessment by investing directly and efficiently in off-grid solar companies. Currently, Nithio FI provides receivables-backed financing in Nigeria, Uganda, and Kenya, with plans to foray into other African countries in 2022.\n\nOver the years, the problem of inadequate power supply in most African countries has stifled economic growth. And the need to look out for alternatives like petrol and diesel-powered generators is normal for most households and businesses.\n\nAlso, there have been recent projections that by 2030, an estimated 650 million people will not have access to adequate electricity supply, with 9 out of 10 of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nNithio FI aims to intensify the reach and access of electrification to more African homes and businesses, banking on its pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) financing model and catalytic capital solution.\n\nCommenting on this investment, Nithio FI Co-founder and CEO, Hela Cheikhrouhou believes that \u201cin order to achieve universal energy access by 2030, last-mile financing must scale to the billions. Nithio has developed an innovative approach powered by its Risk Analytics Engine to lend to small, medium, and large off-grid energy operators to drive scalable connectivity.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, African Development Bank(AfDB) approved a $25 million cheque for renewable energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa. Subsequently, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) approved credit facilities of up to approximately $1.3 million for players in the renewable energy sector in 2020, creating easy access to renewable energy might be Africa\u2019s fast-speed solution to defeating the problem of epileptic power supply.",

          "text": "Apollo, a Kenya-based agritech startup, has received $1 million in debt financing to support small-scale farmers. This was led by Agri-Business Capital (ABC) Fund.\n\nThis is coming after the agritech startup raised $6 million in Series A funding in May 2020, led by Anthemis Exponential Ventures. Other investors that participated in that round were Leaps by Bayer, Flourish Ventures, Sage Hill Capital, and Accion Venture Lab, among others.\n\nThe Agritech startup had raised over $10 million in seed capital, a debt round of over $460,000 in 2018, and $6 million in Series A funding in 2020.\n\nThe Nairobi-based agritech startup was founded in 2015 by Eli Pollak, Chief Executive Officer (CEO); Benjamin Njenga, Chief Customer Officer (CCO); and Earl Suaver, Chief Technological Officer (CTO) to help Kenyan farmers maximise their profits by providing services like financing, farming inputs, advice, and insurance to small-scale farmers.\n\nApollo uses machine learning and automated operations technology to help farmers access these services.\n\nIt also deploys machine learning models to assess if customers are creditworthy. And if they pass this assessment, they receive a voucher code via a text message to redeem their credit.\n\nHowever, Apollo doesn\u2019t give farmers credit in cash. Instead, credit is offered in seeds and fertiliser, which they are expected to repay in cash after harvest.\n\nPollak said that the funding would help Apollo to continue to support small-scale farmers and enable them to access its services. This will lead to a significant increase in their yields and income.\n\nThe agritech startup acquires customers through digital marketing channels, and it onboards them via its app through a network of over 1,200 field agents across Kenya.\n\nDespite the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the startup claims to have grown its customer base by three times in the last year. Currently, Apollo says it serves 60,000 farmers.\n\nAlthough most farmers grow maize, the startup plans to launch new crops and products that will prompt them to grow other varieties for profitable and commercial farming. While it\u2019s not clear why Apollo chose debt financing over equity financing like angel investments and strategic partnerships, the former does not give investors an ownership stake. And it\u2019s a less expensive source of capital, especially if the company is growing at a high rate.",

We also know that some brought their private jets under a temporary import certificate, which has expired and not renewed. These are infractions.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the verification, some of the things we want to expose will come to light. We will make our findings known on July 6 after the expiration of the 30-day grace window. Those in default risk detention of their aircraft as nobody is above the law.\u201d\n\nAttah added that the Customs management believes that owners of private aircraft are highly placed individuals who would be willing to comply with extant laws governing the importation of the aircraft they own; including payments of all appropriate duties and taxes.\n\n\u201cAs an agency of government responsible for enforcement of laws governing imports and exports in Nigeria, NCS will not hesitate to invoke appropriate sanctions on any defaulting private aircraft owner immediately after the expiration of the verification period on Tuesday 6th July, 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, private aircrafts owners or their representatives are to report to room 305, Tariff & Trade Departments, Nigeria Customs Service headquarters, Abuja, from 10am to 5pm. Between Monday 7th June to Tuesday 6th July, 2021\u201d, Attah explained.\n\nHe added that the required documents for verification are; Aircraft Certificate of Registration; NCAA\u2019S Flight Operations Compliance Certificate; NCAA\u2019S Maintenance Compliance Certificate; NCAA\u2019S Permit for non- Commercial Flights; and Temporary Import Permit where applicable.\n\nThe Customs Spokesman emphasized that the ongoing verification was not intended to inconvenience any owner of a private aircraft, as such individuals or representatives can come with the documents for verification.\n\n...",

Mohammed of the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has convicted and sentenced a fake Ponzi Scheme operator: Umoren Moses Edet to seven years imprisonment for obtaining money under false pretense and issuance of dud cheques.\n\nHe was convicted on Friday June 18, 2021 after being found guilty of one-count charge bordering on advance fee fraud. He was originally arraigned on Thursday, June 28, 2018 on the same one- count charge and he pleaded \u2018not guilty\u2019 to the charge, leading to a trial that lasted three years.\n\nSpecifically, Edet collected a sum of N7, 000,000(Seven Million Naira only) from a petitioner ostensibly for bitcoin transactions.

          "title": "NNPC: Nigeria bleeds as petrol cost hits N256, subsidy N150b",
          "text": "By Edith Ike-Eboh/Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said the cost of a litre of petrol has hit N256 and it is absorbing between N140-N150 billion in monthly subsidy to sell to consumers at N162.\n\nBut the octopus corporation blamed fuel smugglers for worsening the situation, as daily consumption jumped to to 103 million litres per day in May, as against the usual 50-60 million litres.\n\nThe Group Managing Director (GMD), NNPC, Mele Kyari, made this known on Tuesday at stakeholders meeting organised by the corporation to discuss how best to stop smuggling in the country.\n\nKyari said the current situation had kept the country in a state of bleeding, as it could not sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume.\n\nHe said that the introduction of Operation White and involvement of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had helped the situation.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA data base , we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month, that means we can do with less than 70 million. The balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country .\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June, there was a day we load out about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201c We know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC, we are not in control of that, we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depot but when the volume goes down, it comes down to us, when there is tight in supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem,\u2019\u2019 he said\n\nHe said that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed that smuggling must stop adding that it was the reason for inviting all stakeholders to chart the way forward.\n\nHe said that the corporation had incorporated the EFCC, the Department of Security Services (DSS), the Nigeria Customs services (NCS), the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), on a platform to achieve this.\n\n\u201cMr President has directed us that we must stop smuggling or round tripping if there is anything like that, and so we must stop it by every means necessary, and we must do anything to stop it, that means we have to work outside the box.\n\n\u201c We know that there are layers of controls that have been there that is not working and that is why we must work outside the box.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are happy to drag in the EFCC, DSS, NSCDC, and even the NCS on a different platforms that will enable us to control this volume and we have seen it work,\u2019\u2019 he added\n\nCommenting on the current PMS and subsidy payment, Kyari explained that with the current exchange rate, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre.\n\n\u201cIf we are to sell at the market today at current exchange rate, we will be selling the product at about N256 to a litre. What we sell today is N162, so the difference is at a cost to the nation,\u2019\u2019 he said\n\nAccording to him, with the high volume of daily consumption, the country cannot sustain subsidy payment.\n\n\u201cAs long as we don\u2019t regulate volume, until we are able to exit this current level, which I know so much work is going on, then we have to manage the volume that we are exposed to between this price of N162 and N256.\n\n\u201cThe difference comes back to as much as N140 billion to N150 billion cost to the country monthly.\n\n\u201c As long as the volume goes up, that money continues to increase and we have two sets of stress to face, stress of supply and stress of foreign exchange for the NNPC. We may not see foreign exchange cheque taking place for importation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resource, Chief Timipre Sylva, said smuggling was not a business and would never be a business.\n\n\u201cI will like to put it on record that whatever we are trying to do in the area of deregulation will not make sense without us exactly knowing the actual consumption of PMS.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came in as minister, I was informed that the daily consumption in the country was around 60 to 62 million litres a day, which to me sounded a little bit outrageous considering the number of cars we have on the road .\n\n\u201cBut somehow, the figures, I understand today have come down to around 52 million litres, may be the number of vehicles have suddenly reduced, but you will agree with me that something is wrong that is why the tracking of trucks loading products is essential for us to move forward on this issue of subsidy removal,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nEFCC TO THE RESCUE\n\nHe added that illegal export of products through the borders whether the land or sea must be stopped, adding that Operation White that was commissioned in 2020 had not worked effectively until the EFCC came into the picture.\n\n\u201cI believe that with the EFCC in the picture, I think that the system will work better and know that Petroleum Equalisation Fund, is also working on product tracking arrangement.\n\n\u201cFor me, I am happy to see that the EFCC is working with us and if we can get this right, I think our movement toward deregulation will be better assured,\u2019\u2019 he said\n\nEFCC Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, said the commission was happy to be part of Operation White since part of its duty was to ensure closure of financial crimes in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is quite disheartening to see what is happening. In 2012, we were faced with petroleum subsidy fraud, we at the EFCC were able to unravel a lot of fraud going on there.\n\n\u201cFrom volume falsification to alteration of bill of laden, to the non-payment of over recovery and to what I call single importation and double subsidy payment.\n\n\u201cWe are still trying to recover about N50 billion we have identified in the fraud but now it is a different ball game. NNPC has taken responsibility of importation of products but the issue of smuggling is there.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring Nigerians that anything we have to do to stop smuggling, we will do to ensure that perpetrators are brought to book and justice is met for the benefits of Nigerians,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nOil marketers and industry players present at the meeting pledged to support government to curb smuggling.",

money is the entitlement of Rivers and Akwa-Ibom States, based on the subsisting decision of the Supreme Court over production sharing contracts arising from the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin oil Production Sharing Contracts.\n\nJustice Taiwo, delivered the judgment on Tuesday in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/174/2021 filed by the Attorney General of Rivers State and Attorney General of Akwa Ibom against the Attorney General of the Federation.\n\nIn 2016 Rivers, Bayelsa and Akwa Ibom States through their Attorneys-General sued the Federal Government, represented by the Attorney General of the Federation at the Supreme Court in Suit No: SC.964/2016.\n\nThe three states sought a declaration that there is a statutory obligation imposed on the Defendant (the Federal Government) pursuant to Section 16(1) of the Deep Offshore Inland Basin Production Sharing Act, Cap.D3 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004, to adjust the share of the Federation in the additional revenue accruing under the Production Sharing Contracts if the price of crude oil at any time exceeds twenty dollars ( $20.00USD) per barrel.\n\nThe States asked the court to declare that the failure of the Defendant to accordingly adjust the share of the Government of the Federation in the additional revenue in the Production Sharing Contracts (variously approved by the Defendant) following the increase of price of crude oil in excess of twenty dollars (20.00USD) per barrel in real terms, constitute a breach of the said Section 16(1) of the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Act and has therefore affected the total revenue accruing to the Federation.\n\nThey argued that following the rules, the court should issue a consequential order compelling the Defendant to adjust the share of the Government of the Federation in the additional revenue under all the Production Sharing Contracts in Nigeria\u2019s Oil Industry within the Inland Water Basin Deep Offshore areas as approved by the Defendant from the respective times the price of crude oil exceeded twenty dollars ($20.00USD) per barrel in real terms and to calculate in arrears with effect from August 2003 and recover and pay immediately all outstanding statutory allocations due and payable to the Plaintiffs arising from the said adjustments.\n\nAt the Supreme Court, the Attorney- General of the Federation opted for an out of Court settlement and consequently, terms of settlement were duly drawn up by the parties and entered as the judgment of the Court.\n\nThe judgment specifically stated that the reliefs in the amended originating summons relating to the larger interest of the Federal Government of Nigeria and the entire citizenry of the Federal Republic of Nigeria shall be diligently implemented.\n\nIt was also agreed that the Attorney General of the Federation, working jointly with the Plaintiffs should undertake to immediately set up a body and the necessary mechanism for recovery of all lost revenue accruing to the Federation Account in the past and up till the date of full recovery and accruing in future or an acceptable instalmental payments thereof within ninety (90) days next from the date of execution of these presents or its being made judgement of the Court.\n\nFollowing the judgement of the Supreme Court and in compliance therewith the Attorney General of the Federation, the Defendant, constituted a body to determine the respective liabilities including the amount due to oil mineral producing States as derivation proceeds.\n\nThe Report of that body stated among others that Rivers is entitled to $1,114,551,610.00 and Akwa Ibom $2,258,411,586 as Derivation proceeds.\n\nHowever, Attorney General of the Federation without recourse to the Governments of Rivers and Akwa Ibom States unilaterally claimed to have settled with International Oil Companies (IOCs).\n\nAnd it was this unilateral action on the part of the Attorney General of the Federation, the Defendant in the judgment of the Supreme Court that led to the Plaintiffs, that is, Rivers and Akwa Ibom States, to file the Suit at the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nBased on the suit filed by the State, the Federal High Court presided over by Justice Taiwo Taiwo declared that Rivers and Akwa Ibom States were entitled to the claims.\n\nThe court also awarded a post judgment interest of 10% in favour of the Plaintiffs until the final liquidation of the judgement.\n\nBAYELSA STATE\n\nOn Monday Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, ordered the Federal Government to pay $951 million to the Bayelsa State Government.\n\nEkwo held that the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), the sole defendant in the case, failed to enter his defence in the suit.\n\nJustice Ekwo ruled that the development made the court to declare the plaintiff\u2019s case \u201cunchanged.\u201d\n\nKen Njemanze filed the suit on behalf of the Bayelsa government. The plaintiff, in the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/175/2012 and filed on February 12, urged the court to compel the AGF to pay five per cent of $50 billion recovered as additional revenue that accrued to the Federal Government.\n\nBayelsa State Attorney General in an affidavit upon which the plaintiff\u2019s claims were based urged the court to make the following orders:\n\n\u201cAn order directing the defendant (AGF) to pay the sum of $951,190, 840.00, being the 13 per cent derivative sum due as arrears of revenue and payable to Bayelsa as assessed, completed and calculated by the body set up by the AGF pursuant to paragraph b (iii) (b) of the terms of settlement made by the (consent) judgment of the court by the Supreme Court in suit No: SC 964/2016 Attorney General of Rivers State and Others Vs Attorney General of the Federation on October 17, 2018. This is in addition to 10 per cent post-judgment interest at the court rate on the said sum of $951, 190, 840.00, until final liquidation thereof.\u201d\n\nThe judge noted that where a person issues a letter of demand on another person upon outstanding facts, the person for whom the demand notice was issued must take steps to react to same.\n\n\u201cWhere the person to whom such demand notice is issued takes no steps, he is deemed to have admitted the claims thereby giving the other person the option of enforcing the claims by the available procedures for enforcement of undisputed claims. That is what has happened in this case,\u201d the judge held.",

Odebunmi Dokun at the close of the session, noted that it was an investigative hearing, after which the report would be presented to the larger House.\n\nHe appealed to media practitioners to consider the sustainability of Nigeria as a country in all their actions.\n\nECOWAS stops FG\n\nMeanwhile, the ECOWAS Court of Justice sitting in Abuja Tuesday restrained the Nigerian government and its agents from unlawfully imposing sanctions, prosecuting, harass, intimidate, arrest or prosecute Twitter and/or any other social media service provider(s) in the country.\n\nThe ruling followed the suspension of Twitter as announced by the Minister of Information and Culture Mohammed after the social media giant was banned in the country for deleting President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) also ordered TV and radio stations to \u201csuspend the patronage of Twitter immediately\u201d, and told them to delete \u2018unpatriotic\u2019 Twitter.\n\nThe ruling\n\nBut in a landmark ruling, the ECOWAS court also mentioned media houses; radio and television broadcast stations, the plaintiffs and other Nigerians who are Twitter users as being immune from prosecution, pending the hearing and determination of this suit.\n\nThe ruling followed the suit filed against the government by Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians.\n\nIn the suit, they alleged \u201cthe unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, criminalization of Nigerians and other people using Twitter, alleging that it has escalated repression of human rights and unlawfully restricted the rights of Nigerians and other people to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom in the country.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing arguments from Solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana, and counsel to the government, Maimuna Shiru, the court said: \u201cThe court has listened very well to the objection by Nigeria. The court has this to say. Any interference with Twitter is viewed as inference with human rights, and that will violate human rights. Therefore, this court has jurisdiction to hear the case. The court also hereby orders that the application be heard expeditiously. The Nigerian government must take immediate steps to implement the order.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction after the verdict, Femi Falana said: \u201cThe intervention of the ECOWAS Court is a timely relief for millions of Nigerians using Twitter who have been threatened with prosecution under the provision of the Penal Code relating to sedition.\n\n\u201cContrary to the assurance credited to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN that violators of the Twitter would not be prosecuted, the Federal Government filed processes in the ECOWAS Court threatening to prosecute Nigerians using Twitter for violating the suspension under the provisions of the Penal Code relating to sedition.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely embarrassing that the Federal Government could threaten to jail Nigerians for sedition, which was annulled by the Court of Appeal in 1983, in the case of Arthur Nwankwo vs The State.\u201d",
          "summary": "He also said government would sanction any other social media platform found wanting in similar manner.\nHe further said government had \u201cdiscovered 476 online platforms devoted to bring down this country (Nigeria).\nThe minister also cautioned Nigerians using the Virtual Personal Network (VPN) to access Twitter to desist because of its possible security implications, including access to personal bank account information.\nOn whether any channel of dialogue had been opened with Twitter, the minister said, \u201cWe tried to but they rebuffed us.\nHe appealed to media practitioners to consider the sustainability of Nigeria as a country in all their actions.",

The owners of these structures are supposed to build according to the building plan approvals given to them.\n\nThere are adequate setbacks that they should leave but unfortunately, the setbacks have been encroached upon. This is the basic fact and everyone knows that the setbacks are no go areas for any form of construction. This is why we are here today.\u201d\n\nOki warned that at the expiration of the 3-day ultimatum without the removal of the illegal encroachments, the state government will take necessary actions against the owners of the structures.\n\nThe LASBCA boss said that the setback areas with interlocking tiles were supposed to be green areas, stressing that the enforcement is aimed at regulating physical planning development in the state.\n\nHe added that green land setbacks are specifically reserved to help preserve the ecosystem as part of efforts to achieve the development plans in the state and make the environment organised and livable.\n\nRecall that the Lagos State Government has in recent times, embarked on the demolition and sealing off of residential and commercial properties across the state for violating the state\u2019s physical planning laws, lack of building approval from the relevant authorities and building on unauthorized areas.\n\nThe exercise has been carried out in various parts of the state such as Ikoyi, Lekki, Ikeja GRA, Magodo GRA, Surulere, Ogudu GRA, Amuwo Odofin and so on.\n\nThe enforcement of the state\u2019s physical planning laws is to help reduce the incidences of building collapse; as General Manager of LASBCA said the enforcement exercise which would be continuous, is part of efforts to rid the state of illegal and unapproved building constructions.",

According to him, \u201ccontemplated overhead costs, recurrent and capital expenditure of the Commission when established is N158,042,050.32.\u201d\n\n\u201cI make bold to say that Nigeria is richly endowed with a variety of solid minerals of various categories ranging from precious metals to various precious stones and industrial minerals. The Nigerian Extractive Industries and Transparency Initiative (NEITI) reported that there are approximately 40 different kinds of solid minerals and precious metals buried in N igerian soil waiting to be exploited.\n\n\u201cThe sector offers a viable alternative to petroleum for foreign exchange earnings.\n\n\u201cGlobally, the mining industry has been a close rival to the petroleum industry, while Nigeria only earns a paltry $89 million per annum from it. The commercial value of Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals has been estimated to run into hundreds of billions of dollars,\u201d the lawmaker stressed.\n\nContributing, Senator Smart Adeyemi (APC Kogi West) said the importance of the commission cannot be overemphasized, noting it would enable government to regulate mining activities and save government trillions of naira being lost to illegal activities in the country.\n\nIn his remarks, the Senate President Dr. Ahmad Lawan, charged the Committee on Solid Minerals to conclude legislative work on the bill and report back within four weeks.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has inaugurated the National Steering Committee (NSC) of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) to be chaired by the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nIn his remarks at the event on Tuesday in Abuja, the President reiterated his commitment to lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years, with a well-researched framework for implementation and funding.\n\n\u201cThis journey began in January 2021 when I directed the Chairman of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council and Secretary to the Government of the Federation to collaboratively work together to articulate what will lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years.\n\n\u201cI am happy to note that the process of designing this inclusive poverty reduction strategy recognised and addressed past mistakes, as well as laid the foundation for a sustainable poverty reduction through the wide range consultations held at all levels of government, development partners, the private sector as well as the civil society,\u201d he was quoted as saying by his media aide, Femi Adesina.\n\nPresident Buhari was confident that the NPRGS would address the underlying causes of poverty on the basis of which it developed programmes that would deal with the multi-dimensional nature of poverty within the practical context of comparative advantage of human and natural resources in the various geo-political zones.\n\nAccording to him, the major challenge before the committee is to translate the good intention of the government into a positive impact on the average Nigerian in order to create an appreciative impact on the poverty situation in the country.\n\n\u201cIf India can lift 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016, Nigeria can surely lift 100 million out of poverty in 10 years. Fortunately, we have already started but we need to unlock the challenges of slow implementation, inappropriate targeting, and absence of adequate resources,\u201d the President said.\n\nThe responsibilities of the committee, he noted, include anchoring collaborative efforts; provide oversight for the implementation of the strategy; provide guidance to Technical Working Group and federal ministries, extra ministerial departments and agencies, subnational governments and other stakeholders on meeting the objectives of the programme; as well as monitor progress and any other effort that would enhance the attainment of the objective of lifting 100 million people out of poverty in 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe performance of our economy despite COVID-19 gives me comfort that we can achieve our goal, but we need to seriously scale up and work more with state and local governments.\n\n\u201cThis call becomes more pertinent in the face of recent forecasts by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and our own Nigerian Economic Summit Group which all agreed that Nigeria needs to frontally tackle her poverty situation if our economic gains are to be sustained,\u201d he told the gathering at the event.\n\nPresident Buhari asked the committee to commence work immediately to enable the Technical Working Group to begin to put the nuts and bolts together.\n\nHe said the responsibilities were onerous but expressed confidence that the committee would be able to lay the foundation and demonstrate, within the next two years, the practicality of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in or under 10 years.\n\nIn his remarks, Vice President Osinbajo said the NPRGS would consolidate other efforts of the government to reduce poverty in the land.\n\nHe noted that the President\u2019s position that local governments, states, and the federal government should work jointly to alleviate poverty in the country would be properly reflected in the framework and implementation, stressing the need for access and inclusivity.\n\nThe SGF, Boss Mustapha, who is a member of the committee said the poverty situation in the country assumed an enormous proportion with an increasing population, adding that the situation was compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe, however, said the administration responded to the COVID-19 poverty fallout swiftly and was able to ameliorate the situation and ensured a quick exit from recession.\n\nThe committee also has as members Chief of Staff to the President, Governors of Ekiti (South West), Delta (South South), Sokoto (North West), Borno (North East), Nasarawa (North Central), and Ebonyi States (South East).\n\nOthers are Ministers of Finance, Budget and National Planning; State for Budget and National Planning; Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development; Agriculture and Rural Development; Industry, Trade and Investments; Labour and Employment, Education and Health.",

People have been using this as a blackmail weapon that we rode to power using social media.

However, neither agency has confirmed the validity of the claim.\n\nAsked about the websites\u2019 seizures during a news conference on Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price did not confirm or deny US responsibility for the takedowns, referring journalists instead to the Department of Justice, which oversees the FBI.\n\nThe DOJ did not respond however respond to the request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarzieh Hashemi, a prominent anchor for Press TV, told The Associated Press that the channel was aware of the seizure but had no further information.\n\n\u201cWe are just trying to figure out what this means,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever In a post to Twitter, the news agency shared a screenshot of the message that appeared in place of its website on Tuesday, saying it \u201cseems to be a coordinated action\u201d as a similar message has also appeared on websites of other \u201cIranian and regional television networks\u201d. PressTV did not confirm US involvement in the seizure, saying only that the actor \u201cclaims\u201d to be with the US government.\n\nIn what seems to be a coordinated action, a similar message appears on the websites of Iranian and regional television networks that claims the domains of the websites have been \u201cseized by the United States Government.\u201d\n\nLaunched in July 2007, Press TV is the international English-language news channel that runs under the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), Tehran\u2019s state media agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIRIB has been sanctioned by the US since 2013 \u2013 and remained so even after the Obama-era nuclear deal \u2013 under a US law that gives the US Treasury Department the authority to designate those in Iran who restrict or deny the free flow of information to or from the Iranian people but Press TV has remained operational despite all the sanctions.\n\nThe Houthi movement\u2019s alternative domain for its al-Masirah news website, which remained operational, released a statement accusing the US of seizing its site \u201cwithout any justification or prior notice\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis seizure of the almasirah.net and other allied websites reveals once again the deceit of the free speech slogans that America promotes,\u201d the agency said. \u201cWe condemn this American piracy.\u201d\n\nLast year the US Treasury Department blocked and seized the official domain name of Iranian state-run newspaper \u201cIran\u201d.\n\nThe website, once registered under the domain \u201ciran-newspaper.com\u201d, is still offline but can now be found instead under \u201cirannewspaper.ir\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2012, Nicole Navas, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman, told Wired that the US government has the authority to seize any website ending in .com, .net or .org because the companies that have the contracts to administer the sites are based on US soil.",

          "text": "Uefa has declined a request to light up the Allianz Arena in rainbow colours before Germany\u2019s Euro 2020 match against Hungary on Wednesday.\n\nMunich mayor Dieter Reiter made the request in protest against a new law in Hungary that bans the sharing of any content seen as promoting homosexuality and gender change to under-18s.\n\nUefa says it denied the request because of the \u201cpolitical context\u201d.\n\nReiter described Uefa\u2019s decision as \u201cshameful\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, European football\u2019s governing body said: \u201cUefa understands that the intention is also to send a message to promote diversity and inclusion \u2013 a cause, which Uefa has been supporting for many years \u2013 having joined forces with European clubs, national teams and their players, launching campaigns and plenty of activities all over Europe to promote the ethos that football should be open to everyone.\n\n\u201cAnd consequently, Uefa has proposed alternative dates for the illumination which align better with existing events.\n\n\u201cRacism, homophobia, sexism, and all forms of discrimination are a stain on our societies \u2013 and represent one of the biggest problems faced by the game today. Discriminatory behaviour has marred both matches themselves and, outside the stadiums, the online discourse around the sport we love.\u201d\n\nGermany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer will be allowed to wear his rainbow captain\u2019s armband during the game.\n\nUefa has proposed to Munich to light the stadium in rainbow colours on either 28 June \u2013 the Christopher Street Liberation Day \u2013 or between 3-9 July which is the Christopher Street Day week in Munich.\n\nChristopher Street Day is an annual LGBTQ+ celebration held annually in cities across Germany and Switzerland, held in memory of the Stonewall Riots in New York in 1969. It is the countries\u2019 counterpart to Pride.\n\nOn Monday, the German football association (DFB) said it would also prefer any such protest to be held on a date other than Wednesday.\n\nMayor Reiter has dismissed those suggestions and says other Munich landmarks will be lit up on Wednesday instead.\n\n\u201cI find it shameful that Uefa forbids us to send a message here in Munich for openness, tolerance, respect and solidarity with the LGBTQI+ community,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe alternative suggestion of illuminating the Allianz Arena on another day contradicts any message that is supposed to emanate from rainbow lighting.\n\n\u201cTomorrow, as the city of Munich, we will still send a clear sign of our solidarity and our respect for sexual equality to Hungary and the world.\n\n\u201cWe will not only fly rainbow flags at Munich town hall \u2013 I assume that the city council will decide this tomorrow with a large majority \u2013 but also make the wind turbine adjacent to the arena shine brightly and also the Munich Olympic Tower.\n\n\u201cBecause we are concerned with a signal for a non-negotiable basic right for all people: equality and tolerance.\u201d\n\nA number of other German clubs including Wolfsburg, Cologne and Hertha Berlin, say they will light their stadium up in rainbow colours, while Werder Bremen have put up Pride flags outside their ground.",

          "text": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel received a Moderna coronavirus vaccine as her second jab, after getting the first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine, a government spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\nThe 66-year-old took her first dose of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine in April, more than two weeks after German authorities recommended the use of the jab only for people aged 60 and above.\n\nMillions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been safely administered in Europe, but concerns linger over a rare type of blood clot seen in an extremely small number of recipients, meaning that some people in early priority groups due to their age or pre-existing health conditions have been holding off on getting it, preferring to wait for another vaccine.\n\nDozens of countries paused the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in March or restricted them to older adults. However, several of them \u2013 including Germany \u2013 have since resumed use either fully or with restrictions after health regulators said the benefits of the shot outweigh any risks.\n\nGermany recommended in April that people who received a first shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine should receive a different shot for their second dose. Several other European countries made similar decisions.\n\nAfter a stuttering start, Germany\u2019s vaccination rollout has sharply accelerated in recent weeks. As of Tuesday, one in two, or 51.2 percent of the population have received their first dose.\n\nSome experts believe that switching COVID vaccines for second doses could boost immunity and several medical studies are under way.\n\nOne small UK study into using different COVID vaccines in two-dose inoculations found that people who received Pfizer\u2019s vaccine followed by a dose of AstraZeneca, or vice versa, were more likely to report mild or moderate common post-vaccination symptoms than if they received two doses of the same type.\n\nNovavax, which is developing a coronavirus vaccine, said on May 21 it would take part in a mix-and-match COVID-19 vaccine trial to test the use of an additional vaccine dose from a different producer as a booster. The trial will start in June in the UK.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada, which is facing supply shortages, has recommended that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines can be used interchangeably.\n\nThe government said on Monday that Pfizer\u2019s weekly shipment of 2.4 million doses was delayed, leaving provinces switching Pfizer appointments for Moderna, and urging people not to cancel their jabs, Canada\u2019s National Observer reported.\n\nOfficials in Ontario have informed residents that they may receive different mRNA vaccines \u2013 the advanced technology used in shots from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.\n\n\u201cWe want you getting the full protection as soon as possible,\u201d David Williams, a doctor, was quoted by the National Observer as saying.\n\n\u201cThe vaccines are safe to mix,\u201d he said.\n\nOfficials in Alberta, Manitoba and Quebec have urged citizens and residents to do the same.\n\n\u201cOur public health is saying you can have the same one, or a mix, the advantages are a lot higher than the very small risk,\u201d Quebec Premier Francois Legault said on Monday.",

          "text": "Nigerian footballer Anthony Nwakaeme has adopted a novel approach to tackling racism by saying that the best way to disarm any abusers is by smiling at them.\n\nThe 32-year-old, who currently plays for Turkey\u2019s Trabzonspor, believes the issue is spreading in football despite recent campaigns by Fifa, Uefa and a host of others, such as Premier League footballers taking the knee, to combat it.\n\nAfter 11 years playing across Europe, including spells in Romania and Israel, he believes that tackling the problem head on is the best way ahead.\n\n\u201cRacism is in sports and growing bigger in football,\u201d Nwakaeme told BBC Sport Africa. \u201cIt will continue to spread everywhere and I can\u2019t confidently say when it can be kicked out of football.\u201d\n\nThe forward recounts an incident from his time in Israel, which he says has armed him for the ongoing fight against what he calls a \u2018societal problem\u2019.\n\n\u201cI experienced racism few years ago when I played in Israel with my team [Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva] away to Maccabi Haifa,\u201d he explained. \u201cRight there on the pitch, I decided I was not going to let those abusing me win.\n\n\u201cThe Maccabi Haifa fans were making monkey noises and booing me, then I turned, looked straight at them and then I smiled.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs soon as they saw my reaction, they realised that what they had done hadn\u2019t affected me in anyway, so they started applauding me, cheering and singing my name.\u201d\n\nNwakaeme said the gesture empowered him to deal with the issue, determined as he was not to give the group the satisfaction of seeing him react negatively.\n\n\u201cSometimes instead of fighting you, I\u2019ll avoid (confronting) you,\u201d he added. \u201cThat was exactly what happened there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I could have challenged them or stopped the game in my own way, but I was enjoying myself on the pitch, I felt powerful and I was making life difficult for their team.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let them distract me or put me down. I wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to make me feel less of a man by reacting negatively.\n\n\u201cOnce they noticed I wasn\u2019t falling or dropping to that level of anger or hatred, they began to cheer me up. Why should I let them win?\n\n\u201cI understand that not many footballers can handle it that way, but personally I don\u2019t pay attention to those things because racism is a societal problem.\u201d\n\nDuring his three-year spell at Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva, where he scored 43 goals in 120 appearances after joining in 2015 (from rivals Hapoel Ra\u2019anana), he won three successive league titles and twice lifted the Israeli Cup.\n\nHis scoring form in Israel caught the attention of Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr and earned a call-up to the Super Eagles squad for their 2018 World Cup qualifiers in August 2017.\n\nNwakaeme was an unused substitute in three games before making his debut against Algeria in November.\n\nDespite the lure of big money from China and of course the threat of racism itself, the player chose to stay in Europe in 2018 when joining Turkish club Trabzonspor.\n\nAfter over a decade in Europe, Nwakaeme said football authorities cannot solve racism issues alone because it is a wider problem.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that racism didn\u2019t start with football, it started many years ago,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe can see it in everyday life and that clearly shows it\u2019s a problem that is way more than just football. It\u2019s a societal problem and we cannot fix it without fixing society.\n\n\u201cYou can see the past years they [Fifa and Uefa] have been fighting racism\u2026 but season after season there are incidents. As much as the authorities continue to campaign and tackle it with mere threats, before the end of the season it will continue rear its head again somehow.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019ve made up my mind not to pay attention to abuses, if you like me or you don\u2019t like me, that\u2019s your problem.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re being racist to me it\u2019s also your problem. I\u2019m here to play football and enjoy myself at the same time, that\u2019s the most important thing for me.\u201d",
