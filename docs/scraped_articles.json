          "title": "IBEDC throws communities into darkness, residents scare officials with sacrifice",
          "text": "Residents of Magboro, Makogi, Oke-Afa, Ibafo and Orimerimun, in the Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State, have been thrown into darkness by the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company.\n\nPUNCH Metro gathered that electricity supply to the communities was disconnected after some residents placed fetish items at the isolator switch of the IBEDC in the Magboro area.\n\nOur correspondent learnt that some yet-to-be-identified persons on Saturday placed a sacrifice at the switch and also chained the electrical gadget.\n\nThe President of the Magboro Movement on IBEDC, Moses Omoniyi, said nobody knew the identities of the people that placed the sacrifice in the area.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen the isolator changeover is pulled up, there will be power, and when it is pulled down, it means there won\u2019t be electricity. That is how Magboro has been supplied power by the electricity company.\n\n\u201cHowever, on Saturday evening, when the isolator switch was up and there was electricity, some people dropped a sacrifice there. They also chained the switch to keep the electricity on. They placed the sacrifice at the bottom. A palm tree leaf and some charms were placed on the chain.\n\n\u201cBut now, the issue is that no one can go there to pull the switch down, because no one knows who put the sacrifice there.\n\n\u201cAs soon as IBEDC discovered that they could not pull the isolator switch down, they authorised that power be switched off from Oke-Aro. The whole Magboro, Makogi, Oke-Afa, Ibafo 1, Ibafo 2, Orimerimun and all the companies using the electricity have not got power since Sunday.\n\n\u201cIf we know the people that put the sacrifice there, we will have to appeal to them to take it away so we can have a way forward. I believe our traditional rulers are also making efforts to know who put it there; so it\u2019s until they see who put it there that we can move forward.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Olaniyi Bamidele, who noted that none of the residents could have placed the sacrifice at the isolator switch, claimed that he suspected foul play on the part of the IBEDC.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe last time they brought power was Saturday and Sunday morning and we were supposed to have power on Monday because we run on shifts. There was no power on Monday till evening when we got a message on WhatsApp that some people padlocked the isolator switch that would be used to turn on the electricity and that as the sacrifice was put there, the IBEDC said they could not energise power until it is removed.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who put the sacrifice there, but from my point of view, Magboro people cannot put sacrifice there. The outage has affected us a lot because there is no power to pump water.\n\n\u201cWe want IBEDC to take us back to the old timetable of two days on and one day off and we also want prepaid meters because some parts of Magboro were given meters last month.\u201d\n\nA resident of Magboro, Oyebola Olufasakin, said power supply in the community had been awful.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine having eight hours of electricity in three days? IBEDC is taking us for granted. When the youth decided that we would not pay for the electricity that we did not enjoy, some old people went to pay behind. The CDC too has been bribed because they are not allowing us to make headway. Instead of them speaking in unison that this is what we want, they are the ones saying it\u2019s the youth that are disturbing the peace of the community. The solution to this issue is for IBEDC to go and we will go back to when we had no power and we will look for another distribution company,\u201d he added.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the isolator switch was still chained and the sacrifice at the same spot, while residents continued to suffer outage.\n\nThe IBEDC\u2019s Media Relations Officer, Busolami Tunwase, could not be reached for comment as of the time of filing this report.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Bashir Bello, KANO\n\nWorried by the pockets of violence and conflicts in the country, a Non-Governmental Organization is known as, Prisoners Rehabilitation and Welfare Action, PRAWA has advocated for restorative justice and an alternative to violence approach to tackle and surmount the headlong menace in the country.\n\nThe Executive Director, PRAWA, Dr Uju Agomoh stated this while training youth volunteers from various communities on alternatives to violence and also security personnel from various security formations on restorative justice respectively in Kano.\n\nDr Agomoh decried that there are pockets of violence across the country hence the need for the approach in order to manage the situation before it escalates or degenerates.\n\n\u201cAll around us, there is a lot of violence going on but collectively we can put a stop to it. There is always a nonviolence part to every situation.\n\n\u201cSo the message is simple by saying no to violence. This is a language that each and every one of us has to say and continually repeats.\n\n\u201cSo we are trying to encourage this youth to go back to their various communities to be ambassadors of alternative to violence and change the narrative by enlightening their peer groups to say no to violence. They should discourage them from violence and where conflict is brewing up.\n\n\u201cLet me also seize this opportunity to call for all hands (all agents of socialization such as parents, schools, media, religious leaders among others) to be on deck. All should begin to join hands to say no to violence and encourage people to take the nonviolence path.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Restorative justice on the other hand is a way of bringing back our traditional criminal justice system that recognizes the place of community, offender and victim. To that end, we would all work together to ensure that once you commit an offence, it would be reconciled and the issue of re-offending will be reduced.\n\n\u201cRemember, everybody who commits offence even if they spends time in custody, one day they would go back to the community, therefore there is a need for us to heal the wound of that broken relationship. Sometimes just saying I am sorry makes a whole difference. So restorative justice is the thing that would come and hopefully help us to improve the quality of justice we are dispensing.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Correctional Service Act of 2019 provided a very comprehensive way of introducing restorative justice. It says that it can happen before the police stage, court stage or even after the person has been released from custody. That in every situation where there is the issue of conflict or crime. There is a need for the victim to understand why did it happened to me and the offender to take full responsibility for what they have done,\u201d Dr. Agomoh said.\n\nSimilarly, the Kano State Commander of National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Isa Likita throw his weight behind the restorative justice approach citing instances with Rwanda where the restorative justice approach was applied and peace has since returned to the country.\n\n\u201cNo war is won on the battlefield. It is always won on the table and that is dispute resolution which is also a form of alternative to violence. We, however, encourage the youths that are being trained here to adopt all the principles and approaches they were been taught so that they can input the same to their various communities,\u201d Likita said.\n\nEarlier, the Kano State Deputy Commissioner of Police (Administration), DCP Abubakar Zubairu accused desperate politicians of using the youths to foment trouble while appealing to the youths not to succumb to pressure or pranks of such politicians whose interest is self-centred.\n\nHe urged the youths to go back to their various communities to sensitize their peers to shun such desperate politicians and be good ambassadors of alternative to violence.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

As at July 2021, the total borrowing is 23% of GDP.\n\n\u201cWhen you compare our borrowing to other countries, we\u2019re the lowest within the region, lowest compared to Egypt, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, the very lowest, and Angola.\n\n\u201cWe do have a problem of revenue. Our revenues have been increasing. We just reported to Council that our revenues from non-oil have performed, as July, at the rate of 111%, which means outperforming the prorated budget.\n\n\u201cBut our expenditure, especially staff emoluments have been increasing at a very fast rate making it difficult to cope with funding of government,\u201d she explained.\n\nOn the difference between the price of crude oil and the $57 benchmark for the 2022 Budget, Mrs. Ahmed noted \u201cyou know that the crude oil price in the international capital market is not stable, it goes up and it comes down.\n\n\u201cOur assessment is that $57 per barrel is a safe zone to be in and we did this after extensive consultations with CBN, we checked the research work of the World Bank and other institutions, whose concern is investigating and researching on crude oil prices. But you know the revenue in the budget for oil and gas is a function of the level of production as well as the price.\u201d",

According to him, the promoters believe Mark\u2019s candidature would be accepted across board as \u201ceven the (PDP) Governors\u2019 Forum will be ready to work with him.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a youth group within the opposition party has accused the PDP governor of alleged undue interference in the affairs of the party.\n\nThe youths under the aegies of PDP Youth Coalition and Ambassadors of Good Governance, urged the governors to allow statutory organs of the party perform their functions, unencumbered.\n\nConvener of the group, Obianuju Ogoko, spoke to journalists, in Abuja.\n\n\u201cWe wish to also plead with our governors to allow our decision-making organs, namely: BoT and NEC to exercise their statutory authority as decision making organs of the Party.\n\n\u201cWe are most grateful to our governors for funding our party but we also plead with them to stop interfering with party processes because they provide funding. We appreciate benevolence that does not compromise our processes.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, former senate president and PDP leader in Kwara State, Bukola Saraki, has expressed optimism that the unity and peace being experienced in the party in the state would ensure its victory in the next general election.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Ilorin, yesterday, after the PDP local government congress and membership e-registration exercise at his Ajikobi Ward in Ilorin West LGA of the state, Saraki said PDP was the only united and peaceful party in the state.\n\nHe said the party had opened more leadership positions for women and youths and charged party faithful to spread the message of hope among electorates that the party was ready to provide political leadership in the state come 2023.\n\n\u201cLet us all go and prepare for 2023 elections. It\u2019s all clear that PDP government is what people want. We\u2019re committed and its left for us to go all out and sell the message of hope to our people. The PDP is the only party in the state that is united and peaceful. For progress of the state, it\u2019s the PDP. We are ready to provide leadership come 2023.\u201d\n\nOn the e-registration exercise, he described the process as transparent and capable of reducing sharp practices, saying PDP had the most modern data base for members.\n\nHe said the registration process was in line with global best practices.\n\nThe high point of the event was the consensus arrangement used to elect local government party officials through affirmation in the congress witnessed by party stalwarts in the state.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

I will ever cherish it.\u201d\n\nShaibu praised Governor Godwin Obaseki, his boss, for providing the atmosphere for him and everybody in the state to excel.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis award would have be possible if not got the freedom and opportunity Governor Obaseki has given me. That is why some of my colleagues, deputy governors, are jealous of me.

The APC National Assembly members have agreed to drag this process and get up to their next year\u2019s annual vacation by which time, whereupon a claim that by the ECOWAS treaty electoral laws cannot be amended less than six months to elections, the process will terminate like they did for the 2019 election but this time with possibility of throwing the country into constitutional crisis.\n\n\u201cWe warn the National Assembly members that God will condemn them and humanity will condemn them if they doctor the Electoral Act amendment process and remove the electronic transmission of results or if they refuse to complete this process within a reasonable time.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Nigeria's Senate President Lawan, His Deputy Move To Frustrate Corruption Trial Of Ex-Minister, Stella Oduah",
          "text": "A move by President of the Nigerian Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, his deputy, Ovie Omo-Agege, and other leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to frustrate the prosecution of Stella Oduah, a senator embroiled in corruption cases, has been uncovered.\n\nOduah is also a former Minister of Aviation.\n\nOn August 27, 2021, Oduah was received into the fold of the ruling APC party at a brief ceremony held in Abuja.\n\nNational Chairman of the APC caretaker Committee, Mai Mala Buni; Omo-Agege; Atiku Bagudu, Chairman of the Progressive Governors' Forum (PGF), and Hope Uzodinma, Imo State governor, were present at the event.\n\nSaharaReporters had exclusively reported in April that Oduah\u2019s trial by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over N9.4 billion fraud may gradually be scuttled going by her secret plot with Lawan and the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami. See Also Corruption N5bn Scandal: How AGF Malami, Senate President Are Frustrating Stella Oduah's Trial\n\nSaharaReporters had learnt that the trial of Oduah could not proceed in February because the co-defendants and the ex-minister failed to appear before Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe judge had given the prosecution additional weeks and slated April 19 for the continuation of trial, but the case of the former minister again did not come up as scheduled.\n\nIt was gathered that Oduah met with Lawan and Malami to frustrate her case with the EFCC.\n\n\u201cFebruary 22 has passed but she was not arraigned. April 19 has also passed. She is working very hard, using Senate President and AGF to either scuttle arraignment or frustrate the trial. Alternatively, they are planning to water down the trial through the prosecution via the EFCC chairman.\n\n\u201cAnother way is through the prosecutor, Dr Hassan Liman, a close friend of Lawan and the AGF,\u201d a source had revealed to SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters reported on February 22 that the EFCC had earlier planned to re-arraign Oduah over fraud involving funds totalling over N9.4 billion that same day but her co-defendants failed to show up in court as part of the plot. See Also Politics N5Billion Fraud: Court Threatens To Issue Arrest Warrant On Stella Oduah, Others For Failing To Appear\n\nOduah was scheduled to be arraigned on 25 counts of money laundering alongside Gloria Odita, Nwobu Emmanuel Nnamdi, Chukuma Irene Chinyere, Global Offshore and Marine Limited, Crystal Television Limited, Sobora International Limited, and the China Civil Engineering Construction Company Limited.\n\nWhen the case was mentioned, the prosecuting counsel, Dr Hassan Liman, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, informed the court that the commission had tried every means possible but was unable to serve the fifth and sixth defendants with the court processes.\n\nHe, therefore, applied for additional 14 days to serve them.\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters on Wednesday, a source at the Presidency said there are concerted and subtle efforts by Lawan and Omo-Agege to \u201cfrustrate, sabotage and compromise the EFCC, its witnesses and prosecution team and Justice Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThere are concerted and subtle efforts by Deputy Senate President and Senate President to sabotage President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption stance by mounting undue pressure on the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, the Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, and also Justice Ekwo of Federal High Court Abuja for them to frustrate, compromise and sabotage the prosecution and trial of Sen Stella Oduah, former Minister of Aviation.\n\n\u201cThis well-orchestrated plan has been perfected by the above-mentioned highly placed Nigerians.\n\n\u201cNigerians, especially civil society organisations are enjoined to campaign and mount pressure on relevant individuals and agencies namely the National Security Adviser, Chairman of EFCC, Director General, Department of State Services (DSS), and Attorney General of the Federation to prosecute diligently and unravel the reason for the delay and hindrance in prosecuting this case into which the EFCC had finished investigation since 2 years ago.\n\n\u201cEnsure that not only will justice be done in this matter, but also that justice will be seen to have been done. Ensure that nobody no matter how highly placed (in Executive, Legislature and Judiciary) derails, sabotages, compromises or frustrates the long arm of justice as it concerns prosecution and trial of Stella Oduah.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had in September 2017 uncovered how Oduah bought a house in London for $1.2 million, disguising it in the robes of a foreign-registered company to avoid detection. See Also Breaking News How Stella Oduah Bought $1.5m House In London Using A Company Registered In Guernsey To Hide Ownership\n\nThe transaction, which had been kept secret, was blown open when Mrs. Oduah decided to rent out the house.\n\nShe engaged the services of a real estate company, Daniel Ford and Company Ltd, for that purpose.\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported in February 2018 that the EFCC had commenced the investigation of Oduah, over her involvement in the N9.4 billion contract for the supply of security equipment to 22 airports across the country.\n\nRecently, Pandora Papers, one of the biggest leaks of financial documents in the world, uncovered how Oduah secretly acquired mansions in London.\n\nOne of the properties is said to be in her name, two through her Nigerian-incorporated firm, and four secretly through her Seychelles offshore company.\n\nInternational Trading and Logistics Company Limited (ITCL) was incorporated in Seychelles, a commonly used secrecy and tax haven, with Oduah as the ultimate beneficial owner.\n\nShe reportedly used the company to acquire the four London properties worth a total of \u00a36.7 million between October 2012 and August 2013.\n\nAt the time, Oduah was a minister in the government of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nShe served as Minister of Aviation between 2011 and 2014, when she was fired over a massive corruption scandal.\n\nOduah was indicted by two panels, which probed the purchase of two bullet-proof cars by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), an agency under her supervision, for N255 million in violation of Nigeria\u2019s public procurement and appropriation laws.\n\nAccording to the UK Land Registry records, on October 19, 2012, ITCL bought a house at 23 St Edmunds Terrace, London, NW8 7QA for \u00a35.3 million.",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Ailing Ex-Lagos Governor, Tinubu Plans \u2018Brief Return\u2019 To Nigeria On Sunday, To Go Abroad For More Surgeries Shortly After",
          "text": "The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, is likely to return to Nigeria on Sunday to a \u201cgrand welcome\u201d already being planned by his political associates, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite Tinubu\u2019s challenging health condition, the return is being planned to make people think the APC leader is healthy and fit for the much talked about 2023 presidency.\n\nTinubu in London\n\nTop sources revealed that after his planned return on Sunday, Tinubu will return abroad to have more surgeries \u2013 proof that all is not yet well with the former Lagos governor.\n\n\u201cTinubu is planning a choreographed return to Nigeria on Sunday. Baba (Tinubu) will return for more surgeries shortly after. A grand welcome is being arranged at the Nigeria Police College in Ikeja, Lagos.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s if everything goes as planned and his health permits him to take the gruesome trip \u2013 because the trip is also going to tell on his recuperation,\u201d one of the sources revealed.\n\nSaharaReporters had last week reported that Tinubu confirmed that he went through a challenging health crisis, saying his \u201cphysiotherapy was gruesome.\u201d See Also Politics Ruling Party, APC Leader, Tinubu Speaks On UK Treatment, Says Physiotherapy Is 'Gruesome'\n\nTinubu said this while addressing members of the House of Representatives northern caucus who visited him in London last Friday.\n\nThe former governor, who has been in the United Kingdom for the last three months since undergoing knee surgery, told the gathering, \u201cBecause of God and people like you, I am well. It is just the physio (physiotherapy) that is gruesome.\u201d\n\nSince his departure, Tinubu\u2019s London home has become a mecca of sorts as he has been visited by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Governors Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), and Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti).\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that Fayemi confirmed that Tinubu had surgery recently and he (Fayemi) was in London to show solidarity with him. See Also Politics Ekiti Governor Confirms SaharaReporters' Story On Tinubu, Says Ex-Lagos Governor Has Health Challenges, Underwent Surgery\n\nThe governor had said, \u201cHe (Akeredolu) and I were in London together to see our leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, but it had absolutely nothing to do with 2023 presidential plans whatsoever. That\u2019s not the reason why we went there.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju had just surgery; it is simply proper etiquette or behaviour both in the part of the country where I come from but also generally that when a friend and elder is undergoing health challenges, it would be improper on your part not to show solidarity and support.\u201d\n\nTinubu\u2019s health has been a subject of controversy of late.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari also made a surprise visit to Tinubu in London where he was seen leaning on a walking stick.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Tinubu underwent knee surgery at the John Hopkins University Hospital in Maryland, US.\n\nThe APC chieftain, it was learnt, left the US for the United Kingdom on crutches, a few days after the surgery.\n\nSources close to Tinubu told SaharaReporters that he wanted the surgery in Paris, France but changed his plan after rumours of his death spread in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTinubu had his second surgery at John Hopkins University in Maryland recently. He was accompanied by a popular Nigerian doctor in Chicago. He had wanted the surgery in Paris but when rumour was rife about his death, he hurriedly left for Nigeria and went to John Hopkins,\u201d one of the sources had said.\n\n\"He left the US for the UK on crutches,\" another source revealed.\n\nSaharaReporters had on July 31 reported that Tinubu, who has had several medical trips this year alone, had surgery about two weeks earlier and could be billed for another one.\n\nThe APC National Leader has been off official and party functions in the country for a while, amidst talks that he is being positioned for the 2023 presidency to succeed the incumbent repressive regime of Buhari.\n\n\u201cTinubu is hospitalised in Maryland, US.

In other words, if a state of emergency is validly declared in any State or in the entire country, the President is empowered to deploy troops and take other extraordinary measures to restore law and order,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cSince 2015, President Buhari has imposed emergency rule in Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Zamfara, Kaduna and Katsina States by deploying members of the armed forces to assist the police in the restoration of law and order. The President has adopted such extraordinary measures without seeking the approval of both Chambers of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIn other words, since the emergency rule imposed on the North East region by President Goodluck Jonathan expired by effluxion of time, President Buhari has not renewed or extended it. The National Assembly has not challenged the illegal emergency rule imposed without any declaration as stipulated by section 305 of the Constitution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo that extent, I want to believe that the Buhari administration has just realised that the deployment of troops without the declaration of emergency rule in many states of the Federation is illegal and unconstitutional. Hence, the threat issued by the Attorney-General of the Federation is an attempt to return to constitutionalism with respect to imposition of emergency rule in Anambra State and other States in the North West, North East and South East regions, where the Federal Government is waging a full scale war against terrorists and the so-called gunmen.\n\n\u201cI wish to submit, without any fear of contradiction, that nowhere in the Constitution has the President been vested with the power to remove the elected Governor of a State and suspend democratic structures. The Governor of a State can only be removed by impeachment or resignation and not by imposition of emergency rule.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, the tenure of legislators is 4 years in line with the provisions of the Constitution. Even though former President Olusegun Obasanjo removed two Governors via the imposition of emergency rule, the PDP-led Federal Government later jettisoned the illegal practice.\n\n\u201cHence ex-Presidents Umaru Yaradua and Goodluck Jonathan never used emergency rule to remove elected governors or suspend legislative houses and local government councils.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIndeed, the Federal Government has since realised that it is unjust and immoral to remove a Governor of a State since the President exclusively controls the armed forces, the police and other security agencies. To that extent, the Federal Government should drop the dangerous plan to remove the Governor of Anambra State and impose a Sole Administrator on the eve of the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the State.\u201d\n\nThe senior lawyer advised President Muhammadu Buhari to seek legislative approval to legitimise the deployment of the armed forces in Anambra, and other states where the federal government is currently conducting counter-insurgency operations.",

          "text": "Tolu Ogunlesi, special assistant on digital/new media to President Muhammadu Buhari, says the ban on Twitter in Nigeria is a win-win situation for the country and the tech company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe federal government had, in June, suspended the operations of Twitter indefinitely over \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d.\n\nThe ban was announced two days after Twitter deleted Buhari\u2019s tweet wherein he threatened to treat Nigerians \u201cmisbehaving\u201d in \u201cthe language they understand\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, in an interview on Cable News Network (CNN), Ogunlesi said a committee set up to negotiate with Twitter has made progress.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the ban will be lifted as soon as the conditions given by the federal government have been met.\n\n\u201cThe ban is a win-win for Twitter and the government of Nigeria; that\u2019s the view I get from the negotiations and I am happy about that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are indeed very close to a resolution and you know one thing I must say is that the media seems to often paint a picture of some sort of adversarial negotiation or contest of sorts, but it has been a very amicable, very positive conversation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think both sides have benefited from listening to each other and then sharing their views, and I think we are very close. During the Independence Day speech of the president on the 1st of October, he did actually say he\u2019s approved the lifting of the ban as long as the ministerial committee set up is happy that the conditions that have been outlined have been fulfilled by Twitter. So, we are very close, no doubt about that.\n\n\u201cI look at the conditions from short term, medium and long term. For example, with taxation, the condition is not that you must start paying taxes. The condition is that you must commit to having a conversation with the tax authorities about paying taxes. It\u2019s not an insistence on paying taxes today; it\u2019s more about commitment and timelines.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the social networking service was suspended over Buhari\u2019s tweet, Ogunlesi, who was a regular user of the microblog before the ban, said the president\u2019s tweet didn\u2019t violate Twitter\u2019s terms.\n\n\u201cThe context is a lot bigger than that, but of course, from a media point of view, you find that usually, and this is not just in Nigeria. There\u2019s often an event or something that happens that kind of triggers something else,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI do not believe that that tweet violated the terms of Twitter. The president spoke in his capacity as the president of Nigeria, and it was a law enforcement message. I think it\u2019s perfectly valid for the president of Nigeria to speak, and he was contextual and specific. It was not a message to law-abiding Nigerians; it was a message to people who have chosen to inflict violence on other Nigerians.\u201d\n\nHe also said the federal government is keen on welcoming technology and providing an enabling ground, adding that tech companies must ensure that their platforms are not used in ways that undermine democracy, peace and security.",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "text": "The family of Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has for many years secretly owned a web of offshore companies in Panama, the British Virgin Islands, and other tax havens, according to a new leak of documents known as the \u201cPandora Papers\u201d.\n\nThe Kenyattas have dominated Kenyan politics since the country\u2019s independence in 1963. In addition to the vast political power amassed over the decades, they are believed to be one of the richest families in the country \u2013 with significant interests in the financial services, hospitality, agriculture, and media sectors.\n\nIn 2018, President Kenyatta told the BBC \u2013 while stating his intention to fight corruption and promote transparency \u2013 that his family\u2019s wealth was known to the public, and that he had declared his assets as required by law.\n\nHowever, secret offshore assets belonging to the Kenyattas have been uncovered by an investigation published on Sunday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Finance Uncovered, Africa Uncensored, and other news organisations.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe secrets were discovered from almost 12 million documents from the archives of 14 law firms and agencies that specialise in offshore company formations. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and processed by more than 600 journalists, as part of a global investigation that\u2019s taken around two years.\n\nSeven members of the Kenyatta family, including the president, are revealed, through the Pandora Papers, as being variously connected to more than 10 offshore companies and foundations. The Kenyattas\u2019 offshore investments include a company with stocks and bonds worth $30 million.\n\nLargest-ever leak\n\nThe Pandora Papers represent the latest and largest, by data volume, in a series of major leaks of financial data about the offshore world over the last five years.\n\nIn 2016, the Panama Papers, which consisted of 2.6 terabytes of data, leaked from the law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The following year saw the release of the Paradise Papers, worth 1.4 terabytes of data.\n\nContaining 2.94 terabytes, the Pandora Papers is the largest of the three leaks. The files come from a much wider array of offshore providers than previous leaks, with locations ranging from Vietnam, Belize, and Singapore, to the Bahamas and Seychelles.\n\nThe papers expose the secret offshore affairs of 35 world leaders, including current and former presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state. Other world leaders named in the Pandora Papers include Gabon\u2019s President Ali Bongo Ondimba; President of Congo-Brazzaville, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nLinks were found between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials, including ministers, judges, mayors, and military generals from 117 countries.\n\nMore than 100 billionaires feature in the leaked data, as well as celebrities, rock stars, and business leaders.\n\nThe global offshore economy enables some of the world\u2019s richest people to hide their wealth and, in some cases, pay little or no tax. Also, many use shell companies to hold luxury items such as property and yachts, as well as hidden bank accounts and art. For politicians, these help them loot state resources.\n\nOther African countries featured\n\nUp to 10 Nigerian politicians are implicated in the Pandora Papers, including former Anambra State governor Peter Obi, according to findings from the leaked documents. Fellow major African oil producer, Angola, has nine politicians.\n\nFive Ivorian politicians and three Ghanaian public officials were helped by foreign agents to stash money suspected to be looted away.\n\nChad, Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Congo Brazzaville have two politicians apiece, Gabon has three politicians while Mozambique has one.\n\n\u201cThese reports will go a long way in enhancing the financial transparency and openness that we require in Kenya and around the globe,\u201d President Kenyatta\u2019s spokesperson, Kanze Dena Mararo, said in response to the ICIJ Pandora Papers leaks, without contesting the allegations.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "With its massive subsea Internet cable, Google says it\u2019s playing the long game in Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the first Google for Africa event held today, October 6, 2021, global Internet giant, Google, has announced significant initiatives for the African continent. They include a $50 million venture fund for black-led African startups, small business loans, grants for non-profits, and most importantly, the launch of Equiano, a subsea Internet cable to increase Africa\u2019s Internet capacity\n\nIn partnership with Safaricom, Google will also be kick-starting a device financing plan to ensure people actually have smartphones and other Internet-enabled devices to access the Internet.\n\nA little over a year ago, Google announced similar initiatives and affirmed plans to deepen Internet access in Africa and contribute to the continent\u2019s digital transformation. While we could open discussions about Google\u2019s impact later, CEO, Sundar Pichai, reaffirmed this again today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African. Today I\u2019m excited to reaffirm our commitment to the continent through an investment of $1B over five years to support Africa\u2019s digital transformation to cover a range of initiatives from improved connectivity to investment in startups.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle has made significant and relatively successful strides in Africa\u2019s startup space. More on that later. However, its efforts at deepening Internet connectivity has had mixed results both in Africa and outside the continent.\n\nGoogle has, so far, focused its efforts on launching Equiano. This 100 terabit fibre optic cable will stretch from Portugal to South Africa, with landing points in Namibia, Nigeria, and St Helena and will connect Africa with Europe.\n\nSidenote: Fibre optic cables help transmit Internet signals across vast oceans and seas at high speeds. Equiano is Google\u2019s third cable named after a Nigerian writer and abolitionist, Olaudah Equiano who was sold into slavery, bought his freedom and helped abolish slavery in the United Kingdom.\n\nThough Africa already has 13 subsea cables, Google\u2019s new cable features a more advanced (fibre switching) technology. A more compact, cost-effective and power-effective switching solution. So it would be a massive boost to the current crop of cables in Africa.\n\nGoogle also claims that it would lead to a 21 per cent reduction in Internet prices, increase Internet speeds, and help create 1.7 million jobs in Nigeria and South Africa by 2025.\n\nBut there\u2019s one small problem. Africa\u2019s current fibre optic cables already have up to 170 terabits combined capacity at the Eastern and Western shores, but just 5.8% (10 terabits) on average gets to the last mile (regular people living far from the coast).\n\nSidenote: As of 2020, Nigeria only used 10% of the MainOne cable capacity, nearly ten years after installation\n\nThe big question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNitin Gajria, Managing Director, Sub-Saharan Africa, Google. Source: Supplied\n\nGoogle\u2019s services which include, Video conferencing, streaming, and emails, require reliable Internet. So then comes the question, why is Google adding an extra 100 terabits to what is already a huge glut of underused capacity in Africa?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNitin Gajria, Managing Director, Sub-Saharan Africa, Google, explains that when it comes to large infrastructure like laying a subsea cable, one has to think about it over a very much longer period.\n\n\u201cYes, there is already a huge capacity. But if you project the numbers out into the future, we have 300 million people we\u2019re expecting to get online over the next few years. So the demand for data would continue to rise exponentially. We\u2019ve also seen data cost coming down across the continent. So we\u2019ve got to think about data demands over several years out.\u201d he says.\n\nThough Gajria agrees that last mile Internet delivery has been one of Africa\u2019s biggest challenges, he points out that Google is currently not delivering connectivity to end consumers. A job mainly for telecom companies (telcos) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with several telcos and ISPs, both within the Equiano stream of thinking and otherwise, to facilitate last-mile deliveries. We\u2019re also working on innovative solutions to help bring down the cost of setting up traditional infrastructure to bring data to underserved regions.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Google has previously implemented projects aimed at deepening Internet access to underserved areas.\n\nOne of the most prominent initiatives was the Loon project. Started in 2011 by Loon LLC, Google\u2019s subsidiary working on providing connectivity to rural and remote areas, It used high altitude balloons of 18 km \u2013 25 km to beam wireless connectivity, mainly in South America and Eastern Africa.\n\nIn January 2021, it shut down Loon, stating that it couldn\u2019t find a sustainable business model and partners for the project.\n\nGoogle\u2019s free wifi initiative, which it launched in 2015, offered free wifi in thousands of public places in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It also worked with several partners on this project. But in February 2020, it announced that it was shutting down the project, claiming that data had gotten considerably cheaper, making the wifi station irrelevant.\n\nOutside of the connectivity space, Google, like most other big techs, to be fair, has a litany of projects it started and killed almost abruptly for one reason or the other.\n\nSilver Linings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Google\u2019s partnership with CSquared, a shared Internet infrastructure provider working to provide last-mile Internet access to some African countries, has seemingly endured. It is currently active in three countries: Uganda, Ghana, and Liberia.\n\nCSquared started in 2013 as a project within Google. The tech giant is now a shareholder after bringing in Convergence Partners, International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Mitsui as investors in 2017.\n\nCharles Murito, Director, Sub Saharan Africa, Government Affairs & Public Policy, reveals that this scheme has deepened connectivity in these countries.\n\n\u201cWhen you take countries like Liberia where connectivity in the metro areas was deficient. We were able to improve connectivity in Liberia in a way that had not been seen before, especially post the war,\u201d he reveals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve partnered with organisations like that. Some we have an interest and others like Liquid Intelligent Technologies, who are also doing good work across the continent,\u201d he says.\n\nOn September 16, 2021, Liquid Technologies announced that it is now delivering high-speed Internet to communities in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, using cutting-edge Wireless Optic Communication (WOC) Technologies from Project Taara at X, Alphabet\u2019s (Google\u2019s parent company) semi-secret research facility.\n\nJust 4.8 km away, separated by the Congo River, lies Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo, where the Internet was considerably cheaper and faster than in Kinshasa. This was because telecom services providers could not lay fibre cables across the Congo River, the world\u2019s deepest and fastest river.\n\nFibre cables had to travel 400km around the river to get to Kinshasa, making the Internet five times more expensive.\n\nLiquid tried to solve this problem for two years but with little success. But with Project Taara, the company could beam Internet signals across the river in just a few days.\n\nLiquid briefly explained how this technology works in a statement to Techpoint Africa thus:\n\n\u201cIn the same way traditional fibre uses light to carry data through cables in the ground, Taara\u2019s WOC links use narrow, invisible beams of light to deliver high-speed connectivity. Capable of transmitting up to 20 Gbps each, Taara\u2019s links across the Congo River will help the 17 million people in these cities have access to much faster and more reliable connectivity.\u201d\n\nThough the Taara team is not confident it will maintain peak performance in different weather conditions, it believes it will still provide reliable and affordable Internet for both cities.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018, Google invested $47 billion in capital expenditure, which helped build Equiano.\n\nWith Africa\u2019s well-documented bottlenecks for Internet infrastructure, and the actual number of Internet users in Africa sketchy, Google is making a massive bet on the continent, and it has good reasons to make sure it pays off. Long term that is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policy analysis is my daily bread. Looking to chat?

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s Crypto Explorer , a monthly series featuring in-depth analysis on the crypto sector in Africa. Expect topics on innovation, regulation, financial inclusion, remittance, eCommerce, and more. for email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, July 22, 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that the pilot scheme of its digital currency \u2014 eNaira \u2014 will launch on October 1, 2021.\n\nHowever, due to reasons ranging from a clash with Independence Day activities to the ill-preparedness of commercial banks, the much-anticipated launch was postponed\n\nWhile addressing the postponement, CBN\u2019s Director of Communications, Osita Nwasinobi, again recited some benefits of the eNaira \u2014 peer-to-peer transactions, reduction of cash use, and financial inclusion.\n\nWhile the eNaira has its benefits, concerns have been pointed out regarding transparency and how it could aid illegal financial practices by those in control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a Twitter user, a closed or private ledger means crucial information such as supply rate, burn rate, and every eNaira transaction will be known to and controlled solely by an entity \u2014 trusted intermediary \u2014 that has access to the blockchain.\n\nCBN said it's expensive to print Naira and E-naira will reduce this cost because they will print Naira electronically. You already know they are dabbling into an area they don't know. No Open Ledger, we can't see current supply/ burn rate so it's laundering on steroids. Goodluck \u2014 $AYOBAMI \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfb (@dondekojo) September 21, 2021\n\nWhile we\u2019ve explored how this currency will work, what it means, and how it differs from other digital currencies, we\u2019re yet to examine the possibilities of a closed or private blockchain aiding \u201claundering on steroids\u201d\n\nWhat is a private blockchain?\n\nA private blockchain is accessible and controlled by a single entity, organisation, or enterprise. The Hyperledger Fabric, chosen to run the eNaira by the CBN, is an example of a private blockchain.\n\nThey\u2019re also known as permissioned blockchains. A trusted intermediary can choose to grant full or partial access to another entity if it deems fit.\n\nBitcoin made blockchain technology famous, so like the cryptocurrency, the tech is associated with decentralisation and openness. But private blockchains are the opposite. Although it\u2019s the same tech, there\u2019s no form of decentralisation; a single entity controls everything.\n\nBlockchain is a database or a record book, if you like, that stores data. It is a distributed ledger that stores transactions that have been validated on a blockchain network.\n\nValidated transactions are aggregated and stored in a block; this block is added to previous blocks creating a chain, hence the word blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the case of private blockchains, the process of validating transactions that leads to the creation of blocks is decided by one entity, bearing similarity with an original banking system.\n\nHow about public blockchains?\n\nPublic blockchains, like the name implies, are open to everyone. Anyone can join the network and see transactions that have taken place. For example, by simply typing https://www.blockchain.com/explorer on your browser, you can search for a Bitcoin address, see the number of Bitcoins in it, and the transactions it has performed.\n\nAlso, anyone with the proper hardware can validate transactions on a public blockchain. While it\u2019s open to the public, it is secure and offers a lot of transparency.\n\nHow private blockchains work, compared to the public ones\n\nImmediately, the difference between a private and public blockchain is clear \u2014 control and access. However, to get an idea of how much power a trusted intermediary \u2014 in this case, CBN \u2014 has on a private blockchain, it is important to break down the transaction process.\n\nAccording to an explanation by Bird & Bird, a global law firm, a trusted intermediary controls a private blockchain.\n\nThis means the CBN will have total control. A trusted intermediary can either build the entire blockchain software from scratch or licence it from a third party like the Hyperledger Fabric, as the apex bank did.\n\nThe private blockchain network is set up using nodes that run this software. A node is simply a system that validates transactions in a blockchain network.\n\nThe CBN will run the validator nodes itself or use a subsidiary \u2014 most likely BItt Inc. It will also create an app with which users \u2014 Nigerians \u2014 can interface with these nodes. Once you carry out a transaction on the app, it is relayed to the CBN who validates them.\n\nAlso, there are two major ways to set up a private blockchain:\n\ndistributed ledger model, and\n\nshared ledger model.\n\nFrom the presentation by the CBN containing the role of strategic stakeholders in the eNaira launch, it can be inferred that the regulator will most likely use the shared ledger model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of eNaira presentation\n\nIn the presentation, banks, fintechs, the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBBS), and other stakeholders will be playing major roles in the deployment of the eNaira, a setup that fits the shared ledger model.\n\nUsing this model, the CBN has the master node and a full copy of the ledger. We then have the first layer of participants \u2014 banks or fintechs \u2014 that run nodes but only have a partial copy of the ledger and have their information limited to the apex bank\u2019s control.\n\nThe third layer of participants is the app users.\n\nIn contrast, a public blockchain does not have a trusted intermediary. There\u2019s a network of equal nodes that interact with each other.\n\nPer Bird & Bird, \u201cthese nodes are responsible for verifying and relaying the transactions on the blockchain network, but they can also act as end-user software that allows a user to create transactions and/or mine/verify transactions before they are added to the blockchain.\u201d\n\nUsing Bitcoin as an example, the transaction starts from a wallet broadcasted to the network where the digital signatures are verified.\n\nThe mining nodes then try to validate the transaction using something called a consensus algorithm \u2014 a rule written into the blockchain software that makes certain transactions are validated correctly. The whole process is known as proof of work (PoW).\n\nA private blockchain goes through somewhat the same process, but instead of a network of nodes deciding the fate of the transaction, it is done by one entity.\n\nHow much power does a private blockchain give the CBN\n\nAdedayo Adebajo, Managing Director of Jelurida Africa, the blockchain company behind Ardor, an open-source blockchain network, believes that while blockchain is immutable, in the case of a private blockchain, the owners can doctor information on it.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re running a private blockchain, there are a number of things you need to sacrifice, part of which is transparency.\n\n\u201cSome of the reasons people run a private blockchain is to remove the need for transparency, to be able to scale, increase transaction speed with reduced energy consumption, and reduce the need for numerous gadgets in terms of nodes.\u201d\n\nHe says it bears a lot of resemblance with the kind of banking operations we have today, the difference being that the currency is digital and could in the future be deployed for decentralised applications where smart contracts will come into play.\n\nInterestingly, he points out that manipulation of information is possible on a private blockchain.\n\n\u201cIt becomes pretty much easy for people to manipulate data and go away with it for a while before it can be discovered or detected as the nodes continue to generate.\u201d\n\nAdebajo believes that a public blockchain would be more suitable for creating the eNaira, making information available to many people.\n\nThis corroborates @dondekojo\u2019s tweet that burn rates or circulation rates will be unknown.\n\nBurning in this sense is reducing the amount of a particular currency in circulation to control inflation. If a certain amount of eNaira were to be burned, it would be almost impossible to confirm if it was indeed burned or laundered.\n\nWould a public blockchain be better?\n\nWhile launching the eNaira on the public blockchain could provide more transparency, it also has limitations.\n\nTo maintain security, public blockchains such as Bitcoin run thousands of nodes which makes transactions very slow.\n\nIf this is applied to the eNaira, transactions will take minutes to several hours to complete.\n\nAlso, running a validator node on the Bitcoin network is expensive.

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello.\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nBuilding Patricia after failing in 13 businesses\n\niWello\u2019s healthcare service for \u20a6300 ($0.76)\n\nAfrican teachers and educational technology\n\nAirtel Money\u2019s partnership with Flutterwave\n\nBuilding Patricia after failing in 13 businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerseverance is one of the qualities of successful business owners. Although it takes time for a business to thrive, this usually depends on keeping your eyes on the goal regardless of obstacles.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s Chief Servant, M\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2, had a chat with Hanu Fejiro Agbodje, CEO of Patricia \u2014 an alternative payment solutions platform \u2014 about his failure in 13 other businesses before Patricia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this insightful discussion, Agbodje reveals how his failed business experiences later paid off.\n\nInterestingly, he just wanted to make \u20a630,000 ($84*) monthly, so in 2017, Agbodje started the company as a gift card exchange platform before evolving into a cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nOne of the things that struck me was that he kept a journal where he jotted down all his ideas. For me, that\u2019s pretty inspiring because in the past, I\u2019ve had some brilliant ideas, but I never remembered them because I didn\u2019t write them down.\n\nAs a neurodivergent person, this is something I want to start doing because I get easily distracted, forget things quickly, and rarely have light bulb moments just by thinking. So, once I\u2019ve forgotten an idea, it\u2019s difficult to recall the concept again.\n\nMoreso, despite having no technical background and being unaware of the existence of a tech community that could assist his business, Agbodje\u2019s 13 failed business experiences paid off immensely.\n\nDo you want to know how? Please, read this: From \u2018urgent\u2019 \u20a630k to $50m: How Hanu Fejiro Abodje built Patricia from scratch\n\nWant a different experience? You can watch it here: From \u2018urgent\u2019 \u20a630k to $50m: How Hanu Fejiro Abodje built Patricia from scratch\n\n*- dollar exchange rate in 2017\n\nAdvertisement\n\niWello is making healthcare available for \u20a6300 ($0.76)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an International Finance Corporation (IFC) report, Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s healthcare system remains the worst in the world. And few countries can afford the $34 to $40 per person per year that the World Health Organization (WHO) considers the bare minimum for essential healthcare services.\n\nAlso, per the United Nations (UN), most Africans, primarily the poor and middle-class, rely on underfunded public health facilities. At the same time, a small minority has access to well-funded, high-quality private health care.\n\nIn Nigeria, 83 million people live in poverty as of 2020 and can not afford basic health services.\n\nTo solve this, iWello, a telemedicine startup, is making healthcare available to Nigerians for \u20a6300 ($0.76).\n\nFounded in July 2021 by Ismail Adejonwo, the startup provides healthcare consultation and surgery funding for procedures like appendix removal, caesarean section for pregnant women, and kidney failure issues.\n\nFor context, kindly read: Nigerian telemedicine startup, iWello, is making healthcare available to people living on less than $1 per day\n\nAfrican teachers and educational technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe role of technology in education can be traced back to 2,500 years ago. And the main goal of incorporating technology into education is to change how teachers and students gather, access, analyse, present, and transmit information.\n\nThis research by the Academy of Finland says that technology transforms the teacher\u2019s role from that of a traditional knowledge provider to that of a facilitator, guiding the students\u2019 learning processes and engaging in joint problem-solving with the students.\n\nAnd around the world, education systems are investing in technology to help teachers be more effective.\n\nBut, given that the edtech industry is still in its early stages in Africa, what does the advancement of educational technology mean for teachers?\n\nJoy and Chimgozirim explained what this means here: What do current edtech innovations mean for teachers in Africa?\n\nAirtel Money partners with Flutterwave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel\u2019s mobile money platform, Airtel Money, has announced a partnership with African payments company, Flutterwave to expand Airtel Money\u2019s services to business across Eastern Africa.\n\nWhat exactly does this mean? Consequently, businesses in Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, Kenya, and Rwanda can accept Airtel Money payments and make bulk payments into Airtel Money wallets.\n\nThis partnership was declared just one day after Airtel Africa announced that Olusegun Ogunsanya, former CEO of Airtel Nigeria, has assumed the role of Managing Director and CEO of Airtel Africa on October 1, 2021.\n\nWhy this partnership? Airtel Money believes that as consumer behaviour changes and eCommerce grows, businesses will be increasingly required to accept mobile money payments from customers for goods and services.\n\nIt also claims that larger businesses are discovering that sending large amounts of money to their employees\u2019 or customers\u2019 mobile money wallets is less expensive, faster, and more convenient.\n\nIs this similar? Yes. In September 2021, Flutterwave announced a partnership with MTN Group, Africa\u2019s telecoms company, to enable businesses in Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia to accept payments via MTN Mobile Money (MoMo).\n\nOlugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, says, \u201cWe are excited to have partnered with Airtel Money to further advance local businesses payment methods which will allow them to increasingly provide more services to their customers, grow their customer base and revenue.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nFacebook Lost About $65 Million During Hours-Long Outage.

The long-awaited malaria vaccine for children is a breakthrough for science, child health and malaria control,\u201d said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cUsing this vaccine on top of existing tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year.\u201d\n\nMalaria remains a primary cause of childhood illness and death in sub-Saharan Africa. More than 260 000 African children under the age of five die from malaria annually.\n\nIn recent years, WHO and its partners have been reporting a stagnation in progress against the deadly disease.\n\nMatshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa described the breakthrough as one long hoped for an effective malaria vaccine and now for the first time ever, it\u2019s being recommended for widespread use.\n\nRead Also: BioNTech snubs Nigeria, target Senegal, Rwanda as base for malaria vaccine production\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s recommendation offers a glimmer of hope for the continent which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease and we expect many more African children to be protected from malaria and grow into healthy adults,\u201d she said.\n\nKey Findings\n\nWHO\u2019s findings demonstrates that the vaccine introduction is feasible, with good and equitable coverage seen through routine immunization systems.\n\nData from the pilot programme also shows that more than two-thirds of children in the three countries who are not sleeping under a bednet are benefitting from the vaccine.\n\nMore than 2.3 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in three African countries to date, an indication the vaccine has a good safety profile.\n\nAccording to the global health body, no negative impact has been recorded on uptake of bednets, other childhood vaccinations, or health seeking behavior for febrile illness.\n\nAnd in areas where the vaccine has been introduced, there has been no decrease in the use of insecticide-treated nets, uptake of other childhood vaccinations or health seeking behavior for febrile illness.\n\nThe test-run has also seen significant reduction (30%) in deadly severe malaria, even when introduced in areas where insecticide-treated nets are widely used and there is good access to diagnosis and treatment.\n\nModelling estimates that the vaccine is cost effective in areas of moderate to high malaria transmission.\n\nNext steps for the WHO-recommended malaria vaccine will include funding decisions from the global health community for broader rollout, and country decision-making on whether to adopt the vaccine as part of national malaria control strategies.\n\nMalaria in Nigeria\n\nWhile Malaria the prevalence in Nigeria has declined 23 percent in 2020 from 42 percent in 2010, it still tops the sources of morbidity and mortality in the country.\n\nNigeria accounts for 27 percent of the global malaria cases and 23 percent of global malaria deaths based on data from the World Malaria Report 2020.\n\nIn the next five years, the government aims to reduce malaria prevalence to a parasite prevalence of less than 10 people and mortality attributable to malaria to less than 50 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2025 as reflected in the new malaria strategic plan 2021 to 2025.",

          "text": "In search of high yielding investment instruments with the potential to hedge against inflation and exchange rate volatility, investors increased their bet in bond funds by over N10 billion in the first nine months of 2021.\n\nInvestors\u2019 interest in bond funds pushed the net asset value (NAV) of the dollar-denominated instrument from N222.59 billion at the beginning of the year to N233.24 billion in September.\n\nThis placed the bond funds ahead of its peers as it reported the highest asset growth among the seven mutual fund instruments listed on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nBonds, fixed income, equity, money market, real estate, mixed and ethical funds are all types of Mutual funds.\n\nA mutual fund is a professionally managed investment scheme, usually run by an asset management firm that pools funds from a group of people and invests their money in securities such as bonds, short-term debt and stocks.\n\nAlso referred to as a debt fund, a bond fund is a pooled investment vehicle that invests primarily in bonds (government, municipal, corporate, convertible) and other debt instruments that are mainly dollar-denominated.\n\n\u201cIn a bid to meet up with the increasing interest of investors to hedge their savings and investment against any devaluation of the naira, several investment outfits (registered with SEC) has set up dollar-denominated mutual funds,\u201d Ayo Ebo, Senior Economist/Head, Research & Strategy, Greenwich Merchant Bank said.\n\nRead Also: Bond yields are rising and investors are pulling out of stocks\n\nWhile ten funds under the bond mutual fund were listed on the Securities and Exchange website at the beginning of the year, the number increased to 12 at the end of September.\n\nAlthough the analysis of the SEC data revealed that the NAV of bond funds shed N2.43 billion year-to-date due to what market analysts called sell-off from high returns from the investment, the average unite price of the instrument increased by 7.41 percent to N25,115.11 in September from N23,382.44 in January.\n\nEight out of the ten bond funds listed on SEC website reported an increase in their unit price, a sign of the increase in the demand for the instruments, analysts said.\n\nWhy the buss around dollar-denominated instruments?\n\nNigeria\u2019s foreign exchange crisis which has persistently fuelled the depreciation of the naira and the high inflation rate that put the real return on investment in the negative are key reasons dollar-denominated investment is attractive for Nigerian investors, according to investment analysts.\n\nDepreciating currency\n\nA weak naira means that investors who hold their savings and investment in the local currency may continue to lose value in dollar-denominated terms.\n\nThis is one reason that necessitates the need for investors to have a portion of their investment portfolio in dollar-denominated assets, especially dollar mutual funds, which are more accessible due to the low entry amount required, analysts said.\n\n\u201cWithout any major attempt to increase or diversify Nigeria\u2019s FX proceeds through the export of non-oil products, we believe the FX crisis will continue to linger, specifically when crude oil prices drop significantly,\u201d Ebo said.\n\nMeanwhile, the naira at the unofficial market, the channel many Nigerians access the dollar from, has depreciated by 18 perecnt in 2021 from N465/$ on December 31 2020 to N568/$ on the 30th of September 2021.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s FX reserves rose by 1.35 prcent to $36.60billion as of 29 September 2021\u2013 the highest level since 12 February 2020 \u2013 signifying the sixth consecutive weekly accretion.\n\nThe current level of the reserves, according to analysts at Coronation Merchant Bank partially reflects the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation to Nigeria coupled with the successfully raised S$4.00bn in Eurobonds last month.\n\nIt should be able to \u201cprovide the apex bank with enough ammunition to defend the Naira in the short term. Nevertheless, FX turnover on the official markers remains relatively low. Thus, there may be continued pressure on the official and parallel exchange rates if the CBN does not increase supply,\u201d the research analysts said.\n\nHigh inflation rate\n\nAlthough Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate has slowed for five successive months to August, the country\u2019s high cost of living is still above the CBN\u2019s desired 6-9 percent.\n\nThe headline inflation number released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that inflation for August 2021 slowed to 17.01 percent year-on-year from 17.38 percent.\n\nWhile the inflation rate in August is the lowest in seven months, it was, however, not enough to overturn the negative real return on the Federal Government less risky short-term Treasury Bills (T-Bills).\n\nWhile average inflation-adjusted returns on the shorter 91-day and 182-day bills were -9.77 percent and -8.48 percent, respectively in 2020, the real return on the bills so far in 2021 has not been close enough to match the performance of last year.\n\nThe real return on T-Bills investment is still in the double negative figures. Factoring the 17.01 percent inflation rate in August against the interest rate reported in the last T-Bills auction result showed that the shorter 91-day and 182-day bills gave investors a real return of -14.51 percent and -13.51 percent, respectively.\n\nThe trend was the same for the longer 364-day bill. From a -6.96 percent real return on investment last year, the bill gave investors -9.51 percent in September.\n\n\u201cThe real return is still clearly negative because inflation is still very high,\u201d Yinka Ademuwagun, investment management analyst at ValuAlliance Asset Mg, said.",

In enthroning a high-performance culture, an organizational performance scorecard has been developed for each ministry.\n\n\u201cThe scorecard will be deployed in tracking key performance targets and deliverables of each Ministry and reports will be demanded on a quarterly basis. A formal assessment of performance targets and results achieved by each Ministry shall be conducted. These shall form the basis of further review and linkages to other key human resource processes.\n\nHe continued: \u201cOn our part, we have articulated, in the MEGA Agenda, a vision of where we want Edo State to be before 2050. Making Edo Great Again and Edo becoming the best state to live and prosper in Nigeria are promises we have made to the good people of Edo State who massively turned out to vote for this Government in September 2020.\n\n\u201cAs Commissioners and Special Advisers, the height of people\u2019s expectations of you and the Government you represent are unprecedented. We have no choice but to meet and deliver on the expectations of the people. As we serve the people, we must become champions of high performance, disciplined in execution and results-oriented.\u201d\n\n\u201cTimely response to the needs and requests from our people must become rooted in our DNA. We must demonstrate and demand \u2018value for money\u2019, a commercial mindset not previously associated with the Public Service,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted that the new members of the State Executive Council must embrace the Six Pillars of the MEGA Agenda and ensure it constitutes a rallying platform that shall generate an irreversible momentum that will industrialize, transform and build the capacity required to take advantage of the state natural endowments.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs a sub-national, we have been impacted severely by these realities, and as Commissioners taking on the reign of governance at these times, riding the storm will not be easy. These are inauspicious times and as a government, we are today faced with dwindling revenue base, caused mainly by drop in FAAC allocation, while our Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) is not at the desired level. COVID-19 continues to be a major threat to the health and wellbeing of our people, with a segment of the society suffering severe casualties.\n\n\u201cThese are no ordinary times. We are today living in a world that has been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic has been devastating across world economies, with adverse effects on healthcare systems. These have been worsened by insecurity, which has risen with civil strifes of different kinds, causing a failure of national and international institutions in a manner that was never anticipated.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to advise that the commissioners will be inheriting vastly improved Ministries, whose Organizational Structures and operating processes have been reviewed and brought in line with best practices in their respective areas.\n\n\u201cThe Public Service Transformation exercise has also focused on rebuilding human capacity within the ministries. We have thus commenced a structured recruitment of talented, young and experienced administrative and technical professionals to shore up the capacity gaps that exist in the public service.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur ICT capabilities have been strengthened and technology has been deployed to underpin many of our operating processes such that in the near future, the Edo State Government shall be so technology-enabled that manual processing shall gradually become a thing of the past.\u201d\n\n...",

Also, SIM acquisition is a contract between service providers and their subscribers, which requires the subscriber to have proper legal status, be of matured mind and rational enough to bear certain responsibilities, obligations and liabilities imposed by a contract,\u201d the commission said in a statement late Wednesday.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported the NCC\u2019s proposal that says \u201cSubscriber means a person not below the age of 18 years who subscribes to communications services by purchasing a subscription medium or entering into a subscription contract with a licensee.\u201d\n\nIn its response, the NCC said the regulation had not been finalised, and claimed earlier media reports were \u201cmisleading\u201d, even though it confirmed the proposed ban.\n\nRead the commission\u2019s full statement:\n\n*NCC not Disqualifying Nigerians from Getting SIM*\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) would like to draw the attention of the public to a publication in a section of the media, purporting that the Commission is developing a regulation to disqualify Nigerians below 18 years of age from getting Subscriber Identity Module (SIM).\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Commission wishes to categorically state that the said report is not only misleading and inaccurate; but a misinformation and mischaracterization of the proceedings of the Public Inquiry on the Reviewed/Draft Registration of Telephone Subscribers Regulations, which took place on Tuesday, October 6, 2021.\n\nThe Commission considers it necessary to set the record straight for the purpose of serving existing and potential telecom subscribers , investors and other stakeholders in the industry accurate information for making informed decisions.\n\nIn accordance with sections 70 and 71 of the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA), 2003 and the Commission\u2019s consultative engagement process, which define its rule-making process, the public inquiry was held for all relevant stakeholders to provide input on the draft regulatory instrument.\n\nThe age of 18 years for SIM acquisition proposed in the draft regulation is contingent on the constitutional provision, which makes 18 years the age of consent in Nigeria. Also, SIM acquisition is a contract between service providers and their subscribers, which requires the subscriber to have proper legal status, be of matured mind and rational enough to bear certain responsibilities, obligations and liabilities imposed by a contract.\n\nThe proposal is, therefore, to protect minors. Parents and guardians can acquire SIMs in their names on behalf of their children and wards in which case they assume whatever responsibilities or liabilities arise from the usage of such SIMs, a measure expected to also strengthen national security.\n\nWhile the Commission is progressively pursuing digital inclusion for all, the draft proposal is intended to guarantee increased monitoring of children and shield the minors from undue liabilities in line with NCC\u2019s Child Online Protection drive.\n\nHowever, the consultative engagement process is still ongoing, as the Commission is reviewing all input from relevant stakeholders in this regard and will consider and deliberate on all comments before issuing a final regulatory instrument.\n\nWe appeal to our media stakeholders to always fact-check their stories pertaining to telecoms regulatory issues and seek necessary clarifications for informed and accurate reporting as the Commission runs an open-house system.\n\nSigned:\n\nDr. Ikechukwu Adinde\n\nDirector, Public Affairs\n\nOctober 6, 2021",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government has said it plans to embark on more borrowing to finance the N6.258 trillion deficit in the proposed 2022 budget.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Hajiya Zainab Ahmed, announced this Wednesday after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the 2022 Appropriation Bill for an aggregate expenditure of N16.39 trillion.\n\nAccording to her, the government did not get enough from revenues and would continue to borrow to fund infrastructure projects.\n\nThe minister explained that Nigeria\u2019s revenues could barely accommodate services.\n\nShe noted further that the country\u2019s borrowings are still within acceptable limits despite the concerns.\n\n\u201cGovernment has been borrowing before this administration and continues to borrow and it is important that we borrow to provide developmental projects in the form of roads, rails, bridges, power and water for sustainable development in this country,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf we just depend on the revenues that we get, even though our revenues have increased, the operational expenditure of government, including salaries and other overheads, is barely covered or swallowed up by the revenue.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to borrow to be able to build these projects that will ensure that we\u2019re able to develop on a sustainable basis.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s borrowing has been of great concern and has elicited a lot of discussions, but if you look at the total size of the borrowing, it is still within healthy and sustainable limits.\n\n\u201cAs at July 2021, the total borrowing is 23% of GDP. When you compare our borrowing to other countries, we\u2019re the lowest within the region, lowest compared to Egypt, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, the very lowest, and Angola. We do have a problem of revenue.\n\n\u201cHowever, our revenues have been increasing. We just reported to Council that our revenues from non-oil has performed, as July, at the rate of 111%, which means outperforming the prorated budget.\n\n\u201cBut our expenditure, especially staff emoluments have been increasing at a very fast rate making it difficult to cope with funding of government. So, what we have to do is a combination of cutting down our cost, as well as increasing revenue to be able to cope with all that is required for government to do, including salaries, pensions debt service, as well as capital expenditure.\u201d\n\nThe minister said council noted the changes in the 2022-2024 fiscal projections based on implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 and other necessary expenditures that should be accommodated in the 2022 Budget.\n\nShe also disclosed the key assumptions and targets underlying the budget provisions including, oil price \u2013 $57 per barrel; oil production \u2013 1.88 mbpd; exchange rate \u2013 N410.15/US$; oil revenue \u2013 N3.15 trillion and non-oil revenue \u2013 N2.13 trillion.\n\nOthers she gave are Federal Government\u2019s Independent Revenue of N1.82 trillion; Total Projected Federal Government Revenue of N10.13 trillion; Debt Service of N3.61 trillion; Statutory Transfers of N768.28 billion (including N462.53 billion capital component) and Personnel costs and Pensions of N4.69 trillion; (inclusive of N617.72 billion for the 63 GOEs).\n\nThe rest are Overhead costs of N792.39 billion (inclusive of N451.0 billion for the 63 GOEs); and Capital expenditure (inclusive of capital component of Social Investment Programme, capital in Statutory Transfers, capital of 63 GOEs, Capital Supplementation as well as Grants and Donor funding) of N5.35 trillion(inclusive of N647.08 billion for the 63 GOEs).\n\nOther are Recurrent Expenditure (Non-Debt) of N6.83 trillion, inclusive of N350.0 billion for the recurrent component of Social Investment Programme; and Aggregate Capital Expenditure of N5.35 trillion, inclusive of GOEs\u2019 capital expenditure, multilateral/bilateral loan funded projects, Capital Supplementation and Grants/Aid funded projects.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives has urged the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) to immediately review the remuneration of judicial officers in line with present economic realities.\n\nThe House which made the demand on Wednesday, also urged the Federal Government to, in line with judicial autonomy, accede to the increase in statutory transfer to the judiciary in the coming fiscal year.\n\nThe House noted the salaries were last reviewed was in 2007 when the dollar was N124 to 1$.\n\nIt noted that 13 years after the salary review, judicial officers officers had been on low incomes.\n\nFor instance, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, who is the most senior judicial officer in the country, earns N279,497 monthly; the Justices of the Supreme Court and the President of the Court of Appeal earn N206, 425 monthly; Justices of the Court of Appeal earn N206, 425 monthly, while Judges of the Federal High Court, National Industrial Court, FCT High Court, State High Courts, FCT Sharia Court of Appeal, FCT Customary Court of Appeal, Khadis of State Sharia Courts of Appeal and State Customary Courts of Appeal, all earn N1.8 million each as their annual salary, Vanguard reported.\n\nThe resolution followed a motion titled \u201cNeed to Review Remunerations of Judicial Officers and Increase the Statutory Transfer to the Nation\u2019s Judiciary\u201d, sponsored by Hon Onofiok Akpan Luke from Akwa Ibom State considered at the plenary.\n\nMoving the motion, Luke said it meagre amount was unfair, unconscionable, unjust and unrealistic that in the face of the several restrictions on the conduct of judicial officers.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe salary of judicial officers was last reviewed by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) in 2007 when the official exchange rate was N124 to $1 and the minimum wage was N5,000, and considering inflationary pressure and other economic factors that have depreciated the value of the Naira by over 60 per cent, the salary of judicial officers have become totally at variance with current economic realities.\n\n\u201cThirteen years after the salary review of judicial officers, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, who is the most senior judicial officer in the country, earns N279,497 monthly, the Justices of the Supreme Court and the President of the Court of Appeal earns N206, 425 monthly; Justices of the Court of Appeal earns N206, 425 monthly, while Judges of the Federal High Court, National Industrial Court, FCT High Court, State High Courts, FCT Sharia Court of Appeal, FCT Customary Court of Appeal, Khadis of State Sharia Courts of Appeal and State Customary Courts of Appeal all earn N1.8 million each as their annual salary.\n\n\u201cThe non-remuneration of judicial officers is partly caused by making the remuneration of judicial officers with political and public office holders in the same law.\n\n\u201cPart I of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and the Code of Conduct Tribunal Act restrains Judicial Officers from generally receiving gifts and operating private businesses except farming, and the Code of Conduct for Judicial Officers further limits engagements of Judicial Officers by restricting them from maintaining certain social relationships and commenting publicly, all with the aim of insulating judicial officers from any form or semblance of corrupt practices and improper conduct.\n\n\u201cIt is unfair, unconscionable, unjust and unrealistic that in the face of the several restrictions on the conduct of judicial officers, the judicial officers receive a meagre salary when compared with prevalent economic realities, thereby rendering them vulnerable to corruption.\n\n\u201cThe budget for the judiciary has remained at N110 billion since 2017, while the total budget size has continued to grow, leading to gross underfunding and neglect of the Judiciary over the years, which have affected productivity, increased frustration, and deflated the morale of judicial officers and staff.\n\n\u201cThe enormous and expanding responsibilities of the Judiciary owing to the country\u2019s increasing population of over 200 million people and the attendant financial implications for building new courts and refurbishing the existing ones aimed at greater access to justice by the people for effective and efficient justice delivery.\n\n\u201cThe Judiciary as an independent arm of government, the Executive does not have the constitutional power to reduce or review the budget of the Judiciary but only to submit to the National Assembly the exact budget as proposed by the Judiciary in conformance to the Constitution and constitutional practices of advanced democracies.\n\n\u201cPoor remuneration of judicial officers is a serious threat to the judiciary, which is a critical institution of the state and starving them of funds compromises their foundational functions and could present misfortune for our democracy as the Judicial Officers may not maintain impartiality and independence in the discharge of their judicial functions.\u201d\n\nAdopting the motion after securing a favorable majority vote of the members, the mandated its Committee on Judiciary to work towards an amendment of the Certain Political, Public and Judicial Office Holder (Salary and Allowances, Etc.) Act, by removing the remunerations of judicial officers from that of political and public office holders as well as ensuring compliance of the resolutions.\n\nIt was given 6 weeks to conclude the assignment and report back to the House for further legislative action.",

          "text": "Some residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have raised the alarm over what they described as a killing field, a few kilometers away from the Life Camp official residence of the FCT Minister, Mallam Muhammad Bello, known as Kuchibena, where suspected deadly cult activities take place, making life very miserable for residents.\n\nMuslin Rajab, a resident of Life Camp explained that within the past two months, several persons have died and about four persons have been murdered within the week in a most gruesome manner by suspected cultists.\n\nHe said that the last killing that reportedly jolted the community was a young man, whose body was said to have been dismembered, with his head chopped off and hung on a stick by his attackers.\n\n\u201cThe notorious slum already sandwiched by several privately developed estates, is now an operational theatre for hardened criminals who terrorise our neighborhood.\n\n\u201cMost residents appear to have resigned to fate amidst frustrating tension, and they are afraid to speak out, for fear of becoming easy targets to the blood-thirsty cultists and hoodlums, who are said to be under-aged, but operate as lords of the jungle there,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the community leaders, who pleaded anonymity, said that the bloody cult clashes have become too frequent and deadly, making people live daily with clouds of uncertainty and disillusionment.\n\nAccording to the source, the night hours are the worst period for the people, as the criminals have defied almost all the security measures put in place by the community and security agencies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile the FCT Police Command Public Relations Officer, Josephine Adeh, has not reacted to an enquiry regarding the incessant killings in Kuchibena, a letter formally addressed to the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), requesting for demolition of the criminal hideouts in the community confirmed the lawless situation there.\n\nThe letter dated April 28, 2021, and signed by the Galadima Divisional Police Officer, CSP Chinyere Akalaga, complained that the activities of the hoodlums had destroyed peace and order in the village and the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nThe Police specifically requested for dislodgement of illegal structures, settlements imposing security threats within the Galadima area.\n\nThe letter reads, \u201cconsequent upon Intelligence report received from the Commissioner of Police, FCT Command, Abuja from the Department of State Security Services and April 21, 2021, pointing Sahara Gate Market, Mab-Global Junction, Efab Queen, opposite market, Cashew Garden along Kuchibena and the popular Mami market in the same Kuchibena area among other major black spots in Galadima srca in the FCT Command.\n\n\u201cIt has become even more expedient that drastic action is taken by your agency to curb the excesses of hoodlums and miscreants that have over time terrorize the peace in and around the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cBecause of the above-stated facts, it may therefore please your authority in the interest of sanity to consider the following as measures for lasting solution: to include: Outright removal, demolition of illegal structures within the area under review. Liaise with the police on a joint assignment in a bid to dislodge them from their Wideouts.\u201d",

          "text": "The RTS, S/AS01 (RTS, S) malaria vaccine for African children has been approved by the World Health Organization.\n\nTedros Ghebreyesus, the agency\u2019s director-general, stated this at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nA two-year immunization program including children in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi led to the recommendation.\n\nHe expressed hope that the vaccine would help Africa\u2019s malaria prevention efforts.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is a historic moment. The long-awaited malaria vaccine for children is a breakthrough for science, child health and malaria control.\n\n\u201cUsing this vaccine on top of existing tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year.\u201d\n\nMalaria, according to the New York Times, is among the oldest known and deadliest of infectious diseases. It kills about half a million people each year, nearly all of them in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 among them 260,000 children under age 5.\n\nThe new vaccine, made by GlaxoSmithKline, rouses a child\u2019s immune system to thwart Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of five malaria pathogens and the most prevalent in Africa. The vaccine is not just a first for malaria \u2014 it is the first developed for any parasitic disease.\n\nIn clinical trials, the vaccine had an efficacy of about 50 per cent against severe malaria in the first year but dropped close to zero by the fourth year. And the trials did not measure the vaccine\u2019s impact on preventing deaths, which has led some experts to question whether it is a worthwhile investment in countries with countless other intractable problem.",

          "text": "Past students of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, spoke out on World Teachers\u2019 Day, Tuesday, about his contributions to and impact on their lives and career paths, just as the VP welcomed the teacher of the year, Ms. Oluwabunmi Anani, to the Presidential Villa and sent a video greeting to all Nigerian teachers.\n\nSeveral of Prof. Osinbajo\u2019s law students, many of whom are now eminent scholars and legal practitioners, had made a short film praising him, and many more had participated in a virtual event honoring the law professor who began teaching at the University of Lagos in 1981. (UNILAG). At the time, Osinbajo was just 24 years old.\n\nAt different periods spanning the 80s, 90s and 2000s, Prof. Osinbajo was a lecturer and then Senior Lecturer of Law at UNILAG, Professor of Law and Head of Department of Public Law at the University. He also taught Law at the Lagos State University.\n\nFormer UNILAG students and alumni explained how Osinbajo\u2019s lectures helped them become better scholars and successful career professionals in a heartwarming 5-minute video that went viral on social media on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to his students, Prof. Osinbajo was a brilliant and an excellent teacher.\n\nMost of the Vice President\u2019s former pupils recalled how he taught the Law of Evidence, noting that the then-young, pleasant lecturer presented lectures, referenced legal authority and citations without utilizing notes.\n\nAmong some of the former students of the VP who spoke in the video and at the virtual meeting yesterday were Prof. Fidelis Oditah, QC, SAN; Supreme Court Justice John Inyang Okoro; Mrs Bimbo Akeredolu, SAN; Mr. Wahab Shittu; Major-Gen (rtd). Pat Akem-Vingir; Prof. Adesoji Adesugba; a member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Iduma Igariwey; and the Deputy Chief of Staff in the Presidency, Mr. Ade Ipaye.\n\nOthers included Ms. Onikepo Braithwaite of Thisday Newspapers; Mr. Joseph Chiedu Ugbo, the Managing Director of the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC); Mr. Andrew Attah; Mr. Adekunle Awodiji; Mr. Bassey Ekwere; Mrs. Remi Ladega and Mr. Abdulrahman Abdurazaq, all legal practitioners.\n\nThere was also Mrs. Toyin Odusanya, who noted that Prof. Osinbajo also lectured her daughter. Ogun State Attorney-General, Gbolahan Adeniran, also spoke on the video, noting that the VP mentored and taught that it is the duty of Attorneys-General to ensure that \u201cjustice is placed at the heart of governance.\u201d\n\nEarlier before the surprise video, the VP had earlier received the Maltina Teacher of the Year 2020, Oluwabunmi Anani, and members of the Nigerian Breweries Limited, NBL, who sponsored the award. While celebrating the teacher based in Adamawa State, Prof. Osinbajo told her, \u201cyou have done us proud, as teachers; by your passion and commitment. (Unlike you) many people end up teaching because they have no choice.\u201d\n\nHe continued \u201cBut teaching is the most important, because everyone is a product of teaching. We have to find a way to promote that notion, which is why the NBL initiative of the Maltina Teacher of the Year is good. We need more support for this kind of initiative so that teachers will be appreciated.\n\n\u201cWe also have to invest more in teacher training and advancing the works of teachers in various ways. If a teacher is well-trained, he or she will have greater esteem and attract other people.\u201d\n\nHe added that while he shares the view that teaching is a calling, \u201cwe must find a way to make it more interesting.\u201d\n\nThe VP then said the Federal Government will do its part to ensure that teachers are better rewarded.\n\nAccording to him \u201cthe President is concerned about improving the lots of teachers, but States have a role to play.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that there were also moves to employ teachers into the public service starting from level 8 as against level 7.\n\nAlready, he said, \u201cthe Federal Government, on its part, has been doing a bit of work in trying to improve the lot of teachers. For example, there is a policy now, though not a law yet, it is still in the National Assembly, about moving the retirement age of teachers in the public service from 60 to 65. That\u2019s an additional five years; then we are also looking at their remuneration.\u201d\n\nThe VP then prayed for the Teacher of the Year, saying \u201cGod will help you as you help so many. You will not be disgraced in Jesus name.\u201d\n\nThe Maltina Teacher of the Year Award, which aims to recognize and celebrate exceptional teachers in Nigeria, is open to teachers in all secondary schools across the country. While State Champions that emerge from the 36 States and the FCT are recognised and rewarded, the overall National Winner is picked from these State Champions after further assessment.\n\nAnani, the current holder of the title, was accompanied on the visit to the Presidential Villa by Uzodinma Odenigbo, Head of Public and Government Affairs, Nigerian Breweries Limited.\n\nAfter receiving Anani and later watching the suprise video, Prof. Osinbajo expressed excitement at the gesture of his former students, saying that teaching was something he did effortlessly because of his passion for it.\n\n\u201cI certainly did not except to be celebrated in this way. Yesterday when I was doing a video recording for the Teachers\u2019 Day, I was saying, well, I must be close to 40 years; I didn\u2019t realize that it was 40 years since I started teaching.\n\n\u201cBut I am deeply grateful to all of you for the very kind words; your very generous remarks about me, about my humble efforts to pass information to you.\n\nIn the VP\u2019s own video to mark the World Teachers\u2019 Day, he recalled how his teachers and lecturers positively impacted his life and career.\n\nThanking all teachers for their contributions, he said in the video, \u201con this special day, the World Teachers\u2019 Day, I\u2019d like to thank all teachers in this nation, wherever you may be; whether you are in a village or in the city or in town, I like to wish you \u2018Happy Teachers\u2019 Day.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are extremely proud of what you do, we are extremely proud of your work. We sincerely appreciate all the sacrifices that you make every single day. We regard you as a major pillar of our society. Happy Teachers\u2019 Day. God bless you.\u201d",
