In life\u2019s journey, it isn\u2019t how far. Still, how well, indeed though satan should buffet if trials should come, I have this blessed assurance controlling all situations and saying to me it is well with my soul.\n\nCertainly, it is well. I made my journey into the ancient throne of Ife with faith in my heart and love for the keeper of it.\n\nFew impressions I would love to correct. If anyone knows otherwise, they are free to come up with facts.\n\nLet it be known that this decision to move on did not come because his majesty is married to another queen. As many would love to assume, throughout our life as a couple, I was the only married wife to him. There were side attractions, but it was never an issue.\n\nI never approached him with any revelation of any sort, as many believed he contacted me first and made his proposal known several months later.\n\nThe marriage was not an arranged one, as many have misconstrued. I never knew the prophetess said to have introduced me to him. Instead, he introduced her to me after I agreed to marry him. I was only being polite out of respect for him.\n\nI have never been pregnant all my life before Tadenikawo; my son is my first ever pregnancy with medical reports to back it up. The girl who is said to be my daughter is my niece.\n\nI did my best to endure and make it work; many times, I smiled through the struggle, but I have finally realised I had just one assignment, my son, and when God is done, He is done. He chose Saul to be king, and when He was done, He told the prophet Samuel I have moved on. Religion was never an issue between us; please refer to my interview on News Central TV. Instead, His Majesty has a picture he would love the world to see and perceive him as and another one which is his true self.\n\nToday I announce the beginning of a new dawn and the close of a chapter. Today, I am a mother to God\u2019s unique gift. I am no longer a slave to my thoughts of perfection. I, at this moment, announce that I shall no longer be referred to as wife to the Ooni of Ife or as Queen of Ile-Ife but as the Queen of the people and mother of my adorable Prince.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State has expressed the resolve of the state and federal governments to work round the clock to end the menace of banditry bedevilling the state and the country before the expiration of their tenure come 2023.\n\nMasari described the insecurity situation experienced in the northwestern part of the country and indeed the whole country as \u201cdomestic banditry\u201d though admitted that there have been some cases of \u201ccross-border banditry.\u201d\n\nThe Katsina State Governor made the disclosure on Wednesday after signing the 2022 appropriation bill into law which he said was primarily meant to complete the jobs started by his administration.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the banditry we are facing in Katsina and by extension northwest and some parts of this country is domestic banditry perpetrated by people that are known to us; that we have lived together with; of the same culture, same language, same religion. In fact, the only thing that differentiates us now from them is that they are bandits and we are not,\u201d he said.\n\nMasari urged the people of the state to rise up collectively as a people and take advantage of technology to defeat the hoodlums and restore the lost peace in the state.\n\nHe also admonished them to eschew the blame game and come up with meaningful solutions to the quagmire instead.\n\n\u201cCollectively as a people, we must defeat them. We must conquer our environment, have self-control of our environment, and dominate our environment.\n\nThere are two advantages that we have: our number and technology.\n\n\u201cPutting the two together, we will restore normalcy to our people. It is not beyond us to do that but what is most important people must sit up. There should be no more cowardice in the fight against these evil men and women. They are evil and represent evil and for us as a people, we should not shy away from our responsibilities by pointing accusing fingers. Before you point accusing fingers do the role that is expected of you.\n\n\u201cIn this fight, there is no loss. The only loss in this fight is if you run away and refused to fight. That\u2019s what the law says. It professes in this part of the country, that we are religious, we are Muslims, we have been thought and directed in situations like this on how to react. We should not under any condition run away we should stay and fight,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe only way to challenge these people is to show them that we are willing, determined capable of defending our territory and our area and our lives and our properties. This does not mean that we are taking away the responsibility of the government. No, far from it. It is reinforcing the purpose of government to provide leadership to secure life and property, honour and dignity of the people you lead. We must conquer this evil. We must. Many responsible people are already offering suggestions on how best to deal with these people because without peace there won\u2019t be development.\u201d",

          "text": "The member representing Umuahia North Constituency at the Abia State House of Assembly, Hon Kelechi Onuzuruike, has made a case for the lifting of the existing curfew imposed by the state government.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that the Abia State Government had imposed a curfew in the state earlier this year, between the hours of 12 am to 6 am in response to the security challenges prevalent in the southeast aftermath of the EndSARS protests held across the region and other parts of the country.\n\nHowever, Hon Onuzuruike while presenting a matter of urgent public importance to the house during its plenary sitting in Umuahia, on Wednesday, said that there is an existing curfew order in the state which was in response to the insecurity prevalent in the southeast region.\n\nThe lawmaker explained that \u201cthe curfew restricts movement from 12 am to 6 am. We are in the yuletide season and many well-meaning Abia sons and daughters will travel from their places of residence to the state, it is therefore imperative to lift the curfew to ease their ingress into the state.\n\n\u201cBusinesses that thrive at night particularly the hospitality business in Abia state have suffered a dearth of patronage due to the curfew, it is also pertinent to lift the curfew in order to cushion the economic losses of these business owners and save the jobs of Abians in their employ,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also explained that the yuletide season is typically characterized by celebratory functions some of which are better suited for the night or late evening.\n\nHon Onuzuruike further said that the Yuletide season is typically characterized by celebratory functions some of which are better suited for the night or late evening.\n\nOnuzuruike further submitted that lifting the curfew will serve to allow the populaces to attend these social functions and ease the undue pressure of driving recklessly to beat the curfew time which in most cases have resulted in the last of lives and valuable property.\n\nHe also emphasised that Abia State shares boundaries with other states and that during the yuletide, residents of other states can only access their respective states through Abia and that lifting the curfew will function to aid their passage through the state to their respective states without undue restriction.\n\nHis words, \u201cIt is true that the curfew was imposed for security reasons, however, the security agencies must put in place the necessary security framework that will ensure the security of Abians if the curfew is lifted\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the Abia House of Assembly has resolved and called on the executive arm of government led by Governor Okezie Ikpeazu to consider the lifting of the curfew to ensure a hitch-free yuletide.",

          "text": "A socio-political group, Osun Shall Rise Again, OSRA, has called for the immediate arrest and investigation of former Governor of the state, Rauf Aregbesola, and a former Secretary to State Government, SSG, Moshood Adeoti, for electoral fraud.\n\nThe group asked Aregbesola, currently the Minister of Interior, to stop playing God over the 2022 gubernatorial poll in the state.\n\nDAILY POST reported that Adeoti revealed how a huge amount of money was paid to the electorate to cast their vote for Gboyega Oyetola during the 2018 guber election.\n\nAdeoti, during a meeting of The Osun Progressive (TOP), a group that encompasses the supporters of the Minister of Interior, in Osogbo on Tuesday said Aregbesola spent a huge amount of money \u2013 N50,000 to N100,000 \u2013 on each voter during the 2018 Osun re-run election in seven units.\n\nThe OSRA said it \u201cwatched and listened with amazement the revelation by the former SSG who said Aregbesola told him how he bought the re-run votes in 2018 for between N50,000 and N100,000 in seven polling units. Their arrest will help the proper investigation and where they are found culpable, they should be tried and sentenced appropriately to serve as a deterrent to others.\u201d\n\nIn a statement signed by the Chairman and Secretary of the group, Saheed Bakare and Lanre Akeju respectively, OSRA noted that the same set of people ganging up against the governor had done similar things in the past, especially in the build-up to the last primary election in the state and the incumbent governor triumphed, declaring that \u201cwe believe it will not be any different this time either.\u201d\n\nThe group further called the All Progressives Congress (APC) national level to immediately wield the big stick on the duo of the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Lasun Yusuff, and Adeoti before they do further damage to the image and integrity of the party.\n\nThe group said, \u201cRecall that Yusuf was the first person who came out in the open to allege that APC never won the 2018 election in the State. Now, the former SSG is saying Aregbesola told him votes were bought. We believe such characters have no business remaining members of the party. This is why we want them sanctioned.\n\n\u201cBy their association openly with Aregbesola on Tuesday, they have shown their hands. But they should know that they are not God. So, they should stop playing God.\u201d the statement read.\n\nIn his reaction, the spokesman to the Minister of Interior, Sola Fasure, while speaking to DAILY POST described the OSRA\u2019s call for the arrest of his principal as ridiculous saying the group was sponsored.\n\nHe noted that the socio-political group was not intelligent about its assertion by calling for the arrest of a citizen without any tangible evidence against them.\n\n\u201cThere are a hundred ways of earning a living, if we investigate this so-called group, you will find out that they are sponsored. The call for the arrest of a citizen is ridiculous without evidence,\u201d he said.",

There are surviving witnesses.\n\n\u201cUnsolved crimes only lead to a culture of impunity.

          "title": "Obasanjo, Sultan, ethnic leaders, others list ways how to save Nigeria",
          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje and Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nEminent Nigerians, senior citizens, leaders of geopolitical zones and ethnic nationalities, including former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III; Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmed Gumi and Alhaji Murtala Aliyu, secretary general, Arewa, have identified key areas of the country\u2019s national life that must be urgently addressed to douse the socio-political and economic challenges as well as the separatist and self-determination agitations in the country.\n\nTheir observations are contained in a communiqu\u00e9 issued after an open dialogue meeting held physically in Abuja and virtually across the world on December 13. The meeting convened by Vision Africa (VA) and the Global Peace Foundation (GPF), a safe, non-judgemental and non-hypocritical platform aimed to bridge the gap across ideological, political, ethnic, religious and cultural divides, was a strategy to understand the conflict dynamics in Nigeria and chart a path to peace and integral security in the country.\n\nIt also seeks to usher in an increased understanding of the root of conflict and violence affecting Nigeria, increase positive relationship between the Nigerian government and various agitating groups across the country and focus on the importance of universal principles and shared values as the glue for social cohesion and sustainable peace.\n\nThe meeting listed the 1999 Constitution, which was described as \u2018Oligo-military in nature\u2019 and not representing the collective interest of Nigerians; social injustice and a failed economy, which has led to high prevalence of insecurity and neglect of oil exploration communities and minorities, as some of the key issues that deepen the threat to the nation\u2019s security and unity.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe 1999 Constitution does not embody the principles of justice, fairness and equality on which every democracy is founded. Thus, it does not fully protect the rights and interests of Nigeria\u2019s diverse constituencies. We call on the government to begin a process of constitution review, amend and rework the constitution, drawing on our previous constitutions, amongst other things, to synchronise/harmonise the laudable principles they embody.\n\n\u201cThis will ensure, not one-off solutions, but lasting change. Government at all levels must revisit and show sincere effort at understanding the core issues of dissidence and self-determination in Nigeria rather than incarceration, bullets and counter-attacks as government\u2019s response to agitations and unrest. The dialogue revealed that even in our divergence, there exists an area of convergence. We, therefore, commit to keeping the conversation room open for further dialogue so as to address and resolve the common challenge that is deepening this divide.\u201d\n\nThe meeting, a sequel to an earlier \u2018Inclusive Security Dialogue Retreat\u2019 held at the Airlie Conference Centre in Warrenton, Washington DC, USA, in October 2021, noted that national development cannot be achieved without focus on youths and the education sector, and an intentional inter-generational collaboration between the elite and the youths.\n\nIt charged religious and traditional rulers to put an end to all manner of incitement, misrepresentation and distortions of neighbours but rather to explore the country\u2019s diversity to discover what is best for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNational development without a focus on youths and the education sector, and an intentional inter-generational collaboration between the elite and the youths may not augur well for our security. Neither will the organised movement of street children and the disabled from one part of the country to another.\n\n\u201cWe postpone dooms day if it is ignored. National reconciliation conference that allows the principles of fairness, equity and justice; with an immediate consideration of legitimate agitations, and a collective effort to de-escalate the conflict and violence across the nation can no longer be ignored. The 1999 Constitution is Oligo-military in nature and does not represent our collective interests; it needs to be re-negotiated by national ethics.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cA constitutional review process, enabling peace and social cohesion is necessary. Government shall therefore provide an environment where a new Constitution from the representatives of the people by the people and for the people would emerge.\u201d\n\nThe meeting called for cessation of incitement, misrepresentation and distortion of the image and all other incidents that tend to pit various nationalities and creed against one another. It said Nigeria must explore its diverse religion and traditions to discover what is best for the people.\n\nIt added: \u201cGovernment must act sincerely as an unbiased arbiter to address insecurity headlong as the high prevalence of violent crisis, kidnapping, and fatal attacks in Nigeria are driven largely by social injustice and a failed economy.\n\n\u201cThe Church, the Mosque, and traditional worshippers must, as a matter of morality, step up to the responsibility of contributing to the collective re-engineering and moral rearmament urgently needed to salvage our nation, in fulfilling their roles as religious leaders and pulpit managers.\u201d\n\nThe communique also admonished: \u201cThe simple objective is to honestly and transparently come to the dialogue table or \u2018conversation room\u2019 irrespective of our political leanings or ideologies \u2013 focusing first, on our common humanity. The purpose of the retreat was to bring stakeholders together to address critical issues and seek lasting solutions to the grave challenges facing Nigeria, beginning from an affirmation of transcendent truths that define our common humanity.\n\n\u201cAs Nigeria, and indeed Nigerians, face an existential challenge, we circulated invitations to an intentional pool of key influencers, political leaders, regional leaders and leaders of separatist/agitating/self-determination groups; and high-level religious and civil society leaders, to address the conditions that foster unrest and radicalism globally \u2013 poverty, unemployment, social dislocation, cultural polarization, and a large demographic of disaffected and alienated Nigerian youths.\n\n\u201cHigh prevalence of insecurity in Nigeria is driven largely by social Injustice and a failed economy; hence fuelling continued agitation by the country\u2019s young alienated generation. Hunger and starvation in the land will get worse as continued violence and insecurity makes our farms unsafe for families whose basic sustenance is dependent on their yields from the farms. Neglect of oil exploration communities and minorities will only deepen the threat to our security and unity. Underdevelopment and isolation cannot remain the strategy else they will be uncomfortable to remain with the concept of Nigeria. The role of religious leaders and pulpit managers (traditional, Christian, Islam) in our moral rearmament and collective re-engineering is urgently needed to salvage our nation.\u201d\n\nThose physically present at the meeting include former president, Obasanjo, the Sultan of Sokoto, Rev. Pam Yakubu, executive secretary, Christian Pilgrims Commission; Sheikh Gumi, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai, Alhaji Murtala Aliyu, Amb. Ahmed, director, Northern Elders Forum, Amb.

          "text": "\u2022To engage House, constituents on next plan\n\n\u2022President\u2019s withholding of assent a decoy, says PDP caucus\n\n\u2022Saraki identifies options before legislature\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale, Juliet Akoje in Abuja, Emma Okonji and\n\nNosa Alekhuogie in Lagos\n\nDespite the resolve and threat by many senators on Tuesday to overrule President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s veto of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, the senate, yesterday, backed down from its resolve. In place of the move, which had seen the collection of signatures for the proposition, the upper chamber resolved to liaise with the House of Representatives on how best to handle the president\u2019s rejection of the electoral reform bill.\n\nThe senate also agreed to involve their constituents in the consultation process during the Christmas break before taking a final decision by January.\n\nBuhari had declined assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, citing issues with direct primaries provisions in the bill.\n\nBut members of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives said the reasons given by the president for not assenting to the bill were a mere decoy to stop the electronic transmission of results by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), using direct primaries as a peg.\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, went ahead to identify two plausible options currently before the National Assembly. Saraki said the legislature should either veto Buhari\u2019s decline of assent or remove the contentious provisions on direct primaries and send the bill back to the president for his assent.\n\nSome senators had at the end of Tuesday\u2019s plenary expressed anger over the president\u2019s rejection of the electoral bill, saying they have secured over 75 signatures ahead of a plan to veto the president at Wednesday\u2019s plenary. But the threat was eventually not carried out, as President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, while summarising the outcome of their closed-door session, said the senate would now consult with the House of Representatives on how to respond to Buhari\u2019s letter on the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill.\n\nAccording to Lawan, the provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) do not permit the upper chamber to exclusively take action on such matters in the absence of the House of Representatives, which had already embarked on vacation. He assured Nigerians that a joint position would be reached with the House after due consultation with the people to determine the appropriate line of action, when both chambers reconvene from the Christmas break in January.\n\nSpeaking on what transpired at the executive session, the senate president said, \u201cThe senate in a closed session deliberated on matters relevant to the workings of the senate, in particular, and, the National Assembly, in general.\n\n\u201cThe senate, also, in the closed session, discussed how to respond to the letter from Mr. President on the electoral bill amendment. The senate consequently resolved to consult with the House of Representatives in January, when both the senate and House will be in session.\n\n\u201cPresently, the House of Reps has gone on recess and, like we all know, the constitutional provision is for the senate and House of Representatives to jointly take the appropriate action.\n\n\u201cThe senate also resolved to consult with our constituents during our recess in January. The senate believes that our constituents have a role to play as the major stakeholders in the laws that we make in the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nHowever, the leader of the PDP caucus in the House, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, in a statement yesterday, said the president was actually trying hard to avoid the electronic transmission of results and had used direct primaries as a decoy.\n\nThe caucus assured Nigerians that it would ensure that its members exercised their constitutional power to veto the president whenever the matter was tabled for discussion\n\nChinda said, \u201cThe untold reason of declining is to avoid the electronic transmission of results, which will improve the credibility of the electoral system. This refusal, though contemplated, has left Nigerians confounded by a president, who continues to show utter disdain for the constitution and the reform of the institutions of state.\n\n\u201cUnder him, our institutions of state have regressed, to the point that the gains of previous institutional reforms embarked on by Our Great Party while in power, have been either lost to his inaction or to his deliberate ploy to leave our country worse than he met it. On this point alone, we are not convinced that he is interested in the reform of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cAs an opposition caucus, we will ensure that our members exercise their power under Section 58(5) of the constitution to veto the president whenever the National Assembly deems it fit to table the issue for discussion.\u201d\n\nSaraki Identifies Options Before Legislature\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, opposed Buhari\u2019s decision to throw out the entire amendments to the electoral bill, saying there are two options before the federal lawmakers.\n\nIn a statement, Saraki said the lawmakers could override the president\u2019s decline of assent or remove the contentious provisions on direct primaries and send the bill back to the president for his assent.\n\nThe former senate president stated, \u201cNow that Mr. President has conveyed his decision to decline assent to the Electoral Act [amendment] Bill, I am sure that I speak on behalf of millions of Nigerians in urging the National Assembly to act fast. This is because we cannot sit back and allow one contentious clause to throw away all the positives in the proposed Electoral Act (amendment) Bill.\n\n\u201cAt this point, two options are open to the National Assembly. They either veto the president\u2019s decline of assent or remove the contentious provision on direct primaries and send it back to the president for his assent. Whichever option our legislators choose, can be accomplished in the shortest possible time. We could have a new electoral law in January 2022.\n\n\u201cAnyone that has been following the mood of the nation knows that Nigerians desire to have a new electoral law that will lead to having a credible, free, fair, and peaceful process of electing our leaders. They want a system that will ensure that their votes truly count in the election of those who govern them.\n\n\u201cThis proposed electoral law is expected to reassure the youths, many of whom steer clear of the political process, because they have no confidence in the system. They believe the system is usually rigged and compromised. One way to bring this active demography into the political system is to enact a new law that will give them hope in our nation. This Electoral Act [Amendment] Bill serves that purpose.\n\n\u201cThis is why, as the representatives of the Nigerian people, the National Assembly must take a decision in the interest of our nation and its long-term democracy. The option of not doing anything after the refusal of the assent by the president is not an option. Our legislators in both chambers of the National Assembly and Mr. President must ensure that it becomes a law without delay.\u201d\n\nPDP: APC Scuttling Electoral Reform for Fear of 2023\n\nThe leadership of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of ruining the Electoral Act Amendment Bill because some key provisions of the bill would not allow them to rig the 2023 general election. PDP said its investigations revealed that the undercurrent was fear of failure at the 2023 general election and the positive implications that the electoral bill would have by guaranteeing electronic transmission of election results.\n\nThe opposition party recalled that APC had been in trepidation of the amendment to the Electoral Act due mainly to the provision of electronic transmission of election results, which would completely eliminate manipulations and alteration of results at elections.\n\nA statement by National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, said it was apparent that APC and the Buhari presidency were never committed to the amendment of the Electoral Act to ensure credible elections. PDP accused APC of triggering a controversy over the mode of primaries by political parties as a camouflage to scuttle the entire amendment, including provisions for electronic transmission of results.\n\nPDP said, \u201cIt is imperative to remind Nigerians of how the APC, in collusion with their leaders in the National Assembly, fought hard to stop the electronic transmission of results provision in the bill, but were resisted by Nigerians supported by the courageous action of the PDP Caucus in the House of Representatives, which staged a walkout only for the APC to orchestrate controversies and set the stage for the withholding of assent by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cThe main reason for this manipulation of the legislative process by the APC is to prevent the electronic transmission of results so that it can continue in its culture of rigging and electoral impunities, including alteration of results at collation, ballot box snatching, destruction of data, among others, just to cling to power against the will of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSuch is consistent with the APC\u2019s well-known machination against every genuine effort to instil credible, transparent, free and fair elections in Nigeria in the last six years. The APC thrives in electoral scam, duplicity, underhand dealings, violence and political brigandage, all in their heinous script to put Nigerians under perpetual bondage.\u201d\n\nPDP alleged that APC, having been rejected for its failures and having also self-decimated its structures across the country, had completely lost the capacity and goodwill for electoral contest and as such sought every means to subvert any process that could guarantee credible elections in 2023.\n\nPDP said the subversion of the passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill by APC further validated the fact that APC was averse to the aspiration of Nigerians and did not believe in democratic principles of credible elections.\n\nMore Nigerians React\u2026\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians from all walks of life have continued to react to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s refusal to assent to the electoral bill.\n\nA member of the House of Representative, Henry Nwawuba, said he did not see any power tussle at play in the whole situation.\n\nNwawuba, who spoke yesterday on the Morning Show of ARISE NEWS Channel, said, \u201cIt is part of the process that as it goes through the rounds in the House, we expose the law to public dialogue, and then we send it off for access. The speaker has said when we come back in January, we are going to take another look at the electoral bill, as it is not over yet.\u201d\n\nOn the news that almost 80 senators had agreed to override the president, Nwawuba stressed that the bill was in the courts of the National Assembly, which would come together and take the best decision in the interest of Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is a critical piece of legislation that is contained in our legislative agenda and we are determined to see them through. We are going to deal with the Electoral Act, by the grace of God, when we come back in January.\u201d\n\nA lawyer, Oluwole Osaze-Uzzi, who also spoke yesterday on the Morning Show, clarified the issue of indirect primaries, saying each party has the right to choose direct or indirect primaries.\n\nAccording to Osaze-Uzzi, direct primaries support every member of the political party to vote and choose the candidate for a particular election.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThere are many good sides of the bill and we must not lose sight of those aspects. There are also some aspects the president did not touch, which some find worrisome. The timelines have been extended for the conduct of primaries for all sorts of steps to be taken as expected by the law.\u201d\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Kunle Adegoke, said on the ARISE Morning Show that political parties were free to determine their internal affairs. Adegoke explained that the recent intervention by the legislature to regulate the affairs of political parties actually stemmed from the fact that the power given to the political parties to regulate their internal affairs had been substantially abused and this has led to a lot of agitation.\n\nAdegoke said, \u201cThe National Assembly knows the constitution that we run in Nigeria recognises only the legislature to take a final decision in this regard. We can as well pass the act all over again and the president will have no choice. We can\u2019t just say we have the power and we are free to exercise it, we must look at all factors that fit the process we are trying to take on.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022FG to provide N49.7trn, private sector N298.3 trillion\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has disclosed that Nigeria requires an investment size of N348.1 trillion to achieve the targets set out in its five-year National Development Plan (NDP) from 2021 to 2025.\n\nThe projected investment portfolio, he said, would be contributed by the government which would source for 14.3 per cent (N49.7 trillion) of the amount, while the balance of 85.7 per cent (N298.3 trillion) would come from the private sector.\n\nThe president spoke yesterday, at Abuja, during the formal launch and public presentation of the NDP, the successor to the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), 2017- 2020, which lapsed in December 2020.\n\nAccording to him, the overall target of the plan was to achieve a broad-based real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of five per cent on average during the Plan period; generate 21 million full-time jobs; and through an inclusive growth, lift 35 million people out of poverty.\n\nHe added that this would set the stage for achieving the government\u2019s target of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years, under the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS).\n\n\u2018\u2018This implies that successful implementation of the Plan will require a strong partnership between the public and private sectors.\n\n\u2018\u2018In this regard, a Development Plan Implementation Unit headed by the Vice President with the Honourable Minister of State, Budget and National Planning as the Vice-Chair will be established in the Budget and National Planning arm of the Ministry to ensure overall coordination with the Ministries, Departments and Agencies; sub-national governments; Private sector operators and Civil Society Organisations,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president recalled that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) had on November 10, 2021, approved the Draft National Development Plan, 2021-2025, which is the first of the envisaged Medium Term development Plans to implement the Nigeria Agenda 2050.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Plan, as a matter of deliberate efforts, is comprehensive and has the capacity not only to accelerate and sustain national development but also the attainment of various Regional and Global Agendas, including the AU Agenda 2063, ECOWAS Agenda 2050 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, 2030.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have no doubt in my mind that with effective and sustained implementation, Nigeria will achieve quantum leap in unlocking its potentials in all sectors of the economy for a sustainable and inclusive national development,\u2019\u2019 the President said at the presentation before the commencement of the weekly FEC meeting.\n\nCommending the Ministers of Finance, Budget and National Planning, the Leaderships of the National Steering Committee, the Central Working Group and the Technical Working Groups for the sacrifice and efforts in achieving this milestone, the president stressed that the implementation of the ERGP not only helped the country to exit the 2016 economic recession, but sustained a modest growth until the advent of the recent global economic challenges occasioned by the outbreak of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018The sustained implementation of the ERGP ensured execution of our social investment programmes and improvement in infrastructure across the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018In order to ensure a seamless transition and continue the implementation of the policies, programmes and projects of government, it became necessary to prepare a successor Plan to the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.\n\n\u2018\u2018I on September 9, 2020, therefore, inaugurated the National Steering Committee (NSC), co-chaired by the respected Mr. Atedo Peterside and the Honourable Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. (Mrs) Zainab Ahmed.\n\n\u2018\u2018Apart from the NSC the institutional arrangement for the preparation of the Plan also included; the Central Working Group (CWG), the Technical Working Groups (TWGs) and a strong Secretariat that supported the process.\n\n\u2018\u2018The process adopted for the preparation of the Plan was not only participatory and consultative but also inclusive; involving all segments of the society such as; Key Political Parties; Government Agencies; Labour Unions; Youth Organizations; Civil Society Organizations; Women Society; Farmers\u2019 Association; ALGON; Traditional and Religious Leaders and Representatives of People with Special Needs; and Development Partners.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the broad objectives of the Plan include the establishing a strong foundation for a concentric diversified economy with robust MSME growth and a more resilient business environment as well as investing in critical, physical, financial digital and innovation infrastructure.\n\nThe president added that the Plan was also expected to build a solid framework to strengthen security and ensure good governance while also enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy population.\n\nPresenting the Plan to the president, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said the plan would focus on investing on massive infrastructure, ensure economic stability, enhance the investment environment, and improve on social indicators and living conditions of Nigerians, among other targets.\n\nShe further stated that the plan was a pointer to the type of Nigeria that all Nigerians desire, adding that it would encourage the use of science, technology and innovation to drive the growth being targeted.\n\n\u201cIn order to have the future we all desire, the plan is developed to play a sizable role in the product complexity space internationally and adopts measures to ease constraints that have hindered the economy from attaining its potentials, particularly on the product mapping space.\n\n\u201cThe plan provides for the implementation of major infrastructure and other development projects across the six geopolitical zones and opening up of opportunities for the rural areas to ensure balanced development and increased competitiveness,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThe plan seeks to invest massively in infrastructure, ensure macroeconomic stability, enhance the investment environment, improve on social indicators and living conditions, tackle climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience strategies, among others,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) has hailed the Buhari\u2019s administration for the initiative that has created the series of economic development plans so far under its watch, noting that no administration, in Nigeria\u2019s history, had been that inclusive.\n\nThe Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Ekiti state, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, who was represented by the Governor of Kebbi State, Alhaji Atiku Bagudu, noted that the new NDP 2021-2025 was a product of collaboration and consultation between the federal and state governments.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwe congratulate Mr. President for launching the 2021-2025 Development Plan as ably introduced by the Minister of National Planning.\n\n\u201cWe had an economic recovery growth plan that expired in 2020, which has achieved the objective of, among others, helping Nigeria exit twice from the recession and now we have a plan in place for 2021-2025 that is further aimed principally at ensuring that the gains have been consolidated and Nigerians are being continuously included.\n\n\u201cThis government, more than any other, has taken deliberate, active steps to include all economic groups and support them more than has ever been done in order that they achieve their economic objectives, in order that the country\u2019s economy continues to provide for all and we will witness more prosperity. We congratulate and I\u2019m sure all of us in the 36 states and FCT are very happy.\n\n\u201cWe have been consulted, some of us who are members of the various committees. It\u2019s a consultative programme and we appreciate both the President and the Vice President because under them, particularly the National Economic Council, which is the major economic decision-making body of the Federation, has been quite inclusive, it\u2019s not a monologue, states are being given the pride of place\u201d, he further said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

For us to come out of the recession that we found ourselves in the previous period, we must have had the fortune of passing the budget and getting Mr. President to sign in time.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe that the economy of Nigeria, and Nigerian businesses especially, will continue to benefit from the passage of the appropriation bills in time and the assent by Mr. President, accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it clear that our desire is to provide legislations for the peace, order and good government of our country.\u201d\n\nLawan further stated that the Red Chamber would consider the report of the Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution as soon as it is presented early next year.\n\n\u201cWhen we return, we have one major that has not been attended to at all as a chamber, and that is the constitutional amendments.\n\n\u201cOur Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution has been doing its work. But as a chamber, we haven\u2019t finished working on it.\n\n\u201cWe are expectant that our Committee on the review of the constitution will be presenting the report to this chamber as soon as we resume. The committee has done so much, and the report is almost ready.\n\n\u201cWhen we harmonise with our colleagues in the House, we should be able to vote on the issues that will particularly bring about peace, unity and good government in our country, before such bill will be sent to the State Houses of Assembly for concurrence,\u201d the Senate President said.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, we must thank Almighty God that almost all those major items we reflected in our legislative agenda as a chamber has been attended to.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that has been left out, including the review or amendment to our standing orders on how our committees have better and more clearly defined jurisdictions and, of course, how we conduct ourselves here as a chamber.\n\n\u201cAnd this is because we\u2019ve remained united even in the face of sometimes very difficult issues. We have gone through such difficult moments with dignity and respect for each other, and we have come out even stronger,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reminded his colleagues of the role of the Senate as an institution to stabilise the polity, particularly against the backdrop of issues likely to surface ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cNext year, by the grace of God, will be the last lap of our tenure. So, we have a lot to ensure that we finish all the things that we have penciled down for ourselves and, of course, there are many other issues that from time to time will be coming up in our polity.\n\n\u201cThis Senate is supposed to play that role of stabilising the polity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd I daresay, that the members of the National Assembly, particularly the Senate, is a stabilising institution in the polity of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nLawan underscored the need for the National Assembly to work with the executive arm of government to provide the needed resources, as well as oversight the use of such funds in the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe killings across the country are so bad, and it is not acceptable to us, but we have to work hard because we are part of government and we are also accountable to the people, for not only protecting their lives and property, but to ensure that they have a life that is worth living.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Stresses need for Senate to stabilise polity ahead of 2023 poll\n\n*Says report of 1999 constitution review committee for consideration January\n\nDeji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje in Abuja\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has disclosed that the National Assembly will on Thursday transmit the 2022 budget passed by both chambers to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.\n\nHe also canvassed for the Senate to stabilise the nation\u2019s polity ahead of the 2023 general elections as the Red Chamber prepares to consider the report of the committee on the review of the 1999 constitution upon resumption of plenary in January, 2022.\n\nLawan, who dropped the hint on Wednesday in his remarks shortly before the chamber proceeded on recess emphasised that the timely signing of the 2022 Appropriation bill into law would ensure the commencement of its implementation by January next year.\n\nAccording to him, businesses operating in the country as well as the economy stand to be impacted positively by the timely passage of the nation\u2019s budget by the National Assembly.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor the 2022 Appropriation bill, we are expecting that the bill will be cleaned up between today and tomorrow, and we hope that by tomorrow (Thursday), the bill will be sent to Mr. President for his assent.\n\n\u201c[And] we are very optimistic that Mr. President will assent to the bill, like he did for 2020 and 2021, so that by January 2022, the implementation of the budget 2022 will commence by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the benefits of passing and assenting to the budget in good time, especially when we had to fight COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of the implementation of the budget in 2021 and 2020 was very clear. For us to come out of the recession that we found ourselves in the previous period, we must have had the fortune of passing the budget and getting Mr. President to sign in time.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe that the economy of Nigeria, and Nigerian businesses especially, will continue to benefit from the passage of the appropriation bills in time and the assent by Mr. President, accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it clear that our desire is to provide legislations for the peace, order and good government of our country.\u201d\n\nLawan further stated that the Red Chamber would consider the report of the Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution as soon as it is presented early next year.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhen we return, we have one major that has not been attended to at all as a chamber, and that is the constitutional amendments.\n\n\u201cOur Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution has been doing its work. But as a chamber, we haven\u2019t finished working on it.\n\n\u201cWe are expectant that our Committee on the review of the constitution will be presenting the report to this chamber as soon as we resume. The committee has done so much, and the report is almost ready.\n\n\u201cWhen we harmonize with our colleagues in the House, we should be able to vote on the issues that will particularly bring about peace, unity and good government in our country, before such bill will be sent to the State Houses of Assembly for concurrence.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, we must thank Almighty God that almost all those major items we reflected in our legislative agenda as a chamber has been attended to.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that has been left out, including the review or amendment to our standing orders on how our committees have better and more clearly defined jurisdictions and, of course, how we conduct ourselves here as a chamber.\n\n\u201cAnd this is because we\u2019ve remained united even in the face of sometimes very difficult issues. We have gone through such difficult moments with dignity and respect for each other, and we have come out even stronger.\u201d\n\nHe reminded his colleagues of the role of the Senate as an institution to stabilize the polity, particularly against the backdrop of issues likely to surface ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cNext year, by the grace of God, will be the last lap of our tenure. So, we have a lot to ensure that we finish all the things that we have penciled down for ourselves and, of course, there are many other issues that from time to time will be coming up in our polity.\n\n\u201cThis Senate is supposed to play that role of stabilizing the polity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201c[And] I daresay, that the members of the National Assembly, particularly the Senate, is a stabilizing institution in the polity of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nLawan underscored the need for the National Assembly to work with the executive arm of government to provide the needed resources, as well as oversight the use of such funds in the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe killings across the country are so bad, and it is not acceptable to us, but we have to work hard because we are part of government and we are also accountable to the people, for not only protecting their lives and property, but to ensure that they have a life that is worth living\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Nonetheless, they admitted that some of the president\u2019s decisions are borne out of inadequate facts of situations.\n\n\u201cWe learnt that the tenure of the current DG, which comes to an end in January 2022, is being considered (for extension) or has been secretly renewed,\u201d the spy chiefs noted.\n\nThey alleged the repeated and \u201cintense lobby\u201d for tenure elongation for the heads of the security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe have known all along that there has been clandestine and sometimes open intense lobby to mislead you to take the wrong decision, as was done in the last appointment,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cPlease excuse our use of this language to describe your last decision on this matter as a wrong one based on very wrong advice. With all sense of humility and modesty.\u201d\n\nThe NIA directors believed the president could not have approved the appointment of Abubakar in 2018 if he had been duly informed about circumstances against his appointment.\n\n\u201cThere is no way you will knowingly approve any illegality and/or anything done without due process as the last appointment of the current DG,\u201d stressed the spy chiefs.\n\nThey pointed out that Buhari flouted the National Security Agencies Act, which specified that the NIA DG should be appointed on the advice of the national security adviser.\n\nThe spy chiefs said Babagana Monguno, the current NSA, had told the National Assembly that he was unaware of Abubakar\u2019s appointment when the president authorised it in 2018.\n\nControversies had trailed the appointment of the current director-general, as critics, including a Bauchi senator, Isa Misau, argued that Mr Abubakar was unqualified for the position.\n\nMany have described the President\u2019s decision as a \u201cbreach of national security.\u201d",

          "text": "Directors in the Nigerian Intelligence Agency (NIA) have asked President Muhammadu Buhari to desist from appending his seal on decisions he does not understand.\n\nThe directors in a secret memo unanimously noted with dismay several decisions Buhari has made after being \u201cdeliberately\u201d misguided by his aides and advisers as a result of \u201cselfishness\u201d.\n\nAll these they attributed to the president\u2019s inability to pay rapt attention to matters, Peoples Gazette reports.\n\n\u201cAs the head of this massive entity call Nigeria, sometimes your aides, advisers and handlers, may, out of selfishness and vested personal interest, deliberately mislead you, to unwittingly do some things against your known principles, unfortunately, because, they know that sometimes, due to some urgent numerous state matters that need your urgent attention you may not necessarily be too meticulous about everything,\u201d the directors said in the letter.\n\nThe letter was written to Buhari amid claims that the President is considering tenure extension for the current NIA director-general, Ahmed Abubakar.\n\nAppointed on January 10, 2018, Abubakar\u2019s tenure is expected to expire in January 2022.\n\nThe directors described Buhari\u2019s decision on the tenure elongation as a \u201cwrong one based on a wrong advice\u201d. Nonetheless, they admitted that some of the president\u2019s decisions are borne out of inadequate facts of situations.\n\n\u201cWe learnt that the tenure of the current DG, which comes to an end in January 2022, is being considered (for extension) or has been secretly renewed,\u201d the spy chiefs noted.\n\nThey alleged the repeated and \u201cintense lobby\u201d for tenure elongation for the heads of the security agencies.\n\n\u201cWe have known all along that there has been clandestine and sometimes open intense lobby to mislead you to take the wrong decision, as was done in the last appointment,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cPlease excuse our use of this language to describe your last decision on this matter as a wrong one based on very wrong advice. With all sense of humility and modesty.\u201d\n\nThe NIA directors believed the president could not have approved the appointment of Abubakar in 2018 if he had been duly informed about circumstances against his appointment.\n\n\u201cThere is no way you will knowingly approve any illegality and/or anything done without due process as the last appointment of the current DG,\u201d stressed the spy chiefs.\n\nThey pointed out that Buhari flouted the National Security Agencies Act, which specified that the NIA DG should be appointed on the advice of the national security adviser.\n\nThe spy chiefs said Babagana Monguno, the current NSA, had told the National Assembly that he was unaware of Abubakar\u2019s appointment when the president authorised it in 2018.\n\nControversies had trailed the appointment of the current director-general, as critics, including a Bauchi senator, Isa Misau, argued that Mr Abubakar was unqualified for the position.\n\nMany have described the President\u2019s decision as a \u201cbreach of national security.\u201d",

As many would love to assume, throughout our life as a couple, I was the only married wife to him,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cThere were side attractions, but it was never an issue. I never approached him with any revelation of any sort, as many believed he contacted me first and made his proposal known several months later.\n\n\u201cThe marriage was not arranged, as many have misconstrued. I never knew the prophetess said to have introduced me to him. He introduced her to me after I agreed to marry him. I was only being polite out of respect for him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI have never been pregnant all my life before.

The girl who is said to be my daughter is my niece I did my best to endure and make it work.\u201d\n\nSilekunola stated that she has relinquished her title but should be identified \u201cas the queen of the people and mother of my adorable prince.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead, His Majesty has a picture he would love the world to see and perceive him as and another one which is his true self. Today I announce the beginning of a new dawn and the close of a chapter,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI am no longer a slave to my thoughts of perfection.

          "text": "Yes, yes, we know Christmas is a few hours away, and this is a bit late, but everybody knows that the big boys are always too busy to shop before the holidays.\n\nSo, if you want to roll with the big boys, here\u2019s a last-minute gift guide for all our overworked hard-working readers out there.\n\n1. Music streaming subscriptions\n\nSource: Stuff.tv\n\nAfrican music has had a great year with artistes gaining international recognition, Grammy nominations, and brand ambassadorship deals.\n\nIt\u2019s been great the last couple of years and has only gotten better with time. You can stream and download all your favourite songs on Apple Music, YouTube Music or Spotify. Gift someone, or even yourself, a music subscription this season, so that next year you too can post your #SpotifyWrapped and we can all judge your bad taste in music.\n\nPrice range: From $2 \u2013 $4 for Individual plans\n\n2. Video streaming subscriptions\n\nSource: The Streamable\n\nWith multiple plans to choose from, Iroko TV and Netflix have been giving us really amazing African content in the past few years.\n\nGet a Nollywood lover an Iroko or Netflix subscription today.\n\nPrice range: From $7 (+ Free basic Netflix plans in Kenya)\n\n3. Wireless headphones\n\nSource: The New York Magazine\n\nYou know who everybody loves: the person who buys whole package gifts.\n\nDon\u2019t just gift music subscriptions, get listening devices to go with it. Apple and Samsung\u2019s earbuds may be pricey but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t alternatives.\n\nThere are a plethora of wireless headphones to choose from like the Oraimo FreePods 3, which are waterproof, affordable and have 8+ hours of battery life.\n\nCheck out Jumia and your local hardware stores for some options.\n\nPrice range: From $5 to $199\n\n4. A fan for harmattan\n\nSource: Shopee\n\nIf you love somebody, get them a rechargeable fan for this season.\n\nHarmattan has arrived in West Africa, and if you live there, like some of us, you know how it gets: it goes from windy and cold in the morning to dry and hotter-than-hell at noon. We\u2019d suggest an AC, but unless you\u2019re going full package and also paying your gift victim\u2019s electricity bill, please stick to rechargeable fans.\n\nThe variants range from handheld to tabletop and standing.\n\nPrice range: $7 \u2013 $157\n\n5. LED strip lights\n\nSource: Lights Strip Co\n\nClubbing might be expensive but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to miss out on the experience.\n\nThe holidays are often full of cheer, but it can also bring up a lot of feelings and memories that are not so great \ud83d\ude14. A simple thing like light affects our brains and serotonin production and a change of light and colour can elevate a person\u2019s mood. Between seasonal depression and the pandemic, somebody you know could use some cheering up this season.\n\nGive the gift of a lifted mood this season by buying someone or yourself multi-coloured LED strip lights. Add some music, and a couple of drinks and you\u2019ve got your very own high-end club\u2014only you don\u2019t have to pay $15 for a tumbler of ice cubes mixed in with a teaspoon of gin and mint.\n\n\n\nPrice range: $4 per metre\n\n6. Laptop stands\n\nSource: The New York Magazine\n\nLaptop stands are also great gift items.\n\nAs remote work grows, we\u2019re constantly finding new ways and postures to work.

          "title": "Ghana\u2019s answer to Silicon Valley is inside refurbished government buildings",
          "text": "Imagine 100 startups housed in 12 refurbished buildings and located in a large compound with sufficient parking space. These 12 buildings provide 8,820 square metres of space customised to fit the needs of each startup\u2014from a small team of five employees to a massive call centre of 100 employees.\n\nThis project in the heart of Ghana\u2019s capital city, the Accra Digital Centre, is a symbol of Ghana\u2019s ambition to be the startup capital of Africa. It aims to house the largest group of entrepreneurs, incubators, and accelerators from Ghana. The digital centre in Accra is one out of 16 others that the government plans to build around the country.\n\nAn aerial view of the Accra Digital Centre\n\n\u201cBeyond Ghana\u2019s capital city, the government has identified unused government buildings around the country,\u201d said David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on buildings at Kumasi, Tamale, and Takoradi. All the costs and appraisals have been done.\u201d\n\nGetting the project off the ground\n\nStarted in 2011, the Accra Digital Centre project was financed by the World Bank and the Rockefeller Foundation. It started with the renovation of a collection of 12 old warehouses belonging to the Public Works Department. But due to changing government regimes and interests, the project wasn\u2019t fully operational until 2017.\n\nFour years later, the Accra Digital Centre is living up to expectation and looks to be a worthy template for other centres across the country. Coincidentally, this aligns with increasing startup activity in the country.\n\nThe success of the Accra Digital Centre is indicative of what Ofori, the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, and even President Nana Akufo-Addo hope is a new future for Ghana. President Akufo-Addo has made it a priority to support innovation and entrepreneurship since coming into office in 2017.\n\nWhile Ghana still needs to lure more international investors and further ease rules for entrepreneurs, the country, backed by government officials and tech leaders, has started to inject new energy into the startup scene is already one of Africa\u2019s top destinations for startup investment. Based on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, Ghana displaced Rwanda to take up fifth place.\n\nTo keep this momentum going, Ofori believes the government\u2019s decision to bankroll this project is important because it helps bridge the gap between the privileged and less privileged.\n\n\u201cWhen things are beyond the reach of average citizens, the government comes in to bridge the gap. Otherwise, the world would become a place of haves and have-nots.\u201d\n\nThe perks\n\nOne of the major attractions of the digital centre facility is the low-rent cost. Currently, it costs $8 per square metre, a fraction of what it costs in other places.\n\nCK Bruce, CEO Innovare, a tech consulting company is one of the early tenants of the Accra Digital Centre who doesn\u2019t regret the decision to move in.\n\n\u201cWhen the centre was launched they came around to convince people to join. At the start, a lot of infrastructure wasn\u2019t ready; there was nobody here. It took some time for things to kick off,\u201d Bruce said. \u201c As soon as we moved in, we started to grow. Every year we\u2019ve had to request for additional space; our team has grown over 100% in the past 3-4 years it\u2019s been here.\u201d\n\nBy being in a space filled with many other startups, Bruce said Innovare has gotten to do business with other companies in the space and formed partnerships. In addition, the environment is vibrant and motivating for his team members.\n\nAnother early tenant of the Accra Digital Centre is aYo, an affordable insurance product by MTN. Francis Gota, CEO aYo Ghana, told TechCabal that its attraction was its affordability, and so far the centre has been maintained well. When I pointed out that instead of aYo the space could better serve smaller startups, Gota was quick to clarify that, as a subsidiary of MTN, aYo is responsible for managing its profitability and sustainability without external help. Similar to Innovare, the workforce of aYo Ghana has increased\u2014doubling from about 125 to 250 employees\u2014since it started working from the centre.\n\nWhen I asked Bruce and Gota separately what they hoped the centre could do better, they both echoed the same thing: they needed more office space.\n\nExporting tech talents\n\nBeyond the affordable real estate cost, the Accra Digital Centre organises activities and programs to educate people and spur innovation.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a hand in instigating and nudging people towards a digital future. A lot of people are still wired to go to school, and afterwards get a job. Yet they have access to a smartphone and the internet to learn,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThese activities and programmes at the digital centre are facilitated by the tech club and Innovation Hub. The activities involve getting people to try their hands on real tools like drone technology, blockchain, 3D printing, and virtual and augmented reality. The best part of these programmes is that they are free to the public.\n\nIn the long run, these activities are meant to position Ghana as a major exporter of tech talents in Africa, starting with neighbouring countries like Liberia, Gambia, and Togo.\n\n\u201cTalents are a critical resource, and we can\u2019t keep relying on foreigners to take the lead in these areas.\u201d\n\nA private company owned by the government\n\nThe Accra Digital Centre is managed by a private company called Ghana Digital Centres Limited, under the Minister of Communications and Digitalisation. To ensure that the Accra Digital Centre functions properly, it is a private company that is 100% owned by the government of Ghana. This was done to demonstrate confidence in the private sector because people often aren\u2019t comfortable doing business with the government.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s job is to provide an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive. The government\u2019s core business is to bring in regulations and look out for the interest of the society and make sure there\u2019s no unfair competition,\u201d Ofori said.\n\nThe government is responsible for the initial setup of the digital centres and afterwards, the revenue generated from the operations of the centre is used to run them. This way the project is self-sustaining and not a burden on taxpayers. On the flip side, the goal isn\u2019t for the digital centres to become massively profit-oriented, else it\u2019d deviate from its purpose of providing critical infrastructure and services at an affordable rate.\n\nStartups are more than websites\n\nDespite all the progress made, it\u2019s been an uphill task trying to convince local investors that startups need more than affordable facilities to scale; they need capital. The Accra Digital Centre is looking to partner with local or foreign investors and investment companies to expand its reach and impact.\n\nOfori explains that there\u2019s a cultural bias that needs to be overcome. Local investors prefer to invest in sectors like real estate and agriculture where the product is tangible, unlike in the tech sector where the products are often intangible.\n\n\u201cHow do you explain to a local investor that you bought a domain name? How do you explain hosting? All you have to show is a website,\u201d Ofori said. \u201cThese businesses that seem like just websites today will become tech giants tomorrow. BMW started out as an aircraft engine manufacturer; today, it\u2019s more famous for its cars.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside TeamApt: How an upstart overturned competition to dominate agency banking",
          "text": "Six years after TeamApt, a little-known banking software development company, had launched, it stirred excitement after Bloomberg reported the startup\u2019s move to raise $150 million at a billion-dollar valuation\u2014which would elevate it to the coveted unicorn status. TeamApt\u2019s co-founders had bootstrapped the company from a four-man team in their flat in 1004 Estate to building products, MoneyTor and AptPay, which serviced virtually all the commercial banks in Nigeria. TeamApt followed the growth with a $5.5 million Series A round by 2019.\n\nHowever, it was Moniepoint, the product it launched next, that skyrocketed the company to near-unicorn status.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria had 4.3 bank branches per 100,000 people in 2018, thereby leaving many of its 200 million population either unserved or underserved. Moniepoint provides payment, withdrawal, and deposit services to these underbanked users through an army of agents mostly in mom-and-pop stores across the country. In 2019, when OPay announced a total of $170 million in fundraising from two rounds and marched thousands of point-of-sale (POS) terminal-wielding footmen across the country to convert agents and successfully grow agency banking in the country, Moniepoint launched that September after a beta-testing phase, with about 1,000 agents.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have money then, so we were taking terminals from banks and manually sending them to agents, individually, in other parts of the country. That was so base and hectic,\u201d says Tolu Adetuyi, Moniepoint Head of Growth.\n\nAfter the $5.5 million raise, TeamApt had cash in the bank to place orders for terminals in China and invaded the Nigerian market. Now it processes over $4 billion monthly, servicing 18 million unique customers, and has over 120,000 active merchants in almost all of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas (LGAs)\u2014only the terror-prone LGAs in the country\u2019s northern regions are left out. A regulator report seen by TechCabal back in June capturing transaction volumes by super agents showed TeamApt recorded an agent transaction volume of roughly 50 million, which accounted for 75% of total agent volumes collated for the month reported. Although, an industry analyst under anonymity told TechCabal that he doubts OPay\u2019s numbers were captured in the report.\n\nSo how did TeamApt become this super agent?\n\n\u201cBack then, our fee was only 1% of each transaction, which was high, but that was what we could afford, but we obsessed about our agents and offered them unmatched user experience,\u201d Adetuyi explained.\n\nTolu Adetuyi, as growth lead, along with 40 other support staff, oversee a massive network of agents engaged through Whatsapp groups dedicated to each LGA in Nigeria and a few other separate high-level Whatsapp groups of LGA agent leaders also called cluster managers, state managers, and regional managers. These performing agents-turned-managers are responsible for increasing and engaging the agents in their communities in order to increase their commission.\n\n\u201cMy phone is always buzzing, and I\u2019m attending town hall meetings. That\u2019s like, the whole of my work. I know what\u2019s happening on the streets right from my room,\u201d Adetuyi tells me excitedly via a Google Meet call.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s strong feedback loop facilitates rich market intelligence which enabled the company successively introduce groundbreaking features to the market which some competitors adopted and eventually became industry standards.\n\nMrs Ogunleye, an agent in the Alimosho local government area of Lagos, runs a grocery store and owns three POS terminals. \u201cI started using Moniepoint because of their daily commission settlement while others were paying monthly,\u201d she tells TechCabal.\n\nSources at TeamApt credit Moniepoint\u2019s early success and breakthrough growth to this payment feature. \u201cMany of these agents are like petty traders who need their daily earnings for restocking and running their households. I study my agents. I literally have documents on agent motivation,\u201d Adetuyi shares.\n\nMoniePoint also provides agents with live analytics dashboards to see a detailed breakdown of their performance and earnings. This transparency enables agent trust in the commission given and drives them to improve their performance as opposed to opaque estimated monthly earnings.\n\nTeamApt deploys an interesting active POS terminal performance management system for its merchants. For example, for every 10 terminals given, a certain number must be doing transaction values exceeding a fixed amount. The figure is determined by the area and market trend. This drives cluster managers to identify and recruit the best agents and engage them daily to improve their performance.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want merchants who use our terminals only when they need to make quick money. We want active agents who use them daily. We try to prevent what they call bozo explosion, where we bring in lots of agents but are not able to service the 20% that\u2019s going to give you most of your revenue, then you end up losing them,\u201d Solomon Amadi, Vice President at TeamApt, tells TechCabal.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s agent network is a vibrant talent ecosystem that allows enterprising agents to grow through the rank. Merchant agents can become cluster managers at LG level, grow into state managers, and finally regional heads, while increasing their earnings along the way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a talent war. Competitors are calling and trying to poach our cluster managers, so much so that we know the name of some of the employees calling them because our cluster managers tell us. That\u2019s why we sign exclusive contracts with some of these managers,\u201d Amadi disclosed.\n\nThe talent grab, though, goes both ways. TeamApt also tries to convert performing agents on other platforms.\n\nTo improve the reliability of its product, TeamApt introduced to the market a 24-hour resolution service for false debit card withdrawals. Usually, it takes 8 days after physically visiting a bank branch to resolve an unsuccessful card withdrawal where the customer\u2019s account got debited. But TeamApt funds customers from its account once it can verify the transaction and later sorts out the reconciliation at the back end with the bank.\n\n\u201cThe solutions we introduced to the market seem commonplace but many of them weren\u2019t being done till we did. In Nigeria, we just like to copy and paste models without thinking to adapt them to our peculiarities. But, first principles thinking has really helped us in how we approach problems and come up with the solutions we have introduced,\u201d Adetuyi concludes.\n\n\u201cFirst principles thinking\u201d is a phrase I heard often while interviewing management executives at TeamApt. It\u2019s a problem-solving thought process of attacking problems by first identifying the fundamental issues. It was first taught by Aristotle and currently made popular by South African-born physics engineering genius, Elon Musk. Tosin Eniolorunda, founder and CEO of TeamApt, champions the thought process and is instilling it into the company culture.\n\n\u201cWhen we hit a roadblock while thinking up a solution, Felix (TeamApt CTO) would often say, okay, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s go back,\u201d Eniolorunda tells me as he rolls his wrist backwards. He shares that his exposure to first principles philosophy came in stages. The first time was in his 100 level at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as a mechanical engineering student.\n\n\u201cI got into OAU on merit, first try. So, I was feeling fly with myself. But I now failed in my first year. My CGPA was 3.3,\u201d he shares in-between laughs. \u201cThat was a major learning experience for me. I learnt the power of focus. Secondly, it sparked a new way of thinking because adversity changes us. I questioned myself on why I want excellence and I began to think of how to get there.\u201d\n\nTosin, the first born of a building contractor father and primary teacher mother, worked and paid his way through tertiary school and graduated with a second class upper in mechanical engineering. He had always wanted to be an entrepreneur and build \u201csomething massive\u201d. With TeamApt seemingly to be crowned with unicorn status, the company now has its eyes on digital banking but with a slant. \u201cThere\u2019s a me too movement in tech. Everyone is launching digital banking with different offerings. But the fundamental question is, what do customers really need? Zero cost transaction accounts? That\u2019s good, but I think credit is one of the key needs. So, we will be launching a hybrid credit-led banking solution that also caters to the offline market,\u201d Eniolorunda concludes.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "After 5 reluctant years of bootstrapping, CinetPay is closing in on Francophone Africa dominance",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year is 2016. Idris Marcial Monthe has just graduated from the Abidjan Founders Institute. An amazing three months of learning from the best and Monthe was feeling quite confident.\n\nHe and Daniel Dindji had just launched their payment gateway, CinetPay in the same year with little to no experience in the financial sector. The duo had met each other while studying Computer Science at the New Superior School of Engineering and Technology (ENSIT), Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nThis is not their first rodeo, though. In 2009, Monthe and Dindji created CinetCore, a platform specialising in the sale of domain names. But they soon encountered a problem \u2014 payments.\n\n\u201cIn our region, you have 80% of people with a mobile money account, while the remaining 10 to 20% have a bank account and a card to pay online,\u201d Monthe tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey tried to open several PayPal accounts to get their payments but they were blocked because Cote d\u2019Ivoire \u2014 like many African countries \u2014 has limited usability on PayPal and is unofficially said to be on a blacklist.\n\n\u201cWe saw that we have a good opportunity with mobile money because many people have mobile money accounts. But, the problem with mobile money is that, all the 80% are spread between three or five operators and it\u2019s not easy for a merchant to open four accounts, integrate four APIs, manage four reconciliation, and deal with four partners, just for collection of payments.\u201d\n\nSo, they decided to build a gateway for their website, connecting all of these mobile money operators in one place. But soon, clients were asking, \u201cHow can we recreate this for ourselves?\u201d And CinetPay was born.\n\nThe journey to getting funded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinetPay Founders. Source: Supplied\n\nIn December 2021, CinetPay announced a $2.4 million seed round led by 4DX Ventures and African payment gateway unicorn, Flutterwave.\n\nCinetPay has been Flutterwave\u2019s Francophone Africa partner since 2019.\n\n\u201cI think Flutterwave was looking for a strong partner in Francophone Africa to explore the market, check if we have the capacity to help them in our region and that is how the partnership started. Flutterwave had a customer in Cameroon and wanted to serve this customer with a mobile money solution and when they looked in Cameroon, they saw that their best partner would be CinetPay.\u201d\n\nFor Monthe, it has been a very good partnership, helping both companies share information and experience.\n\nWhen Techpoint Africa asks Monthe if bootstrapping was a deliberate choice, he says, \u201cIt is not our choice. We are in a region where fundraising is very low, and many investors don\u2019t have information about our region, our market, our environment. If we had a choice, we would have raised money since 2017.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompared to Africa\u2019s big four \u2014 South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Egypt \u2014 funding in Francophone Africa is quite low. However, this year has been a good year for the region, with several startups raising some impressive rounds and a unicorn emerging.\n\nMonthe believes that this is good news for them as more investors get interested in Francophone Africa.\n\nA little bit more detail about CinetPay\n\nCinetPay helps merchants in the Francophone Africa region accept and collect online payments from mobile money wallets in nine countries.\n\n\u201cJust to give you an example, if you are an eCommerce website and you want to launch your website in nine countries in Francophone Africa, you need to create 9 companies, you need to sign 36 contracts with each operator present in our region, you need to integrate 36 APIs, and you need to deal with 36 services for reconciliation, which is not very easy.\u201d\n\nWhat CinetPay does is aggregate all these means of payments in one gateway \u2014 a Flutterwave or Paystack, but for mobile money wallets.\n\nThe company is present in Cameroon, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Guinea, and Benin.\n\nMonthe believes CinetPay\u2019s geographical presence among other things has helped the company stand out.\n\n\u201cWe are present in more countries than our competitors in Francophone Africa. We also have a large number of methods of payment \u2014130 \u2014 on our website. Our payment page is very simple and seamless; you have just one or two steps to processing payments.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is that we have the capacity to help big companies or institutions and public services. And we help these services to build a great solution. We don\u2019t just provide payment services, but we help our partners to digitise their services.\u201d\n\nWith over 350 merchants on the platform, CinetPay serves public services, schools, banks, financial institutions, eCommerce websites among others.\n\nThe company charges a commission on each transaction, with all merchants paying a $20 subscription fee annually.\n\nChallenges, conquests, and plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdris Marcial Monthe, CEO CinetPay. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen Dindji and Monthe first started, with no idea of how a payment infrastructure works, they began to attend a lot of incubators and accelerators, searching for helpful knowledge.\n\nAfter getting into the Abidjan Founder Institute, they also got into Seedstars. They\u2019ve also made it into several government and private incubators. A chance he believes has helped them grow CinetPay.\n\nInterestingly, Monthe didn\u2019t see their lack of experience as a challenge. It became a passion for him.\n\n\u201cI am very passionate about innovation, So I don\u2019t care about learning anything innovation, I like it. I don\u2019t see it as a challenge, but a passion. My goal is to impact the lives of many people in Francophone Africa.\u201d\n\nThe trick was practicing everyday what he had learnt at all the incubators and accelerators.\n\nIntriguingly, Monthe wants to create a non-profit organisation to help females gain access to education.\n\nAccording to the Francophone Africa and the Equality Challenge 2019 Report by the University of Chester Area Studies Research Group, female literacy rates in Francophone Africa have not been growing consistently, with outdated datasets being used for policy making and decision making.\n\n\u201cI think that the world will be better if many women are educated. The capacity of women to do many things like earn profit, to work hard is very high compared totge capacity of the men. This is my passion and my challenge and in the next five, ten years, this is something that I will launch.\u201d\n\nHe also jokes about being a farmer if he hadn\u2019t started CinetPay.\n\nThere\u2019s also the problem of trust. To solve this, Monthe says the team has had to adopt a transparency in communication and collaboration. Of course, when dealing with people\u2019s money, this is important.\n\n\u201cWe give the best product because if you cause losses, you lose trust. We work hard to give the merchants the best experience of payment in West Africa. 99% of transactions are in cash; you need to build trust to combat cash.\u201d\n\nWith the challenge of building and retaining talent, Monthe reveals an interesting strategy.\n\n\u201cWe signed a partnership with a high school to help us to recruit the best people, one year before the end of their degree.\u201d\n\nEssentially, building a pipeline of talent at an early stage.\n\nThe plan for now, though, is to focus on consolidating their hold in Francophone Africa. CinetPay is working on a regulatory sandbox with the Ministry of Finance. Building bridges and important connections as they grow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nOluwanifemi and Emmanuel here.\n\nYes, it\u2019s us again, and we can\u2019t tell if you missed this combo, but we decided to give it a go one last time before we start feasting this festive season. Today, we\u2019ll take a trip down memory lane through some of the news trends we observed on Techpoint Digest in 2021.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusic\u2019s next frontier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, music came in cassettes or rolling discs, and I, sometimes, marvel at how much has changed since then. I mean, you either buy Daddy Showkey\u2019s I in a store, or you wait for NTA to play. I\u2019m probably not old enough to think of anything else, but you get my drift.\n\nToday all you need, if you want to be legitimate, that is, is a decent Internet connection and either Deezer, Spotify, Audiomack, or YouTube music, and you can get your favourite songs at the click of a button or two.\n\nTechnology has changed the game in every industry, and entertainment has been a huge recipient. But what does the future hold? Our reporter, Bolu, had a chat with executives from Spotify and Audiomack to paint a pretty picture.\n\nHave fun: Blockchain-powered music and bigger investments: The next frontier for music tech.\n\nMAX raises $31 million for its electric vehicle subscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: MAX.ng Twitter\n\nNigerian mobility startup, Metro Africa Xpress (MAX) has closed a $31 million Series B funding round. Interestingly, this is the first of other closes in this round that should be expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThis round was led by global private equity platform, Lightrock and UAE-based VC firm, Global Ventures. Other backers include Kenyan VC, Novastar Ventures, Japanese multinational, Yamaha \u2014 these two participated in a $7million round MAX closed in June 2019 \u2014 TMT Investments, and Proparco.\n\nThe fund would be deployed towards expansion into Egypt and Ghana in Q1 2022 and later into Francophone, Eastern, and Southern Africa to compete with the likes of Gozem. It will also go into the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, and the provision of credit and financial products to drivers, specifically those that utilise their vehicles for commercial purposes.\n\nApparently, MAX\u2019s business model has evolved since it launched in 2015. From logistics to bike-hailing and now to offering vehicle subscriptions and other packages that help drivers to maximise revenue and minimise costs.\n\nThis is MAX\u2019s largest VC-funded round to date. $8.2 million raised in four major funding rounds \u2014 through venture funding, angel investments, bank loans, and debt financing \u2014 and a previous raise of over $40 million of institutional debt for driver financing. The startup also moved into Nigeria\u2019s capital market after completing the issuance of a \u20a6400 million ($1 million) bond in September 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore context: Nigerian mobility-tech startup MAX bags $31 million in Series B round, set to expand across Africa, build EV infrastructure\n\nInternational calls get a new look\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you live outside Nigeria, it\u2019s important to note that the country\u2019s telecom regulator is finally regulating the cost of making a call to a loved one back home.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), from January 2022, the standard international termination rate (ITR) for calls will be pegged at a minimum rate of $0.045.\n\nWhat am I talking about? Whenever you make a call from outside the country, your telecom operators pay Nigerian telecom operators a certain amount to complete the call successfully. Before now, the NCC fixed the amount at \u20a624.\n\nSo what happened? Since the fee was in naira, the NCC is saying that the telcos have been losing money due to the devaluation of the naira. Consequently, it believes getting the fees in dollars will help the telcos make more revenue, even if the naira falls again.\n\nThe big picture: Even the NCC is betting that the naira would keep falling, but what can we do? When you convert the new fee, it\u2019s just \u20a618.4 now, but who knows what it would grow to tomorrow?\n\nTrends we observed\n\nEgyptian startup funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI can guess that at some point this year, people in the African startup scene had exclaimed, \u201cthese Egyptian startups are on fire!\u201d It felt like it was time to take lessons from them. The largest raise from an Egyptian company was $120m, and over $400m was raised this year, more than half of what the country had seen since 2015.\n\nTrue, Egypt is part of Africa\u2019s big four in terms of startup market size and funding, but the gap is quickly closing between Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. MaxAB\u2019s $55m Series A, MNT-Halan\u2019s $120m, Paymob\u2019s $18m Series A, and Trella\u2019s $42 million Series A made the highlights.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s a good year for Africa\u2019s startup funding scene. Several Nigerian startups hit unicorn status, and Francophone Africa got its first unicorn. 2022 seems like the year to expect more exciting rounds\n\nRegulatory somersaults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Ewan Kennedy on Unsplash\n\nOf course, you should have guessed we wouldn\u2019t miss this. Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem was fraught with regulatory somersaults, which we have gotten used to for quite a while.\n\nThe crypto ban\n\nFirst, we were hit with the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ban on cryptocurrency transactions. Though crypto is not illegal in the country and the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was planning progressive regulations for the space, that didn\u2019t matter at all.\n\nThe CBN\u2019s circular basically sent crypto users underground \u2014 peer to peer (P2P). The opportunity to regulate a decentralised space got swept away, creating difficulties for well-meaning users and breathing room for bad eggs. But nothing is scarier than \u201cmoney made out of thin air\u201d, right?\n\neNaira launch: CBN highlights relief funds, cross-border payments, and unknown risks.\n\nTwitter ban\n\nIf the ban on crypto platforms had no constitutional grounds, then the Nigerian government\u2019s ban on Twitter was a clear violation. But we had to roll with it because Twitter was apparently a \u201cthreat to national security\u201d. The perfect excuse for African governments looking to censor free speech.\n\nIt\u2019s been four months since Nigeria\u2019s information minister said the ban would be lifted in a matter of days. I guess he wouldn\u2019t be lying if it takes six months.\n\nStartups want to digitise SME operations\n\nQuite a handful of African startups came up with decent plans to digitise Africa\u2019s informal sector. TradeDepot, Marketforce, Doroki, Capiter, Sabi, Alerzo, OmniBiz, Sokowatch, BIZ301, and several others are working on digitising different segments of SME activities that have been largely offline.\n\nThis would definitely be a space to watch in 2022,\n\nFintech unicorns\n\nThan previous years, Africa recorded more unicorns in 2021. For context, these are tech companies valued above $1 billion. The continent now has six unicorns, and more than half of them are Nigerian and fintech startups.\n\nInterswitch is older in the record. Meanwhile, this year, Flutterwave, OPay, Wave, Chipper Cash, and Andela joined the list.\n\nThe bigger picture: We\u2019ll leave this open-ended. Why not bare your thoughts in the comment section? The most interesting responses might just make it to Techpoint Digest on January 3rd.\n\nWhat we are reading\n\nChristmas is in four days.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, technology has had a strong role in how we create, distribute, and consume works of art. Music, for example, has gone from stringed cassette tapes that\u2019ll go on to become a child\u2019s plaything (if you\u2019re me) to being globally available with a simple tap.\n\nOne of the most profound effects technology has had on music is blurring the geographical boundaries that set sounds from different cultures apart, making music truly universal.\n\nIt\u2019s no doubt technology has aided major paradigm shifts in every industry, rendering applauded methods of doing things obsolete and establishing another method as the status quo. But at the point where music is now, it\u2019s hard to think of innovations that will disrupt the current model of music creation, distribution, and consumption.\n\nBut after a closer look and talking to some of the industry\u2019s brightest, the signs are there \u2014 the next frontier for music tech may be closer than we imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t predict the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nMusic is in a very exciting place right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Marcela Laskoski on Unsplash\n\nWhile Victor Okpala, who recently became Spotify\u2019s Artist & Label Partnerships Manager, West Africa, sees amazing things coming to African music tech, he\u2019s still pretty excited about where things are right now. Okpala is also the Founder of Nabsolute Media, a communication and marketing agency.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he started with the subject of monetisation and said artistes can now truly live off their music.\n\n\u201cFor example, we know how bootlegging used to work. A huge percentage of the people that consume music in Nigeria downloaded them from free websites. It was something illegal that somehow got normalised. But we are moving to a place where people see the value in music enough to pay for it.\n\n\u201cApart from the traditional streams of income which were live shows and endorsements, the music itself is able to bring in revenue as a product.\u201d\n\nBootlegging or piracy is the illegal manufacture, distribution or sale of goods. It has been a thorn in the flesh of Nigerian artistes for years. The amount lost to piracy runs into millions of dollars every year.\n\nAdeyemi Adetunji, a lawyer who is also Audiomack\u2019s Manager of Operations and Commercial Partnerships, is just as excited about African music.\n\nAccording to him, he knew afrobeats would become a thing when he was a DJ, playing the songs to an international audience back in the day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would play them Wande Coal, P-Square, and D\u2019banj songs all the way back in 2011, and I just felt like the music was resonating with people, so I knew there was something there.\u201d\n\nAdetunji is particularly pleased that Nigerian musicians were maximising the opportunities technology presented. From building a strong following to connecting with fans on a deeper level.\n\nInternational collaborations and more international award nominations are also exciting phenomena in music right now. Adetunji beams with excitement as he recounts how the international collaborations that only started trickling in in 2010, are becoming the norm today.\n\n\u201cAll the new school kids are doing that a lot now, the Fireboys, the Remas and Omahlays. They\u2019re really big on that.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Okpala, the next frontier for music is that it will be viewed more as a product. He said it\u2019s currently seen solely as a form of art that doesn\u2019t drive enough investment in the industry. Ultimately, he believes the music industry is worthy of the same attention investors pay to fintech or healthtech, for example.\n\nA study by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) published on November 17, 2020, revealed that music supports two million jobs and contributes \u20ac81.9 billion ($91.69 billion) to the European economy annually.\n\nIn the US, music contributes even more to the economy. According to a 2021 study by the Recording Industry Association of America, music contributes $170 billion to the US GDP annually and supports 2.5 million jobs.\n\nThis is possible due to robust investments in the industry. In the US, record companies invested more than $4.5 billion in the industry in 2015.\n\nWhile Nigeria cannot boast such levels of investment, the state of the music industry signals that more investments could have a positive impact on the economy. Per Statista, motion picture and music recording made up $1.8 billion out of Nigeria\u2019s GDP.\n\nIn terms of revenue, the music industry raked in $40 million in 2021. This number is projected to reach $44 million in 2022. Interestingly, there are now data points that can be used to predict investment in music. As Okpala points out, this will aid more investments as there is enough data for investors to bet on.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, if you\u2019re about to invest in an artiste that has, say, 10,000 monthly listeners and 1 million monthly streams on Spotify, you can calculate his monthly revenue to be $5,000. So, if you decide to invest $5,000 towards branding, marketing, and extending reach with the goal of multiplying your audience, you can predict what the revenue could look like.\u201d\n\nHe adds that gone are the days when investors had to bet on just talent as it is never enough.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that come into play when it comes to the success of an artiste, which could be the name, the branding, the story, and the content, of course.\u201d\n\nMusic, blockchain, and the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>Photo by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@zarakvg?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Zarak Khan</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/music-streaming?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a></span>\n\nWhile Adetunji believes no one knows tomorrow and doesn\u2019t like to make bold statements about the future, he indicates that the advent of Web3 and blockchain might have a strong role to play in the future of music.\n\nWe\u2019re already seeing blockchain innovations like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) disrupting the music space.\n\nWhile Okpala agrees that these technologies will play a big part in music, he believes that the future is still very far away. Streaming, on the other hand, isn\u2019t going anywhere soon but will only get better.\n\nNot only is it the current frontier, it\u2019ll most likely still be the next frontier. The convenience streaming brings to music is probably why it\u2019s playing a big role in music growth now.\n\nGlobal streaming revenues have grown by 42% since 2015, surpassing the entire recording industry, which has only grown by 9% in the same amount of time.\n\nAdetunji and Okpala are optimistic about the future of African and Nigerian music, one where tech will definitely determine what the next frontier will be.\n\nWith such interesting predictions, I can\u2019t wait to see more experts from the music scene share their thoughts at Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nYou can also be a part of Techpoint Build 2021, the biggest tech event in West Africa, by registering here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "The expected combination of Flour Mills Nigeria (FMN) and the flour mills unit of Honeywell Flour Mills plc (HFMP) will form a formidable entity and an unassailable market leader in the agro-allied sector in Nigeria, according to industry players and market analysts.\n\nLast month, Flour Mills announced it had reached a deal to acquire the flour mills business of Honeywell in an N80 billion deal that will significantly enhance its market leadership.\n\nFMN is believed to hold about 40 percent of the flour business in Nigeria and its leadership in the sector will become even more secure following the combination with Honeywell Flour, which has a production capacity of 835,000 metric tons of food per annum.\n\nBusinessDay learns that the deal has been helped by several factors including the fact that the combination is seen as a \u201cstrategic fit\u201d and also the leaders of the two businesses including their chairmen have known themselves for a very long time. They have mutual respect for each other.\n\nIn full year ended March 2021, the turnover for the two was N771.6 billion for Flour Mills and N109.59 billion for Honeywell Flour, and the combination will see FMN emerge as a true continental giant, amassing substantial value for shareholders and huge economic benefit for Nigeria.\n\nRead Also: Honeywell, Flour Mills N80bn merger to boost Nigeria\u2019s food production\n\nFMN, established in 1960, prides itself of being in the vanguard of feeding the nation for the past 60 years.

          "title": "The many legal battles of Ecobank and Honeywell",
          "text": "The lawyers for both Ecobank and Honeywell Group are pushing several cases against each other in connection with the dispute over the settlement of claims of N5 billion by the bank against Honeywell as well as an unrelated matter of the sale of shares held originally in what is today\u2019s Airtel Nigeria plc.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Honeywell wrote to Ecobank accepting the terms for the resolution of the claim by the bank agreed at the meeting held the day earlier and saying, \u201cwe confirm our agreement to pay the sum of N3.5billion as full and final settlement of our indebtedness to your bank. As part of the verbal agreement reached at the meeting, we shall immediately pay the sum of N500million towards the facilities. We propose that the balance of N3 billion be paid in three equal half yearly payments.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Ecobank sent back a response in which the bank said, \u201cplease note that the agreement was for a full and final payment of N3.5 billion to be part paid immediately by \u2013 N500 million on Monday, July 22, 2013, and the balance to be paid immediately thereafter before the CBN examiners leave the bank.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the payment became a big issue and this saw both parties moving their wranglings to the court on October 16, 2015, via a suit by Ecobank before Justice Tsoho seeking to wind up Honeywell.\n\nRead Also: Ecobank warns FMN against Honeywell acquisition deal\n\nHowever, both parties began to get public attention for their dispute after Ecobank secured an ex-parte motion to restrain Honeywell and Oba Otudeko from operating their accounts in all banks and financial institutions and an order directing their respective banks to furnish Ecobank with details of their accounts in the banks.\n\nThis same bank-customer dispute was submitted to the subcommittee of ethics and professionalism of the Bankers\u2019 Committee for adjudication and ruling was issued in favour of Honeywell, but Ecobank in a letter dated November 14, 2014, maintained that \u201cduring a recent CBN/NDIC review of the bank, the accounts were flagged and that the CBN had insisted that the amount outstanding be paid without further delay.\u201d\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Honeywell filed a suit before Justice M. B. Idris in which it sought an interim injunction to restrain Ecobank from making any representation suggesting that it owed the bank and on August 10, 2015, the interim injunction was granted and both parties ordered by the court to maintain status quo.\n\nFollowing this, Ecobank filed a preliminary objection on the basis that the Federal High court lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute and on December 11, 2015, the court presided by Justice Idris held that the Federal High court had jurisdiction to hear the matter. Ecobank immediately appealed this decision.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, Ecobank filed two separate suits before Justice Abang. On this same day, Ecobank filed another two petitions before Justice Yunusa who on December 4, 2015, varied the ex-parte orders by granting Honeywell Flour Mills restricted access to its banks accounts allowing the company to take no more than N15 million weekly.\n\nWorried by the orders of Justice Yunusa, Honeywell petitioned the National Judicial Council alleging judicial misconduct arising from what the company called, \u201cthe unfair and unlawful exercise of his discretion.\u201d\n\nAfter this petition to the NJC, Ecobank\u2019s lawyer wrote to Honeywell demanding a copy of the petition. This got Honeywell thinking that something was amiss.\n\nSensing that Ecobank\u2019s lawyers might be attempting to use the administration of justice to blackmail Honeywell into submission, on April 7, 2016, Honeywell petitioned the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee also known as the Body of Benchers.\n\nIn the petition, the company said, \u201cin view of the critical role of the judiciary in preserving the sanctity of the law and in light of the facts set out above, we respectfully urge you to conduct an investigation into Mr Kunle Ogunba\u2019s conduct with respect to this dispute and to take such disciplinary actions as are necessary in line with Section 11 of the Legal Practitioners Act CCAP L11. LFN 2004) to ensure that the integrity of the legal profession is preserved.\u201d\n\nAt an emergency meeting held on September 15, 2017, the Legal Practitioners Privileges Committee adjudicated on the matter and in a statement dated 11/1/2018 and signed by Hadizatu Mustapha, Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court, the committee said as follows, \u201cHoneywell Group petitioned Kunle Ogunba SAN alleging professional misconduct against him. The misconduct alleged consists of the institution of multiplicity of proceedings before different judges of the Federal High Court on the same subject with the deliberate aim of abusing the process of court and derailing the course of justice. This is to further notify the general public that after a thorough investigation of the petition by the sub-committee set up by the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee (at which the respondent was given a fair hearing) it was decided that the petition is meritorious.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the Legal Practitioners\u2019 Privileges Committee at its 129th plenary meeting sanctioned the senior lawyer, withdrawing a set of privileges from him forthwith.\n\nHoneywell is also in court pressing damages claim against Ecobank for harm to its interests arising from the ex-parte order granted against it and which has now been made voided by courts including the Supreme Court.\n\nOn July 13, 2018, justices of the Supreme Court made two rulings, both in favour of Honeywell.\n\nIn one, suit number SC.401/2016, which was an appeal by Honeywell against the ruling of a lower court in favour of Ecobank, the justices in the ruling read by Amiru Sanusi upheld the appeal.\n\nIn another ruling delivered by John Inyang Okoro, the Supreme Court justices reviewed an appeal brought before them by Ecobank in relation to the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on March 30, 2016, said inter alia, \u201chaving resolved all five issues against the appellant (Ecobank) , I hold that this appeal lacks merit and is hereby dismissed. I affirm the decision of the court of appeal delivered on 30th March, 2016.\u201d\n\nIn doing so, the Supreme Court justice said, \u201cHonestly, I have tried to understand the complaint of the appellant in this issue but it appears to be the more you look, the less you see.\u201d\n\nIn an unrelated matter, Honeywell and Ecobank are also in court over the sale of Airtel shares by Ecobank to Bharti Airtel for $28 million. Honeywell claims that as at the time the shares were sold to Delta State government, which then sold to Oceanic Bank (acquired by Ecobank), there was a subsisting shareholder agreement that stipulated that existing shareholders were to be given rights of first refusal.\n\nHoneywell is now asking that the court compel Ecobank to deposit the $28 million proceeds from the share sale into the accounts of the court until the determination of the substantive suit brought by Honeywell.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA \u2013 The Federal Government on Wednesday destroyed over 1m doses of Astrazeneca vaccines donated to combat COVID-19.\n\nThe Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Faisal Shuaib, led the destruction at Gosa Dumpsite, about 2km from the Idu Railway Station, Abuja.\n\n\u201cWe withdrew about 1,066,214, doses of expired AstraZeneca vaccines from across the country,\u201d he said\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria(NAN), reports that Nigeria joined other African countries, like Malawi, South Sudan, Liberia, Mauritania, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Comoros, and the Democratic Republic of Congo in destroying the expired COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cAs you can see these vaccines have now been deposited by the Abuja Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\u201cWe have come through in our promise to all Nigerians to be transparent in our delivery of vaccines.\n\n\u201cThese vaccines did not expire before we took the decision to withdraw them. Today is an opportunity for Nigerians to have further faith in our vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cWe worked with our sister agency, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), who took that decision to destroy these vaccines at the point that they got expired.\n\n\u201cThe work that we do is the work that requires trust. It is a sacred trust that has been bestowed on us by the generalizing generality of Nigerians and hold that trust to be true,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted that the heroes of today\u2019s activity were actually the frontline health workers.\n\n\u201cA few months ago, when these vaccines were offered to us, we knew that they had a short shelf life. But we were living in an environment where the supply of COVID-19 vaccines were very scarce.\n\n\u201cThey were not available due to vaccine nationalism. Some developed countries that procured these vaccines, hoarded them in their stores,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended members of staff of the NPHCDA who worked Saturdays or Sundays on very extreme situations to make sure that Nigerians have access to vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe were able to vaccinate over 10 million Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo my heart and my pride goes out to those frontline health workers that continue to work around the clock.\n\n\u201cWe still have short shelf life vaccines in the country. They are still potent.\n\n\u201cThey have not reached the end of use dates and the health workers are still going around every communities and settlement to ensure Nigerians are vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThis decision has saved Nigeria over 40 million dollars,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking, the Director-General of NAFDAC, Dr. Mojisola Adeyeye, noted that Nigeria was the only country with a unique immunization programme.\n\n\u201cNigeria has one of the best vaccination immunization program in the world. UNICEF mentioned this last year. But we started this journey months before the vaccines came.\n\n\u201cIn terms of what we are witnessing today. It is a continuous unfolding of the fact that the best is for all Nigerians, because Nigerians deserve the best in terms of quality of medicines, vaccines,\u201d she said.\n\nAdeyeye added that this was the basis of the endless meetings between NPHCDA and NAFDAC. Noting that when NAFDAC approved a vaccine it means that what the agency had seen on paper was the package of the history of the vaccine development.\n\n\u201cWe have been working night and day together. And what he said about the vaccines coming with short expiration dates pose a challenge to us as a country.\n\n\u201cBut because of the love of the country we decided to walk with that tight timespan or challenge,\u201d she added.\n\nShe noted that NAFDAC was the only regulatory agency in Africa that tests the subjects the vaccines test.\n\nNAN reports that Malawi was the first country to publicly destroy vaccine doses in May.\n\nThe African Union\u2019s African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team shipped over 900,000 doses AstraZeneca vaccine to 13 African nations through donations.\n\nBut, the Serum institute of India, which manufactured these doses, extended the shelf-life to July 13, there was confusion in the expiration dates.\n\nThis Countries have also faced challenges planning and funding for in-country rollouts, as well as vaccine hesitancy, which has made it difficult for countries to quickly administer the jabs into the arms of citizens.\n\n...",

There had been several calls since then and it continued to grow into the movement that it is today.

Also in bringing the South West together.\u201d\n\nAdeleke noted that he could no longer fold his hands while Osun State continues to go down the drain as it suffers in incompetent hands.\n\n\u201cFrom the word \u2018sponsor\u2019, it is the youths of Osun sponsoring me. It is the spirit of wanting to make that difference that we so desperately need, that is sponsoring me. Those are my driving forces,\u201d he concluded.",

For us to come out of the recession that we found ourselves in the previous period, we must have had the fortune of passing the budget and getting Mr. President to sign in time.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe that the economy of Nigeria, and Nigerian businesses especially, will continue to benefit from the passage of the appropriation bills in time and the assent by Mr. President, accordingly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it clear that our desire is to provide legislations for the peace, order and good government of our country.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President further hinted that the chamber would consider the report of the Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution as soon as it is presented early next year.\n\n\u201cWhen we return, we have one major legislation that has not been attended to at all as a chamber, and that is the constitutional amendments.\n\n\u201cOur Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution has been doing its work. But as a chamber, we haven\u2019t finished working on it.\n\n\u201cWe are expectant that our Committee on the review of the constitution will be presenting the report to this chamber as soon as we resume. The committee has done so much, and the report is almost ready.\n\n\u201cWhen we harmonize with our colleagues in the House, we should be able to vote on the issues that will particularly bring about peace, unity and good government in our country, before such bill will be sent to the State Houses of Assembly for concurrence.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, we must thank Almighty God that almost all those major items we reflected in our legislative agenda as a chamber has been attended to.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that has been left out, including the review or amendment to our standing orders on how our committees have better and more clearly defined jurisdictions and, of course, how we conduct ourselves here as a chamber.\n\n\u201cAnd this is because we\u2019ve remained united even in the face of sometimes very difficult issues. We have gone through such difficult moments with dignity and respect for each other, and we have come out even stronger.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President reminded his colleagues of the role of the Senate as an institution to stabilize the polity, particularly against the backdrop of issues likely to surface ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cNext year, by the grace of God, will be the last lap of our tenure. So, we have a lot to ensure that we finish all the things that we have penciled down for ourselves and, of course, there are many other issues that from time to time will be coming up in our polity.\n\n\u201cThis Senate is supposed to play that role of stabilizing the polity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201c[And] I daresay, that the members of the National Assembly, particularly the Senate, is a stabilizing institution in the polity of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe underscored the need for the National Assembly to work with the executive arm of government to provide the needed resources, as well as oversight the use of such funds in the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe killings across the country are so bad, and it is not acceptable to us, but we have to work hard because we are part of government and we are also accountable to the people, for not only protecting their lives and property, but to ensure that they have a life that is worth living,\u201d Lawan said.",

          "text": "By Christian Njoku\n\nGov. Ben Ayade declared on Thursday in Calabar that he would not privatize any of the 34 Cross River-owned companies in recognition of the choice of the people.\n\nAyade told newsmen that while privatizing the companies was the right thing to do, it was not politically correct.\n\nFew weeks back, Cross River conducted a referendum on the governor\u2019s plan to privatize the companies, but majority of Cross River people antagonised the plan.\n\nAccording to Ayade, his desire to privatize the companies was borne of a positive intention though the decision became unpopular.\n\n\u201cThe government has no business running a business, but I have to concede to the wishes of the people not because it is right but because it is politically correct.\n\n\u201cThere is a Privatisation Act of 2007 that empowers the state to carry out such action but it was necessary to seek the opinion of the people.\n\n\u201cThis is so that it would not be said that I have sold the companies to myself or to my friends.\n\n\u201cIn the interim, a management team will oversee the companies while ensuring that they are not just functional but viable for the state,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAyade also called on the people of Cross River to take advantage of the companies to create wealth for themselves by partnering.\n\nHe noted that as a littoral state with so much natural resources and good climate, Cross River had no business being poor.\n\n\u201cI took over a state that is basically a civil service state happy with dancing on the streets during Christmas in the name of carnivals which does not really yield much to the state.\n\n\u201cExperience has shown that the money we spend on hosting the carnival is far more than whatever comes into the state after it.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it is difficult for many people to see the big dreams of the governor as they prefer the filling of potholes, planting grasses, hosting carnivals and paying salaries,\u2019\u2019 he noted.\n\nAyade added that if the state was to grow, it must go beyond just being a civil service state with the salary mentality.",

          "text": "Queen Silekunola Naomi has declared her divorce from Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi Ojaja II, the Ooni of Ife.\n\nIn a statement posted on her verified Instagram handle and Facebook page on Thursday, she said announced an end to the three-year marriage.\n\nAccording to her, she tried to make the union work but said the monarch\u2019s public identity is at variance with \u201chis true self\u201d.\n\nThe fair-skinned ex-queen wrote, \u201cI did my best to endure and make it work; many times, I smiled through the struggle, but I have finally realised I had just one assignment, my son, and when God is done, He is done. He chose Saul to be king, and when He was done, He told the prophet Samuel I have moved on. Religion was never an issue between us; please refer to my interview on News Central TV. Instead, His Majesty has a picture he would love the world to see and perceive him as and another one which is his true self.\u201d\n\nThe evangelist then declared, \u201cToday I announce the beginning of a new dawn and the close of a chapter. Today, I am a mother to God\u2019s unique gift. I am no longer a slave to my thoughts of perfection. I, at this moment, announce that I shall no longer be referred to as wife to the Ooni of Ife or as Queen of Ile-Ife but as the Queen of the people and mother of my adorable Prince.\u201d\n\nResponding to some allegations, Silekunola said that her \u201cdecision to move on did not come because his majesty is married to another queen\u201d.\n\nShe further explained, \u201cAs many would love to assume, throughout our life as a couple, I was the only married wife to him. There were side attractions, but it was never an issue.\n\n\u201cI never approached him with any revelation of any sort, as many believed he contacted me first and made his proposal known several months later.\n\n\u201cThe marriage was not an arranged one, as many have misconstrued. I never knew the prophetess said to have introduced me to him. Instead, he introduced her to me after I agreed to marry him. I was only being polite out of respect for him.\n\n\u201cI have never been pregnant all my life before Tadenikawo; my son is my first ever pregnancy with medical reports to back it up. The girl who is said to be my daughter is my niece.\u201d\n\nThe Ooni previously suffered a marital breakdown in 2017 when he split from Edo-born Zaynab-Otiti Obanor, whom he married as a monarch on March 16, 2016. Obanor\u2019s marriage to the king lasted for 17 months before the separation.\n\nHe later married Silekunola in 2018 and the marriage produced a son, Tadenikawo.\n\nThe 47-year-old monarch also had a daughter with Omolara Olatubosun as a teenager. Olatubosun gave birth to Princess Adeola Ogunwusi but of recent, there have been counter-claims between the Ooni and Olatubosun over who was responsible for the upbringing of their daughter.",

We pray that people should be able to express themselves, bring different ideas, even when they conflict those ideas within the systems created by the democracy sit and iron them out.\n\n\u201cTo suggest that because there is dissent or differences in opinion, that it will affect the fortune of our party, I think that is quite far-fetched. We are a party that recognises that for us to continue to deliver, we must debate, we must compete, and we must bring ideas to the government.\n\n\u201cMind you, remember that particularly in the last two years, under the current caretaker committee chairman, Mai-Mala Buni, three serving governors, one serving deputy governor, a number of serving senators, members of the National Assembly, former this, former that have joined the party.\n\n\u201cThat is the best evidence that this party is continuing to deliver on the promises that Nigerians have trusted us with, under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari,\u201d he said.\n\nOn insecurity in Kebbi state, the governor urged Nigerians to be cautious about security issues.\n\n\u201cI think Nigerians; we have to be contextual about security issues. We are part of the human race and as long as the problem is not solved, anywhere, you cannot escape it sometimes.\n\n\u201cMany gains have been made, that is the thing, but there will always be that isolated or sporadic issue somewhere. What is important is for us to strengthen each other, strengthen our communities, support our communities, support our security agencies, support measures that will ensure that we will dominate rather than those who do not wish us well,\u201d he said.\n\nPGF on convention date\n\nIn a related development, Director General Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) Salihu Lukman has called on Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary/Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to urgently release the specific date for the party\u2019s national convention.\n\nLukman, while denying media reports that he was opposed to direct primaries, urged the National Assembly\u2019s leadership to rework contentious clauses in the rejected bill and forward same to the president for his assent.\n\nSpeaking during the unveiling of his new book, \u201cAPC and Campaign for New Nigeria\u201d, Wednesday in Abuja, the PDG boss further tasked party leaders on the question of internet provision within the party to ensure that every member of the party is aware of the records of members without any dispute.\u201d\n\nOn direct primary or otherwise, Lukman said: \u201cI am not opposed to direct primary, but there are some conditions which must be met for direct primary to be able to provide the democratic platform that will confirm the voice of individual members of the party.\u201d\n\nWhile commending Buni-led national caretaker committee, Lukman said: \u201cI\u2019m happy from the information we got from the media, the caretaker committee has confirmed that the convention is going to take place in February.\n\n\u201cMy appeal is for the caretaker committee to remain proactive; certain issues should not be allowed to go into speculation. Information about the date of the convention, I think should be made public so that every party member knows when the convention is going to hold in February.\n\n\u201cWe must commend the leadership of H.E Mai Mala Buni, for rising to that occasion and affirming that the February date is sacrosanct. So, party members should look forward for a specific date that will be announced by the caretaker committee.\n\n\u201cSome of those conditions include the fact that the membership of the political party must be very clear; it should not be in dispute. In APC, we are very clear in terms of ensuring that we prioritise the question of developing the membership database of our party. That was why we went through the process of membership registration and revalidation.\u201d\n\nDirect/indirect primary\n\nOn the controversy over direct and indirect primaries, he said \u201cthe whole debate about direct or indirect primary is basically an APC issue. To that extent, my position is to appeal to the leadership of the National Assembly to provide the necessary leadership so that we don\u2019t muddle up issues.\n\n\u201cMy argument is that the original bill which went for public hearing did not include all those provisions. It was out of the momentary anger I think, against governors following the management of the Congresses that led to the situation whereby National Assembly (NASS) members felt compelled to amend the law and include direct primaries.\n\n\u201cThe issues that are necessary in the Electoral Act which are not contentious are issues of electronic transmission of results and all the other issues.\n\n\u201cI think they should rework it and submit it to Mr. President for assent. The other issues of direct primaries should go through the normal legislative process and if it is passed, so be it, so that we don\u2019t throw the baby away with the bath water.\u201d\n\nOn the message of his latest book, Lukman said it is basically an appeal to APC leaders to prioritise internal negotiations.\n\n\u201cDemocracy is about negotiations. Our leaders have demonstrated very good capacity to make sacrifices and that is how the party even came about.\n\n\u201cI think at this point, it is important that our leaders embrace negotiations. It is just about ensuring that meetings take place and decisions taken are respected. It is the capacity of organs of the party to meet that provides a platform for negotiations.\n\n\u201cAnother point which is there in the book is an appeal to party leaders again to prioritise the issue of relationship because the major challenge of politics in this country today is poor management of relationship among party leaders.\n\n\u201cThis is creating a lot of internal crisis and I believe that as we move towards the convention, we should resume meetings of statutory organs of the party because that will help a number of issues whether it is that of congresses or any other disagreement. One meeting can settle everything.\n\n\u201cOur leaders should be able to convene a meeting, possibly, a meeting of National Caucus or National Executive Committee (NEC) before the convention, on the basis of which we can begin to resume the process of reorganizing ourselves and facing the challenge of providing leadership to this country as we move to 2023,\u201d he added.",

          "title": "FULL TEXT: President Buhari\u2019s letter on withholding assent to electoral bill -",
          "text": "The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, on Tuesday, at the opening of plenary read the communication from President Muhammadu Buhari on his rejection of the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill.\n\nWhile making his remark on the letter, Speaker Gbajabiamila said the House would act on Buhari\u2019s communication when the National Assembly resumes in January.\n\nThe letter, which was dated December 13, 2021, was received by the House on December 21, 2021 and it is titled, \u2018Withholding of Assent to Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021.\u2019\n\nRead the full text of the letter below\n\n\u201cFurther to the fetter dated 18th November, 2021, forwarded for presidential assent, the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021, as passed by the National Assembly, I have received informed advice from relevant ministries, departments and agencies of the government, and have also carefully reviewed the bill in light of the current realities prevalent in the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the circumstances.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Rt. Honourable Speaker may wish to note that the conduct of elections for the nomination of party candidates solely via direct primaries as envisaged by the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 has serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences which cannot be accommodated at the moment considering our nation\u2019s peculiarities. It also has implications on the rights of citizens to participate in the government as constitutionally ensured.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 seeks to amend certain provisions of the extant Electoral Act 2010. Part of the objective of the bill is the amendment of the present Section 87 of the Electoral Act, 2010, to delete the provision for the conduct of indirect primaries in the nomination of party candidates such that party candidates can henceforth only emerge through direct primaries.\n\n\u201cArising from the review, Mr. Speaker may wish to particularly note the pertinent issues implicated as follows to wit:\n\n\u201cThe conduct of direct primaries across the 8,809 wards across the length and breadth of the country will lead to a significant spike in the cost of conducting primary elections by parties as well as increase in the cost of monitoring such elections by INEC who has to deploy monitors across these wards each time a party is to conduct direct primaries for the presidential, gubernatorial and legislative posts. The addition of these costs with the already huge cost of conducting general elections will inevitable lead to huge financial burden on both the political parties, INEC and the economy in general at a time of dwindling revenues.\n\n\u201cThe indirect consequences of the issues of high cost and monetisation are that it will raise financial crimes and constitute further strain on the economy. It will also stifle smaller parties without the enormous resources required to mobilise all party members for the primaries. This is not healthy for the sustenance of multi-party democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn addition to increased costs identified above, conducting and monitoring primary elections across 8,809 wards will pose huge security challenges as the security agencies will also be overstretched, direct primaries will be open to participation from all and sundry and such large turn-out without effective security coordination will also engender intimidation and disruptions, thereby raising credibility issues for the outcomes of such elections.\n\n\u201cThe amendment as proposed is a violation of the underlying spirit of democracy which is characterised by freedom of choices. Political party membership is a voluntary exercise of the constitutional right to freedom of association. Several millions of Nigerians are not card carrying members of any political party. Thus, the emphasis should be on enabling qualified Nigerians to vote for the candidate of their choice during general elections as a means of participation in governance and furtherance of the concept of universal adult suffrage or universal franchise.\n\nThe proposed amendment may also give rise to plethora of Litigations based on diverse grounds and issues of Law, including but not limited to the fact that the proposed amendment cannot work in retrospect given that the existing Constitution of the parties already registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) permits direct, indirect and consensus primaries. This real possibility, will, without doubt, truncate the electoral program of the nation as another electoral exercise is imminent towards a change of government in 2023.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at the moment still grappling with the issues of monetisation of the political process and vote buying at both party and general elections. The direct implication of institutionalising only direct primaries is the aggravation of over-monetisation of the process as there will be much more people a contestant needs to reach out to thereby further fuelling corruption and abuse of office by incumbent contestants who may resort to public resources to satisfy the increased demands and logistics of winning party primaries.\n\n\u201cDirect primaries are also subject or susceptible to manipulation or malpractices as most parties cannot boast of reliable and verified membership Register or valid means of identification which therefore means non-members can be recruited to vote by wealthy contestants to influence the outcome. Rival parties can also conspire and mobilise people to vote against a good or popular candidate in a party during its primaries just to pave way for their own candidates. Whereas where voting is done by accredited delegates during indirect primaries, the above irregularities are not possible.\n\nIt further read, \u201cThe major conclusions arrived at upon the review are highlighted hereunder, to wit:\n\n\u201cAsides its serious adverse legal, financial, economic and security consequences, the limitation or restriction of the nomination procedures available to political parties and their members constitutes an affront to the right to freedom of association. It is thus undemocratic to restrict the procedure or means of nomination of candidates by political parties, as it also amounts to undue interference in the affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries or collegiate elections are part of internationally accepted electoral practices. More so, direct primaries are not free from manipulations and do not particularly guarantee the emergence of the will of the people especially in circumstances like ours where it is near impossible to sustain a workable implementation framework or structure thereof.\n\n\u201cIn the premise of the above, I hereby signify to the National Assembly that I am constrained to withhold assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2021 in line with the provisions of Section 58(1) & (4) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). It is my considered position that the political parties should be allowed to freely exercise right of choice in deciding which of direct or indirect primary to adopt in the conduct of their primary elections as their respective realities may permit.\n\n\u201cPlease accept, Rt. Honourable Speaker, the assurance of my highest deration and esteem.\u201d",

          "text": "World\u2019s second-biggest miner Rio Tinto Group has agreed to buy a lithium mine in Argentina for $825 million as the company accelerates its push into battery materials.\n\nThe top mining firms are increasingly looking to expand into so-called future facing commodities, such as lithium, copper and even fertilizers, as investors and governments increase pressure on more polluting materials that have long been the most profitable.\n\nRio stated that it will buy the Rincon asset in Argentina from private equity buyers. The lithium brine project is in the so-called lithium triangle in South America, home to many of the best lithium deposits. Major automakers from Tesla Inc. to Volkswagen AG need an ever-growing supply of battery materials to accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles.\n\nThe deal, along with the recent acquisitions of Millennial Lithium Corp. and Neo Lithium Corp., helps cement Argentina\u2019s position as a long-term destination for lithium development, said Chris Berry, president of industry consultancy House Mountain Partners.\n\nAccording to the Rio Chief Executive Officer, Jakob Stausholm, \u201cThis acquisition is strongly aligned with our strategy to prioritize growth capital in commodities that support decarbonisation and to continue to deliver attractive returns to shareholders.\u201d\n\nThe company said the undeveloped project has the potential to produce battery grade lithium carbonate.\n\nRio is already looking to develop a $2.4 billion lithium mine in Serbia as it moves to diversify its business away from iron ore. Yet, the company\u2019s plans there have come under pressure from local activists who have filled streets in protest against the project.\n\nThose hurdles make the deal in Argentina \u201cespecially important,\u201d House Mountain\u2019s Berry said. \u201cOne of the biggest mistakes I see mining companies make is that they don\u2019t have a plan B. Clearly, Rio has thought their lithium strategy through.\u201d\n\nRio\u2019s push into lithium comes as prices surge. The global transition toward electrified transport has fired up consumption and lithium prices have more than tripled this year to a record. Miners are scurrying to expand capacity, but they can\u2019t keep up with demand and market tightness is likely to persist in the near term.\n\nRio\u2019s peers, which have so far shunned lithium, are also looking to diversify. Larger miner BHP Group is trying to buy a Canadian nickel project \u2014 another vital component in the types of batteries that power electric cars or back up renewable energy. It\u2019s also looking to build a giant fertilizer mine, as is Anglo American Plc.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",

          "title": "Electoral Act Amendment: Nigeria Senate Cowers, Suspends Move to Override Buhari\u2019s Veto",
          "text": "Despite the resolve and threat by many senators on Tuesday to overrule President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s veto of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, the senate Wednesday, backed down from its resolve. In place of the move, which had seen the collection of signatures for the proposition, the upper chamber resolved to liaise with the House of Representatives on how best to handle the president\u2019s rejection of the electoral reform bill.\n\nThe senate also agreed to involve their constituents in the consultation process during the Christmas break before taking a final decision by January.\n\nBuhari had declined assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, citing issues with direct primaries provisions in the bill.\n\nBut members of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives said the reasons given by the president for not assenting to the bill were a mere decoy to stop the electronic transmission of results by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), using direct primaries as a peg.\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, went ahead to identify two plausible options currently before the National Assembly. Saraki said the legislature should either veto Buhari\u2019s decline of assent or remove the contentious provisions on direct primaries and send the bill back to the president for his assent.\n\nSome senators had at the end of Tuesday\u2019s plenary expressed anger over the president\u2019s rejection of the electoral bill, saying they have secured over 75 signatures ahead of a plan to veto the president at Wednesday\u2019s plenary. But the threat was eventually not carried out, as President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, while summarising the outcome of their closed-door session, said the senate would now consult with the House of Representatives on how to respond to Buhari\u2019s letter on the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill.\n\nAccording to Lawan, the provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) do not permit the upper chamber to exclusively take action on such matters in the absence of the House of Representatives, which had already embarked on vacation. He assured Nigerians that a joint position would be reached with the House after due consultation with the people to determine the appropriate line of action, when both chambers reconvene from the Christmas break in January.\n\nSpeaking on what transpired at the executive session, the senate president said, \u201cThe senate in a closed session deliberated on matters relevant to the workings of the senate, in particular, and, the National Assembly, in general.\n\n\u201cThe senate, also, in the closed session, discussed how to respond to the letter from Mr. President on the electoral bill amendment. The senate consequently resolved to consult with the House of Representatives in January, when both the senate and House will be in session.\n\n\u201cPresently, the House of Reps has gone on recess and, like we all know, the constitutional provision is for the senate and House of Representatives to jointly take the appropriate action.\n\n\u201cThe senate also resolved to consult with our constituents during our recess in January. The senate believes that our constituents have a role to play as the major stakeholders in the laws that we make in the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nHowever, the leader of the PDP caucus in the House, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, in a statement yesterday, said the president was actually trying hard to avoid the electronic transmission of results and had used direct primaries as a decoy.\n\nThe caucus assured Nigerians that it would ensure that its members exercised their constitutional power to veto the president whenever the matter was tabled for discussion\n\nChinda said, \u201cThe untold reason of declining is to avoid the electronic transmission of results, which will improve the credibility of the electoral system. This refusal, though contemplated, has left Nigerians confounded by a president, who continues to show utter disdain for the constitution and the reform of the institutions of state.\n\n\u201cUnder him, our institutions of state have regressed, to the point that the gains of previous institutional reforms embarked on by Our Great Party while in power, have been either lost to his inaction or to his deliberate ploy to leave our country worse than he met it. On this point alone, we are not convinced that he is interested in the reform of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cAs an opposition caucus, we will ensure that our members exercise their power under Section 58(5) of the constitution to veto the president whenever the National Assembly deems it fit to table the issue for discussion.\u201d\n\nSaraki Identifies Options Before Legislature\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, opposed Buhari\u2019s decision to throw out the entire amendments to the electoral bill, saying there are two options before the federal lawmakers.\n\nIn a statement, Saraki said the lawmakers could override the president\u2019s decline of assent or remove the contentious provisions on direct primaries and send the bill back to the president for his assent.\n\nThe former senate president stated, \u201cNow that Mr. President has conveyed his decision to decline assent to the Electoral Act [amendment] Bill, I am sure that I speak on behalf of millions of Nigerians in urging the National Assembly to act fast. This is because we cannot sit back and allow one contentious clause to throw away all the positives in the proposed Electoral Act (amendment) Bill.\n\n\u201cAt this point, two options are open to the National Assembly. They either veto the president\u2019s decline of assent or remove the contentious provision on direct primaries and send it back to the president for his assent. Whichever option our legislators choose, can be accomplished in the shortest possible time. We could have a new electoral law in January 2022.\n\n\u201cAnyone that has been following the mood of the nation knows that Nigerians desire to have a new electoral law that will lead to having a credible, free, fair, and peaceful process of electing our leaders. They want a system that will ensure that their votes truly count in the election of those who govern them.\n\n\u201cThis proposed electoral law is expected to reassure the youths, many of whom steer clear of the political process, because they have no confidence in the system. They believe the system is usually rigged and compromised. One way to bring this active demography into the political system is to enact a new law that will give them hope in our nation. This Electoral Act [Amendment] Bill serves that purpose.\n\n\u201cThis is why, as the representatives of the Nigerian people, the National Assembly must take a decision in the interest of our nation and its long-term democracy. The option of not doing anything after the refusal of the assent by the president is not an option. Our legislators in both chambers of the National Assembly and Mr. President must ensure that it becomes a law without delay.\u201d\n\nPDP: APC Scuttling Electoral Reform for Fear of 2023\n\nThe leadership of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accused the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of ruining the Electoral Act Amendment Bill because some key provisions of the bill would not allow them to rig the 2023 general election. PDP said its investigations revealed that the undercurrent was fear of failure at the 2023 general election and the positive implications that the electoral bill would have by guaranteeing electronic transmission of election results.\n\nThe opposition party recalled that APC had been in trepidation of the amendment to the Electoral Act due mainly to the provision of electronic transmission of election results, which would completely eliminate manipulations and alteration of results at elections.\n\nA statement by National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, said it was apparent that APC and the Buhari presidency were never committed to the amendment of the Electoral Act to ensure credible elections. PDP accused APC of triggering a controversy over the mode of primaries by political parties as a camouflage to scuttle the entire amendment, including provisions for electronic transmission of results.\n\nPDP said, \u201cIt is imperative to remind Nigerians of how the APC, in collusion with their leaders in the National Assembly, fought hard to stop the electronic transmission of results provision in the bill, but were resisted by Nigerians supported by the courageous action of the PDP Caucus in the House of Representatives, which staged a walkout only for the APC to orchestrate controversies and set the stage for the withholding of assent by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cThe main reason for this manipulation of the legislative process by the APC is to prevent the electronic transmission of results so that it can continue in its culture of rigging and electoral impunities, including alteration of results at collation, ballot box snatching, destruction of data, among others, just to cling to power against the will of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSuch is consistent with the APC\u2019s well-known machination against every genuine effort to instil credible, transparent, free and fair elections in Nigeria in the last six years. The APC thrives in electoral scam, duplicity, underhand dealings, violence and political brigandage, all in their heinous script to put Nigerians under perpetual bondage.\u201d\n\nPDP alleged that APC, having been rejected for its failures and having also self-decimated its structures across the country, had completely lost the capacity and goodwill for electoral contest and as such sought every means to subvert any process that could guarantee credible elections in 2023.\n\nPDP said the subversion of the passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill by APC further validated the fact that APC was averse to the aspiration of Nigerians and did not believe in democratic principles of credible elections.\n\nMore Nigerians React\u2026\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians from all walks of life have continued to react to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s refusal to assent to the electoral bill.\n\nA member of the House of Representative, Henry Nwawuba, said he did not see any power tussle at play in the whole situation.\n\nNwawuba, who spoke Wednesday on the Morning Show of ARISE NEWS Channel, said, \u201cIt is part of the process that as it goes through the rounds in the House, we expose the law to public dialogue, and then we send it off for access. The speaker has said when we come back in January, we are going to take another look at the electoral bill, as it is not over yet.\u201d\n\nOn the news that almost 80 senators had agreed to override the president, Nwawuba stressed that the bill was in the courts of the National Assembly, which would come together and take the best decision in the interest of Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is a critical piece of legislation that is contained in our legislative agenda and we are determined to see them through. We are going to deal with the Electoral Act, by the grace of God, when we come back in January.\u201d\n\nA lawyer, Oluwole Osaze-Uzzi, who also spoke Wednesday on the Morning Show, clarified the issue of indirect primaries, saying each party has the right to choose direct or indirect primaries.\n\nAccording to Osaze-Uzzi, direct primaries support every member of the political party to vote and choose the candidate for a particular election.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThere are many good sides of the bill and we must not lose sight of those aspects. There are also some aspects the president did not touch, which some find worrisome. The timelines have been extended for the conduct of primaries for all sorts of steps to be taken as expected by the law.\u201d\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Kunle Adegoke, said on the ARISE Morning Show that political parties were free to determine their internal affairs. Adegoke explained that the recent intervention by the legislature to regulate the affairs of political parties actually stemmed from the fact that the power given to the political parties to regulate their internal affairs had been substantially abused and this has led to a lot of agitation.\n\nAdegoke said, \u201cThe National Assembly knows the constitution that we run in Nigeria recognises only the legislature to take a final decision in this regard. We can as well pass the act all over again and the president will have no choice. We can\u2019t just say we have the power and we are free to exercise it, we must look at all factors that fit the process we are trying to take on.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale, Juliet Akoje in Abuja, Emma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos",
          "summary": "Despite the resolve and threat by many senators on Tuesday to overrule President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s veto of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, the senate Wednesday, backed down from its resolve.\nBuhari had declined assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, citing issues with direct primaries provisions in the bill.\n\u201cThe senate, also, in the closed session, discussed how to respond to the letter from Mr. President on the electoral bill amendment.\nThis is because we cannot sit back and allow one contentious clause to throw away all the positives in the proposed Electoral Act (amendment) Bill.\nThis Electoral Act [Amendment] Bill serves that purpose.",

and\n\n\u201cFurther aware that the 2021 Budget Implementation is faced with challenges that will require additional funding for some critical and urgent Line Items in the Budget,\u201d he explained.\n\nBuhari in his virement request contained in a letter dated December 16, 2021, said the sum of N276,757,232,395 would be sourced from the N365 billion Service Wide Vote for Upscaling of National Social Investment Programme (NSIP).\n\nA breakdown of the virement request detailed by the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning showed that N199, 129,053,400 was for payment of local contractors\u2019 debts, public service wage adjustment for MDAs, OSSAP SDGs Projects 3 and Group Life Assurance for all MDAs.\n\nIn addition, N4, 500,821,569 is for the Federal Ministry of Education;

For us to come out of the recession that we found ourselves in the previous period, we must have had the fortune of passing the budget and getting Mr. President to sign in time.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe that the economy of Nigeria, and Nigerian businesses especially, will continue to benefit from the passage of the appropriation bills in time and the assent by Mr. President, accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it clear that our desire is to provide legislations for the peace, order and good government of our country.\u201d\n\nLawan further stated that the Red Chamber would consider the report of the Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution as soon as it is presented early next year.\n\n\u201cWhen we return, we have one major that has not been attended to at all as a chamber, and that is the constitutional amendments.\n\n\u201cOur Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution has been doing its work. But as a chamber, we haven\u2019t finished working on it.\n\n\u201cWe are expectant that our Committee on the review of the constitution will be presenting the report to this chamber as soon as we resume. The committee has done so much, and the report is almost ready.\n\n\u201cWhen we harmonise with our colleagues in the House, we should be able to vote on the issues that will particularly bring about peace, unity and good government in our country, before such bill will be sent to the State Houses of Assembly for concurrence,\u201d the Senate President said.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, we must thank Almighty God that almost all those major items we reflected in our legislative agenda as a chamber has been attended to.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that has been left out, including the review or amendment to our standing orders on how our committees have better and more clearly defined jurisdictions and, of course, how we conduct ourselves here as a chamber.\n\n\u201cAnd this is because we\u2019ve remained united even in the face of sometimes very difficult issues. We have gone through such difficult moments with dignity and respect for each other, and we have come out even stronger,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reminded his colleagues of the role of the Senate as an institution to stabilise the polity, particularly against the backdrop of issues likely to surface ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cNext year, by the grace of God, will be the last lap of our tenure. So, we have a lot to ensure that we finish all the things that we have penciled down for ourselves and, of course, there are many other issues that from time to time will be coming up in our polity.\n\n\u201cThis Senate is supposed to play that role of stabilising the polity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd I daresay, that the members of the National Assembly, particularly the Senate, is a stabilising institution in the polity of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nLawan underscored the need for the National Assembly to work with the executive arm of government to provide the needed resources, as well as oversight the use of such funds in the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe killings across the country are so bad, and it is not acceptable to us, but we have to work hard because we are part of government and we are also accountable to the people, for not only protecting their lives and property, but to ensure that they have a life that is worth living.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje in Abuja",
