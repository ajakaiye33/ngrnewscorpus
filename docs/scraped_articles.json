They were trained using a robust curriculum spanning the broad areas of finance, marketing and sales, leadership, technology, branding, strategy, innovation and business transformation.\n\nNigerian and international consultants from the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management Germany, Ernst & Young, Matt Anthony Consulting, IBFC Alliance, and Kuhl-Cher were part of the facilitators at the Business School.\n\nTwo beneficiaries, Emmanuel Elo-Irawo and Adesuwa Oguocha commended Wema Bank for the initiative, expressing what they had gained immensely from the Business School.\n\nElo-Irawo who operates a frozen fish chain, said: \u201cThey blew my mind because I wasn\u2019t expecting much. I thought it was a forum where they would gather us and give us one or two pieces of information. The sessions have been very revealing, and I now have more knowledge of how to run my business. There is no way Nigeria will develop without trainings like this, and I am very pleased to be part of it.\u201d\n\nOguocha, Creative Director, Suwa Couture described the sessions as \u201cawesome.\u201d Her words: \u201cI am at a stage where I need to scale, and I want to get things right. So far, it has been expository. It\u2019s been explosive. Yesterday alone, the quality of what we learnt, I have already started taking mental and written decisions concerning my business.\n\nThe good thing about this training is that it is practical. You have room to air your concerns and get clarifications. My advice to anyone who isn\u2019t here is to try to apply for the next cohort. It\u2019s worth your time.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the training, Head, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), Wema Bank, Arthur Nkemeh, assured that the institution would not relent to help MSMEs scale and grow their businesses. He added that the Business School is not just for its customers but for all Nigerian SMEs.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is not just about our customers. It is about our passion in supporting and developing SMEs, creating employment, and impacting the economy. SMEs consist of about 90 per cent of the businesses in the country and they are the highest employer of labour. If we continue to support MSMEs to grow their businesses and scale, they will create more employment and impact the entire ecosystem,\u201d Nkemeh said.\n\nHe added that the training affirms the Bank\u2019s commitment and passion for MSMEs that it has supported in its 76 years of its existence.\n\n\u201cWe are an SME-centric bank. So, we are trying to help SMEs to scale and learn better ways of doing their business with top-notch consultants from within and outside Nigeria. Part of our curriculum speaks to leadership, finance, marketing, business management, innovation, business transformation, & strategy.\n\nHe disclosed that the class would have been larger, but the Bank needed to observe the COVID-19 protocol and that there would be virtual and physical classes in select cities.\n\n\u201cAfter this session, we will have online sessions to enable more MSMEs to participate in the Business School program. We will mix it with some physical sessions. Next time, we might move to Abuja or Port-Harcourt to have a regionalised program.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that beyond the Business School, Wema Bank has other capacity-building programs, including business clinics, workshops, seminars, webinars and mentorship programs that will help SMEs survive and scale.",

          "title": "Govs disown FG over $418m consultancy debt",
          "text": "By Romanus Okoye\n\nThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) has warned all chief executives of banks and their compliance officers not to give value to any promissory notes issued by the Debt Management Office (DMO) for allegedly paying Paris Club consultants fees totalling USD$418 million.\n\nThe governors also called on the public to be at alert over what they alleged to be \u201chasty attempt to circumvent the rule of law and dissipate hard earned public funds meant for development purposes to private persons on matters which are presently being litigated upon.\n\n\u201cLet no grant be sealed in the funds of the 36 states of the Federation and the 774 local government areas in the sums mentioned in this caveat without notice to the caveator (NGF) as the matter of the payments is subjudice.\u201d\n\nCounsel to the NGF, PH Ogbole, SAN, in a letter dated September 3, noted: \u201cThe attention of the NGF had been drawn to an online publication in Premium Times dated August 31, 2012 by one Ade Adesomoju and captioned \u201cExclusive: Buhari ignores governors\u2019 call for audit, approves payment of $418million suspicious debts.\n\n\u201cThe information in this report indicates that some consultants/contractors allege that they were retained by some states and had done some work for the states and local governments in Nigeria pertaining to the Paris Club refund by the Federal Government of Nigeria. The Minister of Finance is said to have directed the Director General, Debt Management Office (DMO) to issue Promissory Notes in favour of the consultants. The purported amounts claimed by the various consultants are as follows: Ned Nwoke-USD142,028,941; Ted Iseghoghi Edwards -USD159,000,000;Riok Nigeria Ltd, Orji Nwafor Orizu and Olaitan Bello \u2013 USD142,028,941.95; Panic Alert Security System Ltd and George Uboh \u2013 USD47,831,920.\n\n\u201cThese consultants rely on judgments of the Federal High Court which are presently being challenged by the NGF in several actions in various courts vide suits No: (1) FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2018 between Panic Alert Security Systems Ltd & anor and The Trustees of the Nigeria Governors Forums & 3ors (2) FHC/ABJ/CS/453/2021 between The Trustees of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and Panic Alert Security Systems Ltd & 5 or (3) M/3542/2021 between Riok Nigeria Ltd & 3ors and The Trustees of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum\n\n\u201cIt is interesting to note that some of the consultants have already joined issues with the NGF and the matters have been set down for hearing on September 28 and 29, 2021. The Honourable Minister of Finance, the DG, DMO and the AGF had since been duly served and notified of the pendency of these actions in court in different letters written by counsel to the NGF.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore strange and indeed alarming that having been served and made aware of the pendency of the various court cases; the Honourable Minister of Finance would readily but in complete disregard of the law direct that Promissory Notes be issued in favour of the consultants.\n\n\u201cIt must be noted that custodians and managers of public funds are public trustees and must at all times act in the public interest. In this case, the interest of all the states and local governments of the Federation are involved and ought to be protected by the Hon. Minister of Finance.\n\n\u201cThe issuance of Promissory Notes of a humongous sum of over USD$418million to private persons for alleged consultancy work demands not only caution but strict due diligence, particularly when the judgments which gave rise to the payments sought to be enforced are the subject of pending litigation. Matters that are subjudice must not be acted upon in a manner that will foist a situation of complete helplessness on the courts and render their decisions nugatory.\n\n\u201cThis caveat is therefore issued as a further notice to the Honourable Minister of Finance and the Director General, Debt Management Office to act in the interest of the public and refrain from foisting on the nation another case of P&ID in which but due diligence, the nation would have been fleeced of billions of dollars. The nation is already going through economic adversity and every dollar is needed to be channelled to people-oriented projects. Public duty and probity demand that public trustees must, at all times, act in the interest of the people they serve in order to protect their commonwealth. Accordingly, justice must be allowed to run its full course.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

The Director of Information, National Judicial Council (NJC), Mr. Soji Oye confirmed the development in a statement issued on Sunday.\n\nThe CJN who is the Chairman of the National Judicial Council (NJC) had on August 30, issued the summons to the Chief Judges.\n\nA copy of the summons which was sighted by our reporter directed the affected Chief Judges are to appear before him as a prelude to the larger one by the NJC to explain what warranted issuance of conflicting orders by courts of coordinate jurisdiction.\n\nJustice Muhammad was specifically irked by the huge embarrassment caused the Nigeria\u2019s judiciary by the actions of those who issued the conflicting orders upon ex parte applications by some political parties.\n\nThe summons read in part, \u201cMy attention has been drawn to media reports to the effect that some Courts of coordinate jurisdiction were granting conflicting ex parte orders on the same subject matter.\n\n\u201cIt has become expedient for me to invite you for a detailed briefing on the development.\n\n\u201cThis is even more compelling having regard to earlier NJC warning to judicial officers on the need to be circumspect in granting ex parte applications\u201d.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

A lot of ignorant people were against the former governor of Bayelsa State, who rose and championed a walkout in the Senate. But that is what a true son of Ijawland should do.

          "title": "Why PDP May Lose All Southern States if It Zones Presidency to North",
          "text": "\u2022Delta, Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Oyo vulnerable to APC take over\n\n\u2022Party still weak in most Northern, Middlebelt states, unlikely to make appreciable gains\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThere is a high possibility that the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) might pick its presidential candidate for the 2023 general election from the North, as stakeholders are set to zone the chairmanship position of the party to the South in a matter of weeks.\n\nThis, however, appears contrary to the survey by the THISDAY Economic Intelligence Group (EIG), which gleaned from the field that the decision could cost PDP the elections in practically all the southern states, the presidency and governorship inclusive.\n\nFindings also revealed that the PDP might not make any appreciable gains in the north and Middlebelt states either, as the All Progressives Congress (APC), is still likely to sweep the north even with a Southern candidate.\n\nOne key reality of the current state of play is that the PDP is still vulnerable in many northern states, including the ones it currently controls and the ones it doesn\u2019t. The party might, however, lose states like Taraba, Benue and unable to win back Plateau, if it decided to zone presidency to the north.\n\nAt centre of the war of attrition over the chairmanship of the party lies the desperate permutations of where the party zones its presidential ticket to. The Southerners, who want Secondus out, want him out to pave the way for a replacement from the north, while the northern group led by Atiku and co, wants him to either stay or be replaced by another southerner to solidify their push for the presidential ticket to be zoned to the north.\n\nIn the south, the particularly vulnerable key states that the PDP is likely to lose are Delta, Akwa Ibom, Rivers and Oyo, if the ruling APC played smart by zoning its presidential ticket to the South. Such a move, findings showed, could give the APC a sweeping momentum in the countdown to the 2023 elections that would see it maintaining its hold on power.\n\nAccording to the THISDAY EIG survey, \u201cIf the PDP zones the Presidency to the North, they are likely to lose all their current Southern states, essentially, because of the mood in the South that Nigeria\u2019s Presidency should rotate between the North and the South.\n\n\u201cMost Southerners believe that, for equity, balance, cohesion, security and stability of the union, the next president should come from the Southern part of Nigeria, after Buhari would have completed eight years in 2023. To propose otherwise is almost an anathema among the political class and even among the average southerner.\n\n\u201cIt is that mood of the southern people that was reflected, when 17 southern governors met and asked that the president should go to the South. Right now, Southern leaders are so united that they don\u2019t want to be divided on the issue and don\u2019t mind where in the south the president comes from \u2013 whether from the South-east, South-south or South-west.\n\n\u201cThey are of the view that it is in the collective interest of the entire south to produce the next president. They believe all southern people should be entitled to run and whoever gets the ticket from the region would be accepted.\n\n\u201cThis is actually the undercurrent in the crisis over Uche Secondus\u2019 chairmanship in PDP, which has pitted Governor Nyesom Wike against Secondus, with many southern governors silently supporting Wike\u2019s position, believing that if Secondus retains the chairmanship of the party after the convention, the Presidency would automatically go to the North, which they don\u2019t want. Wike\u2019s attempt to force Secondus out is supported by most of the southern PDP governors, albeit quietly.\u201d\n\nThe survey further gathered that, \u201cMany of them (governors) are looking to people like Makarfi as a possible chairman of the party after Secondus.\n\nHowever, to counter them, the northern group with presidential bid led by a former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar; for President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki; Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; and his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Muhammed, supported tacitly by Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, a former Kano State governor, want the South to produce the next PDP chairman, even after Secondus, so that the presidency could be in the North.\u201d\n\nTo achieve this, the northern group has engaged individuals, like the Chairman of Daar Communications, Dr. Raymond Dokpesi, and others, who are also seeking to be vice president, from the South, to start speaking in support of the northern PDP members\u2019 agenda.\n\nFrom the analysis of the survey, if the trajectory of the country was reviewed from 1960, the North has produced more presidents, and in the 1999 Constitution, there is an agreement that for the survival of the country, power must rotate between North and South.\n\nIt was based on these undercurrents, that the THISDAY EIG carried out a survey, as it has always done since 1999, where it noticed that in each of the PDP states in the South, PDP was likely to lose the governorship with a northern presidency, given the overwhelming move in the South for a president from the region.\n\nThat momentum, from all indications, might therefore lead to the loss of states likes Cross River (the governor has already defected), Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Delta, Abia, Enugu and Oyo.\n\nCurrently, there would not be an election in Edo next year. However, Obaseki, although a PDP governor, the survey showed, is a firm believer in the southern presidency.\n\nThe southern governors believe that for the survival of the PDP post-2023, power has to move down South.\n\nAccording to the survey, the factors in each of the critical southern states, with seeming PDP influence, painted scenarios peculiar to them.\n\nIn Cross River, for instance, even though the governor has defected to the ruling APC, the state is predominantly PDP. But the governor, Professor Ben Ayade, the survey showed, would get momentum and defeat Liyel Imoke and Donald Duke \u2013 two former governors combined \u2013 if PDP chose a northern president and APC settled for a southern presidential candidate. This, the survey added, could make the governor take the state deeper into APC.\n\nThe Akwa Ibom situation is not quite different, according to the survey. While the governor, Udom Emmanuel, is by every measure considered to be doing well, a northern presidential candidate as the PDP standard bearer, would be a hard sell for him and could lose the state to other forces, such as the current APC National Secretary, Senator James Akpanudoedehe, and the Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, who would use federal incumbency to sweep PDP away.\n\nRivers, a crucial PDP state, might easily slip the way of former Governor Chibuike Amaechi, who is currently the Minister of Transportation, and effectively dislodging Governor Nyesom Wike, should the party embrace a northern presidential candidate. The state is already 50-50 for both leading parties and the APC has federal might to its advantage.\n\nBayelsa State is even more vulnerable, because despite the misgivings about the APC governorship candidate, David Lyon, who won by a majority of the public votes in the last election, the party still won. But the PDP only came in through the court. However, with the current Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, and huge federal forces and privileges, APC would just replay the card it played the last time, if the APC put forward a southern candidate and PDP went North.\n\nFrom Delta\u2019s axis, there\u2019s no debating the fact that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa is popular, especially, based on his performance record. But in the face of a southern candidate for APC and a northern candidate for PDP, his popularity would not save his party.\n\nThe party would most likely be swept out by the combined forces of the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, and the Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo, as well as others in the APC. With federal support, they would dislodge the PDP in Delta and sweep Okowa away, should the PDP present a northern president.\n\nThis scenario also applies to Oyo, being PDP\u2019s only state in the South-west, where Governor Seyi Makinde, is surrounded by counterparts from the ruling party. In fact, survey showed he is hugely disadvantaged.\n\nThe survey, nonetheless, from the permutations that came out during PDP\u2019s 92nd National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting some weeks ago, there were indications that the party might actually zone its presidential ticket to the North and the office of the national chairman to the South.\n\nAs a result of this, the governors of the party from the North, believed to have presidential interest, have begun to jostle to ensure the emergence of a national chairman that would be disposed to their aspiration.\n\nA former military governor of Lagos State and later civilian governor of Osun State, Col. Olagunsoye Oyinlola, for instance, is said to be the favourite of many of the bigwigs, should the incumbent, Secondus, decide not to re-contest in the October 30th and 31th national convention in Abuja.\n\nSecondus, in a statement, had stated that his tenure as the national chairman would end on December 9 2021, because he was elected on December 9, 2017, and sworn in same day.\n\nRegardless, the embattled national chairman had recently debunked rumours that he had resigned from his position.\n\nA statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Mr. Ike Abonyi, dismissed the report as untrue, but he contended that he was merely obeying an interim court order at the time.\n\nHe added that as a law-abiding citizen, who had been an adherent of the rule of law as a basis for democracy, he had to stay away as a form of respect for the courts.\n\nThe offices of the national chairman of the PDP and other members of the National Working Committee (NWC) are guaranteed four-year term.\n\nOfficially, PDP is expected to submit the approved zoning of offices of the members of the NWC to the coming NEC meeting on September 9 2021, other stakeholders have been plotting to see that the NWC members elected were pliable to their aspiration.\n\nIn this regard, some stakeholders were believed to be working to ensure that the national chairmanship of the party was micro-zoned to the South-west, but a few others insisted that zoning it to the South-west might prove difficult, as it could amount to abridging the constitutional rights of Secondus to seek a constitutional re-election.\n\nOn his part, Dokpsei too has since debunked reports that he was in the chairmanship race. A statement from him claimed he wanted to keep his integrity and not soil or dent it.\n\nUnfortunately, nobody from the South-east has indicated interest in the presidential run, not even a former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, who was Atiku\u2019s running mate in the 2019 presidential election.\n\nHowever, from the North, the list has continued to increase. There are several posters at the party secretariat in Abuja announcing the aspirations of Tambuwal, Atiku, Mohammed, Kwankwaso, and a former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido.\n\nAhead of the zoning for both the presidential ticket and office of the national chairman, the chairman, Board of Trustees (BoT) of the PDP, Senator Waliid Jubrin, and Dokpesi have said the main opposition party stood a better chance in 2023 with a northern candidate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Equatorial Guinea in December 2017, Gabon in January 2019, Sudan in April 2019, Mali in August 2020. And in March this year, Niger Republic foiled an attempt by the military to seize power.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Government and the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, have condemned the coup and demanded immediate release of President Cond\u00e9.\n\nA statement issued by the spokesperson of the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Esther Sunsuwa, yesterday said: \u201cThe Nigerian Government is saddened by the apparent coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that has taken place in the Republic of Guinea today (yesterday), in clear violation of the ECOWAS Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance.\n\n\u201cThe government strongly condemns and rejects any unconstitutional change of government and therefore calls on those behind this coup to restore constitutional order without delay and protect all lives and property.\u201d\n\nThe West African country of Guinea is rich in natural resources, but years of unrest and mismanagement have made the country to become one of the world\u2019s poorest.\n\nNine unnamed soldiers, severally draped in the red, gold and green national flag, said they had taken over power, because of rampant corruption, mismanagement and poverty.\n\nCalling themselves the National Committee for Reconciliation and Development, they said the constitution had been dissolved and that there would be consultations to create a new, more inclusive one.\n\nNumerous reports have stated that the coup was led by an elite unit headed by a former French legionnaire, Lt.Col Mamady Doumbouya.\n\nAlso, in a viral video, which the media, including the BBC, has not been able to verify, the soldiers asked President Cond\u00e9, 83, to confirm he was unharmed, but he refused to respond.\n\nSitting barefoot on a sofa wearing jeans and a printed shirt, he did not have any visible injuries. His current whereabouts were also unknown at press time.\n\nThose behind the coup said all land and air borders had been closed for a week.\n\nBut from the defence ministry, forces loyal to the president have \u201ccontained the threat and repelled the group of assailants.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the only bridge connecting the mainland to the Kaloum peninsular, housing most ministries and the presidential palace, was sealed off while many soldiers, some heavily armed, were posted around the palace, a military source told Reuters news agency.\n\nThere were unconfirmed reports that three soldiers had been killed.\n\nAs a result of the unrest, Guinea\u2019s football World Cup qualifying match against Morocco at home on 6 September has equally been postponed.\n\nFootball body FIFA said the decision was made to \u201censure the safety and security of all players and to protect all match officials.\u201d\n\nPresident Cond\u00e9 was re-elected for a controversial third term in office amid violent protests last year, after the people suspected he amended the constitution to emerge the country\u2019s life president.\n\nThe veteran opposition leader was first elected in 2010 in the country\u2019s first democratic transfer of power. Despite overseeing some economic progress, he has since been accused of presiding over numerous human rights abuses and harassment of his critics.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He also mentioned the restoration of the Federal Budget to a January-to-December cycle, after more than a decade.\n\nAdesina recounted other successes of the Buhari government to include, \u201cFinance Acts 2019 and 2020 \u2013 the first time ever that federal budgets are being accompanied by dedicated and specific reform legislation, to support implementation. Discrimination Against Persons With Disabilities (Prohibition) Act, 2018: another unprecedented piece of legislation in Nigeria. Treasury Single Account (TSA) started in 2012, expanded across the entire government by President Buhari.\u201d\n\nOn projects, the media adviser said Buhari was the first president to start and complete a rail project in Nigeria\u2019s history (Lagos-Ibadan Rail). He said the president had completed 12 inherited dam projects across the country. These he listed to include Kashimbila Multipurpose Dam, Taraba; Ogwashi-Uku Multipurpose Dam, Delta; Adada Dam, Enugu; Sulma Earth Dam, Katsina; Gimi Earth Dam, Kaduna; Amla-Otukpo Dam, Benue; Amauzari Earth Dam, Imo; Ibiono-Ibom Earth Dam, Akwa Ibom; Gadau/Lafia Zigau Dam, Bauchi; Alajue Small Earth Dam, Osun; Kampe Omi Dam, Kogi (Rehabilitation); and Kargo Dam, Kaduna (Rehabilitation).\n\nOther achievements listed by Adesina include, \u201cDeep Offshore and Inland Basin (Production Sharing Contracts) Act, 2019, amended for the first time since 1993. More than $6 billion of inherited cash call arrears now being cleared by the Buhari administration, since 2016.\n\n\u201cAlso, more than $3 billion of the arrears (payments due to International Oil Companies) have since been paid. The Buhari administration has overseen the first successful Marginal Fields Bid Round in almost 20 years. In addition, the Buhari administration has launched the first National Social Investment Programme in the country\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cToday it is the largest Social Investment Programme in Africa and one of the largest in the world. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was established in 2011, and for its first seven years did not have an enabling Act of the National Assembly \u2014 until 2018, when President Buhari assented to the NCDC Act.\u201d\n\nAdesina listed others to include:, \u201cThe Nigeria Police Act 2020, the first overhaul of the Police Act since it was originally enacted in 1943; Nigeria Correctional Service Act, 2019 \u2013 overhauled the existing Prisons Act, almost 50 years after it was first enacted.\n\n\u201cThe Suppression of Piracy and Other Maritime Offences Act (SPOMO), 2019 \u2013 the first of its kind in the entire Gulf of Guinea, dedicated to prosecuting maritime offences.\n\n\u201cCAMA, 2020 \u2013 the first overhaul of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) in 30 years.

The countries were part of about 56 countries, cutting across Western Europe, Oceania/Pacific, South America, North America, Middle East, Asia and Far East as well as Africa, which were favourite destinations for the commodity.\n\nThe latest Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB) produced by the national oil company showed that India led the pack of buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude for the 2020 trading year with 107.89 million barrels, followed by Netherlands with 73 million barrels, and Spain with 70.4 million barrels.\n\nAs some buyers turned their backs on Nigeria\u2019s crude because it was more expensive due to its top quality, India and other countries had upped their hydrocarbons trade with Nigeria, the data obtained by THISDAY showed.\n\nAlthough successive Nigerian governments had expressed their desire to diversify the country\u2019s economy, the oil sector still accounted for about 90 per cent of total exports, over 86 per cent of foreign exchange earnings and a paltry 9.61 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nThe data from NNPC further showed that apart from the top three consumers of Nigeria\u2019s oil, South Africa came a close fourth with 68.3 million barrels, Italy purchased 32.5 million barrels, while China bought a total 29.6 million barrels from the country during the period under review.\n\nOther countries listed as consumers of Nigeria\u2019s crude are United Kingdom with 24.3 million barrels, Cote d\u2019Ivoire with 20.4 million barrels, France with 19.7 million barrels, Singapore which bought 19.4 million barrels and United States Gulf Coast with a cumulative purchase of 19.4 million barrels.\n\nTogo bought 17.3 million barrels, Portugal purchased 14.8 million barrels, Turkey\u2019s total transaction for the year was 18.1 million barrels, followed by Indonesia\u2019s 17.1 million barrels.\n\nIncluded also on the list of buyers were Germany, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Australia, Peru, Uruguay, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and Myanmar.\n\nBrazil, a top oil producer, bought the least quantity of 266,264 barrels. Other Nigerian crude oil customers included Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, Ghana and Senegal.\n\nIn the year under consideration, 648.5 million barrels of oil were lifted with the highest percentage of 42 per cent going to Western Europe, 31.2 per cent going to Asia, 18.28 retained in Africa while 5.7 per cent went to North America.\n\nFurthermore, an analysis of Nigeria\u2019s 10-year crude oil production revealed that the country produced about 8.425 billion barrels during the period 2010-2020.\n\nA breakdown of the figures indicated that in 2010, 896 million barrels, the highest for the period, was produced, 866.2 million barrels was produced in 2011, 852.7 million barrels in 2012, 800 million barrels in 2013, 798 million barrels in 2014, and 773 million barrels in 2015.\n\nIn addition, 2016 saw the production of 666.7 million barrels, in 2017 it was 689.7 million barrels, it was 701.4 million barrels in 2018, 735.24 million barrels in 2019, while in 2020 Nigeria produced the lowest quantity of oil estimated at 644.36 million barrels.\n\nIn terms of exploration activities, a total of 81 wells were drilled, including 76 development wells and five exploratory wells. But the activity was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that ravaged the world last year.\n\nTotal crude oil and condensate production for the year was 644.3 barrels, giving a daily average of 1.76 million bpd, lower than the 2019 production by 12.36 per cent.\n\nProduction by fiscal regime showed that Joint Ventures (JVs) contributed 208 million barrels, Alternative Financing (AF) contributed 68.8 million barrels, Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) contributed 254.7 million barrels, Independents and the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) contributed 93.4 million barrels while marginal fields added 19.3 million barrels.\n\nIn the gas sector, a total of 2,729.1 Billion Cubic Feet (BCF) of natural gas was produced in 2020, indicating a decrease of 4.74 per cent when compared with 2019 production 2,864.93 BCF.\n\nThe estimated average daily consumption for 2020 was 60 million litres of petrol, 14.1 million litres of diesel and 740,316 litres of household kerosene per day.\n\nWhereas Nigeria\u2019s crude oil still remains quite competitive in the international market because of its low sulphur content, the current push for renewable sources of energy and the net-zero push by developed countries by 2050 remains a major challenge to the future of oil business in the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "AMCON: Expert Seeks National Policy on Debt Recovery",
          "text": "Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nThe federal government has been challenged to expand the laws that grants the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) special debt recovery powers in the corporation\u2019s Act as amended into a national law.\n\nThis would insulate the banking sector against reckless borrowers and recalcitrant debtors that AMCON is currently chasing for the recovery of trillions of naira.\n\nSpeaking at the weekend at the training of Solicitors, Receivers and Receiver/Managers in Lagos, Mr. Oluwakemi Balogun, SAN, of the firm of Oluwakemi LP said debt recovery in Nigeria would continue to be a burden to AMCON as well as the financial sector as long as the system allows some Nigerians to brazenly walk into banks to borrow money with no intention to repay the loan obligation.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s debt recovery agency, which has since inception in 2010 recovered over N1.4 trillion had at different phases from the year of its establishment purchased 12,743 non-performing loans (NPLs) or Eligible Bank Assets (EBAs) worth N3.8 trillion from 22 Eligible Financial Institutions (EFIs) for a purchase price of N1.8 trillion.\n\nSince then, AMCON has worked tirelessly to recover the huge debt, which were covered by various collaterals. But as the years roll by, AMCON obligors have become more daring, and hiding under all manners of legal technicalities to delay the agency from recovery.\n\nHaving watched such financial rascality for some decade, a statement quoted the SAN to have said something drastic must be done by the government to save the country.\n\nAccording to him, some Nigerians in the last 25 years have perfected the act of going to different banks to borrow money and have serially defaulted in the repayment agreement because they country has no policy that guides such recklessness.\n\nAs a mitigant to such ugly development, the legal luminary added, \u201cWe need to have a national law that will assistant lenders (banks and financial institutions). We must have a national policy. There must be a national law on debt recovery.\n\n\u201cThis law should not just be for only AMCON as a government agency but for the nation as a whole. That is one of the ways we can curb the bad behaviour. In some other economies you cannot borrow money and refuse to pay back and go scot-free. Therefore, Nigeria should not allow recalcitrant debtors to go unpunished.\u201d\n\nBalogun was reacting to the different presentations at the programme including the keynote address of the AMCON Managing Director/CEO, Mr. Ahmed Kuru, who was represented at the event by Group Head of Asset Management, Mr. Benedict Daminabo.\n\nThe AMCON CEO had earlier said the agency will continue to highlight the dangers of not recovering the debt because of its grave implication.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have repeatedly made the point at every opportunity that all stakeholders must view the AMCON mandate as one of serious national importance. If at sunset AMCON is unable to recover the huge debt of over N5trillion, it becomes the debt of the Federal Government of Nigeria for which taxpayers\u2019 monies will be used to settle.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that the public will be made to pay for the recklessness of only a few individuals who continue to take advantage of the loopholes in our laws to escape their moral and legal obligations to repay their debts.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, we have reached a point in our country where all stakeholders (the federal government, the judiciary, the legislature and the public) must work together to fight the common enemy of this huge debt burden.\u201d\n\nBut challenging as the agency\u2019s debt recovery activities have shown especially given its peculiar situation, AMCON is steadily making remarkable recoveries but still has about 7,902 outstanding obligors with total outstanding loan of N3.142 trillion.\n\nOf this number, 350 of the agency\u2019s obligors account for N2.053 trillion, which is above 65 per cent of total outstanding amount.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

People were laughing that I lost my polling unit, but it is democracy that won,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not on the ballot, so it is not a referendum on me, it is a referendum on the councilor and the performance of the chairman of the local council. The loss of my polling unit shows that we did not programme these machines; we did not influence our independent electoral commission, and the whole thing has worked very well.\n\n\u201cThe results of the election so far are a unifying moment for our state which is what we have been working on. We want to work against the narrative that the PDP is a party for a part of the state, while the APC is a party for another. Some people say PDP is a party of a religious affiliation, while the APC is that of another.\n\n\u201cThe results of the election clearly show that we are finally uniting Kaduna state and people are making choices based on the performance of elected officials.\u201d\n\nReacting to issues that marred the electoral process, the governor said though results of elections in two LGAs are still contentious because the machines did not function, he believes the exercise went \u201creasonably well\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also said though there was little that could have been done to stop thugs from snatching electoral machines, the machines can be remotely disconnected to avoid interference with results.\n\n\u201cThere are issues that came up and the electoral commission is working on them. Two LGAs are still contentious, the results have not been communicated to me. I have been told that in Kachia, one of the LGAs, the election is inconclusive, because the machines did not function in many polling units. Soba is awaited but so far I will say that the exercise has gone reasonably well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is little we can do to avoid thugs snatching electoral machines, but you should know that these machines are programmed to be disconnected remotely by the electoral commission. The machine also provides its GPS location so you can target and go and recover it.\u201d",

          "title": "With Awabah, Tunji Andrews wants to make pensions as popular as banking",
          "text": "Between November and December 2020, Tunji Andrews co-piloted a project to help informal workers save for the future. Those efforts culminated in the January rollout of Awabah, a digital platform that provides micro pension access to self-employed Nigerians and informal workers.\n\n\u201cMany people in Nigeria and Africa do day-to-day financial transactions in markets but don\u2019t have access to the benefits that the formal financial system offers,\u201d Andrews told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cSo when I wanted to get into the fintech space, it had to be something that would drive financial inclusion on a very strong basis.\u201d\n\nA flexible, \u20a6500 plan\n\nCo-founded with Tina Ajishebiyawo and Gboyega Olatunde, Awabah Nigeria automates micro-pensions and target-savings for self-employed Nigerians and workers in the informal economy. An understanding of the unique characteristics of its target market has been key to Awabah\u2019s operations and ensuring last-mile delivery.\n\nLower-income members of the informal economy can be difficult to capture and most engage in local cooperatives and market associations. Awabah has leaned heavily on town hall meetings to reach these people in large numbers, introducing its product via group presentations and one-on-one sessions.\n\nAfter onboarding them, the company uses either its web platform or a network of local banking agents to continue taking collections from, educating, and further engaging with contributors.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIncome levels vary in the informal sector. Thus, Andrews explains that contributors with as little as \u20a6500 can start a micro-pensions account. Subsequent amounts contributed are based on an individual\u2019s capacity.\n\nContributions are also flexible. Taking into account the irregular cash flow of informal workers, they can be made daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, similar to local savings groups (popularly known as Ajo or Esusu).\n\nDue to the constant need for cash flow in the informal sector, users have the option of withdrawing up to 40% of their savings at any point after the initial 3 months of contributions. Whenever someone deposits \u20a61,000, for instance, \u20a6600 is locked in the retirement account while the rest goes into the customer\u2019s mobile wallet as contingent savings.\n\n\u201cThey always come and ask for their 40% after the first three months as a way of testing the product, and we make sure that they get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cOnce they get their money back and see alerts every time they put in their \u20a6500, they\u2019re able to test the system.\u201d\n\nAwabah has achieved impressive results within months of operation, having onboarded more than 5,000 customers so far. It makes money primarily by earning a commission on every contribution made.\n\nAwabah Nigeria Co-founder, Tunji Andrews.\n\nExtending pensions to the informal economy\n\nIn Nigeria, a good number of elderly parents are financially dependent on their children \u2013 partly because societal norms deem it necessary for children to care for aging parents; and also because there is an evident lack of working systems for retirement savings.\n\nEven where pension schemes are available, they often only cover people who are formally employed. Nigeria has a large informal workforce and about 88% of the entire labour force without pensions is from the informal economy. The result? A large group of citizens becomes financially vulnerable as they get older.\n\nWorse still is that relatively young Nigerians currently dominate the labour force and the lack of retirement savings means they are susceptible to living below the poverty line in their old age.\n\nNigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PenCom) has a target of growing the country\u2019s pension coverage to 30% of the entire labour force \u2013 formal and informal \u2013 by 2024. As of the first quarter of this year, the figure stood at 12%.\n\nA provision in the Pension Reform Act of 2014 ushered in a new micro-pension plan, effectively opening the door for the informal economy to participate in the national Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Awabah\u2019s operation is backed by this provision.\n\nThe micro pension scheme was formally introduced in 2019 but is yet to gain traction. Thus, Andrews has made it his and Awabah\u2019s mission to make the services available to those in the informal sector and whose employers are not legally required to deduct and remit pension.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the new micro pension scheme two years ago, I was excited as I had been thinking about pensions. But there weren\u2019t a lot of conversations and awareness about it. So for me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said.\n\nExpanding Awabah\n\nAwabah is less than a year old and has had to deal with manpower and logistics challenges. Still, Andrews has big ambitions.\n\nGoing forward, the startup plans to leverage the penetration of mobile phones in Nigeria to reach even a wider audience, starting with the planned launch of a USSD option.\n\nThrough a shortcode, existing and potential customers will be able to learn about and sign up to Awabah, as well as get financial literacy lessons in local languages. For those who have smartphones, Awabah will engage them via WhatsApp.\n\nThe Awabah team.\n\nThe startup raised $200,000 from early-stage angel investors ODBA and Co Ventures and Correlation Capital in July, which helped it expand into Ibadan. Awabah also recently gained acceptance into the Techstars London accelerator programme, where it will get some funding.\n\nAndrews reveals that a new fundraising round is in the works, which will help fund a larger expansion. Over the next few months, the startup has plans to enter into five more Nigerian cities. It is also mulling an expansion into Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe bigger goal is to create a larger awareness of micro pensions in Africa,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe want pensions to be popular as banking and insurance are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Awabah has partnerships with three Pension Fund Administrators, including Leadway Pensure, which holds the PenCom license under which it operates; a microfinance bank via which it provides mobile wallets; as well as two agent banking networks.\n\nAndrews aims to expand the list of partner organisations and, in the long term, plans to push conversations with Nigeria\u2019s pensions regulator on the possibility of issuing micro pension licenses for small players like Awabah.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have a one-size-fits-all pension license, unlike Ghana where there\u2019s a three-tier system,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lack of micro pension licenses can be a drawback as we believe we are best positioned to drive the product. But it\u2019s still very early days.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Nigerian banks sit on an inventory of consumer data that fintech startups in the country can only dream of.\n\nWith more than 70 million active bank customers in Nigeria, banks possess valuable big data, consisting of demographic, personal, and professional information of clients as well as transaction history, consumption patterns, and movements.\n\nThere\u2019s so much that can be done with this data. For instance, lenders can segment their client base to offer personalised savings or loan offers. The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "Entrepreneurs sidestep uncertainty to redefine farming in Jos",
          "text": "In recent weeks, Jos, the Plateau State capital, has been in the news over some killings that took place, and even 950 kilometres away in Lagos, one only needs to follow events to feel the tension. This was, however, not the case when BusinessDay visited the state weeks ago, and seeing first hand, a gentrification of sorts on the farms.\n\nApart from insecurity, which is now a national concern, off-taking agricultural goods remain a big deal and especially at risk are perishables like vegetables and fruits. Just as they can fetch a premium, especially in off-season, they are also easily lost and the millions a farmer should get could easily turn into zero, and possibly debt.\n\nSome farmers are however investing more in producing these crops, not only them, but exotic fruits, some of which, as BusinessDay learnt, are being exported.\n\nJos is known for its peculiar weather in Nigeria, but actually, much of Plateau State benefits from the unique combination of climate, topography and elevated hills.\n\n\u201cThe climate in Jos is a bit comparable to a temperate climate,\u201d says Marie Ekhator, an Austrian who runs Mama-Itohan RegenSoil, who BusinessDay met while in Jos. \u201cThat is why I decided to try seeds from my own climate,\u201d she says.

They are making money from crops produced under regulated conditions and in seasons where most farmers in Nigeria would not be producing; these are especially vegetables from tomatoes, to bell pepper, which is their new cash crop.

Without expanding his land under cultivation, he is going to increase revenue by up to 20 times. Just from one crop that serves a rather niche market.\n\nRead also: Jos killings: LG chairman warns against reprisals\n\nWhile two years ago, BusinessDay reported that greenhouse farming may not yet be profitable in Nigeria based on some experiences in the South, but the revelation in Jos is a completely different reality. From improvised greenhouses made of wooden frames, to the proper galvanised steel types, the white structures dot many parts of the state, and no single farmer interviewed had anything short of good news to report. They may have had unpleasant experiences with management, but they reported profits, not loss.\n\n\u201cThe difference (in revenue) does justify the investment. Truth be told, a lot of farmers are starting to invest in farming this season,\u201d says Guyit, whose first time in farming 13 years ago was a near disaster.\n\nUsually, farmers avoid producing certain crops, especially vegetables in the rainy season, when managing the farm and crops, pests are hard to contain, unless of course, for those who own greenhouses. They are the ones who can produce and sell when there is scarcity, along with the very few who brave the odds of open field production in the rainy season.\n\n\u201cThings like broccoli, beef tomatoes, bell peppers can be produced off season and they will be very expensive. After growing them in greenhouses, the demand is usually very high from all over the country,\u201d emphasises Guyit. As he explains, in recent years, and the whole agric consciousness, more educated and middle-class people have started to go into agriculture, and they are able to afford investments like the greenhouses and irrigation systems.\n\nOne of such new entrants would be Wiebe Boer, whose LinkedIn post on going into farming in Plateau State generated some buzz.

But, more importantly, because it\u2019s the best way to create jobs and economic opportunity in rural Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe land is one of Nigeria\u2019s greatest assets and a lot more people need to invest in agriculture to unlock the value for the investor, the farmers, and the nation.\u201d\n\nA story on emerging opportunities in the Jos landscape will be incomplete without Bell peppers, dubbed by many as the new cash crop. During its season, it sells at the farms for N700 per kg, at most, N1000 per kg. But now, it sells between N1500 and N2000 per kg from the farms.

In a 300 to 400 square meters greenhouse, one could harvest an average of 200 kilograms per week and 800 kilograms every month. At N1,500 per kg comes to about N1.2 million per month from one green house, and that is one crop. Having 10 of such greenhouses on just one hectare of land could be netting N12 million monthly.\n\nWhile none of the farmers on this trip had up to 10 greenhouses, one had six greenhouses, and many easily made this much money from bell peppers and other crops on their farms, which curiously, are not large but capital intensive due to the greenhouses.\n\nThey all also hardly expressed the need to get more land, as it turned out; productivity has little to do with expanse of land covered with crops.\n\nBusinessDay also learnt of a strawberry community in Jos, where that is what the whole community does.

          "text": "In recent weeks, Jos, the Plateau State capital, has been in the news over some killings that took place, and even 950 kilometres away in Lagos, one only needs to follow events to feel the tension. This was, however, not the case when BusinessDay visited the state weeks ago, and seeing first hand, a gentrification of sorts on the farms.\n\nApart from insecurity, which is now a national concern, off-taking agricultural goods remain a big deal and especially at risk are perishables like vegetables and fruits. Just as they can fetch a premium, especially in off-season, they are also easily lost and the millions a farmer should get could easily turn into zero, and possibly debt.\n\nSome farmers are however investing more in producing these crops, not only them, but exotic fruits, some of which, as BusinessDay learnt, are being exported.\n\nJos is known for its peculiar weather in Nigeria, but actually, much of Plateau State benefits from the unique combination of climate, topography and elevated hills.\n\n\u201cThe climate in Jos is a bit comparable to a temperate climate,\u201d says Marie Ekhator, an Austrian who runs Mama-Itohan RegenSoil, who BusinessDay met while in Jos. \u201cThat is why I decided to try seeds from my own climate,\u201d she says.

          "title": "For educated Jos farmers, agric pays better than white-collar jobs",
          "text": "Picking what could be described as dirty farm work over a white-collar job is a no brainer for some educated young people, who are gradually thriving in the agribusiness space in Jos.\n\n34-year-old Heriju Gadzama, CEO, Greenhill Farms schooled in the US, where he also worked briefly before returning to Nigeria for National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), and served at the University of Jos in 2014.\n\nHe was later offered employment by the university in 2016, where he teaches business management and marketing. Farming started in 2017, a year after becoming a lecturer. When asked to compare farming and lecturing, and which returns more financially; \u201cdefinitely the farm,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLast year, ASUU was on strike from around January till this year and all that time we were not paid. There was also COVID. But because I had this farm, I was still able to survive, pay my staff on time and monthly,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: Jos killings: LG chairman warns against reprisals\n\nFor him, lecturing is a way to give back, which he loves doing by impacting his students. It also allows him to have a flexible schedule maybe Mondays and Tuesdays on the farm, then Wednesdays and Thursdays, lecturing then Fridays, tries to combine a little bit of the two and get some rest.\n\n\u201cThe farm work is an ongoing thing and the ceiling for agriculture is higher than being a lecturer. In both regards, you cannot go into these occupations just for money; you have to be passionate about it,\u201d he says.\n\nGadzama\u2019s main cash crop is Bell pepper, but he has other supplementary crops in the open field, like red cabbage which he planted close to 15,000 plants.\n\nTrying to give perspective of financial gain, assuming he sold 10,000 of those red cabbages for N200 each, that would net him N2 million from just red cabbage, which is not even the real money spinner on his farm.\n\n\u201cObviously, I had to buy seeds, fertilizer etc but that alone is more than the annual salary an assistant lecturer would make at a federal university,\u201d he says. He cultivates vegetables on a 1.8-hectare farm in Kwang, with a combination of open field and greenhouse farming with six greenhouses. He grows bell peppers in the greenhouses as well as seedless cucumber and beef tomato. In the open field, he grows red cabbage, green beans, green pepper and just vegetables in general during the dry season. During the rainy season, he grows corn and has grown potatoes and organic strawberries during the dry season.\n\nFor Dabin Nenpominyi, an Economics graduate of Covenant University, who also holds a Masters degree from the University of Jos where he concentrated on international economics, going into agriculture is an exciting venture he is committing to.\n\nHe manages a seven-hectare Fonio farm in Kwall, for a business he says focuses on \u2018climate friendly\u2019 crops, which are those that do not require fertiliser and replenish the soil in the long run. Fonio, moringa, and hibiscus, which are the focus crops are being produced with a view to do more exports.\n\nNanpan Guyit started Jasond Bloom Enterprise as a recreational company but after a near-death experience following an accident, it was transformed into an agriculture company.\n\nThe 44-year-old, who had run his family\u2019s hotel business in the past and executed IT contracts through his company, started farming in 2008. He says he was ambitious and started with 8 acres.\n\n\u201cI was just excited and ambitious and felt I would conquer the world. Only to do that and realise that Nigeria is not ready for that, especially in the vegetable sector because they are perishable,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen someone told him to slow down and take it in bits, he says he thought to himself, \u2018No, you don\u2019t know what we are doing here. We want to feed the world!\u2019, but, now says he \u201clearnt his lessons\u201d.\n\nRather than give up, he says, \u201cas a trained economist, this type of thing intrigues me; I needed to understand why. That was what pulled me in even further.\u201d\n\nWith a first degree in Economics from Ahmadu Bello University, and a Banking and Finance Post-graduate diploma from the University of Abuja, he now cultivates an estimated 2.5 hectares he says is enough business. Among other vegetables, he produces a lot of bell peppers and at the time of meeting in Jos, was planting strawberry for someone that wants to ship them out of Nigeria to other African countries.\n\nWould he have done better with paid employment? \u201cI always believe in creating new wealth and I would still do this because for one I think I have better creative expression with farming,\u201d he responds.\n\nAfter 13 years of farming, he says \u201cit has been rewarding.\u201d\n\nPaul Weng is in his 50s but has only done salaried job for six years. Three years with an NGO and another three years with a company he did not state.\n\n\u201cAs I was working in those places, I was still practising my gardening and I realised there was more money in what I was doing than collecting salary so I opted out completely,\u201d he says. He admits it has not been easy because farming is the mainstay for his family of five; paying school fees and all the bills.\n\nHe cultivates about 10 plots of lands in total, but stresses, \u201cone thing people don\u2019t understand is it\u2019s not the size of the land that matters. Somebody can produce on one hectare and someone else on half hectare, yet the half-hectare can produce more. It all boils down to the farming practices.\u201d While he produces a range of crops, mostly vegetables and berries, he farms strawberries, mulberries and gooseberries in commercial quantities.\n\nTwo years ago, he realised about N450,000 from three mulberry trees and now has 32 in nurseries to expand on that particular crop as a business.\n\nRuth Damar, a 24-year-old maker of spices, graduated from the University of Jos in 2017 with a Political Science degree, but started the business in 2015 while in school.\n\n\u201cI actually tried taking a job last year but it was a distraction to my hustle so I just left it,\u201d she says. Damar produces organic spices such as turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, chilli, curry seasonings all in powdered form, selling to those who package for retail, restaurants, and directly to individuals.\n\nDoes she get more revenue compared to formal employment? \u201cVery well!\u201d she says excitedly. \u201cI know I\u2019m not exactly where I want to be but it has potentials, and there\u2019s room for growth. If I were to work somewhere, how much will they pay me?\u201d\n\nChristiana Tongman also studied Political Science before working in a bank for four years. She quit banking and later started farming using both conventional greenhouses and, interestingly, repurposing uncompleted structures inside the family compound, to function as greenhouses. Like most greenhouse farmers, her main crop is the bell pepper, and the income helps complement the family\u2019s earnings.",

We know that this is history in the making. You are not just destined to play this critical role, it is God ordained.\n\n\u201cAnd on behalf of all my colleagues that have sent me here even after I spoke on the phone with Your Majesty, I want to reassure you that we will cooperate with this kingdom in whatever way you want us to work with your stool, right from our colleague in Delta state. Just call on us, we will support you and do whatever is necessary for this country to progress and this kingdom is respected among the committees of kingdoms in the country.\n\n\u201cIn Ekiti, royalty is very important.

And I pray that this time will be good times, God has earmarked this kingdom for great good that will spread across the country. And your time shall be remembered for the positive in many ways.\n\nResponding, His Majesty, Ogiame, Atuwatse III, expressed appreciation to the governor for his goodwill and pray for peace in Iwere land and Nigeria at large.\n\n\u201cWhen we wrote our speech for coronation we focused on Itsekiri.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA \u2013 The Securities and Exchange Commission has unveiled plans to reduce its operating costs in order to boost profitability within the next two years.\n\nThe Director-General, SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda who said this in Abuja, also said that the Commission has been paying 25 per cent of gross revenues to the coffers of government.\n\nSpecifically, he said that the total revenue so far paid by SEC into the treasury as of the end of June, 2021 was about N1.5bn.\n\nWhile admitting that the Commission has been operating under very difficult circumstances since it is currently superintending over a market that was affected by the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, assured that steps are being taken to reverse the fortunes of the apex regulator of the capital market.\n\nHe said that, \u201cIf we go through the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework which we started last year, a look at the 2022 and 2023, you will see that we have worked on our expenditure so that by 2023, the deficit will actually turn into a surplus of N1.235bn and by 2024 we should have N2.5bn surplus.\n\n\u201cWe therefore need the support of all to engineer the kind of transition we are thinking of at the SEC and that 30 per cent which is taking most of the staff cost is part of the set we are targeting for the early retirement programme.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of interest within the Commission to do it but we are really short of the funds to do it now. We have done a lot of revenue rising drives just to ensure that the Commission stays on track.\n\n\u201cThis is something we are mindful of and we have the intent and capacity to deliver on this.\n\nOn the high overhead costs, the SEC DG explained that this is being reduced aggressively.\n\nYuguda said. \u201cIt has reduced because we have since we came, aggressively looked at the overhead and staff cost and reduced certain components of our staff pay that has generated over N2bn of savings as at now.\n\n\u201cIf you take the MTEF numbers, as you go forward, you find that by 2024 staff cost reduces to only N5.88bn. So that is the trajectory that we are working on.\u201d\n\nTo shore up the resources of SEC, he said the Commission has approached a number of institutions like the African Development Bank, Financial Sector Development Africa and a number of other donors.\n\nThis, he said, is expected to fetch a grant figure of N3.84bn, adding that more grant is being expected in the near term to boost operations.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe truth of the matter is that not only for the sake of cutting down on the cost of the SEC, when we came last year, we discovered there has been no IT investment in the SEC for over a decade.\n\n\u201cSo, our IT infrastructure is now obsolete so we have to renew that. And given this difficulty, we could only do that by going out and looking for grant and thankfully we have gotten very positive feedback. But this grant is only going to address investment in IT infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe are working hard to ensure we deliver, from 2023 the tide will begin to change and that is because of the massive efforts that we have made both on the revenue front and on the cost front.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "ANALYSIS: Zambia\u2019s new president takes aim at security sector",
          "text": "President Hakainde Hichilema has wasted no time in asserting his authority. The cabinet appointments announced by Zambia\u2019s new head of state took second place to his bold move to \u2018retire\u2019 security chiefs across all sectors, from the army through to correctional services.\n\nHis swift actions are a positive indication that the new era in Zambia puts respect for the Constitution and rule of law above loyalty to the ruling party and president.\n\nThis is a marked departure from the impunity that securocrats in Southern Africa and indeed the continent have become accustomed to. Security sector reform has remained elusive for most countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) \u2013 something Hichilema seems intent on changing.\n\nTrue to the businessman he is, he wasted no time in aligning the security forces. The president charged the former security heads of willfully negating the spirit and letter of Zambia\u2019s Constitution and being brazenly partisan and unprofessional in their conduct.\n\nThese accusations were strengthened by his first-hand experience of the many arbitrary arrests and detentions of political activists. Under former president Edgar Lungu, the Zambian police and military became complicit in Lungu\u2019s autocratic tendencies. Soldiers and officials were accused of various abuses, ranging from arbitrary detentions of those who spoke out against the government to killing protesters.\n\nMr Hichilema\u2019s move is a necessary first step in developing professional security forces and engendering citizens\u2019 confidence in the integrity of these institutions. It can also help mend damaged relations between the public and the security forces, and show that the security sector should serve the nation \u2013 not the ruling party.\n\nIn a clear recognition of professionalism and integrity, Mr Hichilema promoted one of his jailers to Deputy Commissioner General of Correctional Services. This is likely to have a ripple effect across other sectors of government.\n\nThe new president\u2019s critics are, however, urging caution. They point out that he has a long way to go in balancing competing interests within his winning alliance and securing the confidence of the entire state apparatus.\n\nMr Hichilema\u2019s actions could also, if not communicated well, fuel street-level retribution against those who abused power during the reign of Lungu\u2019s Patriotic Front\u2019s (PF). Already a video is circulating on social media of civilians apprehending and taunting a man accused of abuses during the PF\u2019s crackdown against the opposition.\n\nWhile retiring the securocrats was necessary, some might perceive it as too drastic and too hasty. SADC governments have long grappled with the difficulty of successfully reforming their security sectors. Mr Hichilema\u2019s decision to tackle the problem head-on has undoubtedly been unsettling for some politicians in the region.\n\nALSO READ: Zambian opposition candidate Hakainde Hichilema wins presidential election after sixth trial\n\nThis sentiment is likely stronger in countries where police and soldiers have been willing accomplices in the abuse and torment of opposition parties and human rights activists. In countries like eSwatini, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique and Tanzania, ruling elites might find Mr Hichilema\u2019s measures unpalatable.\n\nIn most SADC countries, the military and ruling party are joined at the hip, enabling the army to act as guarantor of the regime. Despite numerous efforts by the regional bloc, it has not pronounced itself definitively on the matter, leaving citizens unsupported as they wrestle with partisan security forces. Recently, soldiers and police in eSwatini brutally repressed protests that erupted against the monarch.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the military and police have a long history of impunity and partisan behaviour in defence of the ruling party. To date, the soldiers involved in the killing of unarmed civilians in the post-election violence of 2018 and subsequent clampdowns on protests have not faced justice. The script reads the same in Tanzania and Angola. Mr Hichilema is likely to touch a nerve in these countries, which may see ruling elites digging in their heels even deeper.\n\nSADC should perhaps take lessons from Mr Hichilema and create inclusive platforms that civil society and opposition parties can participate in. Rather than tinkering on the margins as it has been doing for years without concrete action, the regional bloc could take inspiration from Mr Hichilema\u2019s courage on security sector reform.\n\nIt is not surprising that Zambia\u2019s president is being greeted as a breath of fresh air by many in the region. Southern Africans living under autocratic and repressive regimes are looking up to him as a role model. Mr Hichilema is undoubtedly defining his own governance style. His actions in the first two weeks of his administration show that he walks the talk and is not afraid to make bold moves.\n\nIn a region desperate for better governance and stronger democracies, questions are already turning to whether he can galvanise a coalition of likeminded leaders and inspire reform in other Southern African countries.\n\nRingisai Chikohomero, Researcher, Institute for Security Studies (ISS), Pretoria\n\n(This article was first published by ISS Today, a Premium Times syndication partner.

The CBN interventions are borne out of the critical issues within our economic space.\n\n\u201cWe are here to discuss about CBN policies and intervention programmes with some significant stakeholders in this country. Our mission is to speak to workers\u2019 leaders on what we are doing in Central Bank and they will be able to take the message back to their people with the language they will understand so that they will be at pace with what we are doing in CBN.\n\n\u201cWe know the issues of insurgency, insecurity, exchange pass through, issues of price adjustment in terms of power or fuel and others. All of these parked together is what we are seeing as inflation today. That is also why CBN is doing massive intervention especially in agriculture.\u201d\n\nIssah Aremu, Director General of the Michael Imodu National Institute of Labour Studies, complimented the CBN for implementing a national planning policy.\n\nHe also praised the CBN for fostering financial literacy among workers, which he believes will help people understand what is going on in the economy, the rate of inflation, and the differences between policies, their jobs, and productivity",

          "title": "Opinion: Dogs Eat Tigers In Nigeria \u2013 By SUYI AYODELE \u2013 Daylight",
          "text": "They once told a king about the existence of a rampaging tiger in his kingdom. He did nothing about it. Each time the carnivorous element devoured any of his subjects, the king would simply mourn, \u201coh, the trouble has gone.\u201d One after the other, his subjects became depleted and those remaining started taking extra care.\n\nThen one day, the tiger visited the palace and made a meal of the heir apparent to the throne. The king, in utter bewilderment, exclaimed \u201cnow, trouble has come\u201d. He subsequently mobilised the marksmen among his hunters to hunt down the tiger. But alas, the tiger had killed all the hunters, before it came for the prince. This was when the king knew that neither him nor his household was safe.\n\nThis is exactly what is happening to us in Nigeria. The avatar, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, as far back as 1976 (45 years ago), warned about the current security situation in Nigeria. Some leaders are too futuristic to be ignored. The sage, Awolowo, was one of them. In the speech he delivered on March 6, 1976, to mark his 67th birthday anniversary, Awo, as he was fondly called by friends and foes alike, looked back at the February 13, 1976 assassination of the then Military Head of State, General Murtala Ramat Mohammed, on the streets of Lagos, and predicted that unless Nigerians rose to the occasion and took their destinies in their hands, they would live, in the future, in a society, where the lifestyle of the jungle would be of envy to mankind.\n\nHe titled his speech at that occasion: \u201cA community in which a dog kills a tiger is unsafe to live in.\u201d That, no doubt, was too apocalyptic; a prediction of an Armageddon of a place. In that piece, he referred to Murtala\u2019s killer, Col. Buka Suka Dimka, as the dog, and the late Head of State as the tiger. Awolowo wrote: \u201cLast February \u2013 on 13 February to be precise \u2013 a dog did kill a tiger along a traffic-congested street with many people around, and got away with it. If that happened to a tiger, what can we say of the sheep and the lambs?\u201d Trust the inimitable Awo never to leave an issue hanging.\n\nHe pointed out where the real problem was then and still is, even now. Again, Awo spoke: \u201cThe fault is not in Nigeria as a physical entity that the structure of our society is like a pyramid with an extremely disproportionate base; it is we, her sons and daughters that have failed to rise, from time to time, to occasions dictated by Nigeria\u201d. Those are timeless words. And they are made manifest even in our very present situation. The anomic society Awolowo predicted some 45 years ago is exactly where we live right now as Nigerians. From the coldest city of Pankshin in Plateau State to the forest of Sambisa in Borno, from the garden city of Port Harcourt, to the aquatic splendor of Lagos, and from the Rainforest of Igangan, Ibarapa, Oyo State, to the savannah of Adamawa, merchants of death follow us everywhere we go and kill us with reckless impunity.\n\nWe remain as helpless and hapless as any conquered people can be. And our leaders remain aloof, unmoved and unbothered by our collective calamities. Even in the animal world, where the tiger lives and where other four-legged creatures hold courts, there is more orderliness, more sanity and more respect for the sanctity of life than we have in present day Nigeria.\n\nIn the last one month, Nigeria has become a complete oxymoron. Our situation is a total paradox. We live in sharp contradiction of what is obtainable in every other sane society. We have become the very absurdity that the literary term, oxymoron, defines. If not so, Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State would not have asked that Kaduna indigenes in the University of Jos be evacuated because of insecurity, to Kaduna, where school children are kidnapped randomly and kept in the forests for months. Kaduna is itself so bereft of tranquil so much that the governor, months ago, withdrew his own children from the public school.\n\nWhat is absolutely unthinkable in other climes has become commonplace in our country. We mourn our dead on a daily basis while our leaders remain unfazed by our situation. This is so, because our situation as the country\u2019s hoi-polloi is not the situation of our lords of the manor, who preside over our affairs. Our leaders, top to bottom, without exception, have become like the Benin proverbial three wise monkeys, \u201cwho see no evil, hear no evil and talk no evil\u201d. We have the very A-heroic as leaders; little wonder we move from bad to worse and worse to the very worst of unthinkability! The security of lives and property, which is one of the fundamental principles of the Nigerian nationhood, has become the exclusive preserve of only our leaders, their immediate families and their proxies who are holed up in the villa. The rest of us, flotsam and jetsam that we are, can perish in our thousands for all they care.\n\nBut thankfully enough, the chickens are coming home to roost. The anomic year of damnation, predicted almost five decades ago, is happening now. On Tuesday, August 25, 2021, \u201cbandits\u201d, or \u201cterrorists\u201d or \u201cunknown gunmen\u201d, visited the heart of our defence and defence structure. That was the day armed men stormed our Nigeria Defence Academy, (NDA), killed two middle-level officers and abducted one. Then, like the ghoul that they are, the killers walked away leisurely. While I can understand, though with acute disquietude, Boko Haram insurgents shooting down our military alpha jets at will, the way they did unchallenged on July 19, 2021, I consider the invasion of the NDA as the biggest military systemic orogeny of the century.\n\nAnd if you consider this to be another \u201cwailing wailer\u2019s\u2019\u201d alarm, just, search for the elementary meanings of \u201cAcademy\u201d and \u201cDefence\u201d and you will know how badly the terrorists, operating openly in our midst, have pushed us to a situation, chess players called, zugzwang, such that anywhere we go and any move we make, will be at a colossal damage to our psyche as a people. Now, it is obvious that nowhere is safe and nobody is safe, including those who lord it over us and who think that the retinue of security personalities attached to them is enough fortress. The Holy book says when the shepherd is struck, the herd will scatter.\n\nThis is what Awolowo saw in 1976, when he interrogated thus: \u201cIf that happened to a tiger, what can we say of the sheep and the lambs?\u201d My people have a saying that any wind which blows off the goods of an \u201cogi\u201d (corn starch) seller, must have rendered useless, the wares of the yam flour seller. If our own NDA could be attacked and decimated in such a brazen manner, little wonder our school children are picked up like snails from their dormitories. And like in other cases before it and the ones yet to come, eight full days after that ugly incident, no single suspect has been arrested.\n\nYet, NDA is supposed to be \u201ca place of study or training in a special field\u201d; and this time around, where the \u201cmethods of defence against attacks\u201d are taught and learnt. That is the same place, some nondescript gunmen rendered defenceless. But the problem, as pointed out earlier, is not about the size of the country, but about her leaders and her people. We have left so many things to fester and they are already in bad shape. Unfortunately, especially for this epoch, we have on the top of the leadership pyramid, a man who derives pleasure in breaking all the bad records he himself set.\n\nThe present leadership, with its level of intolerance, predilection for primordial interests and huge sense of commitment to negative personal convictions, has succeeded in putting the country on the reverse gear at a very dangerous bend of the road. And in all honesty, while the number one man in the entire shenanigans that threw up this present leadership takes the lion\u2019s share of the blame, those who dressed him up in borrowed and unfitting robes and who still want us to appreciate the aesthetics of the flaccid garment, are equally guilty of the tohubohu the nation has been thrown into.\n\nWe are on course if we ask history to record them all on the black page. That is their space in the reckoning of posterity. But for a government that is deliberately deaf, the cacophony of \u201cwailings\u201d Nigerians have engaged in, in the last six years, is enough to make the deaf to hear. But our elders say \u201cyou only wake up someone who is sleeping and not the one who is pretending to be asleep\u201d. Our consolation lies in the fact that in the calamities to come, nobody shall be spared. It is already happening. We read in the news nowadays how government officials, aides of the \u201cogas at the top\u201d, their relations and acquaintances are being sent to their early graves by the same killers the government is pampering.\n\nWe have lost more officers and men of our Armed Forces to bandits and other felons than we lost to any conventional war. Generals, from any arm of the military, are being killed on the highways, on their farms, homes and even on the streets. Most politicians now stay in the state capitals, yielding their constituencies to the \u201cunknown gunmen\u2019\u2019 of this season. What goes around comes around. It is no longer the case of the commoners being killed; we are all dying by installments.\n\nWhen Alexander the Great, who ruled over the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia penned: \u201cI am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep, I am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion\u201d, he surely had Nigeria in mind. Nigeria has the potential to be a great nation but her problem is the present cataleptic leadership which has held her bound to violence to the chagrin of the majority of her citizenry as well as the international community, who must wonder why we seem so cursed.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "title": "NEF to Masari, El-Rufai, Matawalle, Sani Bello: Your security measures lockdown on the North",
          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has lamented the deteriorating security situation in the northern part of the country.\n\nIt, however, disagreed with steps taken by some governors to curtail the menace.\n\nThe steps include suspension of weekly markets, restrictions on sale of petrol, closure of schools and roads, and imposition of curfews among others.\n\nAs part of efforts at tackling banditry and related criminals in the North, some northern state governors, including Mohammed Bello Matawalle of Zamfara, Katsina state Governor Aminu Bello Masari, Kaduna state Governor Nasir el-Rufai and their Niger state counterpart, Abubakar Sani Bello announced certain measures.\n\nThey include the ban on inter-state cattle business and specific types of petroleum sale and restriction in the operation of commercial motorcycle and tricycle (Keke NAPEP) operators.\n\nNEF differs\n\nExpressing dissatisfaction with the governors\u2019 decisions in a statement issued Sunday in Abuja; the Forum said the decisions were akin to complete lockdown of the region\u2019s economy and could only further embolden the criminals and leave the already traumatised people at their mercy.\n\nThe statement was signed by NEF\u2019s Director Publicity and Advocacy Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed.\n\nNEF said: \u201cNorthern Elders Forum is closely following the condition of many Northern communities that have become particularly vulnerable to attacks and abuse by bandits, kidnappers and related organized criminals.\n\n\u201cMeasures being taken by some state governments such as suspension of weekly markets, restrictions on sale of petrol, closure of schools and some roads, curfews, movement of cattle and plans to restrict communication will compound the desperate conditions of living of many communities in the North.\n\n\u201cWhile it will be unhelpful to criticize these measures without adequate knowledge of their potentials to relieve the desperation under which people live, it is important nevertheless to demand that those who have powers to impose them also have clear ideas over what they could achieve and when.\n\n\u201cThese measures represent virtual economic and social lockdowns on people who had been at the mercy of criminals for a long time. Unless they are accompanied by an aggressive and effective assault on the banditry and kidnapping industry, they will merely add to the misery and hopelessness of our communities.\n\n\u201cWorse, they could further embolden the bandit and the kidnappers when it becomes clear that governments and security agencies cannot go beyond lockdowns on communities.\n\n\u201cCommunities themselves will lose even more faith in the capacity of the Nigerian State to respond to their desperate circumstances. The perception that communities are on their own must never be allowed to take deeper roots, but it will, when people see only the bandit and the kidnapper winning.\n\n\u201cThe Forum calls on the federal government to assist states to relieve communities that are now living under additional pressures. State governments imposing additional hardships on communities must know that the measures they are introducing must produce tangible results within a period that makes them meaningful and tolerable.\u201d\n\nNiger monarch abducted\n\nAnd amidst all this, gunmen reportedly abducted the Dodo of Wawa, a traditional ruler in Wawa, Borgu local government area of Niger state, Dr Mahmud Ahmed Aliyu from his palace.\n\nThe palace is some 12 kilometres away from New Bussa where the Nigerian Army barracks is located.\n\nThe traditional ruler was reportedly kidnapped at about 9.30pm Saturday night.\n\nHe was said to have been whisked away into the Kainji National Park amidst spontaneous shooting by the hoodlums dressed in military uniform.\n\nIt was learnt that the gunmen stormed the palace on motorcycles while shooting to scare away the people.\n\nConfirming the incident, the state Police command said the police were already on the bandits\u2019 trail to rescue the district head.\n\nThe command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Wasiu Abiodun, who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna, said: \u201cThe police tactical team and members of the vigilante of the area have been deployed for the manhunt of the hoodlums, with a view to rescue the victim and arrest the culprits.\u201d\n\nHe called on residents to support security agencies with intelligence information to aid in the fight against banditry and kidnapping in the state.\n\nAlso, Secretary to the Niger state Government (SSG) Ahmed Ibrahim Matane told journalists in Minna that the government was doing everything possible to rescue the monarch.\n\nHe said \u201ccombined security agencies and members of vigilante group have been drafted to rescue the Dodo of Wawa unharmed.\u201d\n\nThe abduction has thrown the entire palace into confusion and uncertainty considering the frequency at which bandits now operate in the area bordering Benin Republic.\n\nLawmaker\u2019s wife, kids abducted\n\nAlso, a group of bandits attacked the home of the lawmaker representing Bakori State Constituency in Katsina state House of Assembly, Ibrahim Aminu Kurami, abducting his wife and two children.\n\nThe incident occurred between 8.00 and 9.00pm Saturday night as the bandits reportedly blocked the Funtua-Katsina Road for minutes while the abduction lasted.\n\nDuring the abduction, the bandits reportedly injured one person at the gate of the lawmaker\u2019s house.\n\nIbrahim Kurumi, the lawmaker himself was not at home as he went to Katsina after participating in the Saturday\u2019s APC council Congress in the area.\n\nIt was gathered that the local vigilante group and some residents were in pursuit of the abductors to get the victims released.\n\nJigawa title holder\n\nSimilarly, suspected gunmen Sunday kidnapped a traditional title holder, Alhaji Kabiru Ahmad and set a police vehicle ablaze in Taura local government area of Jigawa state.\n\nAccording to reports, the victim was kidnapped yesterday around 3:00am\n\nThe incident, it was gathered, occurred at about 3.00am of the fateful day when the armed hoodlums numbering about 50 on motorcycles and vehicles, entered Taura town and invaded the victim\u2019s residence.\n\nSpokesman of the state\u2019s Police command, ASP Lawan Shiisu Adam who confirmed the incident, said \u201cat about 3:00 am Police received report that a gang of armed hoodlums invaded the residence of one Alh Kabiru Ahmad and kidnapped him.\u201d\n\nHe said a team of police patrol team rushed to the scene and the hoodlums took to their heels.\n\nAdam said the police patrol team, however, pursued the criminals who in turn ambushed and opened fire on the team.\n\nThe Police spokesperson assured that efforts were on to rescue the victim and possibly apprehend the criminal elements.\n\nAdamawa shuts schools\n\nIn a related development, Adamawa state Governor Ahmadu Fintiri has directed the closure of 30 boarding schools across the state.\n\nThe governor\u2019s directive was contained in a statement by the state\u2019s Commissioner for Education and Human Capital Development, Wilbina Jackson.\n\nThis followed heightened security concerns in the state, particularly around the schools.\n\nThe order, which takes effect from September 6, 2021, the governor said, affects 30 of the 34 boarding junior secondary schools in the state.\n\n\u201c30 boarding junior secondary schools out of the 34 schools in the state have been de-boarded with effect from September 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cFrom now henceforth, all the 30 government junior secondary schools are now day schools.\n\n\u201cThe remaining four that are not affected are Government Girls Junior Secondary School, Yola, General Murtala Mohammed College, Yola, Special School, Jada and Special School, Mubi.\n\n\u201cThis becomes necessary due to the present incessant security challenges faced by the country and owing to students\u2019 tender age,\u201d the statement said.\n\nHe directed that affected students would be distributed to the nearest public junior secondary schools.",

          "text": "Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has said it will withdraw\n\n2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination , UTME, results of one master Chinedu Ifesinachi John who altered his score.\n\nThe 19 year old candidate who claimed that JAMB has been altering his results since 2019 was also handed over to Nigeria Police for investigation.\n\nJohn had claimed he scored 380 in the examination conducted in June this year and was surprised to receive 265 from the board after the results were released.\n\nAfter several enquiries, 265 kept appearing as his score against the 380 scores.\n\nFollowing the alleged \u201calteration\u201d of the UTME score, his father, John Ifenkpam approached an Enugu \u2013 based lawyer, Ikeazor Akaiwe who wrote to JAMB for another opportunity for the boy to retake the examination and demanded N1 billion as damages.\n\nThe lawyer said the N1 billion was to cover for the physical and emotional trauma the boy had being through from being offered \u201ctwo separate scores.\n\nMaster John claimed that his UTME scores from 2019 till 2021 had been \u201caltered\u201d by the board, thereby denying him the opportunity to study his desired course \u2013 medicine.\n\nOn Friday, the candidate, his father and lawyers traveled down to Abuja from Enugu state following an invitation from the management of the board led by the Registrar of JAMB, Prof Is \u2013 haq Oloyede.\n\nInitially, the boy was given few minutes to \u201ccome clean\u201d in a closed session with his father and lawyers about the results he was parading but insisted that his original score from the examination was 380.\n\nAfter going back and forth, the board tendered evidence to counter the claim by John and his legal representatives. At the Friday meeting, documentary evidence tendered by the board showed that John actually scored 265, not the 380 he had claimed.\n\nOloyede accused the candidate of result tempering, adding that he will be handed over to the police for investigation and subsequently prosecuted.\n\nThe registrar said John was among 11 eleven other candidates who allegedly forged their results that the board would prosecute.\n\nHe said the original result issued to john would be withdrawn pending the end of the investigation.\n\nThe registrar said: \u201cWe have 11 of them who tampered with their results. Two of them are already being prosecuted. The remaining ones we are going to withdraw their results and prosecute them. The main purpose is to sanitise the system, including our own staff.\n\n\u201cThere was never any communication of 380 with this boy. Because this boy has accused JAMB, we are going to withhold his result until the investigation is concluded. We are going to request that our interactions with him be subjected to the public.\u201d\n\nHis lawyer, Ikeazor, appealed to the board to instead give room for further infestation.\n\nHe said: I will not stand against the investigation. Let there be an investigation but what I will not agree to is to prejudge him.\n\nEarlier, John had said: The result I have been receiving is not the result I am entitled to. I wrote the first jamb in 2019. The first time they sent 328 later I saw 278 score when I checked it. I printed it. I couldn\u2019t meet up for admission that year. I wanted to study medicine and surgery at the University of Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 the same thing happened. I scored 343 by the time I went to the portal to print I saw 306. I used the 306 and it gave me admission in UI. But because I didn\u2019t have further mathematics I had to forfeit it.\n\n\u201cI decided to leave medicine and surgery for them in 2021, so I picked petroleum engineering. In 2021, JAMB issued me two results. I saw 380 the first time I checked, then the second I saw 265.\u201d\n\nHowever, the candidate later confessed after the Board discovered that he saved his sister\u2019s number on his phone as 55019 and used the phone to send the fake result to his phone.\n\nWhen he send such results they come as 55019.\n\nHe pleaded for mercy that he had to do that when the result he got was not up to what could give him his desired programmme.\n\nNigPilot, Daily Nigerian Newspaper, Nigerian News Update, Nigerian News Headlines, Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Online,",

We will withdraw the case in court,\u201d Ngige said.\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018We Are Starving Here,\u2019 Nigerians In UAE Lament Work Permit Restrictions\n\n\u201cSo, this is where we are with them and we are saying that even if anybody cares to put it in any agreement, that clause will be void ab initio because it\u2019s against the law of the land and we will not, as a government, succumb to undue arm twisting and then go and sign that.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Minister explained that some workers had lost their pay during previous strikes (under the \u201cno work, no pay\u201d rule) and the same punishment will be meted out to the striking doctors if they refuse to resume.\n\n\u201cOther workers have lost their pay during strikes; the Joint Health Systems Union (JOHESU), they lost their pay in 2018 when they went on four months strike; they lost about two or three months\u2019 pay when the no-work, no-pay rule was invoked,\u201d the minister said, adding that the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) suffered the same fate last year.\n\n\u201cNobody paid them (ASUU) anything for six months and it was during COVID-19. So, we can handle things administratively, but nobody should arm-twist,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister also revealed that a list of 8,000 doctors to benefit from the Medical Residency Training Fund is being considered by the government.\n\nFG Vs NARD: Lingering Tussle\n\nThe lingering tussle between the Nigerian government and NARD has been on since July 31 when the doctors went on strike to press home their demands.\n\nDespite a series of meetings between the Federal Government and the striking doctors, no resolution has been reached.\n\nWhile the Federal Government insists that the demands of the doctors have been met, the doctors insist otherwise.\n\nSome of the issues raised by the medical practitioners include the immediate payment of all salaries owed to all house officers, including March salaries (regardless of quota system) before the end of business on March 31.\n\nThey are also asking for an upward review of the hazard allowance to 50 per cent of consolidated basic salaries of all health workers and payment of the outstanding COVID-19 inducement allowance, especially in state-owned-tertiary institutions.\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, had in the wake of the disagreements threatened to invoke the \u201cno-work, no pay\u201d rule on NARD.\n\nBut the NMA has thrown its weight behind the striking doctors and other health workers.",

          "text": "It\u2019s been a tough period for many Nigerians living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), especially those in Dubai, as they lament the loss of jobs and difficulty in obtaining a work permit.\n\nBisi Kazeem, one of the affected Nigerians, believes authorities in the Middle East country are punishing them for the sins of a few.\n\n\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I can only say maybe it is one out of 10, or 10 out of 100 Nigerians that are doing the bad things,\u201d he told Channels Television. \u201cEvery other person is facing his/her job.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cIt has not been easy at all. I have been feeding from hand to mouth. Even as I speak, in the next two to three days, the rent here will expire. I don\u2019t even know how I am going to pay the owner.\u201d\n\nReports of a ban on work permits for Nigerians living in the UAE first surfaced over two months ago.\n\nSince then, hundreds of legitimate workers have lost their jobs, or have been unable to secure new employment. The effect, for most, has been devastating.\n\n\u201cWe are starving here,\u201d Azeez Akogun, a technician, said. \u201cWe are facing a lot of stress. A lot of people are being frustrated; I am being frustrated. Every day, being at home without any income; so, it\u2019s kind of crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never had any issue with my company,\u201d said Olabanji Folorunsho who is still in shock after he was relieved of his security job. \u201cNot a single warning letter from my company.\u201d\n\nAn Attack On Migrants?\n\nOfficials at the Nigerian Embassy in the UAE say they are doing everything in their power to resolve the issue, but the question the victims are asking is for how long?\n\n\u201cI am begging them (UAE authorities) to lift the ban so I can continue my job,\u201d a disturbed Kazeem pleaded. \u201cThey should just pity we the innocent ones so that in the nearest future, one will not become a destitute or a nuisance in the land of UAE.\u201d\n\nCrime rate is said to have been rising among foreigners in the UAE. Earlier this year, videos surfaced online, showing the aftermath of a violent cultist-related altercation linked to Nigerians \u2013 an incident many believe has now led to work restrictions.\n\nSimilarly, in February, it was reported online that an Indian was robbed of Rs 55,30,806 by four Nigerian women in Dubai. The 33-year-old man was reportedly lured into a fake massage parlour through a dating app.\n\nFollowing an investigation, Dubai Police say three women were arrested in Sharjah \u2013 a city also in the UAE \u2013 in connection with the crime.\n\nAmid concerns raised by law-abiding Nigerians and nationals of other African nations said to have also been affected, the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor and ImpACT International released a joint report on Thursday.\n\nThe document, titled \u201cThey told us that they hated black Africans,\u201d contains alleged widespread state-sponsored violations of human rights on African migrant workers in the UAE.\n\nAccording to the international bodies, the report was compiled based on about 100 interviews with migrant workers from Nigeria, Cameroon, and Uganda, and over 20 of those who spoke confirmed a massive campaign of arrests against African workers in the UAE.\n\n\u2018They Were Just Laughing At Us\u2019\n\nThe workers said the attacks, carried out on June 24 and 25 allegedly by authorities, were planned, targeted, and racially motivated.\n\nAt least 800 workers were reportedly taken over the course of two nights, with an unknown number still under detention. Many were said to have been deported despite having valid residence visas and/or work permits.\n\n\u201cI was kidnapped on 25 June at 2am on my bed sleeping,\u201d Melachio Carlos, a Cameroonian who worked as a waiter, was quoted as saying in the 54-page report. \u201cThey took me and asked about my ID, passport, valid residency permit, and phone.\n\n\u201cThey stole everything in my room. They beat me and took me half-naked, only with my sleeping clothes, to Al Wathba prison in Abu Dhabi. We arrived there and they put us in prison. They also took our wives, some of them were pregnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey took us to the prison, and when we got there, they did not give sanitary pads for the women who were doing their menstrual cycle,\u201d a Ugandan nanny, Catherine Kuheisa, said. \u201cBlood was running down their legs and when we went to ask for pads, they were just laughing at us.\u201d\n\nThe UAE Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) is responsible for issuing work permits to foreigners willing to work in the country.\n\nAccording to the law of the country \u2013 Article 1 of Ministerial Decree No. 766 of 2015, a worker whose employment is terminated due to contract expiration can get a new work permit whenever he/she wishes to join new employment.\n\nThe law also allows an employee to get a new work permit for all limited and non-limited contracts if it is determined that the employer has failed to meet the legal and contractual obligations, among other conditions.\n\nIn his reaction, the UAE Ambassador in Nigeria, Dr Fahad Obaid Al Taffaq, stated that the said ban is not official and not from UAE authorities.\n\n\u201cFrom what I believe as an official position from the UAE, the UAE is a very welcoming country. We have no discrimination against any nationality,\u201d Taffaq said in a conversation with the Chairman of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa.",

For several hours, the situation was unclear, as the government said an attack on the presidential palace had been \u201crepulsed\u201d.\n\nThere has been no official account of any casualties and there was no report of any major incident during the night.\n\nThe end of Conde\u2019s regime triggered jubilation in some parts of Conakry, especially in pro-opposition districts.\n\nThe junta on Sunday said that land and air borders had been closed, but on Monday said that air frontiers had been reopened.\n\nConakry, usually a bustling city, awoke in calm on Monday. Many shops were closed, and the main market of Medina was exceptionally quiet.\n\nInternational condemnation\n\nOutside Guinea, international leaders condemned the latest bout of turmoil in West Africa, a region where many countries are struggling with poverty, inequality and jihadist bloodshed.\n\n\u201cViolence and any extra-constitutional measures will only erode Guinea\u2019s prospects for peace, stability, and prosperity,\u201d US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said, urging all parties to abide by the rule of law.\n\nThe African Union and the United Nations both called for Conde\u2019s release.\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), through its acting president, Ghana\u2019s leader Nana Akufo-Addo, threatened sanctions if Guinea\u2019s constitutional order was not restored.\n\nThe EU and France, the former colonial power, have both condemned the coup \u2014 the latest in a region that has seen recent military takeovers in Mali and Chad.\n\n-AFP",

Defence bulwark Olaoluwa Aina also left.\n\nTuesday\u2019s encounter, scheduled for the 5,000 \u2013capactiy Est\u00e1dio Municipal Ad\u00e9rito Sena, affords a number of ambitious fresh legs not deployed in Friday\u2019s 2-0 win over Liberia in Lagos to stake claims for permanent shirts in the Nigeria squad.\n\nThe absence of Olaoluwa Aina, William Ekong and Leon Balogun probably means that Italy \u2013based Tyronne Ebuehi, Chidozie Awaziem of FC Boavista in Portugal and Spain \u2013based Kenneth Omeruo will start against the Blue Sharks on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe departures of two \u2013goal hero Kelechi Iheanacho and Alex Iwobi also open the door for perhaps Terem Moffi and Henry Onyekuru.

Coach Rohr may opt to deploy the versatile Abdullahi Shehu to the midfield as he has done a couple of times, most recently in Sierra Leone against the Leone Stars in a 2021 AFCON qualifier. Russia \u2013based Chidera Ejuke, Italy \u2013based former junior international Kingsley Michael and new face Innocent Bonke from Sweden are all available.\n\nCaptain Ahmed Musa will earn his 100th cap for Nigeria, two days on 11 years after he won his first against Madagascar in Calabar, if he takes any part in Tuesday\u2019s encounter.\n\nThree points will consolidate Nigeria\u2019s leadership of Group C, confirmed after the victory over Liberia that followed the draw between Cape Verde and Central African Republic in Douala. A win will guarantee Nigeria a minimum three points ahead of any other team in the pool, even if Liberia\u2019s Lone Star are victorious against Central African Republic in Monrovia.\n\nA win will also brighten the path of the three \u2013time African champions to the knockout final round, given that home-and-away fixture against the Central African Republic is what is on the plate in October.\n\nEAGLES IN CAPE VERDE\n\nGoalkeepers: Francis Uzoho (APOEL Nicosia, Cyprus); Daniel Akpeyi (Kaizer Chiefs, South Africa); Maduka Okoye (Sparta Rotterdam, The Netherlands)\n\nDefenders: Chidozie Awaziem (FC Boavista, Portugal); Kenneth Omeruo (CD Leganes, Spain); Jamilu Collins (SC Padeborn 07, Germany); Abdullahi Shehu (AC Omonia, Cyprus); Zaidu Sanusi (FC Porto, Portugal); Valentine Ozornwafor (Sporting Charleroi, Belgium); Tyronne Ebuehi (Venezia FC, Italy);\n\nMidfielders: Chidera Ejuke (CSKA Moscow, Russia); Innocent Bonke (Malmo FF, Sweden); Kingsley Michael (Bologna FC, Italy); Adekunele Adeleke (Abia Warriors);\n\nForwards: Ahmed Musa (Fatih Karagumruk, Turkey); Samuel Kalu (FC Bordeaux, France); Victor Osimhen (Napoli FC, Italy); Moses Simon (FC Nantes, France); Paul Onuachu (KRC Genk, Belgium); Terem Moffi (FC Lorient, France); Henry Onyekuru (Olympiacos FC, Greece)",

          "title": "Nigeria: Why Opposition PDP May Lose All Southern States if It Zones Presidency to North",
          "text": "There is a high possibility that the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) might pick its presidential candidate for the 2023 general election from the North, as stakeholders are set to zone the chairmanship position of the party to the South in a matter of weeks.\n\nThis, however, appears contrary to the survey by the THISDAY Economic Intelligence Group (EIG), which gleaned from the field that the decision could cost PDP the elections in practically all the southern states, the presidency and governorship inclusive.\n\nFindings also revealed that the PDP might not make any appreciable gains in the north and Middlebelt states either, as the All Progressives Congress (APC), is still likely to sweep the north even with a Southern candidate.\n\nOne key reality of the current state of play is that the PDP is still vulnerable in many northern states, including the ones it currently controls and the ones it doesn\u2019t. The party might, however, lose states like Taraba, Benue and be unable to win back Plateau, if it decided to zone the presidency to the north.\n\nAt the centre of the war of attrition over the chairmanship of the party lies the desperate permutations of where the party zones its presidential ticket to. The Southerners, who want Secondus out, want him out to pave the way for a replacement from the north, while the northern group led by Atiku and co, wants him to either stay or be replaced by another southerner to solidify their push for the presidential ticket to be zoned to the north.\n\nIn the south, the particularly vulnerable key states that the PDP is likely to lose are Delta, Akwa Ibom, Rivers and Oyo, if the ruling APC played smart by zoning its presidential ticket to the South. Such a move, findings showed, could give the APC a sweeping momentum in the countdown to the 2023 elections that would see it maintaining its hold on power.\n\nAccording to the THISDAY EIG survey, \u201cIf the PDP zones the Presidency to the North, they are likely to lose all their current Southern states, essentially, because of the mood in the South that Nigeria\u2019s Presidency should rotate between the North and the South.\n\n\u201cMost Southerners believe that, for equity, balance, cohesion, security and stability of the union, the next president should come from the Southern part of Nigeria, after Buhari would have completed eight years in 2023. To propose otherwise is almost an anathema among the political class and even among the average southerner.\n\n\u201cIt is that mood of the southern people that was reflected when 17 southern governors met and asked that the president should go to the South. Right now, Southern leaders are so united that they don\u2019t want to be divided on the issue and don\u2019t mind where in the south the president comes from \u2013 whether from the South-east, South-south or South-west.\n\n\u201cThey are of the view that it is in the collective interest of the entire south to produce the next president. They believe all southern people should be entitled to run and whoever gets the ticket from the region would be accepted.\n\n\u201cThis is actually the undercurrent in the crisis over Uche Secondus\u2019 chairmanship in PDP, which has pitted Governor Nyesom Wike against Secondus, with many southern governors silently supporting Wike\u2019s position, believing that if Secondus retains the chairmanship of the party after the convention, the Presidency would automatically go to the North, which they don\u2019t want. Wike\u2019s attempt to force Secondus out is supported by most of the southern PDP governors, albeit quietly.\u201d\n\nThe survey further gathered that \u201cmany of them (governors) are looking to people like Makarfi as a possible chairman of the party after Secondus.\n\nHowever, to counter them, the northern group with presidential bid led by a former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar; for President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki; Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; and his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Muhammed, supported tacitly by Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, a former Kano State governor, want the South to produce the next PDP chairman, even after Secondus, so that the presidency could be in the North.\u201d\n\nTo achieve this, the northern group has engaged individuals, like the Chairman of Daar Communications, Dr Raymond Dokpesi, and others, who are also seeking to be vice president, from the South, to start speaking in support of the northern PDP members\u2019 agenda.\n\nFrom the analysis of the survey, if the trajectory of the country was reviewed from 1960, the North has produced more presidents, and in the 1999 Constitution, there is an agreement that for the survival of the country, power must rotate between North and South.\n\nIt was based on these undercurrents, that the THISDAY EIG carried out a survey, as it has always done since 1999, where it noticed that in each of the PDP states in the South, PDP was likely to lose the governorship with a northern presidency, given the overwhelming move in the South for a president from the region.\n\nThat momentum, from all indications, might therefore lead to the loss of states likes Cross River (the governor has already defected), Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Delta, Abia, Enugu and Oyo.\n\nCurrently, there would not be an election in Edo next year. However, Obaseki, although a PDP governor, the survey showed, is a firm believer in the southern presidency.\n\nThe southern governors believe that for the survival of the PDP post-2023, power has to move down South.\n\nAccording to the survey, the factors in each of the critical southern states, with seeming PDP influence, painted scenarios peculiar to them.\n\nIn Cross River, for instance, even though the governor has defected to the ruling APC, the state is predominantly PDP. But the governor, Professor Ben Ayade, the survey showed, would get momentum and defeat Liyel Imoke and Donald Duke \u2013 two former governors combined \u2013 if PDP chose a northern president and APC settled for a southern presidential candidate. This, the survey added, could make the governor take the state deeper into APC.\n\nThe Akwa Ibom situation is not quite different, according to the survey. While the governor, Udom Emmanuel, is by every measure considered to be doing well, a northern presidential candidate as the PDP standard-bearer, would be a hard sell for him and could lose the state to other forces, such as the current APC National Secretary, Senator James Akpanudoedehe, and the Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, who would use federal incumbency to sweep PDP away.\n\nRivers, a crucial PDP state, might easily slip the way of former Governor Chibuike Amaechi, who is currently the Minister of Transportation, and effectively dislodging Governor Nyesom Wike, should the party embrace a northern presidential candidate. The state is already 50-50 for both leading parties and the APC has federal might to its advantage.\n\nBayelsa State is even more vulnerable, because, despite the misgivings about the APC governorship candidate, David Lyon, who won by a majority of the public votes in the last election, the party still won. But the PDP only came in through the court. However, with the current Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, and huge federal forces and privileges, APC would just replay the card it played the last time if the APC put forward a southern candidate and PDP went North.\n\nFrom Delta\u2019s axis, there\u2019s no debating the fact that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa is popular, especially, based on his performance record. But in the face of a southern candidate for APC and a northern candidate for PDP, his popularity would not save his party.\n\nThe party would most likely be swept out by the combined forces of the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, and the Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo, as well as others in the APC. With federal support, they would dislodge the PDP in Delta and sweep Okowa away, should the PDP present a northern president.\n\nThis scenario also applies to Oyo, being PDP\u2019s only state in the South-west, where Governor Seyi Makinde, is surrounded by counterparts from the ruling party. In fact, the survey showed he is hugely disadvantaged.\n\nThe survey, nonetheless, from the permutations that came out during PDP\u2019s 92nd National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting some weeks ago, there were indications that the party might actually zone its presidential ticket to the North and the office of the national chairman to the South.\n\nAs a result of this, the governors of the party from the North, believed to have presidential interest, have begun to jostle to ensure the emergence of a national chairman that would be disposed to their aspiration.\n\nA former military governor of Lagos State and later civilian governor of Osun State, Col. Olagunsoye Oyinlola, for instance, is said to be the favourite of many of the bigwigs, should the incumbent, Secondus, decide not to re-contest in the October 30th and 31th national convention in Abuja.\n\nSecondus, in a statement, had stated that his tenure as the national chairman would end on December 9 2021, because he was elected on December 9, 2017, and sworn in same day.\n\nRegardless, the embattled national chairman had recently debunked rumours that he had resigned from his position.\n\nA statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Mr. Ike Abonyi, dismissed the report as untrue, but he contended that he was merely obeying an interim court order at the time.\n\nHe added that as a law-abiding citizen, who had been an adherent of the rule of law as a basis for democracy, he had to stay away as a form of respect for the courts.\n\nThe offices of the national chairman of the PDP and other members of the National Working Committee (NWC) are guaranteed four-year term.\n\nOfficially, PDP is expected to submit the approved zoning of offices of the members of the NWC to the coming NEC meeting on September 9 2021, other stakeholders have been plotting to see that the NWC members elected were pliable to their aspiration.\n\nIn this regard, some stakeholders were believed to be working to ensure that the national chairmanship of the party was micro-zoned to the South-west, but a few others insisted that zoning it to the South-west might prove difficult, as it could amount to abridging the constitutional rights of Secondus to seek a constitutional re-election.\n\nOn his part, Dokpsei too has since debunked reports that he was in the chairmanship race. A statement from him claimed he wanted to keep his integrity and not soil or dent it.\n\nUnfortunately, nobody from the South-east has indicated interest in the presidential run, not even a former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, who was Atiku\u2019s running mate in the 2019 presidential election.\n\nHowever, from the North, the list has continued to increase. There are several posters at the party secretariat in Abuja announcing the aspirations of Tambuwal, Atiku, Mohammed, Kwankwaso, and a former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido.\n\nAhead of the zoning for both the presidential ticket and office of the national chairman, the chairman, Board of Trustees (BoT) of the PDP, Senator Waliid Jubrin, and Dokpesi have said the main opposition party stood a better chance in 2023 with a northern candidate.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",

          "text": "Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar says the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2015 general election was Nigeria\u2019s biggest mistake. Atiku stated this on Saturday in Yola at an event, where prominent APC stalwarts defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He urged Nigerians to reject APC in subsequent elections.\n\nAtiku also alleged that PDP lost in 2019 because APC perpetrated massive fraud at the polls.\n\nNevertheless, the former vice president intensified consultations for his 2023 presidential bid.\n\nAdamawa State Governor Ahmadu Fintiri described Atiku as the messiah the country had been waiting for. Reiterating that PDP lost the 2019 presidential election because of the massive fraud perpetrated by APC, Fintiri called on APC members to leave the party because of what he called the ruling party\u2019s woeful performance in power. He said the mass defections from the ruling party signalled its coming interment.\n\nAtiku said, \u201cWe have done a big mistake before by floating a party called the APC. But from today, I am calling on you, the Adamawa people, to leave your parties and join the PDP because it is the future and the masses\u2019 party. APC is Nigeria\u2019s biggest mistake.\n\n\u201cIt was PDP that gave back life to Adamawa State after it was slayed by the APC, ushering the state into her present state of infrastructural development. Our schools are now better and our health institutions are in superb shape. I pray that this event will mark the beginning of the internment of the APC.\u201d\n\nDuring the event, prominent ex-members of APC, including a former Secretary to the Adamawa State Government, Kobis Thimnu, Chief Daniel Bwala, Sali Bodes, Umar Bello, Nedo Geoffrey, and Philip Gutuwa, were received by Fintiri into the PDP. The governor assured the defectors of fairness and level playing ground.\n\nCanvassing support for Atiku\u2019s presidential aspiration, the governor urged stakeholders in the PDP in Adamawa State to work round-the-clock to sell his candidature outside the state, insisting that Atiku was the messiah that Nigeria earnestly awaited.\n\nLast week, Atiku spent a huge part of the weekend visiting political associates in Oyo State. He wrote on his verified Facebook account, \u201cThis morning, I led a delegation on a courtesy visit to the Aare Musulumi of Yorubaland, Edo and Delta States, Aare Dauda Akinola, at his residence in Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\n\u201cToday, in Ibadan, I paid a condolence visit to the widow of late Alhaji Ariyibi Adedibu, Alhaja Bose Adedibu, over her mother\u2019s death. May Allah grant the deceased Aljannah Firdaus and also shine His Noor on Baba Adedibu\u2019s face. Ameen.\u201d\n\nAtiku had visited the PDP governors of Oyo, Rivers, Delta, Enugu, and Edo states, while on Saturday, he met with the governor of his home state, Fintiri.\n\nHe had also been writing letters to his close associates, appreciating them for supporting him in the 2019 general election. In a leaked letter to Dr Kola Jones Ademujimi c/o Hon. Fatai Adams Peoples Democratic Party, of No. 3, Bishop Fagun Road, Alagbaka, Akure, Ondo State, Atiku gave signs that he might give the presidency another shot in 2023.\n\nIn the letter, dated June 29, 2021, Atiku expressed gratitude to members of PDP for their role in the 2019 elections and urged the party to gear up for the 2023 elections. He noted that the party had become better equipped than it was during the last presidential election, and urged members to team up towards a new political and economic order that would radically reinvent the country.\n\nThe letter to the Ondo PDP chieftain read, \u201cIt is with utmost respect that I convey to you, my deep appreciation and profound gratitude for the overwhelming support and massive electoral votes cast to support our party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and my candidature for the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria during the 2019 general election.\n\n\u201cNow, we are better equipped, and all our compatriots must team up today towards a new political and economic order that should radically reinvent our beloved country.\n\n\u201cWe are fully prepared to work in synergy to restore hope, pull Nigeria back from the brinks and relive the patriotic spirit of our founding fathers! I believe that together, we would rebuild our broken fences, mend our cracked walls, restore hope, and return Nigeria to the path of greatness again. Surely, we can, and we must.\u201d",
