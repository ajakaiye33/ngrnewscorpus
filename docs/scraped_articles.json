          "title": "Slain BRT victim, Bamise was a virgin; Mum inconsolable, Dad hard to pacify \u2014 Brother-in-law",
          "text": "\u2022Slam LASG on the absence of CCTV\n\nBy Ebere Orakpo, Ebun Sessou & Gabriel Olawale\n\nConcerned Nigerians have been reacting to the gruesome murder of 22-year-old Oluwabamise Ayanola who was declared missing after boarding a Lagos Bus Rapid Transit, BRT, only for her lifeless body to be found at the morgue of the Mainland Hospital, Yaba, Lagos days later.\n\nThe deceased, a fashion designer, was said to have boarded the BRT bus with number plate 240257 from Chevron bus stop at Lekki to Oshodi, at about 7p.m., heading to her elder brother\u2019s place at Idimu. But she never got to her destination and could not be reached on her phone until her remains were found.\n\nFleeing driver of the BRT bus, Andrew Nice was arrested in his hideout at Ososa, Ogun state by the Department of State Services, DSS. He was, thereafter, handed over to the police. He was arrested alongside a man that harboured him.\n\nWhen Vanguard Metro visited Isale Eko area, opposite Ilu Binrin Estate, where the decomposed body of Oluwabamise was dumped, the majority of the residents denied knowledge of the incident due to fear of any unforeseen aftermath.\n\nPressed further by the reporter, some dwellers who summoned the courage to talk said that when her body was discovered a day after the incident, some body parts were no longer found. This is contrary to police claims that nothing was missing in her body.\n\nAnother resident of the area, Mr Kunle Idowu who spoke with our reporter said that many people saw the lifeless body but walked away due to fear. He said: \u201cLet me correct you, this place is not Ogogoro community, it is Isale Eko. People may call it that name because many people sell Ogogoro here but that is not the name.\n\n\u201cAs regards the death of that young lady, it is so unfortunate that people didn\u2019t see it on time. It was the following day before they saw it and I heard that they reported it to council people who later informed the police. When we saw her, she was covered with blood and there was nothing anybody can do again.\u201d\n\nHowever, the distraught brother-in-law to the deceased, Engr. Johnson Omilana, told Metro on the phone that the driver was lying. \u201cHe is lying, all he said were lies. I am happy he ran away the first time because he knows the crime he committed. I believe he had no idea that the lady did some recordings and shared them with her friends while on the bus.\n\nAlso Read:\n\n\u201cMy surprise is, it was not quite long when we discovered her dead body that we had that the man was arrested and paraded. He confessed that he ran away because he was afraid. The question to ask is, why didn\u2019t he report the incident to the company\u2019s management and the police?\n\n\u201cWhen I asked the management of BRT if they had knowledge that any of their vehicles were on the road, they said no, all their vehicles were intact and in good condition. When I went there initially, I had only the recording, not the bus number; it was after a while that her senior brother advised I zoomed into the recording to get the bus number and I did and got the number 240257 which I showed to them and they told us to wait that the bus driver will soon arrive.\n\nSo, I asked some people to wait while I went to Akinpelu police station to make a statement. When I got back to the terminus, I was told to go to Ajah where he boarded the bus so that I can trace it from that place.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, the driver showed up in the company\u2019s uniform. For me, justice must prevail because that driver is not telling the truth. Everyone knows that there is nothing hidden again. We have a lawyer on the ground on this case.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about the condition of the mother of the deceased, on the deceased mother\u2019s she said, \u201cHer condition is worse. She is in pain. She is already losing her mind. Her situation is not encouraging right now. The late Bamise just graduated last year from her fashion school and started work recently at Ajah. She promised her aged parent\u2019s good life. Her mother is 70 years and the father is 80 years old.\n\n\u201cOn that fateful day, she bought children clothes for her elder sister who just put to bed but we didn\u2019t see any of those items. Right now, the environment is tense, filled with tears, pains, anger and agony, the father is trying hard not to break down completely but the mother is totally inconsolable. She was a very good Christian from her home and she was still a virgin.\n\nWhen Vanguard Metro spoke with more Lagosians about the driver\u2019s account of the circumstances that led to the death of the girl, some indicted the driver and accused him of complicity while others said he was yet to say the truth as regards what transpired.\n\nMr Adeniyi Ademuyiwa questioned the authenticity of his account alleging that he must have been carrying out such a beastly assignment for long. \u201cThis man and his evil colleagues have been doing this for long. I think they were just unfortunate this time that the poor girl made a video and dropped several voice notes before the driver carried his partners in crime.\n\n\u201cIf they were aware she left traces, I guess they would have let her go and looked for another victim. The driver went to park the bus, resumed work normally the following day, only to run away when the family members of the girl came to ask for her whereabouts. He wasn\u2019t expecting anybody to have known. It\u2019s very likely he belongs to a ritualistic syndicate.\u201d\n\nIn her reaction, Nollywood actress, Toyin Abraham slammed the Lagos State government over the horrific manner Bamise was killed. \u201cIt is sad enough that Nigeria is not safe but to think that a place or thing considered as property like BRT is now considered a dangerous place should all get all of us concerned. But I have a few questions for Lagos State Government, why are the BRT buses not fitted with CCTV cameras? she wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat measure have you put in place since this incident that made you assure Lagosians that the BRT buses are now safe? Are we truly safe or your speech is just government rhetoric, telling us what we want to hear?\u201d She advised Lagosians to be extra careful and observant while sending her condolence to the family of the deceased.\n\nMrs Habibat Saliu Ibrahim urged the security agencies to obtain the driver\u2019s phone conversation a week before the incident because his confession is questionable as he was supposed to report the case to the police.\u201d\n\nMr Ofeimum Felix said that the driver is likely to be the head of that syndicate because ritualists will know that you can blow the whistle, so they won\u2019t let you go if you are not part of them. \u201cWhy did he run away if he did nothing wrong? You see why I miss super cop (Abba Kyari), by now he would have been confessing both the one he did and the one that he did not.\u201d\n\nMr. Quadri Issa said that the driver\u2019s confession that the girl was holding on to the pole in the bus before he drove on with the hope that he rescued the girl was a lie, \u201cIf truly the criminals were three, one will still be inside the bus until they drag the lady down. So, his lie was not well articulated. He should just explain how they operate and means of apprehending others.\u201d\n\nMr. Uche Emeka said that if the driver was sincere, he can even create a scene by hitting one of the buses in front of him, \u201cThat way, the next driver will block you and demand that you fix his car. That way you can raise alarm when you come down from the bus to look at the level of damages. Oga driver, please tell the truth and confess your ring leader. Your operation is already busted.\u201d\n\nMrs Tonia Nwajei, a civil servant, said the government of the day has failed Nigerians, especially in the area of the security of lives and property. She said: \u201cIn my opinion, boarding a BRT on the way at that hour is wrong especially when it has less than 20 more passengers in it. Secondly, I believe the buses should have cameras in them which I used to see whenever I am standing on the aisle in the bus. Last but not the least; the government of the day has really, really failed every one of us in terms of security. It\u2019s very disturbing especially when you don\u2019t know whose turn it will be tomorrow. I pray God will continue to protect us all in Jesus\u2019 mighty name. Amen.\u201d\n\nA businesswoman, Mrs Ngozi Ezechi, said: \u201cThings are getting out of hand in this country. We are no longer safe anywhere. I will advise anyone that wants to board any commercial vehicle \u2013 be it BRT, taxi, bus, tricycle, motorcycle or even boat, to be very careful because these kidnappers, ritualists, Yahoo plus guys and the rest of them are all over the place.\n\n\u201cAs a Nigerian born and bred in this country, it is obvious that insecurity has reached its peak in the case of the killing of the young lady in BRT. This is a state-owned and managed transport company where CCTV is supposed to be active 24 hours a day, from the terminal and right inside the bus. With these techs intact, hunting down these killers is easy.\n\nTo prevent future occurrences, if you remember the year the RRS Police unit was created, almost all parts of Lagos and environs experienced peace and security of lives and property. But the current leadership in Lagos State converted the same RRS to the money-making tool, leaving Lagosians in the hands of hoodlums operating as government officials. If only the Police and other security agencies responsible for the safety of lives and property could be allowed to work independently, I think we will have a new and better experience on the issue of security.,\u201d submitted Mr Emeka Clifford, a businessman.\n\nA senior Medical Representative, Mrs Bridget Okobe stated: \u201cThis calls for precautionary measures like installing CCTV cameras in all the BRT buses and proper investigation of drivers before employment. Passengers should follow their instinct and board buses that are filled with enough passengers.\u201d\n\nMrs Anwuli Ogbonnaya, CEO of Party Party Kitchen said: \u201cIt\u2019s so saddening to hear of such an act from a government establishment. It shows the level to which things have fallen apart in our country. Where we are supposed to call home is no longer safe\u2026.it\u2019s indeed worrisome.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State\n\nBy Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo\n\nGovernor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has flagged off the disbursement of N200 million as part of Kaduna State Women Empowerment Fund (KADSWEF), to commemorate the 2022 International Women\u2019s Day, making it the third time that his administration will empower the women entrepreneurs.\n\nThe flag which was witnessed by senior government officials, Women Groups, and Civil Society Organisations as well as the general public, was held at Umar Musa Yar\u2019adua Conference Centre, Kaduna on Tuesday.\n\nThe governor reiterated that the fund is meant to support small traders with capital to grow their businesses, noting that women\u2019s economic empowerment increases the quality of lives of their families and improves society.\n\nEl Rufai argued that \u201cwomen are the foundation of the society\u201d and the APC government of Kaduna state \u201creally believes in supporting women because when you empower a woman you empower her family and the society. \u2018\u2019\n\nHe further pointed out that \u2018\u2019when you give loan to a woman, she pays for her children\u2019s education, feeds her children, and helps her husband. Our women in Kaduna have done very well to make us succeed.\u2019\u2019\n\nEl Rufai said that the Commissioner of Human Services and Social Development, Hajiya Hafsat Mohammed Baba initiated KADSWEF because \u2018\u2019 women traders need a small amount of capital to increase the sales and their businesses, and she said let us do something special for women. \u2018\u2019\n\nAccording to him, Hajiya Hafsat further argued that \u201cwomen are afraid of going to the bank to borrow, they are not given the chance. Let\u2019s do something just for women and I said, \u2018 bring it to the Executive Council.\u2019 \u2018\u2019\n\nThe governor recalled that the commissioner requested for N100 million but \u2018\u2019 we doubled it to N200 million, and we have been consistently doing it since 2019, is only in 2020 that we did not do it due to the covid-19 lockdown.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe governor explained that the government changed the name of Ministry of Women Affairs to the Ministry of Human Services and Social Development \u2018\u2019 because there is no humanity without a woman.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWomen are the basis of humanity, women are the root of humanity and when the quality of the lives of women is improved the quality of society improves.\n\nThe governor also commended the efforts and input of women holding appointive positions in Kaduna State Government, advising women generally to be confident in themselves.\n\n\u201cI want our women in Kaduna to be more confident of themselves. Don\u2019t think that you can only be wives and mothers, you can be Commissioners, you can be Head of Service, you can be Attorney General, you can be Deputy Governor, you can even be governor if you work hard at it.\n\nEl Rufai praised all members of the State Executive Council for working very hard and for consistently supporting every prorgamme that will empower the less privileged, especially \u2018\u2019 those that really need the help of the government to stand and climb the ladder.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "By Henry Umoru, Levinus Nwabughiogu, Johnbosco Agbakwuru & Victoria Ojeme, Funmi Ajumobi & Ebunoluwa Sessou\n\nThe House of Representatives may have buckled under pressure from women across the country, rescinding its resolution on three gender bills it earlier threw out during voting on 68 clauses of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\n\n\nThe House took the decision after an executive session, yesterday.\n\n\n\nThe decision came as women again stormed the National Assembly, yesterday, in protest against the rejection of the bills in the two chambers of the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nWomen from all walks of life had been protesting against the rejection of the bills, asking the National Assembly to reconsider the bills, which they argued would give women a leverage in the political development of the country.\n\n\n\nThis is even as wives of the 36 state governors, yesterday, vowed to occupy the National Assembly to express their disdain and disappointment over the rejection of women-related bills.\n\n\n\nIt will be recalled that the bills failed to fly last week during voting on 68 amended clauses in the 1999 constitutional amendments.\n\n\n\nThe bills to be reconsidered are Indigeneship Bill, Citizenship Bill and the 35 per cent affirmative action on Political Parties\u2019 bill.\n\n\n\nThe speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, who announced the decision of the House, said the bills would come up for voting in four weeks.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThat action is to rescind three of the decisions that were taken on that day (March 1). In the next four weeks, they will come up for voting.\u201d\n\n\n\nGbajabiamila said in a situation where there was a difference in the voting results, he would rely on the constitution to rule on the harmonisation since the constitution allowed the House to regulate itself.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me just quickly touch on the clause. If we at that point have a difference, we will go for harmonisation. The constitution section allows the House to regulate its procedures. I will rely on the Constitution to harmonize,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe called the chairman, House Committee on Rules and Business, Abubarkar Fulata, to move that the decision of the House be rescinded.\n\n\n\nFulata later moved the motion and it was seconded by the deputy minority leader of the House, Toby Okechukwu.\n\n\n\nThe voice vote called by the speaker on the development did not witness any dissensions.\n\nAgain, women storm National Assembly over rejected bills\n\nMeanwhile, scores of women groups, yesterday, continued their protest at the main gate of the National Assembly, blocking many people from accessing the complex.\n\n\n\nThey had vowed not to leave the scene until the bills were reconsidered.\n\n\n\nThe women, under the aegis of Nigerian Women Groups, had last week protested against the action of the lawmakers and promised to return if the decision was not reversed.\n\n\n\nThey made good their promise as they returned in larger numbers yesterday, promising to continue the protest until the lawmakers bowed to their demands.\n\nThey said the marginalisation suffered by women must stop in the country, and also demanded an apology from the lawmakers, while vowing to get the names of those who voted against the bills and publish their names for the world to see.\n\nGovs\u2019 wives vow to occupy NASS over rejected bills\n\nMeanwhile, wives of the 36 governors of the federation also, yesterday, vowed to occupy the National Assembly to express their disdain and disappointment over last week\u2019s rejection of women-related bills at plenary.\n\n\n\nIn a statement signed by the Chairman, Nigeria Governors\u2019 Wives Forum, NGWF, and First Lady of Ekiti State, Mrs Bisi Fayemi, to mark International Women\u2019s Day, they condemned in very strong terms what they described as brazen discrimination against Nigerian women.\n\n\n\nThe first ladies said as those who formed half of the population of the country, their voices and lives matter, stressing there could be no development without the full and equal participation of women in all spheres of life.\n\n\n\nThey added that any country that continue to deliberately undermined the advancement of women was simply stifling its own advancement.\n\n\n\nMrs Fayemi promised that the wives of the governors would continue with ongoing engagement with a broad range of stakeholders to support the proposed constitutional amendments that would give them a gender-friendly constitution in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nAccording to her, as wives of state executives, the first ladies will mount pressure on federal and state lawmakers to do the right thing and be true representatives of the people, with women constituting at least 50 per cent.\n\n\n\nRecall that last week, a bill seeking to give at least ten slots to women as ministers and commissioners in the federal and state governments failed at the upper legislative chamber.\n\n\n\nA total of 88 senators registered to vote. 44 senators voted yes, while 43 voted no, and one abstained.\n\n\n\nThe bill, which was meant to guarantee the inclusivity of women in governance, failed as it could not garner 73 votes needed for it to be passed.\n\n\n\nThe statement read: \u201cEvery March 8, communities around the world gather to commemorate International Women\u2019s Day, IWD. It is a time to reflect on the status of\n\nwomen and highlight the many areas in which their rights are still being undermined and assess progress made.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019It is a day for governmental and non-governmental actors, corporate bodies, development partners and social movements to make commitments to close gender gaps and address the many challenges women still confront in public and private.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver the past three electoral cycles (2011, 2015, 2019) the number of women in the National Assembly has been in steady decline. There are currently 109 senators in Nigeria, with only seven women.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019The House of Representatives has 360 members with only 13 women. There are at least 14 state Houses of Assembly with no women at all. There are no female governors. These disturbing statistics show that there is a deep-rooted bias against women holding leadership positions, and if urgent steps are not taken, this picture will continue to go from bad to worse.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn March 1, 2022, Nigerian women received very disappointing news from the National Assembly. The ongoing constitutional amendment currently has 68 amendments up for debate. There are five bills that seek to ensure gender justice and fairness.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019The Bills are: A Bill to create additional seats for women to increase women\u2019s representation in the Senate and House of Representatives. This Bill will level the playing field and lead to a significant number of women in the National Assembly, which currently stands at 5 per cent. The bill was rejected.\n\n\n\n\u201cA bill to enable Nigerian women transfer citizenship to foreign husbands, a right that every Nigerian man married to a foreign spouse enjoys. The bill was rejected.\n\n\n\n\u201cA bill to ensure affirmative action of at least 35 per cent in political party administration and appointive positions across federal and state levels. The bill was rejected.\n\n\n\n\u201cA bill to ensure a minimum of 20 per cent ministerial or commissioner nominees are women. The bill was rejected. A Bill to allow a woman to become an indigene of her husband\u2019s state after five years of marriage. The bill was rejected.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur interpretation of what transpired with this pattern of voting at the National Assembly on March 1, 2022, is that the progress of Nigerian women has been rejected. All the proposed constitutional amendments were meant to end bias against women and ensure the minimization, if not total removal, of barriers millions of women face on the basis of their gender.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019We hereby condemn in no uncertain terms this brazen discrimination against Nigerian women. As half of the population of the country, our voices and our lives matter.\u201d\n\nWomen can no longer be deprived\u2014 Buhari\n\nAlso, yesterday, President Muhammadu Buhari extolled Nigerian women on the occasion of International Women\u2019s Day, saying women were not where they should be in different spheres of endeavour.\n\n\n\nHe, however, said they could no longer be deprived for too long, as they had consistently proved that they could hold their own on all fronts, and in all fields.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement he signed yesterday, titled \u2018International Women\u2019s Day: President Buhari salutes womenfolk.\u2019\n\n\n\nAccording to Buhari, the celebration, under the hashtag #BreaktheBias, and the theme: Gender Equality Today for a Sustainable Tomorrow, is an opportunity to reflect on the vital roles women play in society, homes, governance, professions, and in all walks of life.\n\n\n\nHe applauded the contributions of women to the current administration as ministers, special advisers, senior special assistants, executive directors, executive secretaries, and many others, noting that they were pulling their weights, and making it impossible for anyone to downplay their essence.\n\nReactions on Reps to reconsider 3 women bills\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the bills rescinded by the National Assembly, Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, urged the leadership of the National Assembly to use the opportunity of the International Women\u2019s Day to address whatever is lacking in the push for equity for women.\n\n\n\nCommending women for their resilience and importance, Obasa, however, expressed sadness that the women have become victims of heinous crimes.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a government, we must look inward to see the areas that are beneficial to the women. Women have become victims of violence and other crimes. What have we done for the emancipation of our women? How much of our women have we lost during child birth?\n\n\u201cWe must encourage our women to be successful and live better,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nIn her telephone chat, Dr. Abiola Akiyode, co-convener Womanfesto, expressed satisfaction with the development. She said: \u201cA responsible leadership needs to respond to the people.\n\nIt is commendable that two of the bills have been rescinded by the House of Representatives. There are lots of corresponding conducts from the Senate. Your guess is as good as mine.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, she noted that the women will not take anything short of 5/5. We will continue to occupy the National Assembly\n\n\n\nAlso, Prof Joy Ezeilo, in a phone interview with Vanguard said: \u201cIt is a welcome development and we are waiting to hear from the Senate. It is only the House of Representatives that we have confidence in. We have to wait for the Senate because both Houses must agree.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know that the leadership of the House of Representatives has been supportive of the women related bills and that is why the affirmative action must be upheld.\n\n\n\n\u201cWomen all over the world were angry over the move by the Senate last week and the negation on the right of women. They have taken women for granted despite that they constitute the majority of the electorate. In a civilized society especially where we have literate and educated people, there is no bills that should be rejected.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI believe, what is playing out is huge ignorant but women are prepared to get down to their constituencies and tell them what they have done. That these lawmakers do not love their wives, sisters, daughters, otherwise, they will be able to pursue their interest.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to hold these people accountable. It is all about gender accountability. So, we are very happy and it is a welcome development and I think, in the interest of peace, social justice and being responsive, the Bills should accepted by the Senate.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was part of the \u2018Occupy the National Assembly\u2019 in Abuja, yesterday morning and we registered our disappointment with the National Assembly and we are also telling the\n\nHouse of Representatives that they should join to bring pressure on the National Assembly. We are ready to wait on the National Assembly until they right the wrong.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

My party, your party, our party. You have alluded to it that a number of people came together to form alliances to unseat a government that was in power for over sixteen years. We have the legacy parties and other people joined.\n\nRead Also: APC senators decry crises in party\n\n\u201cWe got that mass of people to come together. We were able to change the narrative about politics. We took the bull by the horn. We have not been in office up to eight years. We can not afford to throw away our chances. We must get our acts together as a political party.\n\n\u201cWe must have values. What are our core values? Do we want to represent a democratic institution that everyone would appreciate? Let\u2019s create that niche for ourselves. I\u2019m not opposed to zoning offices because there must be mechanism for balance. For me, I have nothing against zoning. What I have said, and that is why I will continue to encourage you, is that there must be internal democracy.\u201d\n\nSenator Musa, who is representing Niger East Senatorial District and Senate Services Committee chairman, said his visit was for consultation as well as sought support of the Governor for his aspiration to become APC national chairman.\n\n\u201cWe know how you want this country to be united, a country where there is equity, fairness and justice.

I am in line with your ideas and I believe, if we can translate same to our political party, we will be one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties are supposed to be platforms where government policies are being designed and proffered for implementation to those that will be elected. I think political parties should be where there will be interaction. It is not only in universities that we do research and adopt strategies. Political parties should be able to do that.\n\n\u201cI will commend you for the fact that you have chosen to have your ideology and you have adopted that in this State. Whatever anyone will say, you are doing very well, and those are the type of leadership we should be able to give our people.\n\n\u201cThis party needs a decisive leader. It is not by age or by figure or by physical look. It is by your antecedents and how strong you can be. The devolution of powers we are talking about, the party has done something.

          "text": "The Federal High Court in Abuja sent shockwaves through Ebonyi State politics yesterday with a judgment sacking Governor David Umahi and his deputy Eric Igwe \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo said they unlawfully defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe judge held that having defected from the party on which platform they won an election and became members of a party that lost, Umahi and Igwe were deemed to have resigned.\n\nIn another judgment, Justice Ekwo ordered 16 lawmakers in the Ebonyi State House of Assembly, who defected from the PDP to the APC, to vacate their seats.\n\nThe first judgment was on the suit numbered FHC/ABJ/CS/920/2021 filed by the PDP.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), APC, Umahi and Igwe were the defendants.\n\nThe second judgment was on the suit filed by the PDP.\n\nINEC, Ebonyi House of Assembly Speaker; the House of Assembly, the Clerk of the House of Assembly, the APC and the 16 defected lawmakers, including the Speaker, Francis Ogbonnaya Nwifuru, were the defendants.\n\nThe other affected lawmakers are Odefa Obasi Odefa, Victor Uzoma Chukwu, Kigbsley Ikoro, Benjamin (surname not provided), Joseph Unuhu, Nkemka Okoro, Anthony Nwegede, Chinwe Nwachukwu, Onu Nwonye, Friday L. Nwuhuo, Moses Odunwa, Chinedu Awo, Chinedu Onah, Chukwuma Igwe and Chukwu Arinze Lucas.\n\nJustice Ekwo added that the PDP, which won the majority votes at the last governorship and the state legislative elections, is entitled to submit the names of candidates to replace Umahi, Igwe and the lawmakers to serve out the remainder of the four-year term it secured by virtue of its victory in the elections.\n\nHe ordered INEC to receive from the PDP the names of its members with which it sought to replace Umahi, Igwe and others or in the alternative, it should organise fresh elections within 90 days to fill the vacancy resulting from their defection to the APC.\n\nThe PDP swiftly named a House of Representatives member, Iduma Igariwey, as governor-nominee, with a former commissioner Fred Udeogu as his deputy.\n\nBut, Umahi said he remained the governor and vowed to appeal the judgment.\n\nJustice Ekwo said Umahi, Igwe and the lawmakers should be excluded from participating in the fresh election, having been disqualified by the defection, which amounted to a rejection of the majority votes earlier secured by their former party.\n\nThe judge ordered Umahi, Igwe and the lawmakers to desist from parading themselves as governor, deputy governor and members of the Ebonyi Assembly.\n\nHe issued an order of perpetual injunction restraining INEC from further recognising them.\n\nThe judge declared that by Section 221 of the Constitution and the democratic system of governance operated in Nigeria, votes are won by political parties and not their candidates.\n\nHe declared that the votes won or scored by a political party at an election are retained by the political party irrespective of the death or exit of the candidate from the political party.\n\nJustice Ekwo declared that under the democratic system of governance operated in Nigeria, the votes won at an election by a political party cannot be transferred to or utilised for the benefit of another political party or member of another political party.\n\nThe judge rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that Section 308 of the Constitution prohibits the filing of both civil and criminal cases against a governor and a deputy, noting that the provision cannot apply to this case.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe civil or criminal proceedings envisaged in Section 308 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) are those cases where causes of action are such that can still be enforceable after the tenure of the persons mentioned therein.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the cause of action and the remedy thereof cannot wait till the third and fourth defendants leave office.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the immunity in Section 308 cannot be said to be absolute. To propound otherwise will be tantamount to creating monsters who will neither bow to the supremacy of the constitution nor observe any law passed by the legislature.\u201d\n\nHe added that Section 308 of the constitution was intended by the legislature as a \u201cveritable constitutional shield and not a political sword that is to be swung frivolously and recklessly.\u201d\n\nJustice Ekwo added: \u201cIn conclusion, let me put it this way, the third and fourth defendants (Umahi and Igwe) did not on their own win the election of 9th March 2019 to become governor and deputy governor of the Ebonyi State respectively.\n\n\u201cThey were sponsored by the plaintiff (PDP) in compliance with the provision of Section 221 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u201cTherefore, it was the plaintiff (PDP) that the electorate voted for. They cannot remain in office as governor and deputy governor respectively of Ebonyi State after their defection without the plaintiff (PDP) that the electorate voted for.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the second defendant (APC) was not the party elected by the electorate in the election of 9 March 2019 to govern Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the second defendant (APC) cannot govern Ebonyi State through the third and fourth defendants when it did not win the election that produced the governor and deputy governor.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution is put in jeopardy where the will of the electorate can be brazenly merchandised by candidates without consequences.\n\n\u201cThe act of the second, third and fourth defendants and the position of their respective counsel, in this case, are directed at the political dismantling of the 1999 Constitution. It must be stopped forthwith.\u201d\n\nThe judge said two decisions by the Ebonyi State High Court, Abakaliki in the suit marked HAB/13/2022 between Senator Soni Ogbuoji and two others v. Engr. David Nweze Umahi and another; and the other by the Federal High Court (Gusau) in the suit FHC/GS/CS/24/2021 between Bashir Saleh & 2 others v. Alhaji Bello Mohammed Matawalle & four others, were not binding on him.\n\nLawyers to the defendants had tendered copies of the judgments which upheld the defection Matawalle and Umahi.\n\nUmahi: I remain governor\n\nUmahi has said that he remains the governor despite the judgment ordering his sack.\n\nHe urged Ebonyi people to remain calm as he was sure of quashing the ruling at the appeal court.\n\nThe governor, who described the verdict as \u201cjungle justice\u201d, said he has forwarded a petition against the judge to Nigerian Judicial Council (NJC).\n\nUmahi claimed that the judgment was \u201cpurchased\u201d and that the judge was out to \u201cembarrass\u201d his party, but he did not immediately provide any evidence to back his allegations against the judge.\n\nThe governor believes the court lacked the powers to remove him as governor as he was covered by the immunity clause.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe constitution stipulates that the only way whereby a governor can vacate his seat is either by death, resignation or impeachment by the House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cThere is no other provision that empowers a hatchet man to turn the Constitution upside down.\n\n\u201cI have listened to the judgment of Ekwo and it is very obvious that he was on a mission.\n\n\u201cHe was making all efforts to upturn the rulings of the Appeal and Supreme courts on issues like this.\n\nRead Also: Umahi denies using Ebubeagu to suppress opposition\n\n\u201cWe have heard the rumours before now that he was determined to give judgment against all known laws and the constitution to embarrass the APC and the Federal government.\n\n\u201cI do not feel worried but I feel so sorry for the judiciary. The executive may have a problem, the legislature may have a problem but the moment justice could be purchased then we are in trouble in this country. And the ruling this afternoon is clear evidence that this country is in trouble.\n\n\u201cAnd let me tell you that this same judge has over 10 cases against Ebonyi government with him and you can imagine what he is going to rule.\n\n\u201cWe have petitioned him to NJC and we will follow it up to ensure that this man is brought to justice.\n\n\u201cI want you to disregard the judgment; it is null and void there is a subsisting judgement in Ebonyi and Zamfara states.\n\n\u201cSo, we have chosen the one to obey, we will not obey his ruling, we will obey the ruling of a competent court of coordinate jurisdiction that says you cannot sue a governor.\n\n\u201cThe sections of the constitution are very clear; no civil or criminal proceedings could be brought against a sitting governor. This is not a pre-election matter, this is not a tribunal matter.\n\n\u201cSo, he has murdered justice in this country and he and his generation will be remembered for this jungle justice which has no leg to stand.\n\n\u201cI am still the governor of Ebonyi State and he has no powers to remove me.\u201d\n\nUmahi also argued that the judge lacked the powers to declare the seats of the House of Assembly members vacant.\n\nThe Ebonyi State Chapter of the APC also rejected the judgment.\n\nIts Chairman, Stanley Okoro-Emegha, accused the judge of acting the script of political detractors.\n\n\u201cThe judgment was clearly biased and it\u2019s unacceptable\u2026There is no need to panic as the judgment will surely be appealed.\n\n\u201cAll members of the APC and supporters of the governor are advised to remain calm and law-abiding.\u201d\n\nPDP picks Igariwey, Udeogu as governor, deputy\n\nThe PDP national leadership picked Igariwey as the party\u2019s nominee for governor and Udeogu as deputy to replace Umahi and Igwe.\n\nNational Chairman, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, said the party had already forwarded the names of Igariwey and Udeogu to INEC to be issued with certificates of return.\n\nAyu called on the Chief Judge of Ebonyi to swear them in without delay.\n\nHe urged INEC to put the necessary machinery in motion to conduct fresh election into the 17 Ebonyi State House of Assembly seats.\n\nAyu hailed Justice Ekwo for the verdict, saying he demonstrated courage.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe want to appreciate the Nigerian judiciary for this landmark judgment.\n\n\u201cThe ruling will bring order in the political space and check the issue of political rascality and stolen mandates. The judiciary is indeed the backbone of this democracy.\n\n\u201cWe also want to single out Justice Inyang Ekwo for special recognition, particularly for being courageous and forthright in going for the substance of the law rather than the technicalities.\n\n\u201cAnd lastly, we call on INEC to immediately withdraw the Certificates of Return from the 17 lawmakers and commence the process of conducting bye-elections to replace them.\u201d\n\nCNPP hails judgment\n\nThe Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) hailed the judgment, saying it would end the era of defections.\n\nIn a statement by its Secretary General, Chief Willy Ezugwu, the group said: \u201cThe verdict of the court has vindicated the CNPP, which has been at the forefront of advocacy that it was immoral and illegal for any elected officeholder to defect to another party with the mandate of the people given to his or her former party.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, commend the judiciary for taking the bull by the horn and moving to end the defection impunity which is destroying democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor us, the court judgment corresponds with the ruling by the Supreme Court of Nigeria in the Omeha vs Amaechi, which averred that it was the party that was voted, note the individual fielded by the party.\u201d\n\nAttorney-General of the Federation (AGF) Abubakar Malami (SAN) could not be reached for comments on the verdict.\n\nHis spokesman, Dr. Umar Gwandu, did not pick up his calls or respond to messages on his WhatsApp as of press time.",
          "summary": "The Federal High Court in Abuja sent shockwaves through Ebonyi State politics yesterday with a judgment sacking Governor David Umahi and his deputy Eric Igwe \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d.\nJustice Inyang Ekwo said they unlawfully defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\nHe declared that the votes won or scored by a political party at an election are retained by the political party irrespective of the death or exit of the candidate from the political party.\nJustice Ekwo declared that under the democratic system of governance operated in Nigeria, the votes won at an election by a political party cannot be transferred to or utilised for the benefit of another political party or member of another political party.\nHe urged INEC to put the necessary machinery in motion to conduct fresh election into the 17 Ebonyi State House of Assembly seats.",

          "text": "\u2022Bello directs sale of forms this week or early next\n\n\u2022Buhari to join Tuesday\u2019s NEC meeting remotely\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\n\n\n\n\nWorried by the recent turn of events in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), which witnessed a dramatic change of guard, stakeholders in the party have started mulling a soft-landing for the displaced former chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, in order to save him from the embarrassment of his ouster.\n\nOne of the options said to being considered, THISDAY gathered last night, was to ask Buni to resign as CECPC chairman, either on the grounds of health or the need to face governance in his State.\n\nAt the same time, there was a pall of confusion yesterday at the national secretariat of the APC over the fate of the National Secretary of the CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe.\n\nThis just as the new leadership is moving swiftly with preparations for the convention scheduled for March 26. THISDAY is reliably informed that printing of expression of interest forms has commenced and are expected to go on sale this week or early next week.\n\nWhile there were reports that Akpanudoedehe had tendered his resignation having read the handwriting from the new leadership, he, on the other hand, claimed he was still the secretary except President Muhammadu Buhari said otherwise.\n\nThis is as President Buhari has hinted that he would be part of next Tuesday\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party, summoned by the acting chairman of the CECPC and Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello, to address some of the raging crises in the party.\n\nSources in the APC told THISDAY last night that some of Buni\u2019s colleagues were unhappy with what had become of him and thought that rather leave him to be embarrassed, there should be a soft-landing that would quietly ease him out, even though someone else had taken over the leadership of the party.\n\nOne of the sources maintained that though he had been out of the country on medical trip, it might be easy to ask him to resign on health grounds and allow the party continue with its affairs.\n\nAnother suggestion before the party, however, was to ask him to resign in order to concentrate on his state, especially, as a first term governor, who might be interested in seeking re-election in 2023.\n\nA reliable source privy to the meeting told THISDAY that Bello said both Buni and Akpanudoedehe would be given soft-landing.\n\n\u201cThey are going to give the Secretary and Buni a soft-landing by asking them to resign. Buni will resign and say he wants to face governance in Yobe, while the secretary will tender his resignation and say he wants to pursue his governorship ambition. That is the soft-landing they are giving them.\n\n\u201cThat is the game plan on the ground. The NEC will now ratify the decision. The convention will hold, the date will not change and they will vacate the court order.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at the end of the caretaker committee meeting yesterday, news filtered in that Akpanudoedehe had been forced to resign his position.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, who also attended the meeting left the secretariat after the meeting ended.\n\nImmediately the news of his resignation rent the air at the secretariat of the party, the staff of the party started jubilating.\n\nThe story of his alleged resignation, however, forced Akpanudoedehe to come back to the secretariat to address journalists to deny the report about his resignation.\n\nHe insisted that he remained the national secretary of the party until President Buhari says otherwise.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said he wouldn\u2019t accept a situation, where some people would be dropping the name of the president, adding that he and Buni would wait until they hear directly from the President.\n\n\u201cI have read on social media that I have resigned as Secretary of the APC. I want to state that it is not true. I didn\u2019t resign. If I had resigned, you would have seen my letter of resignation written by me. Someone cannot just say somebody is dead when he is alive.\n\n\u201cI am not bigger than the party, or bigger than the President, who is a leader of the country. I am waiting for my national chairman to come back. This is not the first time you are seeing a power play. I am waiting for the Chairman. If we have a directive from the President that we should resign, we are not bigger than the President, we will do so, if we hear from him.\n\n\u201cSomebody cannot say go and announce he is resigning. Like MKO Abiola used to say, you don\u2019t shave someone\u2019s head in his absence. So, we have done so much. And you will agree with me that when we came in, this place was like a dead zone. The secretariat was moved to a private home. But we were committed to what we were doing. I am stating here that that breaking news is not from me. I don\u2019t know who announced it.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had received any letter from the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) asking him to resign, Akpanudoedehe added, \u201d I have not received any letter.\u201d\n\nBut he maintained: \u201cSomeone cannot say the President said. I have not received any letter from anywhere. As I said, nobody is bigger than the party. The issue is that, if I have resigned, the answer is no. I am the national secretary of the party.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari is expected to join Bello\u2019s first NEC meeting next Tuesday virtually from London. The National Working Committee of the ruling party at its meeting on Tuesday resolved to hold its NEC next Tuesday at 11am.\n\nBuhari\u2019s virtual attendance, insider said, would serve to instill confidence in Bello\u2019s new leadership.\n\nAll members of the party\u2019s NEC, except Buni and Akpanudoedehe will attend the meeting, including all APC governors.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the party\u2019s national convention and the presidential primary would dominate the meeting.\n\nHowever, following the leadership change that occurred on Monday, Bello later met with APC state chairmen same night at Transcorp Hilton, Abuja.\n\nBello said his major task was to fix the party and ensure a successful National convention of the party at the stipulated date.\n\n\u201cOur main task is to fix the party and hold a convention. We all should be worried about the Convention. We need to hold our Convention so that we rectify past mistakes. I placed my absolute loyalty to you but I need your support,\u201d he said.\n\nAddressing journalists after the caretaker committee meeting yesterday, Bello said the report of the zoning of party offices had been adopted and also announced the NEC meeting for next week.\n\nBello stated: \u201cThe report of the zoning formula has been submitted and adopted and it will be released any moment from now. I mean the zoning formula.\n\nHe said the meeting held yesterday was a continuation of Monday\u2019s meeting, and that the committee would meet everyday from now on.\n\nOn whether Akpanudoedehe was still part of the new leadership, Bello replied: \u201cask him\u201d.\n\nSenate APC Caucus Laments APC Crisis\n\nSenators elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, expressed deep concern over the crisis rocking the party.\n\nThe federal lawmakers, who held a closed-door meeting after plenary at Senate room 301, however, confirmed that the Niger State Governor, Sani Bello, was merely acting for the ailing Governor Buni, as chairman of the party\u2019s caretaker committee.\n\nThey, therefore, urged all stakeholders to exercise caution to avoid any incident that could prevent the conduct of the March 26 convention of the party.\n\nSenate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, who briefed journalists after the two-hour meeting, described happenings in the APC as worrisome.\n\nHe said his colleagues would soon start peace moves to reconcile aggrieved stakeholders across the country.\n\nAbdullahi said, \u201cAPC senators met for about two hours. We are too worried about what is happening in our party and we expressed our concern over the challenges facing the party, very close to its national convention.\n\n\u201cWe thought as a very important stakeholders in the party, we want to draw the attention of everyone involved to come together and unite so that we can have very successful convention in the party.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for regrets about what we could do. What is happening is about the future of our party and government and also the capacity of our party to win elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have sat down as important stakeholders as a caucus in this great party, to dissect all the issues that have been affecting our party since the formation of the caretaker extraordinary convention planning committee.\n\n\u201cWe are quite aware of the challenges that they have faced and we are also aware of the successes that the committee had recorded particularly, when it comes to registration of members.\n\n\u201cThey came to harmonise some of the successes of the party, carrying out congresses at the ward, local government and at the state levels. The same convention planning committee is in place. What we realised is that the chairman of the convention planning committee has been sick and he went for medical checkup.\n\n\u201cThe current Niger State Governor, from the grapevine and from the knowledge that is available to us, is actually the deputy chairman and in the absence of the chairman, he is acting till the chairman comes back. The speculation in the papers is not exactly true.\n\n\u201cWhat we are concerned about is the seeming disarray in the party. So, from our standing coming from all the states in Nigeria, we have to come and establish a national platform, where all these things can be articulated so that all of us will come up with one mind and strategise for the success of the party.\n\n\u201cAll personal and individual bitter struggling for power is subordinated to the chances of the party \u2013 party\u2019s interest. So that the party would be strong. We are the strongest party; we have the largest membership, therefore, we should as much as possible move to make sure that our party is united in the interest of every member.\n\n\u201cWe commend the performance of that committee, we ask you to do more by as much as possible by trying to reconcile those chapters, where there are still challenges trailing the ward, local government and state congresses.\n\n\u201cThis is because, a loss in any state is a loss for the party. We cannot afford to come to the convention as a divided entity. Anywhere there are challenges that could cause the party its victory is a loss for everybody.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022I\u2019m still in charge, judgment was bought, declares Ebonyi gov\n\n\u2022PDP moves to take over, submits names of replacements to INEC\n\n\u2022Mike Ozekhome: Judgment cannot stand Appeal Court scrutiny\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja, Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\n\n\n\n\nContrary to a ruling by a Federal High Court in Gusau, Zamfara State, which affirmed Bello Matawalle as the governor of Zamfara State, in a suit by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), challenging his defection to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), another Federal High Court of coordinate jurisdiction, yesterday, in Abuja, has sacked the Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi and his Deputy, Kelechi Igwe, for defecting from the PDP to the APC.\n\nThe court, which was presided over by Justice Inyang Ekwo, however, sounded a strong note of warning to governors that, the immunity clause in section 308 of the 1999 constitution as amended, was not absolute, and therefore sacked 16 members of the state House of Assembly on the same ground but in a similar suit.\n\nBut the governor had immediately dismissed the court ruling, which had caused instant uneasy calm in the state as null and void, saying he was still in charge as governor of the state, and that the judgment was particularly bought.\n\nRelatedly, the leadership of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had immediately sent names of choice replacements for the vacant positions to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as instructed by the court.\n\nHowever, in his ruling, Ekwo held that the defection of Umahi, his deputy and others from the PDP to the APC was illegal, null and unconstitutional.\n\nTo this end, the court held that they all could not continue to occupy their various offices, having defected from the party on whose platform they came into office.\n\nThe defendants had contested and won the 2019 governorship election on the platform of the PDP but defected to the APC in September 2020.\n\nTheir action had, however, incurred the wrath of the PDP, which dragged them to court to challenge their continued stay in office, having left the party that brought them into power.\n\nDelivering judgment in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/920/2021, Ekwo held that since candidates contest election on the platform of political parties, the votes and the victory in any election accordingly belong to the party and not the candidates.\n\nHe subsequently ordered that Umahi and his deputy should vacate their offices immediately.\n\nIn a similarly suit filed by the PDP, the court also ordered the 16 Ebonyi lawmakers, who defected with their governor, to vacate their seats too, having dumped the party that brought them into office.\n\nHe therefore ordered the plaintiff (PDP) to present the names of its candidates to INEC for the post of governor, deputy governor and the affected 16 lawmakers of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly.\n\nIn addition, Ekwo ordered INEC to stop recognising Umahi and Igwe as governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi State respectively. He made a similar order in respect of the affected 16 lawmakers.\n\nArriving at his decision, Ekwo clarified that the crux of the matter was the defection of Umahi and Igwe from the PDP to the APC, saying the averments of the 3rd and 4th defendants did not address the issue of defection rightly and frontally but rather resorted to general denial to affidavit evidence.\n\nEkwo said the depositions of the 3rd and 4th Defendants in their counter affidavit were \u201cevasive and insufficient\u201d to competently challenge the Plaintiff\u2019s originating process.\n\nIt was, therefore, the opinion of the court that the \u201cImmunity Clause\u201d in section 308 of the Constitution was not absolute.\n\n\u201cSection 308 is a veritable constitutional shield and not for political reasons,\u201d he said, adding that Umahi and Igwe did not controvert the deposition that total votes scored in an election belong to a political party.\n\nEkwo explained further that there was sufficient evidence that the 2nd defendant (APC) contested the Ebonyi State governorship election held on March 2019, with its own candidates.\n\n\u201cIt can be noted that the Constitution does not deal with the issue of defection lightly. The 3rd and 4th Defendants cannot transfer the votes and victory of the Plaintiff on March 9, 2019, to the APC. Offices of the Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State belong to the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe option for Umahi and Igwe is to vacate office and wait for next election to contest election under the platform of its new party,\u201d the court declared.\n\nThe court said the action of APC, Umahi and his deputy was aimed at dismantling the 1999 Constitution, and declared that under the democratic system operated in Nigeria, the plaintiff won the majority of votes during the election and was entitled to enjoy same till end of tenure of office for which the election was made.\n\nMike Ozekhome, SAN Reacts\n\nIn his reaction Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN,, said the judgment cannot stand the scrutiny of the Appeal Court.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that the judgment, shredded of all legal and factual details, cannot stand the acid test of constitutionalism, nor pass the furnace of appellate courts scrutiny. This is because the tenure of office of a Governor and his Deputy are constitutional matters.\n\nThe judgment is said to have sacked Governor David Umahi and his Deputy, Eric Kelechi Igwe from their offices. He cited section 221 of the Constitution, which merely prohibits political activities by certain associations which are not political parties from canvassing for votes or contributing to elections expenses of any candidate at any election. The Judge ordered the PDP to immediately send names of replacements to INEC so that fresh elections can be conducted. He also ordered INEC to cease recognising Umahi and Igwe as Governor and Deputy Governor, respectively, of Ebonyi State.\n\nThe learned trial Judge further held that the 393, 042 votes polled by Umahi in the March 9, 2019 governorship election belonged to the PDP and cannot be legally transferred to the APC upon defection, and that there is no constitutional provision that made the ballot transferable from one party to another. He therefore order INEC to conduct fresh election in accordance with section 177(c) of the Constitution. Not so fast, the enforcement of this judgment. The Governor and his Deputy have 90 days to appeal this decision under section 25(2), (a) of the Court of Appeal Act, it is their right under sections 240 and 241, of the Constitution, the judgment being a final one.\n\nTHIS JUDGMENT CANNOT SURVIVE APPELLATE SCRUTINY\n\nPerhaps, the Jurist\u2019s learned attention was not drawn to appellate decisions on this type of matter, which under the doctrine of stare decisis and judicial precedent, he ought to have followed meticulously. He may also not have been availed of the clear provisions of sections 180 and 188 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nVOTES BELONG TO INDIVIDUALS, NOT POLITICAL PARTY\n\nThe appellate courts have since held again and again that votes cast in an election belong to a live candidate, and not the political party which merely serves as a vehicle that enthrones candidates.\n\nThe Judge in his Judgment had agreed with the PDP which relied on sections 221, 177(c), 106(d) and 65(2)(b) of the Constitution to substantiate its argument that votes belong to the political parties; and it is impossible for candidates to exist without a political party. The case of NGIGE V. AKUNYILI (2012) 15 NWLR (PT.1323) 343 @ 357-376, which came much later over rule this position. The court held in that case that:\n\n\u201c\u2026it is my considered view that the Appellant in relying on the provision quoted above (section 211 of the Constitution), has conveniently lost sight of the underlined words which show that a political party canvasses for votes on behalf of the candidate. In other words that a political party is nothing more than an agent of the candidate in gathering votes for an election. It is my further view that is against the backdrop of this, that the Electoral Act (Supra) requires the candidate (and not the party of the candidate) that has the highest number of votes at an election to be declared as the winner of the said election and further provides for the means of challenging the return of the candidate (and not his political party..\u201d\n\nThe Conflicting Zamfara Example\n\nBut in the suit by some PDP chieftains in Zamfara State, seeking the removal of Governor Matawalle as governor of the state, Justice Aminu Aliyu of the Federal High Court, Gusau, dismissed the case for lacking in merit.\n\nThe court, in dismissing the case, ruled that the constitution of the PDP and that of the 1999 Constitution do not, in any way, prohibit any person from joining any association or political party.\n\nAliyu also premised his decision on the fact that it was only an election tribunal or state House of Assembly that could remove a governor from office. The ruling was delivered on February 8, 2022.\n\nSimilarly, on March 1, 2022, Justice Henry Njoku, of a High Court in Ebonyi State had earlier dismissed a suit seeking to remove Umahi and his deputy on account of their defection to the APC.\n\nThe judge in dismissing the suit slammed a N500,000 cost in favour of Umahi and his deputy.\n\nThe Plaintiff, Senator Sunny Ogbuorji, had demanded that the governor and his deputy, should vacate office for the second runner up, having defected from his former party, PDP.\n\nAmong the issue for determination was whether Umahi and his deputy, having defected to APC, could still continue to be governor, having regards to the provisions of the constitution and the Electoral Act as relied upon by the plaintiff and that having come second in the governorship election ought to be sworn in.\n\nResponding, the defendants in their argument canvassed that the plaintiff was relying on the pre-election/election qualification issues, arguing that there was no provision in the constitution that provided for defection as one of the grounds for the vacation or removal of a person as governor or as deputy governor.\n\nIn his judgment, Njoku, citing Section 188 (1) of the 1999 Constitution, noted that the defendant (Umahi), has not offended any provision of the Constitution or the Electoral Act in his defection to APC.\n\nThe court further held that having regard to section 308 of the Constitution, it was wrong to institute criminal or civil proceedings against the office of the governor. The Court, therefore, dismissed the suit in its entirety.\n\nUmahi: I\u2019m still Ebonyi Governor, Judgment Was Bought\n\nEbonyi State Governor, Chief David Umahi, yesterday, described his removal by a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) as unconstitutional, null and void and of no effect.\n\nBriefing journalists in Abakaliki, Umahi reiterated that he still remained Ebonyi governor, and that he would appeal the judgement.\n\nAccording to Umahi, a governor could only vacate his seat by either death, resignation or impeachment by majority of members of the state House of Assembly.\n\nHe noted that the judgement was allegedly concocted to embarrass the APC and the federal government.\n\nUmahi said: \u201cFor me, I do not feel worried. I feel so sorry for the judiciary. The executive may have problems, the legislature may have problems too, but the moment justice could be purchased, then, we are in trouble in this country.\n\n\u201cThen the ruling this afternoon shows that this country is in trouble. And let me tell you that this same judge has over ten cases against Ebonyi State government with him. And you can imagine what he is going to rule. We have petitioned him to NJC and we will follow it up at all cost to ensure that this man is brought to justice\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want you to disregard the judgement. It is null and void. There is a subsisting judgement in Zamfara State and there is also a judgement in Ebonyi State. These sections of the constitution are very clear. This is not a pre-election matter; this is not a tribunal matter, and so, he has murdered justice in this country and he will be remembered by his generation for this jungle justice, which has no leg to stand.\n\n\u201cI am still the governor of Ebonyi State, but let me say to the nation, there is a need to look at the integrity of the judiciary, because if the judiciary begins to rule on constitutional matters that are well laid down, then, the citizens of this country may decide not to obey the jungle justice,\u201d and therefore called on the people of the state to remain calm and law abiding, as there was no issue to worry about.\n\nAlso, reacting to the judgment outside the court, Commissioner for Information and State Orientation, Mr Uchenna Orji, described the judgement as a travesty of justice and assured the people that they would appeal the decision.\n\nFaulting the judgment, Orji stated that the judge only relied on provisions of the Electoral Act dealing with pre-election and election matters.\n\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal decision in Amaechi shows that today\u2019s judgement was a clear case of an error in law and we must challenge it at the appellate court,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further disclosed that a court of coordinate jurisdiction in Ebonyi State, had made a pronouncement on this matter, saying the Constitution has no provision on defection for governors or has not made it an offence for a governor to defect from one party to another.\n\nPDP Submits Names of Replacements to INEC\n\nIn a related development, the PDP, in compliance with the orders of Justice Iyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, which sacked Governor Dave Umahi and his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, has submitted two names of governor and deputy nominees to INEC.\n\nThe two nominees are Hon. Iduma Igariwe, a serving member of House of Representatives as the new governor and Mr. Fred Udogwu as the deputy governor.\n\nThe PDP also asked INEC to issue the certificates of return to the new nominees.\n\nAddressing a press conference, the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, said, \u201cFollowing the removal of Governor Dave Umahi and his Deputy, Mr. Igwe, and in line with the Order of the Federal High Court directing the PDP to submit replacements for the duo, the national leadership of the party, has submitted the names of Hon. Iduma Igariwe as the new Governor and Mr. Fred Udogwu as the new Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State respectively.\n\n\u201cIt follows the sacking from office of the Ebonyi State Governor, His Excellency, Chief Dave Umahi, and his deputy, His Excellency, Chief Kelechi Igwe, by a Federal High Court for defecting to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cIn the same ruling, the court, presided over by Justice Inyang Ekwo, also sacked the 16members of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly, who also defected with the governor and his deputy into the APC.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that Governor Umahi, his deputy and the 16 lawmakers were elected on the PDP platform in 2015 and again in 2019, but defected to the APC on November 17, 2020, citing \u2018injustice done to the South-East\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd determined to reclaim our stolen mandates, the PDP had sued them and joined both the APC and INEC in the suit. We had prayed the court to declare that by defecting from the PDP, on whose platform they were sponsored and elected, Umahi, Igwe and the 16lawmakers had resigned or deemed to have resigned from office on the day of their defections. And the Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja, gave the PDP and democracy justice today.\n\n\u201cIn a landmark judgement, the court ruled that, \u2018the votes in any election in Nigeria are to political parties, and not candidates. Justice Ekwo consequently ordered all the affected persons to vacate office. He also ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to receive names of candidates from the PDP to replace Messrs Umahi and Igwe.\n\n\u201cFirst, we want to appreciate the Nigerian Judiciary for this landmark judgement. The ruling will bring order in the political space and check the issue of political rascality and stolen mandates. The judiciary is indeed the backbone of this democracy.\n\n\u201cWe also want to single out Justice Inyang Ekwo for special recognition, particularly, for being courageous and forthright in going for the substance of the law rather than the technicalities.\n\n\u201cAnd in line with the court order, PDP is immediately submitting to INEC, the names of our candidates for Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State respectively. We are also calling on INEC to immediately issue the Certificates of Return to the PDP nominees as replacement for Messrs Umahi and Igwe pursuant to the Order of the Honourable Court.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we call on the Chief Judge of Ebonyi state to immediately swear them in as soon as INEC issues the requisite Certificates of Return. And lastly, we call on INEC to immediately withdraw the Certificates of Return from the 16 lawmakers and commence the process of conducting bye-elections to replace them,\u201d Ayu stated.\n\nJudgment is Judicial Recklessness, Says APC\n\nThe ruling APC, has described the Federal High Court judgement on the defection of Governor David Umahi as a clear case of travesty of justice and judicial recklessness.\n\nThe party in a statement issued yesterday by the Director of Publicity, Mr. Salisu Dambatta, declared that the judgement was dead on arrival.\n\nThe party stated: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to the judgement made by Hon Justice Inyang Ekwo of Court 5 of Federal High Court FCT, Abuja and the travesty of Justice occasioned by the recklessness of his Judicial decision.\u201d\n\nAPC insisted that the presiding Judge committed a glaring judicial error by giving judgement sacking a duly elected and sworn in governor and his deputy without relying on or citing any provision(s) of the constitution or any provision of the Electoral Act that empowers the court to sack a sitting governor and or his deputy, saying, \u201cThis is purely a travesty of Justice.\u201d\n\nThe ruling party emphasised that the court failed, refused or neglected to understand the clear difference between a governorship candidate of a political party as contemplated by the Electoral Act and a Governor of a state duly sworn in as contemplated by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Court presided by Hon. Justice Inyang Ekwo further went ahead to rely on the outdated authority of Amaechi v INEC (Omegha case) without exercising the Judicial power of Judicial distinction between pre-election/ election matters and this matter of elected governor defecting to another Political Party.\n\n\u201cHe chose not to appreciate or he lacked the understanding of the difference between a Governor of a State and Governorship candidate of a political party. The Electoral Act and the judgement in Amaechi v INEC contemplate, who is the right candidate of the Party and not the issue of defection, as you all know neither Amaechi nor Omegha raised the issue of defection to another political party.\n\n\u201cSo it is absolutely ridiculous and questionable, as it is shameful that a judge could decide a weighty matter such as conditions for sacking the governor of a State without relying on any express provision of the Constitution or Electoral Act or Judicial Authority either of superior courts or even courts of coordinate jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022House rescinds decision, reconsiders rejected gender bills in constitution amendment\n\nChuks Okocha, Deji Elumoye, Michael Olugbode, Adedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu, Juliet Akoje in Abuja, Hammed Shittu in Ilorin, Segun Awofadeji in Gombe, Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia, Emma Okonji, Segun James in Lagos and Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the world marked the International Women\u2019s Day (IWD) yesterday with the theme, \u201cGender Equality Today for a Sustainable Tomorrow,\u201d President Muhammadu Buhari has extolled the virtues of Nigerian women. Buhari was joined by state governors, their wives, and lawmakers, who released statements and held ceremonies to salute the courage of the womenfolk, and pledge commitment to their increased empowerment.\n\nThat was as members of the House of Representatives at plenary yesterday rescinded their earlier decision and agreed to reconsider three out of the four gender bills they had rejected during last week\u2019s voting on the constitution amendment.\n\nBuhari, in statement by his media adviser, Femi Adesina, said the IWD was an opportunity to reflect on the vital role women played in society, homes, governance, the professions, and all walks of life. He observed that women were not where they should be yet in different spheres of endeavour, but believed they would not be deprived for too long, as they consistently proved they could hold their own on all fronts, and in all fields.\n\nThe president applauded the contributions of women to his administration as ministers, special advisers, senior special assistants, executive directors, and executive secretaries, among others. He said women had been pulling their weight, and making it impossible for anyone to downplay their essence.\n\nThe president rejoiced with women and mothers around whom the tranquillity of homes and society revolves, praying God to grant them peace, joy, and satisfaction as they celebrate their day and always.\n\nConstitution Amendment: House Rescinds Decision, Reconsiders Rejected Gender Bills\n\nThe House of Representatives yesterday withdrew its earlier position and decided to re-examine three out of the four gender bills, which it rejected during last week\u2019s voting on the constitution amendment. Following the rejection of the bills by the lawmakers, hundreds of women had besieged the National Assembly complex, blocking the main entrance to the Three-arm zone to protest the death of the bills.\n\nThe aggrieved women vowed that they were not going to leave the protest ground until the lawmakers addressed what they called bias against the womenfolk.\n\nAt plenary yesterday, Speaker of the House, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, disclosed the decision to reconsider the bills after a closed-door session. Gbajabiamila said the bills, which sought to \u201calter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, to provide for 35 per cent affirmative action for women in political party administration; expand the scope of citizenship by registration and provide criteria for qualification to become an Indigene of a state in Nigeria,\u201d would be re-evaluated in the coming weeks by the lawmakers.\n\nHe said after the reconsideration, any differences with the Senate would be harmonised.\n\nGbajabiamila said the House would be relying on the provisions of the constitution to harmonise the differences between it and the Senate.\n\nThe speaker stated, \u201cThe House, in its wisdom, has decided to take a course of action for the good of the country. That action is to rescind three of the decisions that were taken on the day of voting on constitution amendment. We will revisit them on the next set of amendment coming up within the next four weeks; they will come up again for voting.\n\n\u201cWe will take these three bills again, if we still at that point have a difference with the Senate, we will go for harmonisation. Harmonisation might not be the best tactic when it comes to constitution matters, because I have heard this thing argued here and there, but the constitution allows the House to regulate its own procedure.\n\n\u201cWe will be relying on the provisions of the constitution to harmonise the differences between us and the Senate.\u201d\n\nConsequently, Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Business, Hon. Hassan Fulata, moved a motion to recede the rejected bills and it was thereafter put to a voice vote and all the lawmakers voted in agreement.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after plenary, Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson, said the decision of the lawmakers was in solidarity with the female folks on the occasion of the International Women\u2019s Day and not because of pressure.\n\nBenson, however, said the House did not rescind the decision on the bill to Provide for Special Seats for Women in the National and State Houses of Assembly because of the constitutional constraints.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is International Women\u2019s Day, I congratulate the womenfolk. We rescinded three of the bills rejected during voting on constitution amendment. We did this without being under pressure; we are trying to do the right thing. If you talk about creating extra seats, the constitution itself states the maximum number. You must have a constituency that is available to run; you know what I\u2019m saying.\n\n\u201cSo it is an on-going conversation that we are also critically looking at. Nobody wants to leave the women behind. So, we will do our best to ensure that we try and give them the pride of place they truly deserve.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like what I saw outside (protest), I personally supported and voted in favour of the women bills and other lawmakers did as well.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers, at the plenary, also passed for Third Reading the constitution amendment bills on autonomy for local government councils, state Houses of Assembly, and judiciary, which they voted in support of last week.\n\nOthers bills passed for Third Reading included, \u201cAn Act establish the office of the Attorney -: General of the Federation and of the State Separate from the office of the Minister of Justice or Commissioner for Justice of the state in order to make the Offices of Attorney \u2013 General independent and insulated from partisanship, independent candidacy in presidential, governorship, National Assembly, state Houses of Assembly and local government council elections; and Bill to provide for the Office of Mayor for the Federal Capital Territory Administration, Abuja.\n\n\u201cBills for an Act to Alter the Provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, to Move Airports from Exclusive Legislative List to the Concurrent Legislative List; Bill to Establish State Security Council and for Related Matters; Bill to Empower the National Assembly and State House of Assembly Powers to Summon the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Governors of States to answer Questions on issues on which the National and State Assembly have the Power to make Law; a Bill to reduce the period within which the President or the Governor of a State may authorise the withdrawal of Monies from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in the absence of an Appropriation Act from six months to three months; Bill to provide for the State of the Nation and State Address by the President and Governor, and for Related Matters; Bill to Include Former Heads of the National Assembly in the Council of State, and for Related Matters.\u201d\n\nThere were also the bills \u201cTo provide for the Termination of Tenure of certain Elected officials on Account of change of political party, and for Related Matters, and to enhance existing provisions on the formation of political parties.\u201d\n\nThe lower chamber also introduced a bill seeking to regulate activities of real estate, and a private member bill, sponsored by Hon. Blessing Onuh and nine other lawmakers, which scaled through First Reading.\n\nGovernors\u2019 Wives Join Protesting Women at NASS\n\nMeanwhile, prior to the decision of the House of Representatives, wives of some governors in the country yesterday joined scores of women groups protesting what they called injustice against the female gender at the main entrance of the National Assembly.\n\nThose present were the First Ladies of Ekiti State, Bisi Fayemi, Betty Obaseki of Edo State, and Martha Udom of Akwa Ibom State.\n\nThe team was led by Fayemi, who said they were at the protest ground to stand in solidarity for all Nigerian women.\n\n\u201cWe are here to demand our rights. We want our leaders at the National Assembly to recognise that Nigerian women matter,\u201d she said.\n\nObaseki said anyone who neglected the interest of women would lose election in Edo State.\n\nOn her part, Emmanuel, who advocated 35 per cent affirmative action for women, argued that women should be given the opportunity to contribute to the development of the society.\n\nChairman of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Abike Dabiri, said women were not asking for the easy way out, but only seeking equity.\n\nExecutive Secretary of National Human Rights Commission, Mr. Anthony Okechukwu Ojukwu, voicing support for the protesting women, stated that women\u2019s rights were human rights as well. Ojukwu added that women should not be discouraged, saying this is just the beginning of the struggle.\n\nHe assured the women that \u201cthe National Human Rights Commission is with you, standing by you, cooperating with you, support you in any way we can to make sure that truly, women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d\n\nAt the protest ground also was Executive Director of Yiaga Africa, Mr. Samson Itodo, who noted that the struggle would count for something, saying the lawmakers have no choice but to yield to the demands of the women.\n\nKwara Governor Advocates Improved Participation of Women in Decision Making\n\nKwara State Governor, Alhaji AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, clamoured for improved participation of women in the decision-making process in the country, saying this would make for a balanced society.\n\nIn a statement yesterday to mark the IWD celebration, signed by the governor\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Rafiu Ajakaye, he said, \u201cWhether as a girlchild, wife or mother, a woman is acknowledged for being hard working, kind, resilient, supportive, and generally committed to efforts to build a society that is conducive for all.\u201d\n\nThe governor believed that for humanity to design a world that works for everyone, women must be in the room and be part of the process.\n\nAbdulRazaq noted, \u201cWomen are half of humanity and there is no basis for shutting the door against them.\u201d\n\nWhile congratulating women worldwide on the occasion of the IWD, the governor commended their grit, resilience, and commitment to nation-building. He said the IWD offered a platform to clamour for improved participation of women in the decision making process for a balanced society.\n\nHe added, \u201cI believe wholeheartedly that for us to design a world that works for everyone, women must be in the room and be part of the process.\u201d\n\nInuwa Pledges Increased Opportunities for Women\n\nGombe State Governor, Alhaji Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya, yesterday said his administration was committed to ensuring ease of access to resources and opportunities for women.\n\nYahaya stated this in a message to mark the 2022 IWD. He noted that the occasion was not just a day to celebrate women, but to also reflect on the challenges they were facing and implement workable solutions towards addressing them.\n\nThe governor described women as wonderful partners in the onerous task of nation-building. He said in Gombe State, women held key cabinet positions, stressing that this is one of the steps towards demonstrating that, indeed, \u201cWe subscribe to gender mainstreaming and women empowerment.\u201d\n\nHe encouraged them to continue to remain positive and focused as well as use their talents and motherly disposition to advance societal growth and development. He assured of his administration\u2019s commitment to ensuring the promotion of policies and programmes that will address their needs and challenges.\n\nOrtom Commends Courageous, Resilient Nigerian Women\n\nBenue State Governor, Mr. Samuel Ortom, commended the courage and resilience of Nigerian women.\n\nOrtom, in a goodwill message to mark this year\u2019s IWD, yesterday, stated that some of the challenges militating against women\u2019s emancipation, such as cultural practices, widowhood, and inability to aspire to certain positions in the society needed to be addressed.\n\nThe governor noted that his government was at the forefront of efforts to empower Benue women politically and economically in line with the 35 per cent Beijing affirmative action.\n\n\u201cFor instance,\u201d he stated, \u201csince we came in 2015, we have developed a deliberate policy to give women more opportunities to occupy political offices, which hitherto was not in place.\n\n\u201cWe have a good number of women as appointees but above all, Benue State under my leadership has given women leadership roles as chairmen of local government areas in the state.\n\n\u201cIn the forthcoming local government elections, our party, the PDP, has liberalised women participation by giving nine slots to women as council chairpersons. Apart from a certain percentage of women who will be appointed as secretaries of local government councils, there will be 69 elected women councillors in the 23 local governments. This is a good testimony of a government that prioritises the place of women for the development of our state and country.\u201d\n\nHe challenged the leadership of the APC-controlled National Assembly to borrow a leaf from what he called, \u201cthe women development model from Benue State,\u201d and not to jettison the clamour for women in the political process of the nation.\n\nOrtom condemned the recent brutal killing of Miss Bamise, who boarded a Lagos Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) from Ajah to Oshodi, and urged the authorities to ensure the deceased family got justice.\n\nObaseki Celebrates Women, Pledges Support for More Representation in Elective Positions\n\nEdo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, linked the crisis that rocked the state\u2019s House of Assembly to the lack of women representation. Obaseki reassured support for more women representation in elective positions.\n\nThe governor gave the assurance during an event at the Government House, Benin City, to mark this year\u2019s IWD.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMy only regret till date is that I didn\u2019t work hard enough during the last national elections that produced members of our state House of Assembly to bring women into the house.\n\n\u201cYou all know the situation under which we conducted that election. And we can see the crisis that we had in the house. It was possible because we did not have a woman there.\n\n\u201cSo, we have learned our lesson, and this election, you don\u2019t need to preach to us. I will go out there to campaign and more women will be elected into our state House of Assembly. The crisis we had could have been avoided if we had more voices of reasoning in that house.\n\n\u201cSo, women get ready. You know how we do it; you know we moved from ward to ward, and will do that again in a few months\u2019 time. Rest assured that our government will create more opportunities to support women and build structures that will allow you to achieve your goals.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who flayed the National Assembly for rejecting bills seeking affirmative action and inclusion of women in politics and other spheres of the society, was quoted in a statement as saying, \u201cThe action of the National Assembly should serve as a turning point in our history and should spur you, women, to mobilise Nigerians for gender equality and to break the bias; do not despair.\u201d\n\nHe further stated, \u201cToday\u2019s celebration would have been an epic one if the National Assembly had set aside all unfounded misgivings and biases to justify their refusal to constructive debates and approved the bills to alter the provisions of our constitution to provide affirmative action for women in our political administration and other related matters.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on efforts to end all forms of gender bias in Edo, Obaseki said, \u201cIn Edo, we are clear. We have seen how women have contributed to making major differences in our lives. If we say we want to make Edo great again, then, the women must be at the forefront.\u201d\n\nIn her speech, Edo First Lady, Mrs. Besty Obaseki, who was represented by the wife of the deputy governor, Mrs. Maryann Shaibu, also berated the National Assembly for not giving approval to the five gender bills.\n\nLagos First Lady Leads Rally against Rejection of Gender Bills\n\nFollowing the recent rejection of some gender bills by the National Assembly, Lagos State First Lady, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, yesterday led a rally of women against the rejection.\n\nThe rally was organised by the Purple Women Foundation, in collaboration with the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Wives Forum, and it was tagged, \u201cOne Million Women March Against Gender Discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe First Lady and the women marched from the Lagos State Secretariat to the House of Assembly at Alausa, Ikeja, where they were received by Speaker Mudashiru Obasa; Deputy Speaker, Wasiu Eshinlokun; Majority Leader, Sanai Agunbiade; and Chairman, House Committee on Women Affairs, Poverty Alleviation and Job Creation, Hon Mojisola Alli-Macaulay, among others.\n\nAddressing the women as part of activities to commemorate the 2022 IWD, Sanwo-Olu described the rejection of the gender bills as a brazen act of discrimination against Nigerian women. She called on the National Assembly to promptly reconsider the bills and approve them.\n\nThe governor\u2019s wife said, \u201cOur interpretation of what transpired with this pattern of voting at the National Assembly on March 1st, 2022 is that the progress of Nigerian women has been rejected.\n\n\u201cAll the proposed constitutional amendments were meant to end bias against women and ensure the minimisation, if not total removal of barriers, millions of women face on the basis of their gender.\n\n\u201cWe hereby condemn in no uncertain terms this brazen discrimination against Nigerian women. As half of the population of the country, our voices and our lives matter.\n\n\u201cThere can be no development without the full and equal participation of women in all spheres, and any country that continues to deliberately undermine the advancement of women is simply stifling its own advancement.\u201d\n\nThe First Lady also spoke on the death of Miss Oluwabamise Ayanwole, who went missing after boarding a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and was later found dead, describing the development as sad, shocking, and devastating.\n\nShe said, \u201cAs mothers, we are devastated; we are in shock; we are not happy. Lagos State is not known for ritual killings and we will not tolerate such.\n\n\u201cInvestigations are going on and I am sure there will be justice. Mr. Governor is not sleeping. There will certainly be justice.\u201d\n\nEkweremadu Flays Failure of N\u2019Assembly to Advance Women\u2019s Participation in Politics\n\nFormer Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, criticised the continued collapse of legislative efforts to advance Nigerian women\u2019s participation in politics. Ekweremadu reiterated that only a fundamental switch to proportional representation in the nation\u2019s electoral system could cure the malaise and guarantee women their deserved place in the governance of the nation.\n\nIn a goodwill message to Nigerian women on the occasion of the 2022 IWD yesterday, the former senate president said the situation was one of his nightmares at the helm of electoral reform and constitution amendment for many years, as there was a clear lack of understanding and political will among the political leadership and those who should know better.\n\nHe said, \u201cI congratulate women all over the world and join other well-meaning Nigerians in celebrating Nigerian women, especially.\n\n\u201cIn celebrating them, I also think the occasion calls for sober reflections by all, especially the political elites, over the continued collapse of every legislative effort to shore up women representation in governance structures across the country.\n\n\u201cI believe the International Women\u2019s Day 2022 calls for recommitment and political will by all to rise to the demands beyond lip service.\n\n\u201cShould we not feel embarrassed that Rwanda occupies the first spot on the February 2022 Inter-Parliamentary Union monthly ranking of women in 192 national parliaments, whereas Nigeria places a distant 184th, only better than a few countries like Kuwait, Papua New Guinea, Yemen, Eritrea, and Haiti.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa places 8th, Senegal places 19th, Mozambique places 21st, Ethiopia places 24th, while even South Sudan and Chad occupy the 54th and 56th positions, respectively, well ahead of the Giant of Africa on the same table.\n\n\u201cInstructively, one thing that is common among most of these nations and others with high women representation in parliament is proportional representation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the ranking senator, by law, 50 per cent of the national parliament of the United Arab Emirates is reserved for women.\n\nGoogle.org Commits $1m Grant for African Women Entrepreneurs\n\nIn celebrating the IWD yesterday, Google\u2019s philanthropic arm, Google.org, committed $1million in charitable funding to support programs helping African women entrepreneurs to grow their businesses.\n\nThe move was part of a series of new initiatives aimed at supporting women-owned businesses across Africa.\n\nGoogle announced the African initiative for women and the financial commitment to support the initiate at a virtual conference yesterday.\n\nWhile announcing the initiative, Head, Brand and Reputation for Africa at Google, Mojolaoluwa Aderemi-Makinde, said, \u201cResearch shows that 58 per cent of small and medium-sized business (SMB) entrepreneurs in Africa are women. Despite this, women-run businesses show, on average, 34 per cent lower profits than those run by their male counterparts. They are also less likely to receive funding and investment. This is why we are announcing a series of initiatives today, aimed at providing the support women need to grow their businesses.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the funding announcement, Google also announced another initiative called #LookMeUp, a campaign to showcase women entrepreneurs and tell their stories. These stories feature women like Vivian Nwakah in Nigeria, who launched Medsaf, a pharma supply chain solution to help Nigerians get access to quality pharmaceutical health care services; Mary Mwange, CEO and founder of Data Integrated, who is driving innovation in the mobile payments sector in Nairobi, Kenya; and Mosa Mkhize in South Africa, who launched Origins Publishers to provide her children \u2013 and others like them \u2013 with books in their home languages.\n\n\u201cGoogle is also providing free tools to support women entrepreneurs to grow their businesses and has launched an intensive program to drive the discovery of women-owned businesses through Google Business Profiles,\u201d Aderemi-Makinde further said.\n\nGender Equality Bills: PDP, Governors\u2019 Wives Want National Assembly to Reconsider Position\n\nIn line with the IWD celebration, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and wives of the 36 states\u2019 governors have asked the National Assembly to reconsider all outstanding gender bills currently before it.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 by the wives of the governors, signed by their chairman, Bisi Fayemi, they listed the five bills that the National Assembly must revisit to include, \u201cA bill to create additional seats for women to increase women\u2019s representation in the Senate and House of Representatives. This bill will level the playing field and lead to a significant number of women in the National Assembly, which currently stands at five per cent.\u201d\n\nThe bill was rejected.\n\nOthers are, \u201cA bill to enable Nigerian women transfer citizenship to foreign husbands, a right that every Nigerian man married to a foreign spouse enjoys. The bill was rejected.\n\n\u201cA bill to ensure Affirmative Action of at least 35 per cent in political party administration and appointive positions across Federal and State levels. The bill was rejected.\n\n\u201cA bill to ensure a minimum of 20 per cent Ministerial or Commissioner nominees are women. The bill was rejected.\n\n\u201cA bill to allow a woman become an indigene of her husband\u2019s State after five years of marriage. The bill was rejected.\u201d\n\nAccording to the chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 wives, the interpretation of what transpired with the pattern of voting at the National Assembly on March 1st, 2022, was that the progress of Nigerian women was been rejected.\n\nAccording to Fayemi, \u201cAll the proposed constitutional amendments were meant to end bias against women and ensure the minimisation, if not total removal, of barriers millions of women face on the basis of their gender. We hereby condemn in no uncertain terms this brazen discrimination against Nigerian women.\n\n\u201cAs half of the population of the country, our voices and our lives matter. There can be no development without the full and equal participation of women in all spheres, and any country that continues to deliberately undermine the advancement of women, is simply stifling its own advancement.\u201d\n\nThe governors\u2019 wives, among others, said they were committed to on-going engagement with a broad range of stakeholders to support the proposed constitution amendments that would usher in a gender-friendly constitution in Nigeria\n\nPDP Women Leader, Professor Stella Attoi, while addressing a press conference to mark the IWD, urged the National Assembly to reconsider all gender equality bills the federal lawmakers rejected recently.\n\nDescribing them as agents of development, Attoi said the National Assembly should re-present the said bills for positive reconsideration, adding that it would not be a sign of weakness, but rather that of strength. She explained that the attitudes against women in the National Assembly should be jettisoned, saying the rise of women would not in anyway make men to fall.\n\nPDP urged the National Assembly to adopt the 35 per cent affirmative action, which is the most acceptable global standard on gender inclusion, explaining that the expectations of Nigerians on this matter should be met, which is the quick passage of the gender equality bills.\n\nAccording to Attoi, \u201cGender balance is not solely a women\u2019s issue. Men should be greatly involved in advancing it as no democracy without gender inclusiveness.\u201d\n\nShe called on male senators, members of the House of Representatives, and States Assemblies to support the gender bills.\n\nNasarawa First Lady to Sustain Fight for Gender Equality\n\nThe First Lady of Nasarawa State, Hajiya Silifat Sule, yesterday pledged to sustain her fight for gender equality through the enhancement of girlchild and women welfare in the society.\n\nSilifat made the pledge in a statement given to journalists in Lafia by her Special Assistant on Media, Lamino Ishaq, in commemoration of the 2022 IWD.\n\nShe lamented that one in three women in the country was at risk of one form of gender-based violence or the other, adding that insecurity in many communities has equally placed women and girls, in particular, in grave danger across the country.\n\nThe Nasarawa first lady pledged to support her husband, Governor Abdulallahi Sule, by complementing his efforts and drawing his attention to the plight of vulnerable citizens, especially women and children.\n\nShe said, \u201cThrough my pet project, Silifat Abdullahi Sule\u2019s (SAS) Hope Foundation, I have engaged in advocacy, awareness raising and coordination of empowerment programmes to promote the well-being of women and girls.\n\n\u201cAs \u2018Gender Equality Today for A Sustainable Tomorrow\u2019 is the theme for this year\u2019s IWD celebration, we in Nasarawa State have witnessed that the administration of Governor Sule has, since inception, being working to close the gender inequality gap in terms of participation in governance.\u201d\n\nThis, according to the first lady, was evident in the governor\u2019s appointments into various positions in the apparatus of the Nasarawa State government.\n\n\u201cImagine a gender equal world. A world free of bias and discrimination. A world that is diverse, equitable and inclusive, as well as a world where difference is valued and celebrated is what we need.\u201d\n\nActionAid Nigeria Intensifies Call for Reconsideration of Rejected Gender Bills\n\nActionAid Nigeria also called on the National Assembly to re-present and re-consider the five proposed gender bills in the fifth Constitution Alteration Bills that were rejected by both Houses of the National Assembly.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja, Country Director, ActionAid Nigeria, Ene Obi said, \u201cIn line with this year\u2019s theme \u2018Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow\u2019, we had looked forward to really celebrating International Women\u2019s Day 2022 because we thought it would mark a turnaround for Nigerian woman in politics, and a historic win in the struggle for women inclusion in decision making spaces, as the 2023 general elections draw closer.\n\n\u201cSadly, the decision of the ninth National Assembly has threatened the achievement of adequate women representation in governance, as they have outrightly demonstrated by their votes, that they do not want women inclusion in decision making.\n\n\u201cIf, in 2022, we still have to argue for or against the pivotal role of women in governance, it means our leaders are deliberately resistant to change and still have a lot of learning to do.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge the leadership of the National Assembly of Nigeria to have the Gender Bills re-presented and re-considered. This is the only way to address the current gender imbalance across the legislative arms of governments and across the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s National Gender Policy states that gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment are basic human rights that lie at the heart of equitable development and the country is a signatory to international and regional frameworks such as the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights with the Optional Protocol on Women\u2019s Rights.\n\n\u201cThus, Nigeria needs to live up to her commitment to 35 per cent Affirmative Action on women inclusion across all arms of governance. Upholding this will also increase the country\u2019s credibility in the international community.\n\n\u201cAn inclusive governance is only possible when women sit at the decision-making tables, contribute to planning and national development to find solutions to the many problems plaguing the nation such as climate change and insecurity. No nation can progress with over 50 per cent of its population excluded from contributing to its development. Failure to recognise this is simply planning to fail from the beginning.\u201d\n\nActionAid saluted Nigerian women for their strength and courage.\n\nLCCI Salutes Nigerian Women\n\nLagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) congratulated women all over the world on this year\u2019s IWD. According to the chamber, the theme of this year\u2019s edition, provides us an opportunity to join voices with people around the world and shout the message for equal rights.\n\nIt noted that this year\u2019s theme was all about recognising and amplifying the important role women and girls around the world played in addressing climate change for a more sustainable future.\n\nLCCI stated, \u201cBeyond the speeches and celebrations that mark the annual International Women\u2019s Day, we use this medium to call for critical policy and social reforms that put gender equality and sustainability at the centre of governance, politics, and international affairs.\n\n\u201cWomen should be given equal access to resources for them to add more value to society. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) revealed that if women farmers had equal access to productive resources, their farm yields would increase by 20 to 30 per cent.\n\n\u201cThis could provide enough food to keep 100 to 150 million people from hunger and thereby reducing global hunger to 17 per cent.\u201d\n\nIt noted that in line with global trend, Nigerian women constituted nearly half of the population of the country. \u201cBut despite the major roles they play with their population size, women roles in the society are yet to be given the recognition they deserve.\n\n\u201cThis is due to some cultural stereotypes, abuse of religion, traditional practices, and patriarchal societal structures. In Nigeria, about 51 percent of women are involved in voting during elections.\n\n\u201cDespite this, women are still under-represented in both elective and appointive positions. The extant National Gender Policy (NGP) recommended 35 per cent affirmative action and sought for a more inclusive representation of women with at least 35 per cent of both elective political and appointive public service positions.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll Expand Women\u2019s Political Fortunes as APC National Chairman, Says Al-Makura\n\nAs the world commemorates this year\u2019s IWD, an aspirant for the position of National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Tanko Al-Makura, has promised to expand the political fortunes of women if elected national chairman of the party.\n\nAl-Makura, in a statement yesterday, lamented that Nigerian women were yet to get opportunities in governance commensurate with their contributions to the nation\u2019s development.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is a fact that no party, no people, and no nation can attain its goals without giving women their deserved place as a key demographic and agents of change.\n\n\u201cThey are the political mobilisers, they constitute a large chunk of the voting population, and have acquitted themselves most creditably in the positions of authority and trust. They therefore deserve better.\n\n\u201cThat is why we have it on top of our agenda to ensure that women take their rightful place in the scheme of things both within the APC and in the governance structures of the country as we will lobby the leaders of the party \u2013 the president, governors, lawmakers, ministers, among others \u2013 to ensure greater women representation across board.\u201d\n\nAl-Makura recalled that when he was governor of Nasarawa State, he appointed five women as commissioners, adding that his administration also appointed a female Secretary to the State Government.\n\nHe said mainstreaming of Nigerian women, especially the APC women, in both party and governance was a key part of his agenda for the party if elected National Chairman.\n\nLAPO Gives Award to Six Outstanding Women for Leadership Skills\n\nSix women bagged the Outstanding Women Leadership Award (LOWLA) organised by the Lift Above Poverty Organisation (LAPO) at a ceremony held in Benin City, Edo State capital, on Tuesday.\n\nThe awardees, which were adjudged to have done well in business, professional and agriculture, are Mary Ike-Chukwu, Martina Onah, Nwanta Nwakaego, Hajia Amina Mohammed, Olamide Akinnayajo and Hajia Hassana Haladu.\n\nChief Executive Officer, Lift Above Poverty Organization (LAPO),, Dr Godwin Ehigiamusoe said the award which was initiated in 2013, demonstrates the organisation\u2019s commitment to women empowerment.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe award reinforces the positive image of women in Nigeria and helps in reducing the influence of negative attitudes and practices that discriminate against and exclude women in all facets of life.\n\n\u201cI congratulate the recipients and I must say that the latest winners bring the number of LOWLA beneficiaries from inception to 27.\n\n\u201cLAPO as a pro-poor and woman-focused organisation has over the years supported women\u2019s right, socio-economic empowerment and elimination of all forms of violence against them through policy advocacy, health and social intervention programmes.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the awardees, Akinnayajo expressed happiness over the award and the N300, 000 attached to it.\n\nShe also noted that LAPO had been instrumental to the rise of their businesses and urged the organisation to do more for women.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022NBS Understates Economy by 25%, Says PwC Economist\n\nDike Onwuamaeze\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coronation Merchant Bank (CMB) has projected that the federal government\u2019s domestic borrowings in 2022 would exceed N2.6 trillion while estimating that inflation and GDP growth rates would be 13.88 per cent and 2.6 per cent respectively this year.\n\nThe CMB added that the country might experience weak portfolio investment inflows due to negative real interest rates as the headline inflation rate remained in double digits.\n\nThese predictions were contained in its Economic Review and 2022 Outlook titled \u201cBlend of Optimism and Uncertainty,\u201d which was released yesterday during a virtual CMB 4th edition of its Interactive Session Series themed \u201cNigeria\u2019s Economic Landscape \u2013 a Blend of Optimism and Uncertainty.\u201d\n\nThe CMB said: \u201cGiven the current elevated oil price, compared with the oil price benchmark in the 2022 budget, there might be room for the FGN to source funds for fuel subsidy from its windfall/savings. Overall, we expect the budget deficit this year to be higher than the current projection and that domestic borrowing could exceed N2.6 trillion. This implies upward pressure on FGN bonds and NTB yields.\n\n\u201cFor 2022, we expect the impact of positive base effects on the headline inflation rate to wither away by the second quarter of the year. Looking ahead, on the back of specific factors which could result in upward pressure on prices, we have imposed visible fluctuations in the m/m inflation rate using a few assumptions. These include insecurity, modest exchange rate depreciation, hike in electricity prices, electioneering and the possible N10 per litre excise duty imposed on non-alcoholic carbonated and sweetened beverages. We see average inflation for FY 2022 at 13.88 per cent y/y and at 13.91 per cent y/y at end-December 2022.\u201d\n\nThe report further stated that the steady financial injections/interventions into selected sectors like agriculture by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) have assisted to keep economic activities afloat within these sectors and observed that the \u201clarge informal economy is one reason for the misalignment between the growth figures recorded in these sectors and intervention efforts.\n\n\u201cWe expect some fiscal stimulus on the back of FGN\u2019s capital expenses. Furthermore, we anticipate investment spending in targeted sectors. We are optimistic about the implementation of the PIA, which should improve revenue collection and could boost investor appetite.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, overall pre-election expenditure towards the 2023 general elections should also contribute to the growth drive. For 2022, we expect a GDP growth of 2.6 per cent y/y.\u201d\n\nDelivering a welcome remarks yesterday during the unveiling of the report, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of CMB, Mr. Banjo Adegbohungbe, stated that \u201cthere are a number of factors, both positive and negative that are expected to influence the macroeconomic landscape in 2022. The lessons learnt on resilience as Nigeria embarked on a recovery path in 2021 will be critical in shaping the business and macroeconomic environment this year\n\nThe event, which was held virtually, featured expert speakers such as Founder and Chief Consultant of B. Adedipe Associates, Dr. Biodun Adedipe; Advisory Partner/Chief Economist at PwC Nigeria, Dr. Andrew S. Nevin; Chief Economist at Coronation Merchant Bank, Ms. Chinwe Egwim, and Chief Economist at the Development Bank of Nigeria, Professor Joseph Nnanna,.\n\nEgwim, who delivered the macroeconomic presentation, said: \u201cLooking ahead, on the back of specific factors, we expect upward pressure on prices. Overall, consumption patterns are relatively better and are almost mirroring pre-pandemic levels. However, we must note that consumer pockets are still steadily being rebuilt.\u201d\n\nHowever, Nevin expressed optimism for 2022 added that the National Bureau of Stattistics (NBS) underestimated the volume of Nigerian economy by 25 per cent.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe (Nigeria) have a bigger economy and more economic activities than we think. The official number from NBS is about N20 trillion in the fourth quarter which understates the economy perhaps as much as 25 per cent. We also have a smaller population than estimated, so we are actually richer than we think.\u201d\n\nSpeaking during the virtual event, Adedipe noted that, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen the pattern in the last 10 years of non-oil sectors accounting for between 77 per cent and 82 per cent in terms of contribution to our GDP, while the oil sector has repeatedly accounted for less than 10 per cent. It is now obvious that what drives the economy is the non-oil sector and that is where we will have to pay a lot of attention. Looking at this in the context of where we are, I see an economy that will grow very strongly, and I expect growth to be sustained this year.\u201d\n\nIn his comment, Nnanna added that \u201ctaking a look at the diversification strategy, we need as a country to restructure the economy, moving from the factors of production within and across different sectors towards high productivity so that diversification can be achieved through encouraging private investments, foreign investments, improving infrastructure and so on.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Why e-commerce is king in Egypt",
          "text": "When Syrian entrepreneur Ronaldo Mouchawar founded Souq.com in 2005, buying things by clicking a picture on a clunky computer was unheard of in the Middle East. Somehow, Souq managed to quickly become the leading online retailer in the Middle East. And in 2017, twelve years after it launched, Amazon bought it for $580 million to expand operations in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nToday Egyptian sales make up more than half of Souq\u2019s revenues.\n\nSouq\u2019s $580 million buyout underscored Amazon\u2019s online retail expectations in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, where e-commerce continues to grow at 25% every year. Bain and Company say the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and Egypt, with its 103+ million residents, make up roughly 80% of the e-commerce market in the MENA region.\n\nFurthermore, a Disrupt Africa report released in January shows that 20% of Egyptian startups are decidedly pursuing opportunities in the e-commerce and retail-tech space. That is roughly two times the number of fintech startups operating in the country and a sharp contrast to the rest of the continent\u2019s startup profile. Last year, Egyptian e-commerce startups received USD$ 131.27 million; according to Africa: The Big Deal, which is 1.4 times the e-commerce funding Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa received in the same period.\n\nClearly, retail tech and e-commerce rule Egypt\u2019s tech scene; and this is why.\n\nGovernment policy is pushing informal SME retail online.\n\nFacing a budget deficit of $27.8 billion in May 2018, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi offered five-year tax exemptions while urging informal workers to legalise their status. The government had hoped to raise an additional $51.9 billion in taxes from the informal sector. At a parliamentary session, Mohamed Badrawi, a member of the Economic Affairs Committee, declared that \u201cIncorporating all these economic activities into the formal sector is becoming an urgent matter.\u201d\n\nThe informal sector in Egypt accounts for more than half of Egypt\u2019s economy. In 2020, the government issued a new law that offered incentives for small businesses to incorporate as formal entities. Beyond creating incentives for informal traders to formalise operations, Egypt\u2019s Central Bank imposed daily limits on cash deposits and withdrawals while asking banks to remove similar daily limits on digital transactions. The bank says this will help support financial inclusion goals. In reality, however, this push saw informal traders who generate bulk sales in cash struggle to deposit and withdraw cash, as a result, pushing them to formalise their businesses. When these traders incorporate and begin to accept digital transactions, it also makes sense to take their business online.\n\nA market scene in Cairo. Egypt\u2019s informal economy constitutes up to 50% of the country\u2019s GDP, provides more than 60% of new jobs and is growing by 1% every year.\n\nPhoto: Alex Azabache/Unsplash\n\nThe functioning belief on the part of the government was that e-commerce would aid a transition away from cash dependency, which will, in turn, reduce the size of the informal sector and increase tax revenue.\n\nCovid-related restrictions accelerated consumer trust in digital commerce channels.\n\nThe social and economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation globally. Egypt was not an exception.\n\nDespite the government\u2019s best-strong-armed efforts (it mandated the use of cashless systems to pay for government services and imposed fines on defaulters), Egyptian shoppers remained reluctant to use digital channels for shopping or payments \u2013 until the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThis was also partly driven by the reforms mentioned earlier which the Egyptian government used to encourage informal retailers to formalise their operations. At the time, Egypt\u2019s Central Bank waived several bank transaction fees for 6 months which it later extended to the middle of 2021. As a result, despite predictions about slowing digital commerce growth in Egypt, Jumia and Noon reported a 940% increase in online sales as the pandemic hit. 72% of participants in a Mastercard survey claimed to have shopped online during the pandemic.\n\nThe trend appears to have sustained beyond COVID-19 as more people than ever use smartphones to access services. Today Egyptian e-commerce is expected to grow at least 30% this year, buoyed by younger shoppers and rising incomes from Egypt\u2019s expanding middle class.\n\nGood infrastructure is good business.\n\nAn omnibus whizzes past in Alexandria, Egypt. 74% of Egypt\u2019s 65,050km road network are paved more than double the continental average.\n\nPhoto: Fady Fouad/Unsplash\n\nAs e-commerce accelerated in Egypt, it created a ripple effect on the logistics sector. People who buy things online need to get their goods delivered somehow. While infrastructure in Egypt is not the best globally, Egyptian infrastructure is second only to that of the island nation of Seychelles on the Africa Infrastructure Development Index (AIDI).\n\nA combination of a reasonably good road network and increased investment in transport and telecoms infrastructure is proving beneficial to the handful of logistics-tech startups that are helping to make shopping online easier.\n\nStill, as with online retail anywhere, last-mile logistics remains an issue. According to Waya Media, 40% of online orders in Egypt do not reach their customers the first time they are shipped. So while Egypt\u2019s 4000 post offices make up the backbone of its distribution network, a good number of online retailers who need to deliver items to their customers\u2019 doorsteps partner with full-service logistics companies or use smaller specialized delivery units that stitch together end-to-end services to patch delivery gaps.\n\nAggressive infrastructure investments by the Egyptian government has seen it rise to second place, only behind Seychelles on the African Infrastructure Development Index (AIDI).\n\nSource: Open Data for Africa\n\nOther startups like Appetito are pioneering franchised pickup centres similar to what Getir does in Europe to bring grocery deliveries closer to their customers. More prominent players like Amazon opened a 28,000 square meter warehouse in the 10th of Ramadan City in August last year. The new hub and 15 delivery stations across Cairo, Alexandria, Tanta, Ismailia, and Assiut are part of Amazon\u2019s growing MENA distribution network.\n\nEgypt\u2019s last-mile delivery startups are the API connectors in a very fragmented supply chain. Image source: Wamda.\n\n\u201c[BNPL will] accelerate moving from cash-on-delivery to paying by cards\u201d \u2013 Sherif Nessim, Founding General Partner, Jedar Capital\n\nThe e-commerce boom is also creating ripple effects for fintech in Egypt. While cash-on-delivery is very much alive, the value of card transactions is growing at an impressive pace. The Egyptian central bank is playing a leading role in facilitating this shift. For example, it allows banks operating in the Egyptian market to own unlimited shares in payment service providers and payment systems operators as part of the country\u2019s push towards cashless payments.\n\nSherif Nessim, Founding General Partner at Jedar Capital, believes that Buy Now Pay Later offerings can help accelerate the transition to digital payments. \u201cEvery year, we find that the balance is moving from cash-on-delivery to cards, cash to cards. People are putting more trust in online payment methods,\u201d BNPL solutions, he adds, \u201c[will] accelerate moving from cash-on-delivery to paying by cards because if I pay with this credit card, I can pay in 6 months, interest-free.\u201d When you think about it, it makes sense for a market where younger and relatively more impulsive shoppers are the drivers of e-commerce growth.\n\nAccording to Nessim, all of these plays are part of why he expects growth to continue for traditional e-commerce and q-commerce companies.\n\nAttractive growth prospects lure VC money.\n\n2021 was a record-setting year for venture-backed companies globally. Venture capitalists invested more than USD$ 675 billion into startups globally, and Africa outdid its 2019 record with more than $5 billion invested in African startups. Venture funds were themselves swamped with cash, partly a fall out of fiscal (stimulus) policies for the pandemic and partly as a result of more people being willing to bet on risky \u201ccompanies of the future\u201d than ever before.\n\nAll of this activity has set the perfect stage for venture capital funds in Egypt. Last year and led by funding into e-commerce and retail tech companies, Egyptian startups raised $403.5 million, according to data from Disrupt Africa.\n\nWith more cash to spend, investor packs are hunting for growth and returns in emerging and frontier markets. Post-revolution Egypt happens to be one of the latest such frontier markets. Naturally, investors have their eyes on it. \u201cThey realise that the next ten years are the years for emerging and frontier markets,\u201d Sherif Nessim says. He adds that some VC firms he knows are creating dedicated funds \u201cthat only invest in emerging markets rather than invest out of their global funds.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, like Amazon and Souq illustrate, bigger growth-hungry companies in the United States and Europe prefer to acquire local companies in emerging markets instead of building from scratch.\n\nEgypt\u2019s unique combination of growing venture capital interest, growth prospects, and a government determined to shore up revenues by including more informal businesses means digital commerce will continue to grow as more retailers become formal and come online. At the same time, it also signals significant growth prospects for affordable business-to-business software and services to help these newly formal businesses manage their processes and access credit.\n\nCritics have slammed MENA investors for mostly backing e-commerce and marketplace startups. However, by helping buying and selling thrive online, those investments may be responsible for accelerating digital adoption in other areas in a region as conservative as the MENA. After all, since commerce is the backbone of the world\u2019s economic systems, it only makes sense for the digital version of the bazaars and souks that line Egyptian streets to lead the way for her technology ecosystem.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Fintech innovations on the rise in DR Congo\u2019s nascent startup landscape",
          "text": "As with most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, access to basic financial services is significantly limited in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Just 14% of the population have an actual bank account and only 25% have an account with either banking or any other financial institution.\n\nMore so, there is less than 35 kilometre of paved road for every 1 million inhabitants in the French-speaking country, making traditional branch-based banking unfeasible for most of its 90 million residents and the bid for financial inclusion arduous.\n\nThe digital finance revolution that\u2019s played out in the rest of Africa over the past decade thus cannot come soon enough for people in the central African nation, especially given it has a 47% mobile phone penetration rate, with the figure likely to grow further.\n\nA number of startups have sprung up over the past 5 years, which, through fintech innovations, have brought financial services closer to where people live and work. One such is Flash International, the largest fintech and payments aggregator in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlash operates a network of agents that allows people to do their banking on its mobile platform (FlashApp), putting financial services\u2014including remittance, payments, and other value-added services\u2014within easy reach.\n\nThe startup currently has roughly 3,500 agents and 90 branches, through which it serves more than 2 million customers. And instead of opening individual accounts with multiple banks or mobile money operators, Flash gives its users a card with which they can accept all payments.\n\nChief executive Jonathan Johannesen, whose 25 years of professional experience cuts across roles in financial institutions like Citi and mobile finance firms Moneytrans and TigoCash, started the company in 2018.\n\nSince its launch, Flash has recorded stellar growth and is currently integrated with several banks, mobile money, and telecom operators. It claims to process nearly 1 million transactions valued at over $50 million per month through its payment services and also facilitates more than 40,000 satellite TV subscription transactions, one of its value-added products.\n\nAccording to the CEO, the mission was to build the first Congolese fintech that would aggregate as many financial and value-added services as possible. \u201cWhat we currently have is an application with up to 27 different products and services, through which thousands of agents make a living out of,\u201d Johannesen recalled in a recent interview with TechCabal.\n\nA screenshot of the Flash web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nUnlike Flash, Okapi Finance was launched out of Sweden by founder Gis\u00e8le Mwepu, with DRC being one of the company\u2019s four markets across all the regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The startup rolled out its services in the country last year and currently has 170,000 customers. Its goal, according to Mwepu, is to reach up to 25 million people in the country in less than 10 years.\n\n\u201cDRC has over 90 million people and still there aren\u2019t many financial services solutions available. The opportunity is very huge. And the unbanked people aren\u2019t just individuals, they can be traders, merchants, or informal employees,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Okapi platform allows both individual and enterprise customers carry out daily financial transactions like deposits, money transfers, and salary disbursements through its web and mobile platforms, USSD, and physical agents.\n\nOkapi has a special focus on getting more women included in the country\u2019s financial services ecosystem. Per Mwepu, up to 80% of the company\u2019s DRC users and 95% of the 17,000 merchants it\u2019s onboarded are women. For the latter, the company extends a line of credit\u2014weekly loans of around $50\u2014to help power their businesses.\n\n\u201cFinancial inclusion cannot be achieved by only allowing people to carry out payment transactions,\u201d Mwepu noted. \u201cWe need to increase their accessibility to a wide array of financial services.\u201d\n\nThrough the Okapi platform, microfinance banks and insurance providers can distribute their products, enabling them penetrate the informal sector and reach the unbanked population. In addition, users don\u2019t need a bank account to access these services and after signing up can apply for the Okapi Visa card.\n\nA screenshot of the Okapi Finance web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nWhereas Flash focuses on urban areas like Kinshasa with most of its agents in DRC\u2019s major cities, Faysal Axam\u2019s startup targets the unbanked population in rural areas, where more than half of the population resides.\n\nIn Goma, the capital and business hub of North Kivu province in the eastern DRC, Faysal Company offers a \u201cTap and Pay\u201d solution\u2014a magnetic card that interacts with POS machines and interfaces with a virtual wallet.\n\n\u201cFinancial flows are mostly in DRC\u2019s urban areas, not so much in peri-urban areas, and nearly not at all in rural areas,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile mobile money penetration rate is 72% in cities, it\u2019s only 28% in rural areas.\u201d\n\nCircumventing fintech challenges in DRC\n\nIn a country like DRC where road and internet infrastructure is below par, agents are especially effective at reaching rural dwellers and reducing deployment costs for providers.\n\nFor customers, agent networks reduce travelling time and security risks as they historically had to locate one of the only 500 bank branches available in the country\u2014which is ironically Africa\u2019s second-largest country by land area and the fourth most populous.\n\n\u201cMost transactions are done over the counter in DRC as there\u2019s still a very low penetration in terms of smartphones and internet access is not affordable. Also, the prevalent habit of the population is mainly to visit an agent for a transaction or service,\u201d Johannesen said.\n\nA high capital barrier for entry in the financial services space preserves the dominance of big banks like Ecobank and UBA as well as network operators (such as Vodacom Congo, Orange RDC, and Bharti Airtel who collectively control 35-40 million subscribers).\n\nFintech startups looking to partner with banks and telcos have had to deal with skepticism and aversion from the industry giants. Axam recalled it took Faysal almost a year and a half to get its first mobile money integration license in 2020 after the startup was rebuffed by banks and local mobile network operators for partnerships.\n\nA screenshot of the Faysal Company web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nMultipay Congo, DRC\u2019s first inter-banking platform, was launched in 2015 to create interoperability between payment platforms like ATMs and point of sale machines.\n\nBut the framework doesn\u2019t make integrating with banks and telcos any easier for fintechs, according to Mwepu. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to achieve financial inclusion without interoperability of solutions from other stakeholders like banks and telcos. We have to work together,\u201d the Okapi Finance founder said.\n\nOn the back of a successful partnership with Orange, Faysal\u2019s customer base has exceeded 10,000. Although that\u2019s a small number, it\u2019s significant nonetheless in a country where more than 70% of the population live on less than $1.90 a day and most have no immediate incentives to open financial accounts.\n\nAxam added that Faysal\u2019s growth is also because the solution can be used offline, even in areas without internet connectivity.\n\nWith internet access at around 17%, feature phones \u2013 which retail at about $20 \u2013 play a huge role in enabling Congolese to access digital finance services. Faysal, for instance, gets most of its traction from the USSD feature as Goma dwellers often must seek a mountaintop just to access 2G cell phone coverage.\n\nIn addition, while banks and telcos boast sufficient financial muscle to build and scale their products, startups lack access to sufficient finance. \u201cWe don\u2019t have finance, investors, incubators, and accelerators, especially in Goma,\u201d Axam said, citing security issues as a challenge that makes it hard for investors to trust the ecosystem. \u201cMany excellent solutions here can\u2019t get continental or international exposure because of this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important, however, to note that the DRC\u2019s fintech landscape is practically nascent with only 12 startups playing in the space as of 2018, per a report from Microsave and MasterCard. But the digital finance seeds are clearly beginning to take root and there are concrete reasons to be bullish about the opportunities in DRC for fintech and its prospect to attract investors.\n\nWith startups like Flash, Okapi, Faysal, alongside remittance fintechs, partnerships like the Mastercard and Billetera deal targeting the millions of financially excluded residents, as well as the government\u2019s increasing shift towards virtual payments for its over thousands of civil servants, one can anticipate a radical digital finance expansion in the coming years as DRC moves to replicate other African countries\u2019 successes, slowly but surely.\n\n\u201cFintechs in DRC are beginning to thrive. It\u2019s definitely promising but a better infrastructural coverage is crucial to realising full potential,\u201d said Noel K. Tshiani founder of Congo Business Network, an international network of Congolese professionals and entrepreneurs. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about the vision of the DRC government under President Felix Tshisekedi and its ambitious digitisation program aligned with the country\u2019s National Digital Plan.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These women are building Africa\u2019s neobank for the supply chain industry",
          "text": "When Nkiru Amadi-Emina and Ijeoma Akwiwu met at a birthday party in Abuja, Nigeria, they knew they\u2019d make good friends; what they didn\u2019t know was, they would make good co-founders as well. But 8 years into their friendship, they have built and run a couple of projects and businesses together and, now, they are focused on building Pivo, a startup they envision will be the neobank for trade in Africa. Like AfreximBank but faster and digitally operated.\n\nThe big picture is to be the go-to neobank for trade in Africa by the end of this year, or next.\n\nPivo entered the market with Pivo Capital, a credit-focused financial services platform for supply chain small and medium businesses (SMEs), because of the co-founders\u2019 track record in the supply chain industry, especially the logistics aspect.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLong before Pivo, Amadi-Emina, a software engineer, worked as a tech consultant for Nigeria\u2019s electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), for over 2 years. She left INEC in 2017 to found her first startup Jalo, a venture-backed on-demand delivery company that focused on Nigeria\u2019s North-Central market and served e-commerce platforms like Jumia and Konga in that region.\n\nIn August 2018, Amadi-Emina joined Kobo360 after the logistic startup acquired Jalo in an acquihire deal. She remained at Kobo360 for a little over 3 years before leaving last year to focus on Pivo.\n\nFor Akwiwu, a trained lawyer who claimed to have stumbled on tech by chance and the influence of friends like Amadi-Emina, her law career, which started officially in 2013, spanned across law firms and companies like Gilmor Engineering, one of the biggest engineering firms in Nigeria, where she worked for over 6 years.\n\nBut, along the line, she started playing with project and product management and operations, monitoring projects, and product development lifecycles on the side. Last year, she decided to transition fully into tech. She left law to focus on building Pivo and getting a master\u2019s degree in software development while at it.\n\nWith Amadi-Emina\u2019s experience in the logistics side of the supply chain, having worked and led the port operation effort at Kobo360, Akwiwu\u2019s experience in law, and their collective knowledge of running an exportation business, building a business that serves the logistics arm of the supply chain was a no-brainer.\n\nLogistics supply chain is Pivo\u2019s first stop\n\nIn Africa, access to credit is still one of the biggest challenges small businesses deal with, especially small supply chain businesses. Supply chain businesses usually have a short time to execute a contract, and due to the excessive bureaucracy and numerous requirements, acquiring credit from traditional financial institutions takes a long time, therefore these businesses are automatically at a disadvantage.\n\nThis is where Pivo comes in.\n\nA truck loading at the port. Image source: Lori\n\nLaunched in September last year, Pivo provides flexible and quick financing options for supply chain businesses like logistics service providers, clearing and forwarding businesses, and FMCG distributors. Pivo is like a third-party partner in a transaction between a buyer and a seller. But to understand what Pivo does, one must first understand how supply chain financing works.\n\nSupply chain finance is a type of cash advance suppliers receive from lenders to fulfill a transaction or contract before the buyer pays them.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: a merchant wants to supply a buyer with goods but needs some working capital to see the transaction through before the buyer pays them. So the merchant approaches the lender (that would be Pivo, in this case) for a credit. The lender then collects all required information to check for the legitimacy of their transaction or contract claim with the buyer, then disburses the credit once the buyer confirms the contract.\n\nThe above illustration explains Pivo at its core. Once a business finishes their KYC and asks for credit, Pivo prompts them to supply all the information about the transaction they need financing for. After that, Pivo profiles the business seeking credit for worthiness, runs a risk assessment on the transaction, and then profiles the businesses they are doing the transaction with, to ascertain whether they are credible and good for the money.\n\nOnce everything checks out and the buyer agrees to pay into the supplier\u2019s Pivo account, Pivo then disburses the loan. In partnership with Providus Bank, Pivo provides its customers with a business account that facilitates remittance. So, after the money lands in the supplier\u2019s Pivo account, the startup takes its dues.\n\nAll these checks and assessments help Pivo to finance only creditworthy customers and less-risky transactions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to ensure 98% recovery on every single capital we deploy to our customers,\u201d Amadi-Emina told TechCabal.\n\nAmadi-Emina also mentioned that the average capital requests they\u2019ve received per customer is about $10,000. And while they cater for credits within the range of $5,000 from the company\u2019s balance sheet, requests above $5,000 are passed to their credit partners.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nFor now, the startup is still building in a stealth mode and according to the CEO Amadi-Emina, Pivo currently has about 250 direct SMEs customers and 5 ecosystem leads, which are the larger corporations that Pivo serve the SMEs within their value chain through embedded finance. Each ecosystem lead is reported to have about 500 to 1,000 SMEs.\n\nThe startup lists some of the top logistic companies in Africa as its ecosystem lead customers including Jetstream Africa, SabiRoad, Vee Logistics, and MVx.\n\nOn the side of its loan book, the co-founders said they have disbursed $1 million worth of credit out of over $2 million worth of applications that they have received since launch.\n\nThe company makes money from the interest charged on the credit disbursed, management fees, and the one-off charges from account creation. Akwiwu believes that as they continue to add more offerings, they will have more sources of revenue.\n\nThe startup has also raised a 6-figure preseed from Microtraction, FirstCheck Africa, Ventures Platform, Mercy Corps Venture, Rally Cap Ventures, Metis Capital Partner, Bold Angel Fund, and recently just got into the ODX accelerator programme where it\u2019s entitled to $125,000 for a 7% equity stake.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nFor Akwiwu and Amadi-Emma, the roadmap is clear and they already have new products that will help them become a full-fledged neobank for trade in the works. For example, products like Invoice Factoring and Pivo Plus, which includes insurance and corporate compliance offerings, are already in the testing phase.\n\nThe company is currently only operational in Nigeria with the plan to expand into Ghana before the end of the year.\n\nThe competition in the credit market in Africa is heating up and it\u2019s good for SMEs. While there are new upstarts springing up to provide credit for businesses, the bigger ones are also making a fray into the scene. For instance, Flutterwave, the unicorn fintech, has joined the credit space with the recent announcement of Flutterwave Capital.\n\nWhile other startups like Payhippo, Lendigo, Float, and even Brass have successfully built a digital financial institution that provides credit for African SMEs, Pivo is the only one playing strictly in the supply chain sector, at least that we know of at the moment.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The total worth of disbursed credit has been changed from $980,000 to $1 million. Between the time we interviewed the founders and the date this article was published, Pivo disbursed another $20,000 in credit.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Togolese inventor builds $12,000 mini tractors for the West African market",
          "text": "First, he received awards for inventing the \u201cFoufoumix\u201d, which brings relief from hours spent pounding foufou. Then, Minsob Logou invented a mini-tractor, tailor-made for local conditions. Now, he wants to sell it across the region.\n\nThis article was contributed to TechCabal by Blame Ekoue of bird story agency.\n\nSeeing imported agricultural machinery \u2013 often paid for by government or donors \u2013 lying discarded due to the unavailability of local servicing or parts was enough for Minsob Logou to invest his time, money, and energy into a local solution for farmers. The result: the Logoutrac mini-tractor. It\u2019s a step out of the kitchen and into the field for this award-winning Togolese inventor.\n\nBetter known in Togo and the region as the \u201cfather of Foufoumix\u201d Logou requires little introduction to those who keep an eye on the world of African invention. As early as 2002, Logou was honoured for his work by the World Intellectual Property Organisation and in 2014, he placed second at the African Innovation Awards. His desire to invent is deep-seated.\n\n\u201cThe story started from a passion that I had from an early age for all things related to technology. Since the benches of the school, I had this thing in me for all that is technological. I have to try to see how they were designed, how we arrive at what we design can respond to a given functionality. This is what gave me all this knowledge today, which far exceeds what I learned on the benches,\u201d Logou explained.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBorn into a large family, his position as an engineer at Togo Telecom, though coveted, was not enough to stop the inventor from resigning to devote himself to finding solutions full time. His first big win came with an invention that allows cooks at home and in restaurants to replace hours of strenuous work \u2013 the Foufoumix. The industrial-looking kitchen unit has been a hit in West Africa to such an extent that knock-offs are now produced in China. Logou tries to provide local solutions to local problems.\n\n\u201cThe basis of my research to be able to create a product is the observation of my community. When I see that they are in need of something, I can create machinery to make it easier for them to obtain a result in order to improve performance and make their lives better,\u201d he said.\n\nThat was the thinking behind his latest invention, launched recently at his small factory located on the outskirts of the Togolese capital, Lom\u00e9. Logou describes his mini-tractor \u2013 which sports the \u201cLogoutrac\u201d brand \u2013 as a \u2018made-in-Togo mini-tractor, a versatile, powerful, and resilient machine\u2019.\n\nThe prototype for the tractor, which retails for the local equivalent of $12,000, was built using salvaged parts, with the idea that doing so would help buyers easily access spare parts. But due to high initial demand, the young Togolese engineer quickly took the next step.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay in recovery or recycling anymore and I am now manufacturing some of the spare parts of this machinery myself,\u201d he explained.\n\nLogou said that the initial idea for the mini-tractor came from his frustration at seeing the vast amounts of money that are used to purchase foreign agricultural machinery, only for it to be abandoned because spare parts are too difficult to too expensive to purchase locally.\n\n\u201cThe solutions that we import from elsewhere, most of the time, fail to meet our needs. So we end up with problems in agricultural mechanisation. Big tractors don\u2019t last long in the field before they break down. And when they stall, first, the expertise to detect the breakdown is a problem and the same spare part must be ordered from the parent company, which is quite complicated,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThe $12,000-mini tractors built by Minsob Logou. Image credit: bird story agency.\n\nSelling at 7 million FCFA (the equivalent of around $12,000), the mini-tractors are built for a regional market as well as a local one. That is why Lougou is looking carefully at the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) to which Togo is a signatory \u2013 and which should help him sell his inventions across Africa. Currently, there are trade barriers in place which prevent significant exports.\n\n\u201cPeople are showing interest but so far, there has been no international export. We should do it but the problem is free trade between African countries,\u201d fumed Logou.\n\nCurrently, Logoutrac equipment is sold by agricultural groups and the Togolese Ministry of Agriculture. A lower-cost option is already in the works.\n\n\u201cSince the cost is not within the reach of all farmers, we are working on a tiller for those who cannot afford it,\u201d Lougou explained.\n\nLogou\u2019s other pet project is finding solutions to a far wider problem: counterfeiting. While counterfeiting is estimated at 10% worldwide, it reaches 30 to 80% of products sold in Africa, depending on the sector. He has good reason to want to bring an end to counterfeits, especially of his Foufoumix product.\n\n\u201cThere are Chinese choppers that our compatriots import to sell and announce that it is foufoumix, but the latter is a registered trademark which has a patent\u2026 Having had trials in this direction, the conclusion that I have drawn is that our justices in West Africa are not strong enough in the field of intellectual property. There is still a lot to be done,\u201d he says, adding that he has brought counterfeiters to justice but nothing has come out of it.\n\nTo deal with this problem, he prefers to focus instead on the quality of his products.\n\n\u201cThe struggle is to have quality products,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly.

          "title": "How no-code tools helped two UNILAG graduates build omni-channel messaging platform, Ozi",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Adejumo Azeez and Israel Akpan first built Ozi in 2019, there were many things they didn\u2019t consider would be big problems; one of them was finding a good developer to build a product.\n\nBut after spending March through May 2021 trying to find one to build their product, they decided it was time to find a different solution. Azeez had heard of no-code tools, and they decided to research whether it would be a good fit.\n\nWithin a week, the verdict was in. Like bloodhounds, they picked up the trail to a helpful solution. They found no-code tools like Bubble, Airtable, Adalo, Webflow, Zapier and more. By August 2021, Akpan and Azeez had launched the beta version of Ozi, testing it on their eight loyal customers.\n\nA welcome surprise for someone with a previously condescending view of all things no-code.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey made everything easy so anyone with zero knowledge can use it. Before I dived into building anything with them, I was looking down on them, saying you can\u2019t achieve anything with them because they will just give you templates to develop stuff with. But you can achieve complex workflows; you can connect with APIs,\u201d Azeez said.\n\nThe making of Ozi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsteam on pot in kitchen\n\nPeople take different roads to entrepreneurship, but for Azeez and Akpan, it began in the University of Lagos (UNILAG) in 2017 and with a platform called Lagviews.\n\nLagviews was a platform the duo ran as a directory to help students find \u201centrepreneurs on campus.\u201d They built the website using low-code tool, WordPress but soon discovered a glitch in their plan. People would rather contact them on WhatsApp than use the website.\n\nSoon, they pretty much conducted all their business on the messaging platform and turned into a WhatsApp TV, helping businesses advertise on their statuses for \u20a6500 or \u20a61,000. But they couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\nThey had classes and could not always respond to enquiries, so they decided to create a chatbot. A stroke of genius \u2014 or luck \u2014 that led to the first client of what would eventually become Ozi.\n\n\u201cWhen we did it, we got a contact from a church. They saw the chatbot, and they liked it. The church was Joshuaville, the youth church of the City of David. They asked if we could do this chatbot for them, and we said sure, we could do it. We did it for the church, and they liked it.\n\n\u201cBut it got to where, apart from the chatbot, they also wanted to push out their messages to their members. They asked if we could do bulk messages for the platform instead of just chatbot. So, it took us a few tries. I got a few of my friends in the computer sciences department, and we came up with a solution that could also help the church send bulk messages to their people.\u201d\n\nThe solution: the church sends the numbers to them, and they manually send all the messages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the rest is history, or should we say \u201cjust the beginning.\u201d\n\nMore roadblocks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith one customer, things were pretty straightforward. Send broadcast messages and respond to any enquiries with a chatbot. They basically acted as an agent for the church, but for its WhatsApp needs.\n\nBut from one, it grew to eight, based on referrals and a little word of mouth. And with more customers came more responsibilities and complexities.\n\nThey landed a contract with The Elevation Church, and a referral by the church led them to work with Lekki County Homes.\n\nCustomers wanted to find out whether contacts were going to be sold or compromised, and so, they had to sign non-disclosure agreements. But this solution could not become a one-size-fits-all, and they lost potential customers. And so began the search for developers and the journey to no-code.\n\nWhat does Ozi do?\n\nOzi is best described as a Communications as a Service product.\n\nSelf-styled Ozi, the first WhatsApp automation platform in Nigeria, helps users automate their messages on several messaging platforms. You can send and schedule campaigns, appoint agents to reply to messages, create your chatbot, and create mailing lists or groups to send newsletters to on your messaging platforms, among other things.\n\nYou also get delivery reports to measure conversion rates.\n\nSign up is pretty seamless and involves entering your email and password or connecting using Facebook or Google. You then go to a page to fill in your number before preceding to your dashboard.\n\nCurrently, you can connect your WhatsApp account on your dashboard, but according to Azeez, other messaging platforms like Telegram and Instagram are only done on request.\n\nAs part of the company\u2019s nod to data privacy complaints by customers, it has a privacy policy and is working to become fully NDPR compliant by the end of March 2022.\n\nWhy WhatsApp?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game plan, Azeez told me, is to become the number one platform people think of for their business messaging needs on WhatsApp.\n\n\u201cWe have a future target that we are trying to drive the products towards. We are trying to create a product that does customer relations for businesses, and that\u2019s where we are building the product towards \u2014 a CRM for messaging apps.\u201d\n\nUnlike competitors like Termii and Sendchamp, which focus on unified communications via channels like SMS, email, and other messaging platforms, Ozi has doubled down on its WhatsApp strategy.\n\nThe reason? Open rates.\n\nAccording to Mailchimp, the average open rate for all industries using email is 21.33%. Azeez promises a 98% open rate on WhatsApp using Ozi.\n\nThe other reason is to save costs for businesses.\n\n\u201cWe understand the problem, and it\u2019s helping people save the cost of SMS. SMS is expensive, and people communicate more on messaging apps, so they don\u2019t have to spend on airtime.\n\n\u201cIf people reach their audience, their customers at large, in bulk, via WhatsApp, it\u2019s going to save them money. And it\u2019s also going to save time because of the automation we have.\u201d\n\nFor context, the cost of sending bulk messages via SMS varies. Some platforms cost \u20a61.99 per unit, while others cost \u20a61.90. To send messages to 2,000 contacts at \u20a61.90 per unit, you\u2019ll spend \u20a63,800. If you send messages at least four times a week, that equates to \u20a660,800.\n\nOn Ozi, to send messages to a maximum of 5,000 contacts, you\u2019ll spend \u20a620,000 a month, while sending to 10,000 numbers will cost you \u20a630,000. All of this comes with agents, chatbots, and other add-ons.\n\nYou also have the option to use the pay-as-you-go service at \u20a60.50k per message and fewer add-ons.\n\nAnd then, there is the argument of higher open rates leading to more conversion.\n\nBut a focus on WhatsApp alienates potential customers for other services like email and SMS.\n\n\u201cWe even had a disagreement with one of our customers who was like, \u201870% of my members are not on WhatsApp.\u2019 I was like it was not possible. He was not even saying 30%. While I know everyone is not on WhatsApp, more people are using WhatsApp these days.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, according to Statista, WhatsApp\u2019s user base in Nigeria was approximately 4.03 million users and was projected to reach 8.13 million users by 2025.\n\nBut Azeez says this is part of a strategy: corner the WhatsApp market first and introduce other channels later. A very interesting gamble.\n\nWhat makes Ozi different?\n\nThe answer: the ability to send bulk WhatsApp messages\n\n\u201cWhat makes our product stand out is that if you use Termii, for instance, and you want to connect messaging channels like WhatsApp and Facebook, you have to go through WhatsApp\u2019s API.\n\n\u201cSo basically, you go to Termii, and you sign up on their website, then if you want to add your WhatsApp messaging channel, you apply for it. Termii then forwards your application to WhatsApp for approval. But with us, you don\u2019t need all that.\u201d\n\nAzeez says this makes the process cumbersome and prevents users from sending bulk messages. Usually, users can send broadcast messages, but that has a limit of 256 contacts.\n\nThe team found a way to bypass this using a chatbot that essentially copies and pastes the message to each contact. To send messages to 900 contacts takes an hour.\n\nPossible policy questions\n\nIn 2019, WhatsApp introduced a policy that prevents the unauthorised use of automated or bulk messaging. The rationale was to prevent users from getting unwanted messages from strangers and encouraged them to report and block such numbers.\n\nIt also threatened legal action against persons or businesses who violated this policy.\n\nAccording to Azeez, Ozi frowns on spamming and rarely allows marketers to use the platform. He also said that the way the product is set up \u2014 a chatbot copying and pasting the messages \u2014 prevents it from facing trouble with the messaging app.\n\nHowever, according to WhatsApp\u2019s white paper, it has ways of determining automation, like the \u201ctyping\u2026\u201d signal it shows whenever a human is typing. It says bots cannot do this. But this white paper is four years old, and thse company might have improved its programming.\n\nIt, however, raises a red flag as to how well this policy is being implemented.\n\nBecoming no-code advocates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I spoke to Azeez, his infectious enthusiasm for no-code was on full display.\n\nNo-code tools allow anyone to build web and mobile apps without writing a line of code. To Akpan and Azeez, economics graduates with very little knowledge of programming languages, this was a godsend.\n\nAzeez plans to set up a no-code platform to propagate the gospel of no-code and train no-code professionals to meet the rising global need for their services.\n\n\u201cThere are people looking for no-code talents. I feel that for people who are already using Adsense or WordPress, no-code is what they should go to next because the market is big.\u201d\n\nHe also advises entrepreneurs to go the route of no-code to validate their ideas and ensure there\u2019s a market before rushing to build with code.\n\n\u201cFor starting up, go through no-code. You\u2019ll use it to learn about what your product needs before you invest in actual coding to develop your products.\u201d\n\nBut he also cautions on the cost of no-code. While there are free plans, you would need to pay for more storage as the platform grows; this phenomenon is not uncommon as low-code platforms like WordPress work similarly.\n\nOn Bubble, a personal plan costs $25 per month and comes with 10GB of space, a custom domain, email support, etc. A professional plan costs $115 per month, with more space and other add-ons. The production plan costs $475 per month, with dedicated cloud storage and more benefits.\n\nBest laid plans coming together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first spoke to Azeez in November 2021, through spotty Internet connections and turned-off videos, he told me many things that Ozi planned to achieve with timelines.\n\nThey planned to hire more people to focus on marketing and sales. At the 1,000 customer mark, there were also plans to raise funding by the end of the first quarter of 2022, reduce pricing and business margin, and increase active users to 10,000 by the second half of 2022.\n\nWhen we spoke this week, he could confirm that all but one had been achieved.\n\nThe startup has just closed a $10,000 angel round, with an increase from 100 to 10,000 users \u2014 2,000 active \u2014 a business margin of 90% cost and 10% profit, up from a previous 95%, and a five-person team, including a digital marketer and a content creator.\n\nThe company also reduced pricing from \u20a620,000 for 2,000 \u2013 5,000 contacts and \u20a630,000 for 5,000 contacts to \u20a620,000 for 5,000 contacts and \u20a630,000 for 10,000 contacts.\n\nAzeez said the funds would be used to improve data privacy while doubling down on marketing and sales.\n\nAll this leads Ozi to its end goal of becoming the one-stop shop for unified communication in Africa. But then, Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words. Twitter\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

At Techpoint, we published a piece filled with funding tips for female entrepreneurs.\n\nOne thing bears repeating: women are underrepresented in most organisations and settings. Like most problems, there is no single cause or solution to this. However, in your little way, you can help build a more equal world.\n\nHere\u2019s the article I spoke about.

On the first day, Rain and Telkom emerged winners, forking out a combined R2.6 billion ($169.8 million).\n\nWhile Telkom paid R1.5 billion ($98 million) for two chunks of 10MHz in the 800MHz band, Rain paid R1.1 billion ($71.8 million) for its bands. The auction is expected to resume on Thursday where all qualified companies will participate in the main auction.\n\nOn the sidelines of the auction is a court case filed by Telkom against the bidding process. The company alleges that the bidding process will harm competition in the telecommunications sector.\n\nThe company had previously asked the court to supervise a new auction to be conducted by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) once it invalidates the current auction. ICASA, on the other hand, has said there is no legal impediment to the auction proceeding.\n\nBitmama launches physical cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Flickr\n\nOver the last few years, Nigerian banks have reduced the spending limit of customers\u2019 dollar debit cards. Consequently, customers have frequently complained about their inability to complete transactions while outside the country.\n\nIn response, one of the foremost cryptocurrency startups in the country, Bitmama, has launched physical cards. This is coming three months after it launched virtual cards for its users. In a blog post announcing it, the company revealed that there is no minimum deposit required, making the card available to new and old users alike.\n\nThe card can be funded with stable coins like USDT and USDC, with a monthly spending limit of over $10,000. Additionally, users can use it on PoS terminals or for online payments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the surface, this is an interesting development that solves the challenge of FX limits for Nigerians travelling abroad. However, with cryptocurrencies not yet accepted by many businesses globally, one may wonder how it will work. Typically, crypto debit cards automatically convert cryptocurrencies at the point of transacting to fiat and Bitmama\u2019s card may work similarly. However, it is unclear if it will work in the same way for ATM withdrawals.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nEnjoy the rest of your day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnivasa, an indigenous ride-hailing company in Nigeria, launched Verify and Pay, an innovative digital payment system aimed at reshaping the transport system in Nigeria, on Friday, March 4, 2022.\n\nThrough Verify and Pay, passengers hailing a cab can scan the barcode on the taxi to confirm the details of the driver and the vehicle, input their destination to check and negotiate fares, and select preferred payment options such as card payments or USSD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe platform was launched at the Lagos State Taxi Driver & Cab Operators Association (LSTDCOA) headquarters, Oshodi, Lagos. The event was graced by Mr Otunba Taiwo Omolekan, President, LSTDCOA; Honorable Mike Oladipupo, general secretary of LSTDCOA, and other high-ranking members of LSTDCOA.\n\nComrade Idris, President of Professional E-Hailing Drivers and Private-owners Association (PEDPA), Mr Ayodele Kumolu, representative, Universal Insurance plc, and Mr Israel Ifedayo, Mizala tech partner, were also present at the event.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Verify and Pay platform is a new face to transportation in Nigeria; currently, it has been launched for the Lagos Yellow Cabs but will also cut across other forms of transport within the state, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt before the end of the year.\n\nMr Otunba, the president of LSTDCOA, gave a breakdown of the journey so far for taxi drivers. He said that he has been working on providing solutions to the issues affecting taxi drivers and their services.\n\nHe added that technology has to be embraced to prevent the extinction of yellow taxi cabs in Lagos state.\n\nSpeaking at the event, CEO of Univasa, Dr Ben Adeniyi, said, \u201cThe verify and pay platform initiative was born out of the need to be an \u201cEnabler\u201d to service providers and consumers.\n\nFor us at Univasa, providing innovative services is at the helm of our operations, and we continue to hold it as a top priority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a driver-partner with Univasa, you get to enjoy the convenience of receiving your payments instantly with our instant withdrawal feature, so \u201cCash or Card e no matter\u201d as we like to say and for the riders, we are offering you a chance to own your experience while hailing a ride\u201d.\n\nComrade Idris gave a brief speech, where he called for solidarity between members of LSTDCOA and PEDPA as they stand to benefit from each other.\n\nMr Ayodele Kumolu, the representative of Universal Insurance plc, also spoke in detail about their flexible insurance packages. Drivers can apply and make payments in instalments, either a weekly, monthly or yearly package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Univasa rolled out its Drive-to-Own empowerment program, which allows drivers on the Univasa ride-hailing app to pick a Univasa car as their vehicle of choice to work, make daily remittances for a duration of 18-24months, which will be deducted from their earnings from the app, and then the driver gains permanent ownership of the car.\n\nThe Univasa team also confirmed that the cars in the drive-to-own scheme had been insured with Universal Insurance plc and tech partners, Mizala. The insurance covers the car, third party and life.\n\nUnivasa also has a package for drivers who meet the earning mark of NGN 200,000 in a month. They will automatically be beneficiaries of free insurance against the next month, and others can also easily apply for comprehensive insurance on a flexible payment structure.\n\nThe yellow cab drivers expressed their excitement for the new initiatives by Univasa especially verify and pay platform, as it will help them track their rides and also help to improve the reputation of the association as their riders will be more assured of their safety.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa, Dr Ben Adeniyi said that the onboarding process won\u2019t be limited to the drivers alone as passengers need to understand how to use the platform. It will enable the passengers to easily adopt the platform and increase trust as they know the driver is affiliated with Univasa and LSTDCOA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnivasa is a wholly-owned Nigerian Company that provides a one-stop solution to fulfil the daily needs of Africans via cutting-edge digital technology.

          "title": "Businesses suffer as diesel price surges 160%",
          "text": "Like many business owners across Nigeria, Joseph Martins, who plies his trade in the country\u2019s commercial capital, Lagos, depends largely on diesel. But buying the diesel he needs to power his generator has been giving him a big headache in recent weeks because of the skyrocketing cost of the fuel.\n\nUnable to depend on the national grid for stable power supply and finding it hard to push the cost down to the final consumers, he is forced to buy a litre of diesel for over N500 per litre and that squeezes his tiny profit margin even further.\n\nThe price of Automotive Gas Oil, popularly known as diesel, has soared by almost 160 per cent in one year to N540-570 per litre from N220-N240 in March last year.\n\n\u201cAt the current pace, any business using diesel will be forced to increase its price which will have an effect on inflation rate,\u201d Martins told BusinessDay.\n\nThe surge in the price of diesel, which has been deregulated, followed the rally in global oil prices, buoyed by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Brent, the global oil benchmark, jumped a 13-year high of $139 per barrel on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe marketers are selling at a price that covers their cost price, import cost and exchange rate price,\u201d said Mike Osatuyi, national operations controller of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur selling price is based on the crude price and the cost of dollars in the black market which is N575 because marketers source dollars from the black market.\u201d\n\nIn Africa\u2019s biggest oil-producing country, most small businesses, manufacturers or retailers are now facing intense pressure from rising energy costs as they have to spend more on diesel to power their generators.\n\nTotal power generation in the country stood at 4,033.7MW as 6am on Tuesday, according to data from the Nigerian Electricity System Operator.\n\nBusiness experts have expressed fear that the spike in diesel price might force more businesses to sack employees amid rising energy costs.\n\nThe immediate past director-general of Nigeria\u2019s largest business think-tank, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Muda Yusuf, said high and increasing cost of diesel was compounding an already difficult situation for many investors.\n\n\u201cWe would see an escalation in production and operating costs; mounting inflationary pressures, erosion of profit margins, and a risk to business continuity, especially for SMEs in the real sector,\u201d Yusuf, CEO of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, added.\n\nDiesel is mostly used by businesses, especially manufacturers, to power their generators amid a lack of reliable power supply from the national grid. Many vehicles transporting goods and people across the country also use diesel.\n\n\u201cHigh diesel cost would trigger higher transportation costs. Most haulage vehicles are powered by diesel. Increase in transport costs typically impacts on general price level,\u201d Yusuf said. \u201cA major driver of inflation is high transportation costs.\u201d\n\nRead also: Nigeria diesel generator market to hit $806.8m by 2030-report\n\nMichael Adebayo, chairman of Gas Users Group at Manufacturers Association of Nigeria, said manufacturers \u201care currently in a fix as they have to deal with rising production cost, reduced demand and their inability to increase the prices of goods.\u201d\n\nAdebayo, a director at Haffar Industrial Company Limited, a textile production company, described the spike in diesel price in the first quarter of the year as a bad omen for the 2022 business year.\n\n\u201cCurrently this is a time of confusion for us because we do not even know the best way to address this, especially as the price increase is continuous,\u201d he said.\n\nNigeria ranked 169 in the getting electricity metric, scoring 47.4 points on the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business 2020 report and a zero in the reliability of power supply. Local manufacturers are left to self-generate more than 8,000 megawatts through alternative sources of energy in order to stay afloat, which sees them spending so much on petrol and diesel.\n\n\u201cIt is only a matter of time before the prices of other goods and services go up,\u201d Adebayo told BusinessDay.\n\nData from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicate that the average diesel price in Lagos was N303 in January 2022, a 24 percent rise when compared to the price of N243 in December.\n\nThe NBS data also showed that diesel price was N131.47 in June 2015 when the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration came into power.\n\nThe NBS, in a power sector data review, revealed that generators (diesel, petrol and gas) provide 48.6 percent of the electricity consumed by both households and businesses across the country.\n\n\u201cThis means that the country\u2019s electricity sector is fast becoming degenerate as 12 in every 25 Nigerians make use of generators, spending about $16 million to fuel only 14 million of these generators annually,\u201d Financial Derivatives Company Limited said in a new report.",

And we can see the crisis that we had in the House. It was possible because we did not have a woman there.\n\n\u201cSo, we have learned our lesson, and this election, you don\u2019t need to preach to us. I will go out there to campaign and more women will be elected into our State House of Assembly. The crisis we had may have been avoided if we have more voices of reasoning in that House.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, women get ready. You know how we do it; you know we moved from ward to ward, and will do that again in a few months\u2019 time. Rest assured that our government will create more opportunities to support women and build structures that will allow you to achieve your goals,\u201d he assured.\n\nThe governor, who flayed the National Assembly for rejecting bills seeking affirmative action and inclusion of women in politics and other spheres of the society, noted that \u201cthe action of the National Assembly should serve as a turning point in our history and should spur you, women, to mobilize Nigerians for gender equality and to break the bias; do not despair.\u201d\n\nHe further stated: \u201cToday\u2019s celebration would have been an epic one if the National Assembly had set aside all unfounded misgivings and biases to justify their refusal to constructive debates and approved the bills to alter the provisions of our constitution to provide affirmative action for women in our political administration and other related matters.\n\n\u201cIf they had done the right thing, today, we would have all rolled out the drums to celebrate them for such resolute display of progressive change, but unfortunately, they refused. Rather, today, we are all going to carry placards across the country to commence protest which will force those we voted to represent our interests to do the right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf only leaders understand and appreciate the exceptional competence and leadership abilities of women, there will be no conversation about giving women the opportunity and responsibility in government,\u201d the governor added.\n\nSpeaking on efforts to end all forms of gender bias in Edo, Obaseki said, \u201cIn Edo, we are clear. We have seen how women have contributed to making major differences in our lives. If we say we want to make Edo great again, then, the women must be at the forefront.\u201d\n\nIn her speech, Edo First Lady, Mrs. Besty Obaseki, who was represented by the wife of the Deputy Governor, Mrs. Maryann Shaibu, also berated the National Assembly for not giving approval to the five gender bills.\n\nIn her opening remarks, the Commissioner for Social Development and Gender Issues, Mrs. Maria Edeko commended Obaseki and the Edo State House of Assembly for showing support for women as evidenced by the Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) Law.\n\nThe Commissioner noted, \u201cThis year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day is a call on political leaders to show support for women so that a large number of them would be elected as state and national assembly members.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Some people are being extremely sensational, posting and saying that \u2018Lagos state government wants to cover something that even my person wants to cover something\u2019, the governor said.\n\n\u201cI think people trivialise life and make it look at everything as if they want to score a cheap point. I think this message should go to people like that \u2014 they are of low minds and have no conscience.\u201d\n\nThe governor also explained that closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera was not installed in the BRT vehicle.\n\n\u201cI think it is important to say this. I have seen on social media, people are asking \u2018you don\u2019t have CCTV cameras in your cars and vehicles\u2019. No, it is not true,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn all of our BRT buses that we procured two and a half years ago, all of them have CCTV cameras and trackers. However the additional ones that we bought locally last year are the ones we have not installed CCTV cameras.\n\n\u201cBecause you need to do a lot of configuration before you can put CCTV cameras in them so we are speaking with the manufacturers of that. I don\u2019t need to mention names but they were purchased locally. That is the unfortunate one this particular incident happened.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu advised Lagosians not to board a BRT bus of which lights, including the radar lights which indicate destination, are off.\n\nHe said once the lights of a BRT bus are switched off, it means that the bus is no longer in service and that the driver is expected to take the bus to the park to close for the day.\n\n\u201cAny bus that has its inner lights on at night is certainly still on service. Once the lights are off and the radar in the bus is not displaying, people should desist from boarding such a bus, because it is no longer in service at that period,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cBy that time, the checker and conductor would have been out of the bus, except the driver who is expected to take the empty bus back to their yards.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

Mariam Katagum. It brought stakeholders together to explore the key issues that could facilitate progress towards gender equality through policy and finance.\n\nIn his opening remarks, the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Exchange Group Plc (NGX Group), Mr. Oscar N. Onyema, OON said, \u201cThe global finance industry has a critical role to play in achieving gender equality. As the world clamours for increased reallocation of finance to address the Sustainable Development Goals, climate change and other pressing issues, there is a pressing need for stakeholders to reconsider the role of finance in addressing gender issues. If promoting gender issues was conceived as a business opportunity or a transaction, favourable policies would need to be implemented to enable investors recoup their investments. At NGX Group of Companies, we remain committed to playing our part by implementing various initiatives aimed at promoting gender diversity and empowering women.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the potential of collaboration to promote gender equality, Chief Executive Officer, Temi Popoola, said, \u201cWe recognize our strategic position as the engine of growth of Africa\u2019s largest economy and we leverage this unique position to promote the adoption of sustainable business practices, and reporting as well as foster the growth of long-term sustainable finance. NGX Group of Companies is committed to championing efforts to advance gender equality across our ecosystem through the introduction of gender-responsive and inclusive financial instruments, advocacy for increased participation of women on boards and in senior management and support for capacity building initiatives to enable companies achieve their gender-related aspirations.\u201d\n\nHonorable Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen, expressed the willingness of the Ministry of Women Affairs to collaborate with NGX to promote gender equality. In her remarks, the Honorable Minister said, \u201cPartnerships is at the heart of our intervention philosophy at the Ministry of Women Affairs. We welcome innovative initiatives that can create a future where women are economically empowered as business leaders and entrepreneurs and take on leadership positions in all spheres of endeavour. We are open to collaborating with Nigerian Exchange Limited, development partners here present and all relevant stakeholders, local and international, who can help create this future through innovative solutions, including gender bonds.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on a fireside chat session on inclusive economic policies to break the gender bias in women\u2019s employment and entrepreneurship, Ms. Tinuade Awe, Chief Executive Officer, NGX Regulation, lauded the economic and societal benefits of women\u2019s financial inclusion, stating that, \u201cWomen\u2019s financial inclusion can create greater economic stability and prosperity for women, their families, and their communities, by building assets, and enabling the ability to respond to family needs\u201d. Honorable Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Amb. Mariam Katagum, highlighted the need for collaboration across board. She said, \u201cthe contribution of women to the Nigerian economy has been established. However, we have only 8 years to ensure we achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, hence there is need for urgency for Nigerian to move ahead in terms of gender equality\u201d. She highlighted the potential of policy in improving the livelihoods of women through gender friendly trade policies, indicating that, domesticating the 2017 Buenos Aires Declaration on Women and Trade, which encourages member states to make trade and development policies more gender friendly, would help us go a long way in ensuring that women are better included in the financial system and the economy as a whole.\n\nThe event featured goodwill messages from Ms. Naomi Nwokolo, Executive Director, United Nations Global Compact Network Nigeria; Lansana Wonneh, Deputy Representative, Nigeria and ECOWAS, UN Women; and a keynote address by Kevin Njiraini, Regional Director, Southern Africa & Nigeria, themed \u201cHow Corporate Nigeria is Choosing to Challenge with the Nigera2Equal Programme\u201d. The symposium also featured a panel session to highlight the potential of leveraging sustainable finance to break the gender bias in gender equality.

          "text": "\u00b7 To mark the International Women\u2019s Day this year, on March 8, 2022, Prime Minister Boris Johnson launched a new global partnership with 11 global businesses to improve girls\u2019 access to education and employment in developing countries.\n\n\u00b7 The UK Government will contribute an initial \u00a39m, with the partners providing an additional \u00a311m.\n\n\u00b7 The programme aims to provide high quality skills training to around 1 million girls around the world.\n\n\u00b7 Improving girls\u2019 access to education is a key part of the UK\u2019s foreign policy, to ensure the build back from the pandemic and prevent a lost generation. Investing in education helps lift communities out of poverty and protects girls from early marriage, forced labour and gender-based violence.\n\nAs part of activities to mark this year\u2019s edition of the International Women\u2019s Day (IWD), the United Kingdom Prime Minister, Boris Johnson has launched a new global partnership with UBA Foundation and 10 other organisations, to improve girls\u2019 access to education and employment in developing countries.\n\nTo this end, the UBA Foundation, together with 10 other global businesses have come together with the UK government who will be working in partnership with UNICEF\u2019s Generation Unlimited (GenU) to fund this very crucial programme that aims to provide high quality skills training to around one million girls around the world.\n\nThe UBA Foundation, other private sector players and global businesses who are partnering to fund and resource the the initiative to tune of \u00a39m are Accenture, Standard Chartered, Unilever, Microsoft, Pearson, PwC, Coursera, Vodafone, BP and Cognizant. The UK government has contributed an initial \u00a39m to the initiative called the Girls\u2019 Education Skills Partnership programme.\n\nExplaining its drive to undertake this project which is expected to have far-reaching positive effects for the girl-child across the world, the UK Government pointed out that even before the Covid pandemic, millions of children did not have any access to school \u2013 and girls from disadvantaged families are particularly vulnerable to missing out on education, whether through poverty or prejudice. The pandemic has created even more barriers to education, with a peak of 1.6 billion children around the world having faced school closures.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who pointed out that this is UK\u2019s first education partnership of its kind where the UK Government is joining forces with the private sector to boost girls\u2019 access to education in developing countries, said, \u201cThe United Kingdom has long been a proud and mighty champion of this fundamental cause and today we take one leap further through our first Global Partnership of its kind \u2013 opening up opportunities for one million girls across the developing world to have access to high quality skills training.\n\nContinuing, Boris said, \u201cEnsuring every girl and young woman across the globe receives 12 years of quality education is the greatest tool in our armoury to end the world\u2019s great injustices. \u201cDelivering on this mission will be one of the best defences against ignorance, ensure the greatest protection from prejudice and put a rocket booster behind our hopes and dreams for global development in the years to come.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Mr Johnson noted that some of the businesses involved will be contributing a range of resources including books, computers and other technology, mentoring, advice and access to their networks, skills and training programmes just as the private sector involvement will help ensure that education and learning opportunities provide girls with the skills for the future that employers need.\n\nThe Group Chairman, United Bank for Africa(UBA), Mr Tony O. Elumelu, CON, who was in attendance at the event reiterated the importance of educating the girl child and giving back always as we strive towards sustainable development. \u201cWe understand first hand, the need to empower young women in African communities to catalyse sustainable socio economic development. At the UBA Group, we are committed to women empowerment and we continue to champion women causes in our business and through our work in philanthropy. Working together, we must ensure that our girls are properly educated and attain the necessary skills that allow them to effectively compete as the world becomes increasingly global,\u201d He added.\n\nMr Elumelu thanked the Prime Minister and the UK Special Envoy, Helen Grant, for the laudable initiative that will see more girls globally, being educated.\n\nThe UBA Foundation is the Corporate Social Responsibility arm of the United Bank for Africa group.

          "text": "The Senate has rejected the ruling of a Federal High Court in Abuja stopping it from amending the 2022 Electoral Act as requested by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nPresident Buhari, had penultimate Friday before signing the 2022 Electoral Bill into law, urged the National Assembly to expunge section 84(12) of the Act which requires appointive political office holders to resign their positions before contesting for any election right from the level of party primary election.\n\nBut on the strength of litigation against further amendment of the Act by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) , Justice Inyang Ekwo, Monday restrained President Buhari , the Attorney \u2013 General of the Federation , Abubakar Malami(SAN) and the Senate from making any amendment on the Act.\n\nIn the substantive suit filed through its team of lawyers led by Chief Ogwu Onoja (SAN), the leading opposition party challenged the legality or otherwise of the National Assembly tinkering with the Electoral Act, after it had been signed into law by the president.\n\nIn a ruling delivered by Justice Inyang Ekwo, the Court specifically barred all the defendants in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/247/2022, from removing section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act or preventing it from being implemented for the purpose of the 2023 general elections.\n\nOther defendants in the suit are Speaker of the House of Representatives; Clerk to the National Assembly; Senate Leader, House of Representatives Leader and the Independent National Electoral Commission( INEC).\n\nOthers are Deputy Senate President, Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Deputy Senate Leader and Deputy Leader of the House of Representatives.\n\nSenate kicks\n\nKicking against the Order during plenary Tuesday, the Senate first listed consideration of the Act for amendment on its order paper and made it to pass first reading.\n\nIn his remarks, Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan said the court cannot stop the Senate and by extension, the National Assembly, from performing its legislative duties.\n\nHe said: \u201cI find it necessary to talk to this at this point, because our governance system is based on the Presidential system of government where there is clear cut separation and exercise of powers.\n\n\u201cThe Judiciary, under no circumstance, cannot stop the National Assembly from performing its legislative duties.\n\n\u201cWe know what our due processes are, just like we wouldn\u2019t venture into what the Judiciary does, it should also understand that we have our processes.\n\n\u201cIf the President writes to the National Assembly to request for an amendment, that is within his competence, and it is for the National Assembly to decide whether it agrees with the request of Mr. President or not.\n\n\u201cBut to say that we cannot consider it, is to ask for what is not there to be given. I believe that members of this National Assembly know their work and will do what is right.\n\n\u201cThis is due process, we are not doing anything outside of the law, whether it is Mr. President or any Nigerian who feels very strongly about an amendment, this National Assembly is ready to take in and consider.\n\n\u201cIt is within our exclusive right to consider whatever request we receive from Nigerians, whether through the Executive arm of government or through our colleagues \u2013 private members\u2019 bill.\n\n\u201cThe doctrine of separation of powers should be respected by all arms of government to prevent anarchy. The Senate will surely go ahead with the amendment as requested for by the President.\u201d\n\nSupporting Lawan\u2019s argument, Senator Gabriel Suswam (PDP Benue North East ) , faulted the court ruling.\n\n\u201cI agree with what you have said, the court cannot stop us from making laws. The problem with the letter sent to us by the President was that there is a part of it that interpreted the law we made.\n\n\u201cI think that is the only part that the court can act on, because he (President Buhari) said that the law we (National Assembly) made is ultra vires the Constitution, which is not his responsibility, and, I think, to that extent, the court can comment on that and not on the fact that we are making laws,\u201d he said.\n\nEkweremadu cautions\n\nBut Senator Ike Ekweremadu, while citing Order 52(5) of the Senate Standing Order, called on the Senate to abide by the court ruling.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen we were waiting for the President to assent to the Electoral Act, some of us made a suggestion we believed would help, namely that the President would sign and then we would commit ourselves to amending that section.\n\n\u201cMr. President, I agree with you entirely, but the principle as all the lawyers here know, is that if there is a court order, no matter how wrong it is, our responsibility as individuals and citizens is to respect it.\n\n\u201cThe argument you have raised is what we are going to raise in response.\u201d\n\nHowever Lawan in his ruling, said the Senate would forge ahead with the amendment.\n\n\u201cIf the Judiciary wants to come into the Legislature to decide when we sit and when we don\u2019t, then that\u2019s anarchy.\n\n\u201cIf the Judiciary would simply say we are not to consider this and that, and we obey those kind of rulings, that is anarchy, because it is emasculating the legislature and that is not supposed to be.\n\n\u201cWe will continue with what we are supposed to do because that is our calling. We are just advising that the Judiciary should please help us develop this democracy, because this arm of government is the least developed and if we allow these kind of rulings, we may end up going back to where we were 23 years ago\u201d, he added",

          "title": "Transmission Company of Nigeria Blames GenCos for Nationwide Load Shedding, Worsening Power Supply",
          "text": "The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) on Tuesday attempted to explain the worsening nationwide power supply, stating that the Generation Companies (Gencos) were not generating enough electricity to be transmitted by the company.\n\nIn a statement signed by the General Manager, Public Affairs, TCN, Mrs. Ndidi Mbah, the wholly owned federal government entity, insisted that it could only transmit the power supplied by the Gencos.\n\nThe TCN notified its customers that the current load shedding being experienced nationwide was as a result of very low power generation made available by the Gencos for wheeling through the transmission grid to Distribution Companies (Discos) nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe media has been awash with reports that TCN has reduced the load allocation to distribution companies. That information is incorrect. The correct position is that TCN can only transmit the quantum of power generated by Gencos through the national grid to distribution load centres nationwide.\n\n\u201cFor clarity, TCN does not generate electricity and therefore can only transport cumulative generation from all the generation companies nationwide to distribution load centres.\n\n\u201cThe distribution companies are responsible for end-users consumption. TCN allocates power to distribution companies based on approved percentage (formula approved by NERC), of the total generation available per hour or on day-ahead nomination,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe company noted that presently, the cumulative generation nationwide was low and generation companies have attributed this to several factors including poor gas supply.\n\nOther challenges, it stressed, included low generating units of generating companies, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, all of which have caused most power generating companies to limit their generation, and sometimes not generate at all.\n\nA summary of the power generating profiles in the last two months, for instance, the statement noted, clearly showed that 14 gas-powered generating stations were either not generating at all or had limited generation at various times within the period, further depleting the quantum of power generation available for transmission into the grid on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cPower generating stations in this category include; Omotosho units 5 & 6, Olorunsogo units 3, 4 & 6, Omoku units 3 & 6, Omotosho NIPP units 3 & 4, Delta units 15, 17, and 18, Afam VI units 11 & 12, Olorunsogo NIPP unit 3, Ihovbor NIPP unit 2, Sapele Steam unit 3, Sapele NIPP unit 1, Odukpani NIPP units 1 & 3, and Okpai units 11, 12 & 18.\n\n\u201cAlso, within the same period, Jebba Hydro and Shiroro Power Generating Stations were either out or had limited generation, causing additional loss of 232MW from the grid.\n\n\u201cOther power generating plants such as Omotosho units 3&4, Olorunsogo units 1, Delta units 10 &20, Afam VI unit 13, Ihovbor NIPP units 4, Geregu NIPP units 22&23 and Odukpani NIPP units 2, 4 & 5, have also been out either on fault or for scheduled maintenance, causing a further loss of about 3,180MW from the grid,\u201d the TCN stated.\n\nThe company stated that a combination of the above scenarios had persisted and the total effect on the grid has been persistent low generation, which TCN operators have had to strive to dispatch in a way that will not jeopardise the stability of the grid.\n\n\u201cMore recently, from the 1st to 4th of March, 2022, there was generation shortfall due to water management in Shiroro and Jebba hydro with the loss of 307MW and 125MW respectively from both stations.\n\n\u201cWithin the same period, there were fault and technical problems in Egbin, causing 514MW shortfall and in Geregu causing 230MW shortfall, while reported fault at Alaoji NIPP reduced generation from the substation by 263MW.\n\n\u201cGas constraint alone in Olorunsogo gas generating plant reduced generation from the station by 104MW, in the same vein, Omotosho gas lost 102MW and Sapele NIPP lost 263MW. In Omotosho NIPP, there was generation shortfall of 233MW and in Omoku a shortfall of 112MW.\n\n\u201cTwo units in Okpai have limited generation due to technical problems causing a 204MW drop in generation and in Afam VI 511MW drop in generation.\n\n\u201cGas constraint and fault in Olorunsogo NIPP reduced generation by 240MW, Geregu NIPP by 435MW, and Ihovbor by 142MW. Also, due to gas pipeline pigging, Odukpani NIPP was shut down which caused a reduction of generation by 575MW,\u201d it added.\n\nThe TCN further reiterated that a combination of issues ranging from gas constraints, fault, and technical problems within generating plants caused persistent low generation and consequently low load allocation to distribution companies nationwide.\n\nIt pointed out that this is based on the fact that TCN can only transmit what is being generated by Gencos and presently they are all generating below capacity.\n\nTCN stated that except cumulative power generation increases considerably for it to transmit to distribution companies nationwide, TCN would be left with no choice than to continue to shed load.\n\n\u201cWe will however continue to work hard to ensure the efficient allocation of the total load generated by power generating stations into the grid, bearing in mind the need to ensure that the national grid is stable in spite of the challenges posed by insufficient load on the transmission grid,\u201d TCN said.",

More investments in that sector would be a great opportunity for Turkey to expand its investments interest in Nigeria,\u201d the minister said.\n\nA statement by the Senior Adviser, Media & Communications, Horatius Egua, quoted the minister as saying that, \u201cWe are looking at the possibility of Turkey taking interests in more investments in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said the cooperation between Nigeria and Turkey remained very significant, stressing that the relationship could be extended to the energy sector and other areas of trade.\n\nThe minister added that with the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), Nigeria has further streamlined its laws in the oil and gas investment environment and thus making investments in the more attractive to potential investors.\n\nHe called on the deputy minister to encourage Turkish investors to come to Nigeria to participate in the new opportunities offered by the exit of the IOCs to consolidate the bilateral relations between both countries.\n\nSylva assured Bayraktar of good returns on investments in Nigeria, stressing that despite plans by the IOCs to divest from onshore assets, the companies were ramping up investments in offshore assets in the country.\n\nHe noted that this was a sign that the Nigeria investment environment is still the desired investment destination in Africa.\n\nThe minister added that he expected investors from the country to also take up investments in greenfield assets, noting that the country was prepared to engage in discussions on a government-to-government basis to achieve the desired results.\n\nOn his part, Bayraktar solicited the support of Sylva to get Turkey to be part of the Nigerian upstream oil and gas sector, adding that the country was prepared to shore up investments in the area of natural gas, given the right environment.",

          "text": "McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and General Electric __ ubiquitous global brands and symbols of U.S. corporate might __ all announced Tuesday they were temporarily suspending their business in Russia in response to the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOur values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine,\u201d McDonald\u2019s President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said in an open letter to employees.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe Chicago-based burger giant said it will temporarily close 850 stores but continue paying its 62,000 employees in Russia \u201cwho have poured their heart and soul into our McDonald\u2019s brand.\u201d\n\nKempczinski said it\u2019s impossible to know when the company will be able to reopen its stores.\n\n\u201cThe situation is extraordinarily challenging for a global brand like ours, and there are many considerations,\u201d Kempczinski wrote in the letter. McDonald\u2019s works with hundreds of Russian suppliers, for example, and serves millions of customers each day.\n\nLast Friday, Starbucks had said that it was donating profits from its 130 Russian stores __ owned and operated by Kuwait-based franchisee Alshaya Group __ to humanitarian relief efforts in Ukraine. But on Tuesday, the company changed course and said it would temporarily close those stores. Alshaya Group will continue to pay Starbucks\u2019 2,000 Russian employees, Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson said in an open letter to employees.\n\n\u201cThrough this dynamic situation, we will continue to make decisions that are true to our mission and values and communicate with transparency,\u201d Johnson wrote.\n\nCoca-Cola Co. announced it was suspending its business in Russia, but it offered few details. Coke\u2019s partner, Switzerland-based Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co., owns 10 bottling plants in Russia, which is its largest market. Coke has a 21% stake in Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co.\n\nPepsiCo and General Electric both announced partial shutdowns of their Russian business.\n\nPepsi, based in Purchase, New York, said it will suspend sales of beverages in Russia. It will also suspend any capital investments and promotional activities.\n\nBut the company said it will continue to produce milk, baby formula and baby food, in part to continue supporting its 20,000 Russian employees and the 40,000 Russian agricultural workers who are part of its supply chain.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever we must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business,\u201d PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said in an email to employees.\n\nGeneral Electric also said in a Twitter post that it was partially suspending its operations in Russia. GE said two exceptions would be essential medical equipment and support for existing power services in Russia.\n\nRussia, but it offered few details.

GE said two exceptions would be essential medical equipment and support for existing power services in Russia.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s is among those to take the biggest financial hit. Unlike Starbucks and other fast food companies like KFC and Pizza Hut, whose Russian locations are owned by franchisees, McDonald\u2019s owns 84% of its Russian stores. McDonald\u2019s has also temporarily closed 108 restaurants it owns in Ukraine and continues to pay those employees.\n\nIn a recent regulatory filing, McDonald\u2019s said its restaurants in Russia and Ukraine contribute 9% of its annual revenue, or around $2 billion last year.\n\nYum Brands, the parent company of KFC and Pizza Hut, said late Tuesday it planned to temporarily close 70 company-owned KFC restaurants in Russia. The company said it was also in talks with a franchisee to close all 50 Pizza Hut restaurants in Russia. It had announced Monday that it was donating all of the profits from its 1,050 restaurants in Russia to humanitarian efforts. It has also suspended new restaurant development in the country.\n\nBurger King said it is redirecting the profits from its 800 Russian stores to relief efforts and donating $2 million in food vouchers to Ukrainian refugees.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s said Tuesday it has donated more than $5 million to its employee assistance fund and to relief efforts. It has also parked a Ronald McDonald House Charities mobile medical care unit at the Polish border with Ukraine; another mobile care unit is en route to the border in Latvia, the company said. PepsiCo said it is donating food, refrigerators and $4 million to relief organizations.\n\nSome of the companies have a long history operating in Russia. PepsiCo entered the Russian market in the early 1960s, at the height of the Cold War, and helped to create common ground between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.\n\nLater, McDonald\u2019s was one of the first U.S. fast food companies to open a store in Russia, a sign that the Cold War had thawed. On Jan. 31, 1990, thousands of Russians lined up before dawn to try hamburgers __ many for the first time__ at the first McDonald\u2019s in Moscow. By the end of the day, 30,000 meals had been rung up on 27 cash registers, an opening-day record for the company.\n\nBut since the Ukraine invasion last month, many corporations have ceased operations in Russia in protest. Among them is consumer goods conglomerate Unilever, which on Tuesday said it has suspended all imports and exports of its products into and out of Russia, and that it will not invest any further capital into the country. In a more limited move, Amazon said Tuesday the company\u2019s cloud computing network, Amazon Web Services, will stop allowing new sign-ups in Russia and Belarus.\n\nPressure had been mounting on companies that remained in the country. Hashtags to boycott companies like McDonald\u2019s, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo quickly emerged on social media.\n\nLast week, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli __ a trustee of the state\u2019s pension fund, which is a McDonald\u2019s investor __ sent letters to McDonald\u2019s, PepsiCo and eight other companies urging them to consider pausing their operations in Russia.\n\n\u201cCompanies doing business in Russia need to seriously consider whether it\u2019s worth the risk. As investors, we want assurances that our holdings are not in harms way,\u201d DiNapoli said Tuesday in a statement. \u201cI commend the companies that are taking the right steps and suspending their operations in Russia.\u201d\n\nIn his letter, Kempczinski cited influential former McDonald\u2019s Chairman and CEO Fred Turner, whose mantra was, \u201cDo the right thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are countless examples over the years of McDonald\u2019s Corp. living up to Fred\u2019s simple ideal. Today is one of those days,\u201d Kempczinski said.",

          "title": "Nigeria: \u2018I\u2019m Still Ebonyi Governor, Judgment Ousting Me Was Bought,\u2019 Umahi Says \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "Ebonyi State Governor, Chief David Umahi, on Tuesday, described his removal by a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) as unconstitutional, null and void and of no effect.\n\nBriefing journalists in Abakaliki, Umahi reiterated that he still remained Ebonyi governor, and that he would appeal the judgement.\n\nAccording to Umahi, a governor could only vacate his seat by either death, resignation or impeachment by majority of members of the state House of Assembly.\n\nHe noted that the judgement was allegedly concocted to embarrass the APC and the federal government.\n\nUmahi said: \u201cFor me, I do not feel worried. I feel so sorry for the judiciary. The executive may have problems, the legislature may have problems too, but the moment justice could be purchased, then, we are in trouble in this country.\n\n\u201cThen the ruling this afternoon shows that this country is in trouble. And let me tell you that this same judge has over ten cases against Ebonyi State government with him. And you can imagine what he is going to rule. We have petitioned him to NJC and we will follow it up at all cost to ensure that this man is brought to justice\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want you to disregard the judgement. It is null and void. There is a subsisting judgement in Zamfara State and there is also a judgement in Ebonyi State. These sections of the constitution are very clear. This is not a pre-election matter; this is not a tribunal matter, and so, he has murdered justice in this country and he will be remembered by his generation for this jungle justice, which has no leg to stand.\n\n\u201cI am still the governor of Ebonyi State, but let me say to the nation, there is a need to look at the integrity of the judiciary, because if the judiciary begins to rule on constitutional matters that are well laid down, then, the citizens of this country may decide not to obey the jungle justice,\u201d and therefore called on the people of the state to remain calm and law abiding, as there was no issue to worry about.\n\nAlso, reacting to the judgment outside the court, Commissioner for Information and State Orientation, Mr Uchenna Orji, described the judgement as a travesty of justice and assured the people that they would appeal the decision.\n\nFaulting the judgment, Orji stated that the judge only relied on provisions of the Electoral Act dealing with pre-election and election matters.\n\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal decision in Amaechi shows that today\u2019s judgement was a clear case of an error in law and we must challenge it at the appellate court,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further disclosed that a court of coordinate jurisdiction in Ebonyi State, had made a pronouncement on this matter, saying the Constitution has no provision on defection for governors or has not made it an offence for a governor to defect from one party to another.\n\nPDP Submits Names of Replacements to INEC\n\nIn a related development, the PDP, in compliance with the orders of Justice Iyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, which sacked Governor Dave Umahi and his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, has submitted two names of governor and deputy nominees to INEC.\n\nThe two nominees are Hon. Iduma Igariwe, a serving member of House of Representatives as the new governor and Mr. Fred Udogwu as the deputy governor.\n\nThe PDP also asked INEC to issue the certificates of return to the new nominees.\n\nAddressing a press conference, the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, said, \u201cFollowing the removal of Governor Dave Umahi and his Deputy, Mr. Igwe, and in line with the Order of the Federal High Court directing the PDP to submit replacements for the duo, the national leadership of the party, has submitted the names of Hon. Iduma Igariwe as the new Governor and Mr. Fred Udogwu as the new Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State respectively.\n\n\u201cIt follows the sacking from office of the Ebonyi State Governor, His Excellency, Chief Dave Umahi, and his deputy, His Excellency, Chief Kelechi Igwe, by a Federal High Court for defecting to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cIn the same ruling, the court, presided over by Justice Inyang Ekwo, also sacked the 16members of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly, who also defected with the governor and his deputy into the APC.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that Governor Umahi, his deputy and the 16 lawmakers were elected on the PDP platform in 2015 and again in 2019, but defected to the APC on November 17, 2020, citing \u2018injustice done to the South-East\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd determined to reclaim our stolen mandates, the PDP had sued them and joined both the APC and INEC in the suit. We had prayed the court to declare that by defecting from the PDP, on whose platform they were sponsored and elected, Umahi, Igwe and the 16lawmakers had resigned or deemed to have resigned from office on the day of their defections. And the Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja, gave the PDP and democracy justice today.\n\n\u201cIn a landmark judgement, the court ruled that, \u2018the votes in any election in Nigeria are to political parties, and not candidates. Justice Ekwo consequently ordered all the affected persons to vacate office. He also ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to receive names of candidates from the PDP to replace Messrs Umahi and Igwe.\n\n\u201cFirst, we want to appreciate the Nigerian Judiciary for this landmark judgement. The ruling will bring order in the political space and check the issue of political rascality and stolen mandates. The judiciary is indeed the backbone of this democracy.\n\n\u201cWe also want to single out Justice Inyang Ekwo for special recognition, particularly, for being courageous and forthright in going for the substance of the law rather than the technicalities.\n\n\u201cAnd in line with the court order, PDP is immediately submitting to INEC, the names of our candidates for Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State respectively. We are also calling on INEC to immediately issue the Certificates of Return to the PDP nominees as replacement for Messrs Umahi and Igwe pursuant to the Order of the Honourable Court.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we call on the Chief Judge of Ebonyi state to immediately swear them in as soon as INEC issues the requisite Certificates of Return. And lastly, we call on INEC to immediately withdraw the Certificates of Return from the 16 lawmakers and commence the process of conducting bye-elections to replace them,\u201d Ayu stated.\n\nJudgment is Judicial Recklessness, Says APC\n\nThe ruling APC, has described the Federal High Court judgement on the defection of Governor David Umahi as a clear case of travesty of justice and judicial recklessness.\n\nThe party in a statement issued yesterday by the Director of Publicity, Mr. Salisu Dambatta, declared that the judgement was dead on arrival.\n\nThe party stated: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to the judgement made by Hon Justice Inyang Ekwo of Court 5 of Federal High Court FCT, Abuja and the travesty of Justice occasioned by the recklessness of his Judicial decision.\u201d\n\nAPC insisted that the presiding Judge committed a glaring judicial error by giving judgement sacking a duly elected and sworn in governor and his deputy without relying on or citing any provision(s) of the constitution or any provision of the Electoral Act that empowers the court to sack a sitting governor and or his deputy, saying, \u201cThis is purely a travesty of Justice.\u201d\n\nThe ruling party emphasised that the court failed, refused or neglected to understand the clear difference between a governorship candidate of a political party as contemplated by the Electoral Act and a Governor of a state duly sworn in as contemplated by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Court presided by Hon. Justice Inyang Ekwo further went ahead to rely on the outdated authority of Amaechi v INEC (Omegha case) without exercising the Judicial power of Judicial distinction between pre-election/ election matters and this matter of elected governor defecting to another Political Party.\n\n\u201cHe chose not to appreciate or he lacked the understanding of the difference between a Governor of a State and Governorship candidate of a political party. The Electoral Act and the judgement in Amaechi v INEC contemplate, who is the right candidate of the Party and not the issue of defection, as you all know neither Amaechi nor Omegha raised the issue of defection to another political party.\n\n\u201cSo it is absolutely ridiculous and questionable, as it is shameful that a judge could decide a weighty matter such as conditions for sacking the governor of a State without relying on any express provision of the Constitution or Electoral Act or Judicial Authority either of superior courts or even courts of coordinate jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nEditor",

          "title": "Nigeria: APC Stakeholders Mull Soft-Landing for Displaced Chairman Buni",
          "text": "Worried by the recent turn of events in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), which witnessed a dramatic change of guard, stakeholders in the party have started mulling a soft-landing for the displaced former chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, in order to save him from the embarrassment of his ouster.\n\nOne of the options said to being considered, THISDAY gathered Tuesday night, was to ask Buni to resign as CECPC chairman, either on the grounds of health or the need to face governance in his State.\n\nAt the same time, there was a pall of confusion Tuesday at the national secretariat of the APC over the fate of the National Secretary of the CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe.\n\nThis just as the new leadership is moving swiftly with preparations for the convention scheduled for March 26. THISDAY is reliably informed that printing of expression of interest forms has commenced and are expected to go on sale this week or early next week.\n\nWhile there were reports that Akpanudoedehe had tendered his resignation having read the handwriting from the new leadership, he, on the other hand, claimed he was still the secretary except President Muhammadu Buhari said otherwise.\n\nThis is as President Buhari has hinted that he would be part of next Tuesday\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party, summoned by the acting chairman of the CECPC and Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello, to address some of the raging crises in the party.\n\nSources in the APC told THISDAY last night that some of Buni\u2019s colleagues were unhappy with what had become of him and thought that rather leave him to be embarrassed, there should be a soft-landing that would quietly ease him out, even though someone else had taken over the leadership of the party.\n\nOne of the sources maintained that though he had been out of the country on medical trip, it might be easy to ask him to resign on health grounds and allow the party continue with its affairs.\n\nAnother suggestion before the party, however, was to ask him to resign in order to concentrate on his state, especially, as a first term governor, who might be interested in seeking re-election in 2023.\n\nA reliable source privy to the meeting told THISDAY that Bello said both Buni and Akpanudoedehe would be given soft-landing.\n\n\u201cThey are going to give the Secretary and Buni a soft-landing by asking them to resign. Buni will resign and say he wants to face governance in Yobe, while the secretary will tender his resignation and say he wants to pursue his governorship ambition. That is the soft-landing they are giving them.\n\n\u201cThat is the game plan on the ground. The NEC will now ratify the decision. The convention will hold, the date will not change and they will vacate the court order.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at the end of the caretaker committee meeting yesterday, news filtered in that Akpanudoedehe had been forced to resign his position.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, who also attended the meeting left the secretariat after the meeting ended.\n\nImmediately the news of his resignation rent the air at the secretariat of the party, the staff of the party started jubilating.\n\nThe story of his alleged resignation, however, forced Akpanudoedehe to come back to the secretariat to address journalists to deny the report about his resignation.\n\nHe insisted that he remained the national secretary of the party until President Buhari says otherwise.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said he wouldn\u2019t accept a situation, where some people would be dropping the name of the president, adding that he and Buni would wait until they hear directly from the President.\n\n\u201cI have read on social media that I have resigned as Secretary of the APC. I want to state that it is not true. I didn\u2019t resign. If I had resigned, you would have seen my letter of resignation written by me. Someone cannot just say somebody is dead when he is alive.\n\n\u201cI am not bigger than the party, or bigger than the President, who is a leader of the country. I am waiting for my national chairman to come back. This is not the first time you are seeing a power play. I am waiting for the Chairman. If we have a directive from the President that we should resign, we are not bigger than the President, we will do so, if we hear from him.\n\n\u201cSomebody cannot say go and announce he is resigning. Like MKO Abiola used to say, you don\u2019t shave someone\u2019s head in his absence. So, we have done so much. And you will agree with me that when we came in, this place was like a dead zone. The secretariat was moved to a private home. But we were committed to what we were doing. I am stating here that that breaking news is not from me. I don\u2019t know who announced it.\u201d\n\nAsked if he had received any letter from the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) asking him to resign, Akpanudoedehe added, \u201d I have not received any letter.\u201d\n\nBut he maintained: \u201cSomeone cannot say the President said. I have not received any letter from anywhere. As I said, nobody is bigger than the party. The issue is that, if I have resigned, the answer is no. I am the national secretary of the party.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari is expected to join Bello\u2019s first NEC meeting next Tuesday virtually from London. The National Working Committee of the ruling party at its meeting on Tuesday resolved to hold its NEC next Tuesday at 11am.\n\nBuhari\u2019s virtual attendance, insider said, would serve to instill confidence in Bello\u2019s new leadership.\n\nAll members of the party\u2019s NEC, except Buni and Akpanudoedehe will attend the meeting, including all APC governors.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the party\u2019s national convention and the presidential primary would dominate the meeting.\n\nHowever, following the leadership change that occurred on Monday, Bello later met with APC state chairmen same night at Transcorp Hilton, Abuja.\n\nBello said his major task was to fix the party and ensure a successful National convention of the party at the stipulated date.\n\n\u201cOur main task is to fix the party and hold a convention. We all should be worried about the Convention. We need to hold our Convention so that we rectify past mistakes. I placed my absolute loyalty to you but I need your support,\u201d he said.\n\nAddressing journalists after the caretaker committee meeting yesterday, Bello said the report of the zoning of party offices had been adopted and also announced the NEC meeting for next week.\n\nBello stated: \u201cThe report of the zoning formula has been submitted and adopted and it will be released any moment from now. I mean the zoning formula.\n\nHe said the meeting held yesterday was a continuation of Monday\u2019s meeting, and that the committee would meet everyday from now on.\n\nOn whether Akpanudoedehe was still part of the new leadership, Bello replied: \u201cask him\u201d.\n\nSenators elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, expressed deep concern over the crisis rocking the party.\n\nThe federal lawmakers, who held a closed-door meeting after plenary at Senate room 301, however, confirmed that the Niger State Governor, Sani Bello, was merely acting for the ailing Governor Buni, as chairman of the party\u2019s caretaker committee.\n\nThey, therefore, urged all stakeholders to exercise caution to avoid any incident that could prevent the conduct of the March 26 convention of the party.\n\nSenate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, who briefed journalists after the two-hour meeting, described happenings in the APC as worrisome.\n\nHe said his colleagues would soon start peace moves to reconcile aggrieved stakeholders across the country.\n\nAbdullahi said, \u201cAPC senators met for about two hours. We are too worried about what is happening in our party and we expressed our concern over the challenges facing the party, very close to its national convention.\n\n\u201cWe thought as a very important stakeholders in the party, we want to draw the attention of everyone involved to come together and unite so that we can have very successful convention in the party.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for regrets about what we could do. What is happening is about the future of our party and government and also the capacity of our party to win elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have sat down as important stakeholders as a caucus in this great party, to dissect all the issues that have been affecting our party since the formation of the caretaker extraordinary convention planning committee.\n\n\u201cWe are quite aware of the challenges that they have faced and we are also aware of the successes that the committee had recorded particularly, when it comes to registration of members.\n\n\u201cThey came to harmonise some of the successes of the party, carrying out congresses at the ward, local government and at the state levels. The same convention planning committee is in place. What we realised is that the chairman of the convention planning committee has been sick and he went for medical checkup.\n\n\u201cThe current Niger State Governor, from the grapevine and from the knowledge that is available to us, is actually the deputy chairman and in the absence of the chairman, he is acting till the chairman comes back. The speculation in the papers is not exactly true.\n\n\u201cWhat we are concerned about is the seeming disarray in the party. So, from our standing coming from all the states in Nigeria, we have to come and establish a national platform, where all these things can be articulated so that all of us will come up with one mind and strategise for the success of the party.\n\n\u201cAll personal and individual bitter struggling for power is subordinated to the chances of the party \u2013 party\u2019s interest. So that the party would be strong. We are the strongest party; we have the largest membership, therefore, we should as much as possible move to make sure that our party is united in the interest of every member.\n\n\u201cWe commend the performance of that committee, we ask you to do more by as much as possible by trying to reconcile those chapters, where there are still challenges trailing the ward, local government and state congresses.\n\n\u201cThis is because, a loss in any state is a loss for the party. We cannot afford to come to the convention as a divided entity. Anywhere there are challenges that could cause the party its victory is a loss for everybody.\u201d",
