          "text": "Seplat\n\nBy Peter Egwuatu\n\nShareholders of Seplat Energy Plc have unanimously endorsed the proposed stepping down of the Company\u2019s Chairman, Dr ABC Orjiako from its Board of Directors.\n\nThe shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, AGM held on Wednesday in Lagos also approved the financial statement of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the appointment of three Non-Executive Directors.\n\nThe directors include: Mrs. Bashirat Odunewu, an Independent Non-Executive Director , Mr. Kazeem Raimi as a Non-Executive Director and Mr. Ernest Ebi as a Non-Executive Director.\n\nEbi who is anominee of Shebah Petroleum Development Company Limited (BVI) is replacing Dr. A.B.C Orjiako who stepped down from the Board of Seplat Energy Wednesday 18th May 2022 after the AGM.\n\nSeplat Energy had recently released its first quarter results ended March 31, 2022 to the Nigerian Exchange Limited , NGX recording a rise in profit before tax by 197.8 per cent to N34.7billion from N10.6billion year-on-year. The company also generated cash from its operations to the tune of N74.4 billion from N1.7billion year-on-year, rising by 197.8 per cent.\n\nThe energy Company\u2019s also grew its revenue by 58.6 per cent to N100.6 billion from N57.9 billion year-on-year; as its gross profit soars to N48.8 billion from N20.1 billion.year-on-year, rising by 122.3 per cent.\n\nCommenting at the AGM, Mr. Roger Brown, Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Energy Plc, said:\n\n\u201cSeplat Energy delivered a good quarter that benefited from higher oil pricing, which offset lower production owing to continuing problems with the Trans Forcados Pipeline. However, the alternative Amukpe-Escravos Pipeline is mechanically complete and once we have signed the commercial agreements, we expect Chevron to be lifting our oil through the Escravos Terminal in the third quarter.\u201d\n\nSpeaking as well, the outgoing Chairman, Orjiako said\n\n\u201c I am stepping down having laboured well for the growth of the Company. Right from the inception we knew where we were going. So we started growing organically before we went into acquisitions.Our proposed acquisition of MPNU remains on course. We are awaiting the necessary approvals from government and regulators and expect the transaction to complete in the second half of this year. The effective date of 1 January 2021 means we will benefit from higher recent oil prices and as we have previously reported, the addition of MPNU will nearly treble our production and double our reserves on a pro forma 2020 basis.\n\n\u201cThe acquisition will reinforce our leadership of Nigeria\u2019s indigenous energy sector and enabling us to generate strong future cash flows that will underpin our investment in Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and improve our overall stakeholder returns. It will also bring a significant undeveloped gas resource base which, alongside our ANOH gas project development, will underpin Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and drive domestic and export revenues when developed.\u201d\n\nOn the Company\u2019s divestment plan, he said: \u201cWe announce the decision to divest the Group\u2019s interest in the Ubima marginal field for a consideration of $55million, which marginally reduces the company\u2019s 2P reserves by 2 MMboe to 455 MMboe.\n\n\u201cWe have proven we have the financial strength and credibility to attract international finance into Nigeria\u2019s energy sector and this will help us in our aim to deliver energy transition and provide cleaner, more reliable and more affordable energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and growing population.\u201d",

So, the first thing you have to do is that if you want to drive your own uniqueness as a country, you must define an overarching economic policy.\n\n\u201cFor instance, if you want to be a productive economy like what China and India have done, the next thing you have to do is determine how to tap into the natural resources and labour force in place. To tap into the labour force, you have to micromanage the educational system.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the demography of the country, more than 42.5 per cent of the population are below the age of 23. For you to tap that, you must go back to the educational system. We must make sure every young person has, at the minimum, in today\u2019s world, a STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). They must be at the foundation of our educational curriculum. If you do that, we are going to have something to sell to the world and the world will come to us.\u201d\n\nHe said there is a need for the government to step back from striving to build infrastructure and concentrate on regulation and supervision of the economy.",

Chris Ngige has linked the scourge of child labour to pervasive poverty in the African continent.\n\nNgige made the remark on Wednesday while addressing the International Labour Organisation (ILO) 5th Global Conference on the Elimination of Child Labour, holding in Durban, Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa .\n\nA statement signed by Mr Olajide Oshundun, Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations in the ministry, made this known in Abuja.\n\nHe said that the current administration in Nigeria had adopted multi-pronged approach to fighting child labour through reduction in poverty index, in spite of teething challenges.\n\nThe minister, who co-chaired the day\u2019s panel, said Nigeria faced numerous challenges in the fight against child labour but was doing everything possible to stem the social malaise.\n\nAccording to him, the challenges in the fight to eradicate child labour include low revenue earnings due to fall in crude oil prices and production, over dependence on imported goods or items.\n\nThe minister listed others as low agricultural production and the consequential economic recession.\n\nHe attributed the worsening scenario in Nigeria to the COVID-19 pandemic which stagnated economic activities all over the world, pushing the country into a second economic recession in 2020.\n\n\u201cEven before the present administration, poverty had crept into Nigeria\u2019s socio-economic firmament and accentuated child labour with many non-working age persons taking to farming and artisanal mining.\n\n\u201cAlso, the educational curriculum not properly developed to give the right and proper skills in the secondary and tertiary institutions compounded matters.\n\n\u201cHigh rate of school dropouts among children also became a major issue and a catchment pool for Child Labour.\n\n\u201dAlso, decent jobs for young persons gave way to informal, hazardous jobs, such as illegal refining of petroleum products which has claimed scores of lives with attendant pollution,\u201d he said.\n\nNgige added that others were the poor working in heavy construction industry and ill-equipped persons handling dangerous chemicals in industries.\n\nHe however said that to reverse poverty which was at the root of child labour, the Federal Government had rolled out various measures including the diversification of the economy\n\n.\n\nAccording to him, this is through agriculture revolution-provision of fertilisers, grants to farmers, quick yields and agricultural extension.\n\nHe said the other measures were the stoppage of unnecessary importation of commodities such as rice, potato and beans and blockage of revenue leakages.\n\nNgige therefore said government was boosting Technical and Vocational Training Education, though the restructuring of the entire secondary and tertiary education curricular.\n\nHe explained that the government had introduced free education at primary and junior secondary level as well as school feeding programme to tackle low school enrolment.\n\n\u201cWe equally have adhoc employment schemes, like the National Youth Service Corps scheme for all graduates of tertiary institutions under 30 years, N- POWER programme for one million unemployed persons.\n\n\u201dWe also have social security programmes, like Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT), Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), survival funds and entrepreneurship loans. The establishment of Occupational and Safety Health Commission is in progress,\u201dhe said.\n\nHe added that though these efforts were yielding fruits, the Nigerian Government still needed technical support from the ILO.\n\nThe event was declared open by the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa.",

Buratai declined their call and urged them to support any candidate that shared their vision.\n\n\u201cThe choice of Amaechi is borne out of our conviction that his vision for Nigeria aligned with that of the group, coupled with his experience in governance and passion for Nigeria.\n\nJikta said the concern of the group was to choose leaders with the requisite experience and track records, which according to him endeared Amaechi to the group as the right person to support.\n\nHe said the decision was in response to the resolve of Nigerians to advocate for leadership that would be responsive, trusted and deliberate in meeting the people\u2019s yearning and aspiration.\n\n\u201cWe are using this opportunity to announce our support to the candidacy of Rotimi Amaechi, as we believe he has the capacity to salvage the country, both in security and economy as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe urge members of fusion 774 all over the country to lay their support to him.\n\n\u201cAt this stage, all members who are APC delegates to the presidential primaries to give him the full support and cooperation he may desire.\n\n\u201cWe at Fusion 774 will use all available resources within our means to ensure he comes out successful in the coming APC primary elections,\u201d he said.\n\nThe National Patron of the group, Dr Abubakar Sani, said the group looked out for aspirants from all political parties and evaluated their capacity and acceptability before declaring support for Amaechi.\n\nSani said the group would not only support anyone to become president but would set up machinery to hold him accountable to the people.\n\nHe said that Fusion 774 would form opposition against anyone that failed to align their vision, saying the group would not accept funding from any politician.\n\nAccording to him, the group consulted with some eminent personalities in the country, like traditional rulers to be able to narrow their choice down to Amaechi as an alternative since Buratai rejected the call.\n\nHe added that it was time for citizens to be actively involved in choosing a better president in 2023.",

Now that council has approved it, and it\u2019s very critical road leading to the Mambilla Plateau.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to Fashola, the road also provides access to the Gashaka Game Reserve and also supports access to many farm lands.\n\nThe Minister also disclosed that the council gave approval to a private firm, Mainstream Energy Solutions, to invest over N74bn in the reconstruction of three roads in Kebbi and Niger States.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe second project, which is also on a tax credit scheme approved by council, is actually three roads.\n\n\u201cThe applicant, in this case, is Mainstream Energy Solutions, a major energy player in the country, is now seeking to also participate in this policy by investing about N74.4bn.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has approved a total sum of N4,045,197,340 billion for the Ministry of Aviation to acquire a highbrow property in Abuja, that will serve as office accommodation.\n\nThe funds would also go into buying of specialised equipment to aid the Accident Investigation Bureau AIB perform its job in case of Aviation accidents.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed made the disclosure on Wednesday, after the Federal Executive Council meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cI am reporting on behalf of the Ministries of Aviation, Power, Agriculture. The council approved a memo from the Honorable Minister of Aviation for the award of contract for the establishment and deployment of Advanced Report Generation Utility Engine web based reporting tools in favour of Mssers Sinecon Limited in total sum of N553, 575, 000, inclusive of 7.5% with a delivery period of 12 months. This technology will aid the Accident Investigation Bureau to be able to establish and develop the advanced reports generation system.\n\n\u201cThis system has tremendous benefits to both authorities and recipients of information. It will be hosted on a common database, which reduces agency\u2019s cost of production, and provides technical means for users to search across agencies of government to communicate findings of accident investigations in a modern web based format, as opposed to the current traditional written format published on the web.\n\n\u201cThe web reporting tool will motivate investigators over time to create more visual contents that will have an integrated option to develop 3D flight animation to communicate the history of flights that will be hosted on plane sciences services in Ottawa, Canada.\n\n\u201cThe second memo was the most straightforward one. The council approved the sum of N3,491,622,340 to enable the Ministry of Aviation to purchase a property at Plot 426, Cadastral Zone, opposite the Corporate Affairs Commission.\n\n\u201cThis property will enable the ministry to be in the same building with many of its agencies. As of now, many of the agencies operate from rented properties and this is a drain on the government apart from the fact that it does not allow for good coordination of activities. Necessary checks and legal searches have been made and the council approved the purchase today,\u201d Lai stated on behalf of the Aviation Minister, Hadi Sirika.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Power also presented two memos to FEC which were both approved.\n\nThe first memo sought approval for the upward review of the original contract sum in respect of the construction of Yola, Song, Gombe, Mubi, Gulako 132 KV double circuit transmission line.\n\nIt is a 232km transmission line which is judged to be so crucial to the ability of the Transmission Company of Nigeria to improve power generated by the GENCOs.\n\nLai said, \u201d It is a variation. The contract has been awarded before but due to paucity of funds and additional obstacles, it has to be reviewed from the original USD $16 million plus N1.248 billion to now the same $16,698,000 but N2,337,643,640.\n\n\u201cThe second memo by the Minister of Power also sought approval for the repair and refurbishment of defective nine sets of 330 KV, 13 sets of 132 KV and 26 sets of 33 KV Crompton grips circuit breakers for the Transmission Company of Nigeria. Some of these circuit breakers are weak, having been there for more than 35 years and the total sum is N409,089,841. And this is to help the network of the TCN\u201d\n\nAlso deliberated at FEC was a memo seeking approval for a national agricultural technology innovation policy.\n\n\u201d It is a policy that aims at better synergy and alignment with MDAs to overcome inadequate coordination on policy implementation. It will address the issue of fragmentation of mandates and rivalries among MDAs in the agricultural sector. It will help livestock development and it will support the establishment of functional models of ranches, grazing reserves and integrated meat and dairy processing among others.\n\n\u201cThe policy is also going to help promote knowledge creation and transfer through reorganising, unbundling and strengthening agricultural research and training systems. The policy will also give access to mechanization via tractor and implement hiring schemes. It will also impact on quality extension service delivery leading to enhanced technology adoption to strengthen the value chain for quality crops, fisheries and aquaculture among others,\u201d Lai explained on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture, Mohammad Abubakar.",

The court appearance came as Governor of Sokoto State, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, relaxed a 24-hour curfew imposed on Sokoto metropolis as a result of protest by irate Muslim youths opposing prosecution of the murder suspects.\n\nIn the First Information Report (FIR), Prosecuting Police Officer, Inspector Khalil Musa, told the court that the suspects were accused of participating in disturbance act that led to the death of Deborah.\n\nThe NBA, while expressing sadness and condemnation over the spate of extra-judicial killings in any part of the country described it as reprehensible, barbaric and unacceptable and called on security agencies and government to immediately move to checkmate the menace.\n\n\u201cThe government should immediately commence the prosecution of all suspects involved in these brutal and arbitrary killings in order to send a strong signal that such acts will no longer be tolerated in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe NBA also believes that the prompt and effective prosecution of the alleged killers will instill confidence in the citizens, promote accountability, and signpost the government\u2019s commitment to the rule of law.\n\n\u201cWith particular reference to the murder of Miss Deborah Yakubu and related developments in Sokoto, we note that some arrests have been made by the Nigeria Police and that the suspects are now being prosecuted. We are, however, worried by yet-to-be confirmed reports reaching us that the suspects have been charged with mere breach of public peace in an episode that cut short Deborah\u2019s life in her prime.\n\n\u201cThe NBA is strongly opposed to a banalisation of the situation, and if these reports are true, then we call on the Sokoto State Government to immediately rethink its prosecution strategy and file charges that truly reflect the gravity of the situation\u201d, the statement read in part.\n\nWhile observing that expectation of Nigerians and the international community was that the culprits are brought to justice speedily for the appropriate offences, Akpata remarked that the demand for the release of the suspects by some protesting youths coupled with assault on innocent citizens, burning of worship centres and destruction of property had added an entirely new and worrisome dimension to the unfortunate incident.\n\nAkpata disclosed that following the development the NBA has decided to postpone the 2022 NBA Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL) billed for Sokoto State in honour of Miss Deborah Yakubu.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the Executive Committee of NBA-SPIDEL came to the painful decision to request, and I have approved, that the 2022 NBA-SPIDEL Annual Conference be postponed not only for the safety of our conferees and guests, but as a mark of respect for the memory of the slain Miss Deborah Yakubu\u201d, the NBA President said.\n\nFanatical Support Given to Deborah\u2019s Alleged Murders Worries AFBA\n\nIn a related development, the African Bar Association said it received with deep shock and awe the gruesome murder of the female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education by her fellow students in what it described as \u201ca senseless crime orchestrated and supported by religious bigots.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs if this heinous crime is not enough to shake the foundations of any decent society, the association is completely taken aback by the fanatical support given to this callous action by top religious leaders, highly placed government officials and\n\neven Lawyers.\n\n\u201cThe position of the African Bar Association is that no matter the provocation or whatever offence is alleged to have been committed by the murdered Deborah, resort to actions outside the law is not only irresponsible but a call to anarchy,\u201d the association stated.\n\nIt pointed out that the latest development was an affront on any civilised society and called for immediate decisive response by law enforcement agency.\n\nAccording to AFBA, the uncivilised and criminal response of rioting and destroying public and private properties in response to the arrest of some of the alleged perpetrators of the dastardly act showed how desperate fanaticism could lead.\n\n\u201cThe response of the Government of Sokoto State to the growing carnage is however commended and more should be done to check these lawlessness and restore public confidence in government and due process.\n\n\u201cThe African Bar Association calls for the hunt down and diligent prosecution of those fully or remotely connected with this grievous crime. The gory photos and live videos circulating round the world of this incident has added a further devastating blow to the already dented image of Nigeria as a responsible country in the comity of civilised world.\n\n\u201cWe join the world to condemn the gruesome murder of Ms. Deborah Samuel and insist that the full wrath of the Law be brought to bear on the perpetrators. # JUSTICE FOR DEBORAH,\u201d it added.\n\nAdeboye Postpones Sokoto Crusade over Murder of Deborah Samuel\n\nMeanwhile, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has postponed a crusade scheduled to hold in Sokoto State following the killing of the female student.\n\nThe crusade titled, \u2018Light Up Sokoto Crusade,\u2019 was scheduled to hold physically in the north-west state from May 16 to 17, 2022.\n\nHowever, Adeboye announced the postponement of the crusade in a Facebook post on Monday night, saying the shifting of the programme became necessary due to the unrest in the state.\n\nAccording to him, the planned religious event would now hold virtually at a later date.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cPostponed but God turned it around. We Trust in Our God\u2019s Big Picture Plan! When God turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. We serve a God who specialises in using the impossible situation for his glory.\n\n\u201cIf you are in doubt, look closely at the death and resurrection of Jesus! Devil thought he killed Him, but His death and resurrection resulted into life for many. He keeps turning it around for our good. It is in this might that we proceed!\u201d\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria had called for a nationwide protest slated for May 22 to demand justice for the slain Sokoto student, even as her murder continued to attract widespread anger.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022New delegates\u2019 template favours Lawan\n\n\u2022Ganduje: I believe APC will pick presidential candidate from South\n\n\u2022Says Osinbajo is a loyal, successful vice president\n\n\u2022APC commences screening of 2,822 House of Assembly aspirants today\n\n\u2022Denies altering presidential primary date\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Emameh Gabriel\n\n\n\nIn a move that is certainly going to generate shock waves around the country and heighten the already tensed political situation, it has come to light that the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is working towards zoning its presidential ticket to the North-east, with the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan likely to emerge as its presidential candidate in the 2023 elections.\n\nMany in the South who have been strident in calls for the presidential ticket to be zoned to the South after eight years of Buhari in the saddle are will not likely to be amused by this evolving development.\n\nAlso, with the latest decision of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) to allow ad-hoc delegates to elect presidential candidate at its forthcoming convention, the chances of a northern aspirant emerging as the presidential standard bearer have brightened even more.\n\nA reliable source in the ruling party who disclosed the new zoning arrangement in the APC to THISDAY yesterday, further confirmed Monday\u2019s disclosure by Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal that the party may have settled for Lawan as its presidential candidate.\n\nIt also confirmed a recent THISDAY report that National Assembly\u2019s latest amendment to the Electoral Act, 2022, to allow statutory delegates \u2013 all those elected \u2013 to participate and vote in the conventions, congresses or meetings of political parties, was designed to boost the chances of the Senate President in the 2023 presidential race.\n\nTHISDAY had reported that the aim of the fresh amendment to the Electoral Act which received accelerated passage at both chambers of the National Assembly, was to increase the chances of Lawan in the party\u2019s presidential primaries and subsequently boost the Party\u2019s chances of retaining in the 2023 presidential elections.\n\nHowever, if President Muhammadu Buhari assents to the Electoral Act 2022 Amendment Bill before him, which will allow statutory delegates to participate in the presidential primaries the dynamics of the contest will change dramatically in favour Lawan\n\nThe current Electoral Act 2022 (as amended) has no role for statutory delegates at the convention.\n\nStatutory or \u201cSuper\u201d delegates are elected Councillors, local government chairmen and their vice, party chairmen in the 774 LGAs and six Abuja area councils, state and federal lawmakers, governors and their deputies, president and vice president, NWC members, state party chairmen and secretaries.\n\nThe provision in the Principal Act reads: \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall clearly outline in its constitution and rule the procedure for the democratic election of delegates to vote at the convention, congress or meeting.\n\nLast week, federal lawmakers amended Section 84 of the Principal Act by deleting subsection (8) and inserting a new subsection (8) as follows: \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidates shall clearly outline in its constitution and rules the procedure for the democratic election of delegates to vote at the convention, congress or meeting, in addition to statutory delegates already prescribed in the Constitution of the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the National Assembly is trying to do is to back Lawan with the huge number of statutory delegates of past and present legislators that the amendment would allow to attend such conventions and congresses. They are in the region of almost 4,000, who are most likely going to throw their support behind Lawan. So, that is why they are trying to amend the law again to suit their own selfish purposes and calculations,\u201d a source who pleaded to remain anonymous had stated.\n\nOn the other hand, the source hinted that the APC was considering either zoning the position of the vice president to either the south-west or south-south.\n\nUnder the new APC arrangement, it was gathered that the Senate President might be zoned to the south-east if the ruling party gets the majority seat in the Red Chamber and the Speaker of the House of Representative zone by the APC to the North-west. In the same vein, it was gathered that the leadership of the party might have decided to zone its Deputy Senate President to the North Central and the Deputy Speaker to either the South-west or South-south.\n\nTHISDAY had yesterday quoted Tambuwal to have said: \u201cThey (APC) are gradually moving away from their zoning arrangement. We know their tricks. They want to see the outcome of our primary come May 28 and 29 before they will decide who will be their candidate.\n\n\u201cLook at the APC national chairman. He is quiet about their supposed zoning arrangement simply because they already have plans to field Senator Ahmad Lawan depending on who is the presidential candidate of our party.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, while speaking on a national television reiterated his support for Lawan\u2019s presidential ambition.\n\nThe Senate Chief Whip added: \u201cWith Ahmad Lawan, I am ready to be the sweeper of the place (Aso Rock). I don\u2019t need to have a position if Ahmad Lawan is the president,\u201d the former Abia State governor noted.\n\n\u201cI can sweep the Villa; my house is very close to the Villa. I can be the sweeper of the Villa; it is just a stone\u2019s throw. I am not joking.\u201d\n\nAccording to the former Abia governor, some presidential aspirants are already considering stepping down for the Senate President. Kalu expressed optimism that Lawan has what it takes to reset the country.\n\nHowever, contrary to insinuations that the APC might have dropped the idea of zoning or picking its next presidential candidate from the south, Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, yesterday, said he believed the party would do everything possible to ensure it chose a southern presidential candidate.\n\nGanduje said this when he received the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, whom the governor described as both loyal and successful, at the Kano State Government House.\n\nIn a related development, APC would today commence the screening of 2,822 House of Assembly aspirants jostling for the party\u2019s tickets ahead of the May 22 primaries.\n\nThe party denied altering the date of its presidential primary, billed to take place between May 30 and June 1.\n\nGanduje received Osinbajo at the Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano, and accompanied him to the scene of yesterday morning explosion in Sabon Gari, from where they proceeded to the Government House, where the vice president was scheduled to hold his ongoing consultations with APC stakeholders and delegates in Kano State.\n\nSpeaking on the debate over the zoning of the party\u2019s presidential ticket, Ganduje noted that though the idea of zoning was \u201cnot constitutional\u201d, for the sake of equity and fair play, the party would work to ensure that the south produced the next president on the party\u2019s platform.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the next president will come from the South and we will work for that,\u201d he said.\n\nGanduje\u2019s position came amid speculations that the ruling party was planning to jettison the zoning of its presidential ticket in order to retain power in the north.\n\nReports early this week had it that it was the idea of retaining power in the north that informed the decision of the senate president, Ahmad Lawan, and Governor Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State to join the presidential race at the last minute.\n\nAlso, the ruling party inaugurated its screening committee for House of Assembly aspirants yesterday in Abuja, and said the exercise would end on Thursday.\n\nAPC raked in the sum of N5.644 billion from the sale of forms to aspirants vying for state assembly seats.\n\nTHISDAY can reliably report that the ruling party cleared all the 145 governorship aspirants screened last Friday, ahead of the governorship primaries to be held in 30 states on May 20.\n\nIt was also gathered that out of the 351 senatorial aspirants, the party had so far given a clean bill to 340 to contest the primary election scheduled for May 25. The outcome of the screening for the remaining aspirants was still being awaited.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that a senatorial aspirant from a South-west state, who had purchased the nomination form, failed to appear before any of the three screening panels at the weekend.\n\nIt was also gathered that of the 1,197 aspirants for the House of Representatives seats that were screened, preliminary reports on the exercise showed that Imo and Anambra states topped the list of states with disqualified aspirants. The affected aspirants, according to a party source, were disqualified following a series of petitions and allegations of criminal conducts against them.\n\nIn the meantime, following reports last week that the ruling party had altered the date of its presidential primary from May 30 to May 28, when the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had scheduled to hold its own poll to pick a presidential candidate, National Publicity Secretary of APC, Mr. Felix Morka, in a statement yesterday, described the report as fake.\n\nThe party stated that should an adjustment become necessary, such changes would be communicated via its official communication channels.\n\nMorka stated, \u201cOur attention has been drawn to a story of purported adjustment to the All Progressives Congress (APC) Timetable/Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election, which is making the rounds on social media.\n\n\u201cThe story should be disregarded as fake news. The party\u2019s Timetable/Schedule of Activities for the 2023 elections remain as earlier published: Governorship \u2013 Friday, 20th of May, 2022;State House of Assembly \u2013 Sunday, 22nd of May, 2022; House of Representatives \u2013 Tuesday, 24th of May, 2022; Senate \u2013 Wednesday, 25th of May 2022; Presidential \u2013 Monday, 30th of May to June 1st, 2022.\u201d\n\nAPC inaugurated 37 screening committees to screen House of Assembly aspirants and also to elect local government and state delegates ahead of the various party primaries.\n\nDeputy National Chairman, North, Senator Abubakar Kyari, while inaugurating the committees, said the screening would be conducted simultaneously with the election of local government and state delegates.\n\nNational Organising Secretary, Suleiman Argungu, described the assignment as one of the critical segments of the party\u2019s transition in the 2023 general election.\n\nArgungu said, \u201cWe will provide chairman and secretary of each committee. The guidelines specify roles of the committee, which includes minimum requirements; APC requirements; educational requirements; payment of form fees, which qualifies each aspirant to contest; sponsors and if anybody goes against Section 84(3) of the Electoral Acts as amended, stands disqualified.\u201d\n\nChairman of Kebbi State Appeal Screening Committee and Director General of Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, said the assignment was about building a foundation for the new leadership of the country that would emanate from the candidates of the various political parties.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Officials of the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development have been accused of failing to distribute $100,000 (N41.1million) allowances donated by three banks to Nigeria\u2019s women basketball team for their Tokyo 2020 Olympic participation.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a member of the senior women basketball team, D\u2019Tigress, revealed that their allowances, bonuses, training grant worth $4,900 had also not been paid.\n\nShe added that none of the D\u2019Tigress team members would show up in camp in preparation for the February 2022 FIBA World Cup if the Nigerian government failed to pay them.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe last time we checked, some of our allowances, bonuses and training grants have not been paid. All our accounts numbers have been submitted but still no remittance. Donations made by banks for players, officials, volunteer stipends etc. dating all the way back to 2018 but I will let the managers address the vendor/contractor\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cThey forget we all have a relationship and do communicate; $500 each 2018 FIBA World Cup for players and officials; $1,000 each for finishing final 8 in FIBA World Cup; $1,000 each bonus for winning AfroBasket in Senegal for 2019 players and officials.\n\n\u201c$300 - $400 each Mozambique Olympic Qualifier allowance balance, were supposed to be paid $100 per day; $2,000 each training grant balance from Tokyo Olympics, players only. The $100,000 donated by three Nigerian banks to all the players and officials that made D\u2019Tigress Olympics qualification possible final roster. The men also got $100,000 assigned to them, the total was $200,000.\n\n\u201cMiscellaneous expenses by players and officials; the full breakdown has been submitted to the outgoing Basket Ball President and the honourable minister, Sunday Dare.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to the association leadership, the Presidency, the Ministry and NBBF administration old and new, if these monies are not paid before the next qualifier of the next tournament in February 2022, FIBA World Cup, the entire D\u2019Tigress team will not show up in camp. We are all saying this as one unit and one voice.\u201d\n\nOn the poor outing of the team at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic, she said, \u201cWhoever watched the Olympics games and knows Nigerian Basketball could see that something was wrong. We didn\u2019t play our best because we weren\u2019t treated or given the best during one of the greatest stages and moments of an Athletes career.\n\n\u201cYes, we had some injuries, could have executed better but there were a lot of distractions around us like; Not knowing who we have available on the team. Not having enough practice time with each other to build cohesiveness.\n\n\u201cOur head coach did not prioritize adequate preparation nor trust his staff enough to delegate significant responsibility. Poor decision by the outgoing President Musa Kida, he avoided the D\u2019Tigress in camp because we inquired about our money amongst other basic things, when he made it to the U.S, he bypassed us in Atlanta to Vegas to support the men\u2019s team. He did not support us with any leadership personnel.\n\n\u201cI believe each player that has been a part of D\u2019Tigress since 2017 has their own thoughts and feelings about the dissolved NBBF Board and coaching staff over the course of the time. It is evident that our voices haven\u2019t been heard, our request for little things ignored, we are not being celebrated and recognized as this team deserves, instead allowances and bonuses are being owed by the NBBF and Ministry.\n\n\u201cOnce again, not having a General Manager (GM) on the team created unwanted disorder. This was the icing on the cake for all players with the emotional buildup over the years. We knew all we could do is stick together, try to stay positive and enjoy the Olympics the best that we could. As a team, we know if we were well prepared to play in the Olympics, that there would be no doubt we could have advanced out of our bracket. To our loyal Fans that has been by our side, we appreciate you all.\u201d",

          "text": "Officials of the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development have been accused of failing to distribute $100,000 (N41.1million) allowances donated by three banks to Nigeria\u2019s women basketball team for their Tokyo 2020 Olympic participation.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a member of the senior women basketball team, D\u2019Tigress, revealed that their allowances, bonuses, training grant worth $4,900 had also not been paid.\n\nShe added that none of the D\u2019Tigress team members would show up in camp in preparation for the February 2022 FIBA World Cup if the Nigerian government failed to pay them.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe last time we checked, some of our allowances, bonuses and training grants have not been paid. All our accounts numbers have been submitted but still no remittance. Donations made by banks for players, officials, volunteer stipends etc. dating all the way back to 2018 but I will let the managers address the vendor/contractor\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cThey forget we all have a relationship and do communicate; $500 each 2018 FIBA World Cup for players and officials; $1,000 each for finishing final 8 in FIBA World Cup; $1,000 each bonus for winning AfroBasket in Senegal for 2019 players and officials.\n\n\u201c$300 - $400 each Mozambique Olympic Qualifier allowance balance, were supposed to be paid $100 per day; $2,000 each training grant balance from Tokyo Olympics, players only. The $100,000 donated by three Nigerian banks to all the players and officials that made D\u2019Tigress Olympics qualification possible final roster. The men also got $100,000 assigned to them, the total was $200,000.\n\n\u201cMiscellaneous expenses by players and officials; the full breakdown has been submitted to the outgoing Basket Ball President and the honourable minister, Sunday Dare.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to the association leadership, the Presidency, the Ministry and NBBF administration old and new, if these monies are not paid before the next qualifier of the next tournament in February 2022, FIBA World Cup, the entire D\u2019Tigress team will not show up in camp. We are all saying this as one unit and one voice.\u201d\n\nOn the poor outing of the team at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic, she said, \u201cWhoever watched the Olympics games and knows Nigerian Basketball could see that something was wrong. We didn\u2019t play our best because we weren\u2019t treated or given the best during one of the greatest stages and moments of an Athletes career.\n\n\u201cYes, we had some injuries, could have executed better but there were a lot of distractions around us like; Not knowing who we have available on the team. Not having enough practice time with each other to build cohesiveness.\n\n\u201cOur head coach did not prioritize adequate preparation nor trust his staff enough to delegate significant responsibility. Poor decision by the outgoing President Musa Kida, he avoided the D\u2019Tigress in camp because we inquired about our money amongst other basic things, when he made it to the U.S, he bypassed us in Atlanta to Vegas to support the men\u2019s team. He did not support us with any leadership personnel.\n\n\u201cI believe each player that has been a part of D\u2019Tigress since 2017 has their own thoughts and feelings about the dissolved NBBF Board and coaching staff over the course of the time. It is evident that our voices haven\u2019t been heard, our request for little things ignored, we are not being celebrated and recognized as this team deserves, instead allowances and bonuses are being owed by the NBBF and Ministry.\n\n\u201cOnce again, not having a General Manager (GM) on the team created unwanted disorder. This was the icing on the cake for all players with the emotional buildup over the years. We knew all we could do is stick together, try to stay positive and enjoy the Olympics the best that we could. As a team, we know if we were well prepared to play in the Olympics, that there would be no doubt we could have advanced out of our bracket. To our loyal Fans that has been by our side, we appreciate you all.\u201d",

          "text": "German sportswear manufacturing giant, PUMA plans to sue the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports.\n\nThe development comes as the sportswear manufacturer terminated a four-year contract it had with Nigeria in a letter dated Wednesday, August 4, 2021, and signed by the company\u2019s director, Manuel Edlheimb.\n\nAccording to reports, the AFN under the leadership of Ibrahim Gusau had entered into a controversial $2.76 million deal with PUMA on July 24, 2019, in Doha, Qatar.\n\nThe deal reportedly led to a major crisis that split the athletics body into two factions, with Gusau and AFN First Vice President, Sunday Adeleye accused of sidelining other members of the board during the signing of the deal.\n\nThe deal, signed by the Gusau-led AFN, was due to expire in 2022, Punch reports.\n\nPart of the contract is that PUMA will supply apparel to all age categories to Nigeria\u2019s Athletics team for four years at no cost.\n\nIn addition, gold medalists at the Olympic Games will earn $15,000 (N6 million), silver medalists will get $5,000 (N2 million) while a bronze medal will fetch athletes wearing the PUMA apparel at the games $3,000 (N1.2 million).\n\nIn the latest development, PUMA officials have got in touch with officials of Gusau-led AFN informing them of an intention to sue.\n\nAccording to a source quoted by Punch, the sports ministry would be made a party to the suit \u201cbecause they issued a memo granting AFN permission to seek sponsorship. PUMA sees AFN as a representative of Nigeria with that memo. It gave them confidence that AFN had approval. They also claimed that as of the time of signing the contract, the parties involved are recognised by law and FG, and there was no faction to warrant suspicion. They believe an administration is a continuum and the agreement has government backing..\u201d\n\nThis was confirmed by the AFN First Vice President, Adeleye while appearing on Arise TV as a guest on Thursday.\n\nWhile displaying evidence and documents showing the FG\u2019s approval for the federation to seek a sponsor, Adeleye said, \u201cThe contract is a non-disclosure one. It is between PUMA and AFN with FMYSD\u2019s permission. We warned that this may lead to litigation and wrote to all parties involved, including finance and justice ministries.\n\n\u201cWe are sure that PUMA will go to court on this matter. Their officials have called that they are sending documents from their legal department. We wrote the minister on the implications for Nigeria. This won\u2019t make other companies deal with Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that Gusau-led AFN did everything possible to ensure that the image of the country is protected.\n\nOn why the kits were kept in a store, he said, \u201cOur AFN has been barred from using the facility in the stadium and we needed to run the activities of the association. We have a store and office that we run. The constitution didn\u2019t say our office should be in the stadium.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would take responsibility for the termination of the contract, Adeleye said, \u201cWe should be awarded because we are patriotic. The Federal Government asked federations to look for sponsors (before Sunday Dare). This contract precedes him. They are aware of the contract.\n\n\u201cWe worked with instruction. We looked for a sponsor so that the burden can be taken off the Federal Government. The sports ministry should be sanctioned. We need a shake-up in the sports ministry.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the minister and sports ministry under his administration. Our problems have never been this worse. Federations have issues but not to this extend. Despite a court order, the minister is resolute in destroying some people. We gave the kits out, the ministry said they were not going to use the kits.\u201d\n\nThe sports ministry\u2019s had insisted that Nigerian athletes at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will not wear PUMA because of the leadership tussle between the Gusau-led AFN board and the one being championed by the sports minister, Dare.\n\nIt was learnt that several efforts were made to give the athletes the PUMA kits, including shipping bags of kits with 40 items each to Tokyo through the Nigerian Embassy in Japan but to no avail.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of State Services (DSS) last year cleared Gusau and his vice president, Adeleye over corruption allegations levelled against them by the sports ministry.\n\nThe sports ministry in 2020 petitioned the DSS over the AFN\u2019s partnership deal with PUMA to kit Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams until 2023.\n\nThe DSS' response to the sports ministry\u2019s petition, titled \u201cRe: Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development (FMYSD), Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and Alhaji Shehu Gusau\u201d, dated September 3, 2020, and signed on behalf of the Director-General of the DSS by Bello Mustapha, was received on September 4, 2020, by the sports ministry.\n\nIn the letter, the DSS stated, \u201cThis Service (DSS) has thoroughly investigated the matter regarding the Puma deal. The under-listed findings were established:\n\n\u201cAthletics Federation of Nigeria entered into a valid contract with Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited.\n\n\u201cThe AFN gave Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited the mandate to source for sponsors for Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams on her behalf in a letter dated September 4, 2018, signed by Ademu A.

At the last count, we have about 25 who made submission of those forms. Three of them did not \u2014 senator Chris Ngige, Godwin Emefiele, Timipre Sylva did not submit their forms.\u201d\n\nAsked whether there were concerns over the buying of nomination forms by proxy, the APC spokesperson said at the point of purchase, anybody can procure forms for a politician to contest any elective position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is not fraudulent.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

The plan, similar to Disney+\u2019s $8 plan in the US, allows users to stream concurrently on 4 devices and access unlimited downloads across 10 devices.\n\nOn the service, South Africans will access original Disney content like the Star Wars series and Encanto; and features from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) like Moon Knight. South African users will also access Disney+\u2019s Star Hub where they can view features from other platforms like FX, Hulu, Freeform, and 20th Century Fox.\n\nMore competition for DStv\n\nComparatively speaking, Disney+ is the cheapest international streaming service available to South Africans, beating Amazon Prime Video at R136 ($8.55)/month and Showmax at R225($14.14)/month. While Netflix does have an affordable R49/month Mobile plan in South Africa, the plan only allows 1 user and 1 device. The only Netflix plan similar to Disney+\u2019s Standard R119 plan is Netflix\u2019s Premium plan which costs R199 plan and allows Ultra HD streaming on up to 4 devices.\n\nDisney\u2019s launch will also bring more competition for DStv which has been struggling to retain its users\u2019 on the platform. Last year, it lost over 100,000 high-value subscribers in 6 months after it cut off access to some sports channels from its packages.\n\nDStv, however, does have cheap monthly plans at R59 ($3.71) and R115 ($7.23) and is still the preferred streaming service for most South Africans with over 12 million subscribers (58% of DStv\u2019s total subscribers) glued to the platform.\n\nWhile platforms like Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video offer access to more international content, they also come with a major disadvantage, compared to DStv: users need to be connected to the internet to access their services.\n\nData is expensive in South Africa with 1GB costing an average of R78.50 ($5). An hour of streaming on Netflix consumes 1GB of data at standard definition, and 3GB at high definition. Watching just 20 hours of Netflix a month is equal to R1,560 ($98), almost twice the cost of DStv\u2019s most expensive Premium plan.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Adora Nwodo is making a name for herself in the cloud",
          "text": "Adora Nwodo is a 25-year-old software engineer based in Lagos. She currently works as a cloud engineer at Microsoft and is the author of Cloud Engineering for beginners. I\u2019m bringing Adora to Centre Stage because she has shown great commitment to strengthening developer communities across Nigeria and is an advocate for African women in technology.\n\nAdora Nwodo on cloud engineering and mixed reality\n\nKoromone Koroye: Hi Adora, thanks for agreeing to speak with me. Please, tell me a little about yourself.\n\nAdora Nwodo: I am a software engineer currently building mixed reality on the cloud at Microsoft. I am also a public speaker, published author, digital creator, and occasional DJ.\n\nKK: Are there any differences between cloud and software engineering, or are the terms interchangeable?\n\nAN: There are differences. Anyone who designs, builds, implements, and maintains software applications is a software engineer.\n\nCloud engineers are typically hired to deploy or scale up new and existing cloud resources. Cloud engineers literally do their engineering on the cloud, whether software engineering or DevOps engineering.\n\nKK: What does it mean to build mixed reality (MR) products?\n\nAN: Before I talk about mixed reality, let me briefly explain the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAR is essentially an enhanced and interactive version of our physical and real world. If you have ever used Snapchat or Instagram filters, you have interacted with AR somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, VR is a computer-generated environment that usually requires a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset to enjoy a fully-immersed digital experience.\n\nMixed reality blends both AR and VR and provides an interesting middle ground for both technologies. MR gives you the immersive VR experience and the chance to interact with multiple digital objects. Furthermore, MR gives you the illusion that these digital objects exist in your physical space. I can see holograms in my room when I wear a mixed reality headset, but I still get to experience my room as it exists in real life.\n\nKK: Fascinating! What do you enjoy about building mixed reality products in your current role?\n\nAN: I\u2019m building a platform called Mesh for Microsoft. Mesh is the engine that will power the metaverse. Building Mesh has been an exciting experience, primarily because most of the ideas we are working on are relatively new and unknown. Sometimes, building in uncharted territory without a pre-existing playbook to fall back on, can be frustrating. Still, I choose to enjoy the learning process of pioneering a new industry or sector.\n\nDigging deeper with Adora Nwodo\n\nKK: How did you get into cloud engineering? What piqued your interest?\n\nAN: Before joining Microsoft, I already had a vested interest in technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud engineering. When I found out about the Microsoft role and that it involved working with mixed reality, I was immediately interested in being a part of the team. During my early months in Microsoft, I primarily worked on the HoloLens before transitioning into cloud-related projects.\n\nKK: Is there a learning curve to accommodate cloud engineering? What are the specific courses people need to take?\n\nAN: If you\u2019re trying to come into cloud engineering, taking an introductory computer science course is essential. The cloud is basically a network of computers, so you need a foundational understanding of computers to understand what is going on. Take any fundamental course on computer science; learn about Linux, operating systems, networking, and cloud fundamentals of the computer.\n\nKK: Let\u2019s talk about your professional growth. Did your career kick off at a startup?\n\nAN: No, it didn\u2019t. I worked with an advertising agency as a software developer before moving to Microsoft.\n\nKK: What was it like transitioning from working at an agency to moving to a more structured and global company like Microsoft?\n\nAN: Joining Microsoft was a breath of fresh air for me, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily about the company as much as it was about the team. I\u2019m a big advocate for working with great teams rather than just great companies. The transition was easy for me because I was excited about the opportunity to build solutions I am passionate about and become the kind of engineer that I have always dreamed of.\n\nAdora on being an African woman in technology\n\nKK: What changes do you think need to be made for gender biases to be eradicated in our ecosystem? It\u2019s obviously going to take a while, but practically speaking, what kind of changes do you think need to be made?\n\nAN: When we talk about gender bias, some people think it\u2019s always conscious, but unconscious biases also exist. I implore African startups and businesses to hold recurring bias training sessions for their employees throughout the year. We can\u2019t start the mindset shift if we don\u2019t educate people and expose them to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nHannatu Asheolge: You are pretty influential in the Nigerian tech ecosystem. You\u2019re also a blogger, published author, and active YouTuber. How has putting yourself out there helped you grow?\n\nAdora Nwodo: Putting myself out there is one of the reasons I got into Microsoft at the time that I did. Being active in the developer community and on LinkedIn at that time put me on a recruiter\u2019s radar; it helped me acknowledge that I\u2019m a big fan of learning in public. If I didn\u2019t try to learn in public by posting tweets about things I was reading or learning, people wouldn\u2019t have reached out to me to offer help. Finally, it helped me build my network. Going to ecosystem-related events, meeting new people, and taking on collaborative projects has helped my professional growth.\n\nHA: You recently announced that you were accepted into a Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) programme. What does this acceptance mean to you as a young Nigerian woman?\n\nAN: I am excited about learning career-accelerating skills like leadership and business management, and I get to be a part of the impressive GSB network.\n\nHA: Do you have any tips you\u2019d like to share about balancing work life and school?\n\nAA: First of all, I don\u2019t know if balance is achievable. I like to think we just try our best and leave the rest to vibes, to a great extent. Delegation is a skill everyone needs to learn on the job. You don\u2019t have to do everything, primarily when you work with a team of talented people. How you prioritise your tasks and assignments matters as well. Prioritise, delegate, and ask for help.\n\nMy calendar has also made my life easier recently. I use it to schedule most of my days to avoid wasting time on unnecessary tasks.\n\nHA: You\u2019re very vocal about your non-work-related hobbies and interests. Can you share some of your favorite hobbies or after-work activities?\n\nAN: I love going around drinking wine and eating steak and mashed potatoes. I enjoy the whole restaurant-hopping thing with a bunch of my friends where we\u2019re just eating good food and drinking wine. I also DJ at lounges and curated events.\n\nHA: You\u2019re currently part of several communities. Can you share a few that have helped shape your professional and personal growth?\n\nAN: I\u2019ve been a part of several communities, but the one that really helped a lot at the start of my career was Google Developer Groups(GDG). I was a co-organiser for GDG Ajah and a member of GDG Lagos. My involvement with them helped me meet many tech people at that time. Currently, I\u2019m VP for the Nigerian chapter of the VR/AR Association. The goal is to advocate for VR and AR usage in this region and let the world see what Nigerian companies are doing with VR and AR technology.\n\nHA: You\u2019re a young woman with a thriving career. Do you see yourself sticking with cloud engineering for a long time, or is there a career pivot in your future?\n\nAN: There\u2019s a career pivot in my future. I see myself taking on more roles that allow me to make business decisions within tech organisations pretty soon. Engineering decisions are fun, but I definitely want to take on roles that will enable me to make more business and product decisions at some point in my career.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued rules and guidelines for all crypto and digital asset service providers on Friday, May 13, 2022.\n\nThe rules in the document, New Rules on Issuance, Offering Platforms and Custody of Digital Assets, include:\n\nNew licence requirements for platforms that deal with digital assets\n\nCategorisation of the platforms\n\nGuidelines for their operations\n\nSEC Rules for virtual asset service providers (VASPs)\n\nAnyone offering crypto or digital assets-related service in Nigeria is a VASP. The categorisation of VASPs is further broken down into:\n\nDigital Assets Offering Platforms (DAOPs): These platforms enable the issuance of digital assets for fundraising purposes. They can also be called Initial Coin Offering platforms. You can liken it to a place where public companies offer their stocks for sale, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n\nDigital Asset Custodians (DACs): According to the SEC, \u201cthis means a person who provides the services of providing safekeeping, storing, holding or maintaining custody of virtual assets/digital tokens for another person\u2019s account.\u201d These are crypto wallets like Metamask and Trust Wallet. Crypto exchanges fall into these categories too because they offer wallet services.\n\nDigital Assets Exchange (DAX): This is \u201can electronic platform which facilitates the trading of a virtual asset or digital asset.\u201d They are simply crypto exchanges such as Binance and Quidax.\n\nWho are considered VASPs?\n\nThe SEC identifies any platform that facilitates trading, exchange, issuance, and digital and virtual assets transfer as VASPs. It is an umbrella term for a person or entity that uses/offers any crypto-related services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Commission did not mention any monetary requirement for the registration of VASPs, but there are several requirements and obligations for the registration.\n\nRules for crypto exchanges\n\nIn addition to the general requirements for all VASPs, registering as a Digital Assets Exchange (DAX) \u2014 crypto exchange \u2014 operator requires the following:\n\n\u20a6100,000 application fee ($240)\n\n\u20a6300,000 processing fee ($722.46)\n\n\u20a630 million registration fee ($72,000)\n\nMinimum paid-up capital of \u20a6500 million ($1.2 million)\n\nEvery exchange serving Nigerians must be duly certified by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). This means exchanges such as Binance and Paxful will have to be registered with the CAC.\n\nEvery exchange will also have a SEC-approved board. The Commission will also approve the appointment of CEOs and other principal officers in exchanges.\n\nCEOs will hold office for no more than ten years. In the words of the SEC, \u201cThe Chief Executive Officer of a DAX Platform shall hold office for five years in the first instance and may be re-appointed for a further period of five years and no more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission did not clarify if the CEO\u2019s tenure period will be applied at one crypto exchange or at different exchanges.\n\nThis model is similar to the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The Nigerian Stock Exchange CEO, Oscar Onyema completed his 10-year tenure in April.\n\nExchanges will now be required to submit weekly and monthly trading information, quarterly, and annual financial reports, including compliance reports to the Commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SEC must also be notified before an exchange can cease trading operations. They are also not allowed to grant financial assistance to investors or employees to trade digital tokens.\n\nBefore any token or digital asset can be listed for trading on an exchange, the SEC must first issue a \u201cno objection\u201d approval for the token.\n\nThe exchange needs to demonstrate some level of information concerning the token or project. It must have the project\u2019s whitepaper \u2014 an informational document that contains why a token is being created, a roadmap and an incentive for investors \u2014 know its level of security, how secure its blockchain is and the number of nodes it has.\n\nIn addition, it should reveal if the project has suffered any hacks in the past and any security vulnerabilities it has.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s rules on exchanges signify a thorough understanding of how cryptocurrencies work. This has helped the Commission develop measures to protect crypto traders from trading scam tokens and ensure the safety of their funds in exchanges.\n\nHowever, sharing data with the SEC could be a privacy concern for many. Cryptocurrencies, after all, were created to give pseudonymity to financial transactions.\n\nSEC crypto regulations on creating or issuing tokens\n\nThere are currently 19,443 crypto tokens in existence, according to CoinMarketCap. Creating and issuing tokens is relatively easy, making it possible to develop scam tokens.\n\nWith crypto scammers stealing up to $14 billion in 2021, the need for even more protection for investors has never been more apparent.\n\nThe ease of token creation has led to the creation of popular scam tokens such as the Squid Token, which saw investors lose $3 million in two weeks.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s rules on token issuance are to tackle this problem and minimise victims of scam tokens.\n\nThe SEC will now require any business or entity looking to conduct an initial asset offering or initial coin offering (ICO) in Nigeria or targeting Nigerians to submit an assessment form and a draft of its white paper \u2014 an informational document that contains why a token is being created, a roadmap, and incentive for investors.\n\nAfter receiving all necessary filings, the Commission will take 30 days to determine if the project should be offered to Nigerians.\n\nBefore the assessment is complete, all digital asset offerings must have the disclaimer in the whitepaper clearly stating that the SEC has not determined if the asset is suitable for offerings or considered a security.\n\nAccording to the SEC, some digital assets can now constitute securities. The problem of identifying digital assets and cryptocurrencies has always been a major obstacle to their regulation.\n\nIf the SEC considers a digital asset a security under the Securities Act of 2007, the asset will be registered as a digital asset and security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the SEC determine digital assets as security?\n\nGenerally, a security is a financial instrument that holds monetary value, can be traded publicly, and represents part ownership in a company that has gone public.\n\nFor example, company stocks, bonds and mutual funds are examples of securities. Buying Tesla stock, for example, means you own securities and are a part-owner of the company.\n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that a digital asset that has the characteristics of a security will be considered a security by the SEC.\n\nIn the crypto world, governance tokens are examples of such tokens. They represent a level of ownership or control of an entity, and holders of the token have a right to vote on how a company should be run.\n\nThere\u2019s a \u20a610 billion ($24 million) cap on the amount of money that can be raised through digital assets.\n\nIn recent years, we\u2019ve seen crypto-focused companies try to raise money by issuing crypto tokens to the public. The SEC\u2019s new rules would mean that if a company, say Bitmama, wants to raise funds by issuing tokens, it has to do so on a platform that is VASP registered.\n\nIf the asset offering is to raise money for an entity that deals with digital/virtual assets, then it is a VASP and will need the proper registration to be considered as such.\n\nRules for Digital Assets Offering Platforms (DAOPs)\n\nDAOPs are platforms where digital assets are issued. They can also be called ICO platforms. Tokens are issued on these platforms for people to buy by entities looking to raise money. It is the same way public companies like Tesla and Google sell stocks. Registration for DAOPs is also quite similar to DAXs.\n\nApplication fee of \u20a6100,000 ($240)\n\nProcessing fee of \u20a6300,000 ($722.46)\n\nRegistration fee of \u20a630 million ($72,000)\n\nMinimum paid-up capital of \u20a6500 million ($1.2 million)\n\nAccording to the SEC, DAOPs are expected to carry out due diligence on all digital asset offerings and determine whether to approve them or not. They\u2019re also expected to provide investors with updated information on all digital asset offerings.\n\nLimitations to SEC\u2019s rules\n\nDecentralisation of the crypto space has been a significant challenge to its regulation, and the SEC\u2019s rule does not clearly state its regulatory plans for VASPs operating in the decentralised space.\n\nWhile the Commission can control what goes on in centralised exchanges, it is unaware of what people do on decentralised exchanges where no know-your-customer (KYC) protocol is required.\n\nEnforcing the rules on token issuance and determining which are securities is also limited by decentralised structures of crypto tokens.\n\nTokens that have the characteristics of securities are usually governance tokens mainly used by Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and are governed by smart contracts that carry out any actions agreed upon.\n\nWhile the SEC has its rules, following them could be a choice for some VASPs. However, the SEC can bank on investors to only invest in VASPs approved by the Commission for their safety.\n\nOf course, this is not a given.\n\nFor centralised and international crypto companies like Binance, it will be interesting to see how the SEC plans to enforce its rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

Engaging in actionable steps to strengthen our goal to provide innovative and disruptive products as well as build an empowered and efficient workforce is something we are committed to at GIGM.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEnahoro brings unquantifiable experience to this role and will drive value for all stakeholders through his leadership and initiatives. I am delighted that we were able to get him to embrace the long-term vision of GIGM as he takes on this new role.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Okhae hinted at GIGM embedding more customer-friendly features in its products. \u201cTechnology has been pivotal in positioning GIGM as an industry leader, and technology will be the premise on which the company will continue to lead the industry.\n\n\u201cThe digital age is primarily characterised by customer-first features with crucial attention paid to customised services. This new dispensation will focus on implementing future-proof business strategies while integrating more lifestyle features into the GIGM application enabling users to do things freely while moving freely.\u201d\n\nBuilding a sustainable business\n\nOver the past few years, GIGM has steadily incorporated technology into its operations, transitioning from a transportation company to a tech-driven mobility player. In 2019, it launched its services in Ghana as part of moves to become a pan-African player.\n\nThat was followed by the addition of payment services in 2021 as the company revealed its desire to facilitate the movement of not just humans and goods but also value.\n\nCommenting on GIGM\u2019s mobility goals, Okhae shared that the company plans to embed more lifestyle features in its products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMobility is beyond movement; it is about the ability to move easily and unhindered irrespective of the channel: land, rail, water, air, or virtual/augmented reality. While moving freely, people should also be able to move things freely. This is the new renaissance of GIGM and the bedrock upon which we will embed more lifestyle features in the existing customer app.\u201d\n\nWith the new leadership not including anyone from the company\u2019s founding team, it would be interesting to watch the business\u2019 attempts to stay relevant in the face of stiff competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has decried the country\u2019s over-dependence on crude oil, restating the need to enhance the nation\u2019s global competitiveness through increased investment in agriculture.\n\nThe governor, who described the dependence on oil as unsustainable, noted that with increased investment in agriculture, the country will be able to grow sufficient produce to ensure food security, create jobs and improve the livelihoods of citizens.\n\nObaseki spoke while addressing members of the Plantation Owners Forum of Nigeria (POFON), who were on a courtesy visit, at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nPredicting a bleak future with the country\u2019s current overreliance on crude oil, Obaseki said there\u2019s an urgent need to diversify as the nation\u2019s dependence on oil has not been able to enhance the global competitiveness of its economy.\n\nThe governor, however, noted that his administration remains committed to economic diversification through agriculture and will sustain programmes and reforms aimed at boosting the sector and ensuring food security.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs a people and as a country, it is all about economic competitiveness. Whether we like it or not, the current DNA of the Nigerian economy is being forced to change. That means our overreliance on crude oil has not increased our global competitiveness, particularly in the oil trade.\n\n\u201cFor us in Edo, we, fortunately, saw this coming and we have prepared ourselves for this transition that we are witnessing. We are in a race against time, just reading the news and seeing what other countries are going through as a result of the Ukrainian war.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cIt\u2019s really scary that we cannot continue in this direction. Last week, Indonesia and Malaysia banned the export of oil palm. Specifically for us in Edo, agriculture is key because food production is our priority. First, let\u2019s feed ourselves and the extra we have, we will use it to trade.\n\n\u201cWe are glad that we have members of the Plantation Owners Forum of Nigeria. You can say whatever you want about agriculture, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s about skill and the training of the personnel, which I believe is the most important aspect in agriculture.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get all of these right, we cannot compete. We need to be able to produce at a competitive rate to be able to sell. So, that is why I want to encourage you to continue what you are doing. For us in Edo, we have a huge opportunity and a unique advantage because you can\u2019t transverse Nigeria without coming to Edo,\u201d the governor added.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of POFON, Mr. Emmanuel Ibru, who identified the importance of agriculture to the economy, said Edo is one of their major palm oil-producing states in the country as most of their major stakeholders are from Edo.\n\nCommending the governor for his initiatives to boost agriculture development in the state, he noted, \u201cWe know that Edo has been making giant strides in various oil palm initiatives.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Wednesday, received members of the Bayelsa State Due Process Bureau who were in the state to understudy Edo\u2019s e-procurement system, with the governor charging states on effective management of resources to improve the lives of the citizens.\n\nObaseki, while speaking to the delegates at the Government House in Benin City, noted that e-procurement remains key for states with scarce financial resources to deliver on their mandate, ensuring sustainable growth and development.\n\nThe governor said Edo State\u2019s procurement process has moved from analog to digital system which introduced a new level of transparency that has continued to address all forms of manipulations and corruption in the procurement process.\n\nHe noted, \u201cIn view of the scarcity of resources, it is important to appropriately manage the resources available and put them to proper and greater use for the benefit of the people. It\u2019s only an effective and transparent e-procurement process that can make it possible to achieve this.\n\n\u201cE-procurement helps in managing scarce financial resources effectively and it propels development and progress. E-procurement is key, especially for states that don\u2019t have much financial resources. Effectively managing the little resources available helps the developmental efforts.\u201d\n\nObaseki further stated, \u201cAbout 12 years ago, we had the privilege of seeking budget support facilities from the World Bank and the emphasis was on the need for a stronger procurement unit. Nobody wants to give you money if they are not sure that you can spend it properly.\n\n\u201cWe have one of the oldest e-procurement units in the country. We have moved from the analog era to the technology era in our procurement system in Edo State. We have a system where we procure properly. We have found that technology is the way to go. We now use technology to facilitate our procurement process in the state.\n\n\u201cTechnology introduces a different level of transparency that will fight all forms of manipulations because it allows everyone to see the records at the same time, unlike manual process, thereby eliminating all forms of corrupt acts.\n\n\u201cThe transparent procurement process has a lot of benefits for the state as it helps in so many ways. When procuring infrastructure and other services, it is important to have a robust system that becomes a culture. It is important because it\u2019s in the best interest of the people, and the best approach to improving the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIGR is difficult to collect and after collecting it, it becomes obligatory to explain to the people how you spent the money,\u201d the governor added.\n\nThe leader of the delegation, Aaron Nicodemus Timiye, who is the Director-General of Bayelsa State Due Process Bureau hailed Edo for establishing a world-class procurement process that has become a template for other states.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are here to study the public procurement process, specifically the e-procurement system. We are here to exchange notes and ideas on e-procurement, and possible ways of improving our e-procurement process as Edo State is far ahead of Bayelsa State in terms of e-procurement.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has reviewed the Fund\u2019s sovereign arrears policies, endorsing main recommendations of the staff paper \u201cReviews of The Fund\u2019s Sovereign Arrears Policies and Perimeter.\u201d\n\nA statement from the Fund on Tuesday said the review is the last step in a multi-year modernization of the Fund\u2019s legal and policy framework for treatments of sovereign debt in IMF arrangements.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cIt adopts incremental but important amendments that aim to support more effective, orderly, and transparent resolution of sovereign debt difficulties in member countries.\u201d\n\nRecognizing the disruptive nature of sovereign arrears for Fund members and the international community at large, the Fund\u2019s legal and policy framework for sovereign debt includes a policy of non-toleration of arrears (NTP) to international financial institutions and official bilateral creditors in specific circumstances, complemented by the policy on Lending Into Arrears (LIA) to private creditors, which was adopted in 1989 and last reviewed in 2002 and the Lending Into Arrears to Official Bilateral Creditors (LIOA) policy adopted in 2015.\n\nThe IMF said that in light of the evolution in the creditor landscape\u2014including the emergence of new official bilateral and International Financial Institution creditors and instruments\u2014the Executive Board also endorsed staff\u2019s recommendations on the Fund\u2019s definitions and practices used to categorize claims when applying these arrears policies.\n\nThe main changes are in four areas:\n\nFor areas that witnessed changes were: The LIA policy has been revised to place greater emphasis on debt transparency, and streamlined by eliminating the reference to a formal negotiating framework.\n\n*The Fund\u2019s existing practice governing lending to members who are not in arrears but seeking a debt restructuring (\u201cpreemptive debt restructurings\u201d) is codified into a formal policy, with an emphasis on debt transparency along the lines of the LIA policy.\n\n* While the LIOA policy remains unchanged (given limited experience with its application since its adoption in 2015), the Fund\u2019s definition of an official bilateral claim was updated in light of the recent evolution of the creditor landscape (such as new creditors and new types of instruments).\n\n* The NTP with respect to IFIs has been updated to provide clarity on how new IFIs will be treated.\n\nAs is currently the case, the question of whether an IFI should benefit from the NTP will remain a judgment call informed by several factors. In addition to the existing factors\u2014global membership, treatment by the Paris Club, and participation in the HIPC initiative\u2014the Board will also consider whether the institution is a Regional Financing Arrangement and whether the IFI is receiving preferred creditor treatment by the official bilateral creditor community.\n\nFor all other IFIs, the NTP would apply in cases when a restructuring involving official creditors is not required, while the LIOA would apply in the remaining cases.\n\nThe board agreed that, overall, the Fund\u2019s arrears policies have worked well in enabling the Fund to proceed with providing financing in cases of arrears.\n\nAt the same time, they noted that practice in sovereign debt restructuring and the creditor landscape have evolved over the last 20 years and certain updates are in order. Directors agreed that the proposals endorsed today are accurately reflected in the Executive Board understandings in Supplement 2 of the main paper to be issued shortly.\n\nFirst, Directors agreed that debtors would be expected to share \u201crelevant\u201d information, generally aligned with what the member would be required to share under the Debt Limits Policy.\n\nThey noted that this expectation would replace the earlier two-track approach on confidential and non-confidential information. Directors emphasized, however, that decisions on an adequate macroeconomic framework and the design of the financing plan or the adjustment program that could form the basis for the Fund\u2019s lending into arrears will remain in the sole purview of the Fund.\n\nThe Directors considered that any terms offered to the creditors by the member should be consistent with the parameters of the Fund-supported program.\n\nThey also expected that the debtor should provide clarity on the perimeter of claims that would be subject to the private-sector debt restructuring at the outset of the debt restructuring process.\n\nDirectors reiterated their support for the use of flexibility in applying the LIA policy in emergency financing cases, in line with the flexibility provided under the LIOA policy.",
          "summary": "The executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has reviewed the Fund\u2019s sovereign arrears policies, endorsing main recommendations of the staff paper \u201cReviews of The Fund\u2019s Sovereign Arrears Policies and Perimeter.\u201dA statement from the Fund on Tuesday said the review is the last step in a multi-year modernization of the Fund\u2019s legal and policy framework for treatments of sovereign debt in IMF arrangements.\nFor all other IFIs, the NTP would apply in cases when a restructuring involving official creditors is not required, while the LIOA would apply in the remaining cases.\nThe board agreed that, overall, the Fund\u2019s arrears policies have worked well in enabling the Fund to proceed with providing financing in cases of arrears.\nAt the same time, they noted that practice in sovereign debt restructuring and the creditor landscape have evolved over the last 20 years and certain updates are in order.\nThey also expected that the debtor should provide clarity on the perimeter of claims that would be subject to the private-sector debt restructuring at the outset of the debt restructuring process.",

          "title": "NDDC: Group Urges Buhari, APC, To End \u2018Ongoing Illegality\u2019, Inaugurate Board",
          "text": "Niger Delta Elders\u2019 Forum (NDEF) has again urged President Muhammadu Buhari to end what it called ongoing illegality in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), and comply with the law setting up the Commission, fulfil his promise of June 24, 2021, and inaugurate the substantive board to manage the Commission for the benefit of the people of the nine Niger Delta states.\n\nAccording to Tonye Ogbogbula, National President of the group, \u201camity between the President Muhammadu Buhari government and the people of Nigeria who he governs is based on trust which is earned from promises made and promises kept.\u201d He observed that \u201cone of such promises by President Buhari to the nation was made on June 24, 2021 when, receiving the leadership of the Ijaw National Congress (INC), he unequivocally committed to inaugurate the NDDC Board upon the receipt of the Commission\u2019s Forensic Audit report, which report has been submitted to him since September 2, 2021.\u201d\n\nThe President said: \u2018\u2018Based on the mismanagement that had previously bedeviled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021. I want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated.\u201d\n\nNDEF regretted that \u201cnot only has the President not fulfilled his promise eight months after, which prompted the Ijaw National Congress (INC) to describe the delay in the inauguration of the NDDC Board as a \u201cclear betrayal of trust and display of state insensitivity on Ijaw nation and Niger Delta region,\u201d it further negates this government\u2019s touted commitment to the rule of law.\u201d\n\nOgbogbula stated that it is sad that for a government which prides itself for adherence to rule of law, President Buhari\u2019s Government conversely continues to administer the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) in flagrant violation of the NDDC Act. He noted that \u201cas a Commission established in 2000 by an Act of Parliament, the ongoing national embarrassment at NDDC should be of grave concern to President Buhari about his legacy when he leaves office in 2023 and thereby persuade him to put an end to the illegality of further administering NDDC with a Sole Administrator that is not known to the law setting-up the Commission.\u201d\n\nNDEF President recounted that \u201csince the inauguration of the Buhari Presidency on May 29, 2015, it has serially violated the law setting up NDDC by consistently choosing to administer the Commission through illegal interim managements and sole administrator contraptions that are alien to the law setting up NDDC. In the seven-year tenure of President Buhari, NDDC has only been administered by a substantive Board for two years, between November 2016 and January 2019 when Senator Victor Ndom-Egba was Chairman while Nsima Ekere was the Managing Director.\u201d\n\nHe further observed that \u201cthere is a pattern of illegalities instituted by the current administration to undermine accountability at the NDDC in a way that no other federal agency has been so treated in the last seven years of the Buhari Presidency. In the 15-year history of the NDDC, prior to President Buhari\u2019s coming in 2015, an interim appointment had never been made outside of the law, even when the Governing Boards were dissolved.\u201d\n\nOgbogbula, in recounting the series of aberration in NDDC stated that \u201cprior to Buhari\u2019s coming to power in 2015, in the absence of a Board duly constituted in line with the NDDC Act, the most senior civil servant in the NDDC took over as Managing Director in acting capacity for a brief period until a Board was constituted in line with the NDDC Act. The NDDC Act does not permit the appointment of any external persons from outside the Commission to act as Managing Director or Sole Administrator without compliance with the Act which requires nomination by the President and Confirmation by the Senate. This is the same requirement for Ministers of the Federal Republic. The Law does not permit for anyone to be appointed as Acting Minister in any Ministry. If there is no Minister in a Ministry, the most senior civil servant \u2013 i.e. the Permanent Secretary holds forth until a Minister is appointed by the President and duly confirmed by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOgbogbula recalled that \u201cthe orderly succession in NDDC was only breached in 2015 by the Buhari Administration when it dissolved the Bassey Henshaw led Board with Dan Abia as Managing Director, and appointed Ibim Semenitari as Sole Administrator, a position she held illegally for over one year. The illegality in NDDC continued in January 2019 when President Buhari dissoved the two-year old Victor Ndoma-Egba led Board and replaced the Board with an Interim Management team led by Professor Nelson Brambaifa. It was not until August of 2019 that the Buhari Presidency ended the illegal Brambaifa interim management team and then, in accordance with the law establishing NDDC forwarded the list of nominees for a 16-member Board to the Senate for confirmation, and then dutifully appointed the most senior civil servant at that time in NDDC, Mrs. Akwaghagha Enyia, as Acting Managing Director pending the Senate confirmation of the President\u2019s nominees as NDDC Board members, which list he forwarded to the Senate on October 18, 2019.\u201d\n\nBut according to the NDEF President, \u201cunfortunately again President Buhari relapsed to its recourse to illegality in administering NDDC, because as the Senate dutifully screened and confirmed the nominees of President Buhari as Board and Management of NDDC on November 5, 2019, this same government has since embarked on another spree of interim managements/sole administrator contraptions, while the Board confirmed by the Senate has been on hold since November 2019.\u201d\n\nSince October 2019 this government has appointed two illegal interim management teams led by Joi Nunieh and Professor Keme Pondei, respectively, and presently the Commission is illegally led by a Sole Administrator, Effiong Akwa, Ogbogbula stated.\n\nThe NDEF also regretted that \u201ccuriously, whereas the North East Development Commission (NEDC) has been allowed to function with its duly constituted Board in place in line with its NEDC Act thereby ensuring proper corporate governance, accountability, checks and balances and fair representation of its Constituent states, the NDDC on the other hand has been run arbitrarily in the last two and half years by Interim committees/sole administrator in breach of the NDDC Act even after President Buhari had appointed a Board for the NDDC which was duly confirmed by the Nigerian Senate on November 5, 2019, but was asked to be on standby for inauguration after the forensic audit.\u201d\n\nNDEF noted that \u201cunder the illegal interim managements/sole administrator contraptions, the combined two-year budgets for 2019 and 2020, as approved by the National Assembly was N799 Billion. Yet, as pointed out by Professor Benjamin Okaba, President of Ijaw National Congress (INC), under the interim management/sole administrator contraptions, \u201cover N600bn payments have been made for emergency contracts without due process; the 2020 budget was passed in December and N400bn was voted for the NDDC but the commission had spent over N190bn before the budget was passed, thereby violating the Procurement Act.\u201d\n\nThe group also recalled the Senate probe of NDDC in June/July of 2020 which revealed how the NDDC Interim Management Committee (IMC) blew N81.5 billion in just a couple of months in breach of extant financial and public procurement laws for which the Senate passed a resolution recommending that the IMC should refund the sum of N4.923 Billion to the Federation Account, and that the IMC should be disbanded, while the substantive board should be inaugurated to manage the Commission in accordance with the law.\n\nNDEF also recounted the November 2021 protest by the Association of Contractors of the Niger Delta Development Commission (ACNDDC) when the Chairman of ACNDDC, Joe Adia stated that the Commission \u201cpays N800 million each for so-called desilting jobs and yet contractors being owed N5 million you have refused to pay?\u201d in addition to the doubly-restated scandal, earlier this year, involving the illegal sole administrator contraption in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) when the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) alleged that \u201cillegal N20bn payment was made to ghost contractors over phantom jobs for phony distilling contracts purportedly awarded by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\u201d\n\nOgbogbula observed that \u201cThe Buhari administration, by its numerous illegal actions in the NDDC in the last two and half years has been de-marketing the APC in the Niger Delta region,\u201d quoting Godspower Tamunosusi as stating that \u201cNiger Deltans are very upset with the disdainful manner the region has been treated. There is increasing anger against the APC in the Niger Delta region as a result of the very poor, biased, illegal and provocative actions of the Federal Government in the handling of matters concerning the NDDC and the Niger Delta region.\u201d\n\nNDEF also recalled how, earlier in the year, The Niger Delta Rescue Movement (NDRM) vowed not to back the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 elections following the delay of President Muhammadu Buhari to inaugurate a substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nOgbogbula therefore stated that it is in President Buhari\u2019s best interest to keep good legacy by abiding to the law establishing NDDC. He noted that an Ijaw group, the Ijaw Interest Advocates (IIA), also known as Izanzan Intellectual Camp, in a statement signed by its leader, Arerebo Salaco Yerinmene Snr had earlier advised that \u201cThe Presidency and the President\u2019s family should remember to keep good legacies even after office. The government\u2019s flagrant disobedience of the laws guiding the establishment of an agency created to develop an impoverished region is unacceptable. We are again appealing to President Buhari to save the Niger Delta Development Commission by inaugurating the substantive board.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tonye Ogbogbula, \u201cPresident Buhari can no longer pretend that the unholy alliances amongst some serving and recently disengaged principal officers of the Federal Government to ignite uncontrollable crisis is not known to it. President Buhari must now rise to the occasion to save the Niger Delta region from the sorry state of those who have deliberately decided to exacerbate the palpable tension in the region. He should therefore heed the call of Niger Delta leaders, governors, youths, women, traditional rulers, civil society organisations, and other stakeholders, comply with the law setting up NDDC, and also fulfill his own promise of June 24, 2021, and inaugurate the board to manage the Commission for the benefit of the people of the nine Niger Delta states.\u201d",

I, therefore, want to alert all the candidates for House of Assembly, House of Reps, and Senate in Imo State are being informed and alerted to mobilize and be on the lookout for such moves and insist on ensuring the Electoral panel members show the list of the delegates which they are coming to the Primary with before any accreditation can start.\n\n\u201cAnd ensure at all cost that the illegal list is not used to avoid canceling all Imo PDP primaries because INEC monitors will record in their report that the fake list was used and anybody from the opposition can go to court and void our primaries.\u201d",

There was a building which was about to collapse, so our attention then was to get an excavator to ensure the building didn\u2019t fall on the general public. So that\u2019s what we were busy doing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe building now collapsed and the issue of whether it\u2019s a cylinder or not is not our own priority then. Our priority was to rescue the people who are inside the building that collapsed.\n\n\u201cSo now the government will set up a committee to fully investigate the actual cause of the explosion. So it doesn\u2019t matter whether the welder was using electricity or gas cylinder. The investigation will show whether he was using electricity or not. But all we are saying is that it\u2019s not a bomb blast,\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople can say anything because they want negative thinking. But if it\u2019s a bomb blast, and it has already happened, what is the interest there? Why do people insist it must be a bomb blast? What happened has already happened. Who were wounded were wounded. Whether it was a gas explosion or a bomb blast, what\u2019s the interest of the general public? What benefit do we have?\u201d he added.",

Victor Adewumi stated this yesterday when he visited the site of the incident at Oku Iboku Community in Uyo, to assess the level of repair works on the instance of the Minister of Power, Engr. Abubakar D. Aliyu.\n\nAdewumi, who briefed newsmen at the site, said the tower has been reconstructed and work has reached an advanced stage after three weeks, even with difficulties posed by the terrain.\n\nIn his words, \u201cThe tower has been fully reconstructed, restringing has to be done with the utmost care after other towers that were also tampered with have been fortified, to avoid the collapse of more towers. We are however doing everything possible to reconnect the line to the national grid\u201d.\n\nHe noted that the collapsed tower was not the only one vandalized and that restringing the transmission line involves bringing down the 330kV DC line on some suspension towers, that were minimally vandalized, up to the nearest tension towers on both sides of the collapsed tower and fortifying the suspension towers before restringing the lines to ensure quality work is done,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe noted that work has reached 70% completion and that TCN is working hard to ensure that the 330kV DC transmission line is completed and reconnected to the national grid in one week, to ensure the evacuation of over 400MW stranded power at the Odukpani Power Plant near Calabar as well as the restoration of power supply to Cross River State.\n\nEngr. Adewumi appealed to the public to help TCN in the fight against the vandalism of power infrastructure, saying that such acts are detrimental to Nigerians and the expansion of power infrastructure in Nigeria. He also assured residents of Cross River State and parts of Akwa Ibom State that the company was fast-tracking the completion and restoration process.",

ABCON under my leadership will continue to encourage our members to play the vital role of closing the exchange rate gaps in the market and reducing widening premium between the parallel market and the official window,\u201d he said.\n\nGwadabe listed several factors that continue to undermine the naira stability and the local currency\u2019s value against other currencies.\n\nThe ABCON boss called for the creation of BDCs\u2019 Autonomous Foreign Exchange Trading Window (BAFEX) with determined maximum daily limit for legible BDCs to access dollars from banks, autonomous market and diaspora forex widow at the prevailing market prices.\n\nHe requested for enhancement of existing BDCs\u2019 automation portals to file transaction returns on CBN/ABCON/NFIU/NIBSS portals for effective regulatory monitoring and supervisions.\n\nGwadabe also sought for the creation of an automation portal to encourage registration of undocumented and unlicensed operators for effective monitoring, identification and tracking of their transactions.\n\nHe said the reluctance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to open new windows through which foreign exchange can be attracted to the economy remains a key factor in the naira continued fall.\n\nHe said the non-inclusion of BDCs in the list of channels through which diaspora remittances flow to Nigeria, under the CBN\u2019s guidance and regulation, has reduced the volume of dollar inflows to the economy.\n\nAccording to him, the World Bank\u2019s latest Migration and Development Brief showed that Sub-Saharan Africa attracting $49 billion in 2021. The bank said officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to increase by 4.2 per cent this year to reach $630 billion.\n\nGwadabe said Nigeria\u2019s contribution to the remittances fund is expected to rise when BDCs are allowed to receive funds from Nigerians in Diaspora into the economy.\n\nHe said the BDCs are to perform this role through contactless and digitised channels that make collections easy and seamless.\n\nHe said there is urgent need to review the guidelines on BDC\u2019s Scope of Operations to include participation in payment space, such as agency banking, Point of Sale (PoS) services, inbound and outbound forex transfers, ATM Forex services, to reflect global business model practice.\n\nHe suggested that the BDCs should be allowed to access dollars or diaspora remittances through the autonomous forex windows that enable operators to receive IMTOs proceeds, carry out online dollar operations and Point of Sale (PoS) Agency, among others.\n\nGwadabe insisted that now is the time to break the current industry monopoly that puts the remittances market in the hands of few players depriving others from tapping into the plan.\n\nThe ABCON boss also called for the establishment of training institutes to enhance capacity and infrastructure in the industry and broaden players\u2019 business scope with cash-back incentives for those that patronize BDCs while also implementing a less cumbersome and complex documentation requirements for end users.\n\n\u201cThe BDCs should be able to operate a network of digital solutions for PTA/BTA. This would reduce overheads, and improve profitability. Some BDCs might still consider working closer with commercial banks. The ABCON can also be recognized as self-regulatory organization to enable it operate effectively and sanction erring members,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our resolve to align with the policy thrust of the apex bank and ensure that ABCON members play their roles professionally and strategically in the interest of the market and economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that de-marketing of BDCs by regulators and security agencies is not good for the stability of the market.

          "title": "Finland, Sweden Apply to Join NATO as Russia Pummels Ukraine",
          "text": "Finland and Sweden formally applied to join NATO on Wednesday, prompted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and triggering one of the most significant changes in Europe\u2019s security architecture in decades.\n\nThe applications came after more than 250 Ukrainian fighters surrendered to Russian forces at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol after weeks of resistance, bringing an end to the most devastating siege of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nFinland and Sweden were both neutral throughout the Cold War and their decision to join NATO reflects the sweeping shift in public opinion in the Nordic region since Russia\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion.\n\nIt also brings about an expansion of the Western alliance that Russian President Vladimir Putin had long invoked as one of the main justifications for ordering his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine in February.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic moment, which we must seize,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a ceremony in which the Swedish and Finnish ambassadors to the alliance handed over their application letters.\n\nRatification of all 30 allied parliaments could take up to a year, diplomats say.\n\nTurkey has surprised its allies in recent days by saying it had reservations about the new prospective members, but Stoltenberg said he thought the issues could be overcome.\n\nAnkara has said it wants the Nordic countries to halt support for Kurdish militant groups present on their territory and lift bans on some sales of arms to Turkey.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden will host the leaders of Sweden and Finland at the White House on Thursday to discuss the applications, the White House said.\n\nAfter weeks in which Russia threatened retaliation against the NATO plans, Putin appeared to abruptly climb down, saying in a speech on Monday that Russia had \u201cno problems\u201d with either Finland or Sweden, and that their NATO membership would not be an issue unless the alliance sent more troops or weapons there.\n\nThe steelworks surrender in Mariupol allowed Putin to claim a rare victory in a campaign which many military analysts say has stalled.\n\nWhile both sides spoke of a deal under which all Ukrainian troops would abandon the steelworks, many details were not yet public, including how many fighters still remained inside, and whether any form of prisoner swap had been agreed.\n\nPOSSIBLE PRISONER EXCHANGE\n\nBuses left the steelworks late on Monday in a convoy escorted by Russian armoured vehicles. Five arrived in the Russian-held town of Novoazovsk, where Moscow said wounded fighters would be treated.\n\nSeven buses carrying Ukrainian fighters from the Azovstal garrison arrived at a newly reopened prison in the Russian-controlled town of Olenivka near Donetsk, a Reuters witness said.\n\nRussia said at least 256 Ukrainian fighters had \u201claid down their arms and surrendered\u201d, including 51 severely wounded. Ukraine said 264 soldiers, including 53 wounded, had left.\n\nRussian defence ministry video showed fighters leaving the plant, some carried on stretchers, others with hands up to be searched by Russian troops.\n\nThere were some women aboard at least one of the buses in Olenivka, Reuters video showed.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had personally guaranteed the prisoners would be treated according to international standards, and Ukrainian officials said they could be exchanged for Russian captives.\n\nUkrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Kyiv aimed to arrange a prisoner swap for the wounded once their condition stabilised.\n\nRussian Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations Dmitry Polyansky said there had been no deal, tweeting: \u201cI didn\u2019t know English has so many ways to express a single message: the #Azovnazis have unconditionally surrendered.\u201d\n\nTASS news agency reported a Russian committee planned to question the soldiers, many of them members of the Azov Battalion, as part of an investigation into what Moscow calls \u201cUkrainian regime crimes\u201d.\n\nFighters of the Azov Regiment are lionised as heroes in Ukraine, but reviled by the Kremlin as a band of Russia-hating neo-Nazis.\n\nHigh-profile Russian lawmakers spoke out against any prisoner swap. Leonid Slutsky, one of Russia\u2019s negotiators in talks with Ukraine, called the evacuated combatants \u201canimals in human form\u201d and said they should be executed.\n\nFormed in 2014 as an extreme right-wing volunteer militia to fight Russian-backed separatists, the Azov Regiment denies being fascist or neo-Nazi. Ukraine says it has been reformed and integrated into the National Guard.\n\nBATTLE FOR DONBAS\n\nThe battle for Mariupol is Russia\u2019s biggest victory since its invasion, giving it control of the Azov Sea coast and an unbroken stretch of eastern and southern Ukraine. But the port lies in ruins, and Ukraine believes tens of thousands of people were killed under months of Russian bombardment.\n\nRussia\u2019s offensive in the east, meanwhile, appeared to be making little progress, although the Kremlin says all its objectives will be reached in its bid to \u201cdemilitarise\u201d Ukraine.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military command said Russia continued to shell Ukrainian positions along the entire frontline in the east on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIn the Kharkiv direction, the enemy focused on maintaining its positions and preventing the further advance of our troops,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s general staff said in a statement.\n\nAround a third of the Donbas was held by Russia-backed separatists before the invasion. Moscow now controls around 90% of Luhansk region, but it has failed to make major inroads towards the key cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in Donetsk in order to extend control over the entire Donbas.\n\nUkrainian forces have advanced at their fastest pace for more than a month, driving Russian forces out of the area around Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city.\n\nUkraine says its forces had reached the Russian border, 40 km (25 miles) north of Kharkiv. They have also pushed at least as far as the Siverskiy Donets river 40 km to the east, where they could threaten Russian supply lines.",

I guarantee you that I will run a transparent, rewarding, inclusive and open government. Nigeria is rich. What we need is to redirect our resources and channel them in the right direction to bring about prosperity.\u201d\n\nBut Anyim, who also met delegates in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Tuesday, said he was fully prepared by his experience and exposure for the office of the President of Nigeria, because he had clear ideas of the challenges facing the country and the solutions they demanded.\n\nOn the broad agenda of his programme, the presidential aspirant categorised Nigeria\u2019s problems into three namely: political, economic and social, saying he gathered profound experience from his over 30 years of public service including being a senator, President of the Senate, and secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), adding that he would be bringing these experiences in running the country if Nigerians elect him as president next year.\n\n\u201cAt the formation of our nation (Union), there were lots of negotiations, constitutional conferences and even the Willinks Commission to allay the fears of the minority tribes. The lesson here is that the buy-in of all component segments of the nation is required to build the nation.\n\n\u201cGiven that democracy is government of the people, by the people and for the people, therefore, any policy of government that does not have the buy-in of the people is not likely to succeed. This accounts for the failure of several attempts to advance our nation.\u201d\n\nPresenting what he called his \u201cpathway to a greater Nigeria,\u201d to the party delegates from all the six states of Lagos, Oyo, Osun, Ondo, Ekiti and Ogun, Anyim described the Southwest as the brainbox of the nation and promised to partner with the zone on the issue of restructuring.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and George Okoh in Makurdi",
