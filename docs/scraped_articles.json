          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA Consultant Public Health Physician, Dr. Chukwuma Anyaike, has urged stomach ulcer patients to seek appropriate treatment, noting that dieting cannot cure the health condition.\n\nDr. Anyaike who is also the National Coordinator of the National Tuberculosis, Leprosy and Buruli Ulcer Control Programme, said an ulcer is a wound on the walls of the intestine, stressing that the wound cannot heal with mere dieting.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, Anyaike said it is risky for people to trivialise stomach ulcers, warning against self- medication.\n\nAccording to him, some people have lost their lives to stomach ulcers, as a result of self-medication and their refusal to seek help from experts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very wrong for someone to say that there is no drug for a stomach ulcer.\n\n\u201cFor the wound to heal, the person has to take a drug. It is not true that you will just take food for the wound to heal.\n\n\u201cUlcer is a wound on the walls of the intestine. The wound cannot just go like that without treatment,\u201d the physician explained.\n\nDr. Anyaike noted that a stomach ulcer could cause internal bleeding if left untreated.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat is why some of those suffering from it die of internal bleeding. So, some people die of bleeding ulcers. That is why people should stop commonising it. There is no scientific evidence to show that ulcer has no treatment.\n\n\u201cSo, how does the ulcer come about? Your body secretes a kind of fluid sometimes that is acidic. If it doesn\u2019t see any food, it will start corroding the walls of the gut and if it corrodes the walls of the gut, that is how the wound starts. Although there is also a worm said to usually cause that too.\n\n\u201cNow, when you eat food and the food touches that place, you will start having pain.\u201d\n\nThe expert said people suffering from stomach ulcers usually experience pain when the food that they eat touches the wound.\n\nDr. Anyaike said there are basic things that those battling ulcers could do to avoid the wound escalating.\n\n\u201cThey should make sure that they prevent anything that will touch the wound; they should take something that will reduce the effects of acid.\n\n\u201cAnd they should take some treatments, antibiotics and others that can help in the healing of the wound.\n\n\u201cWhen people say there is no drug for ulcers, I do not think it is correct information.\n\n\u201cAny drug that will help the wound to heal takes care of it. The wound cannot just go like that without treatment.\n\n\u201cThat is why if you are sick of ulcer, you have to go to the hospital and they will give you drugs and those drugs will reduce the pain and then give room for healing\u201d, the physician added.\n\nThe physician advised people struggling with the health condition to avoid stress.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf you have an ulcer, you must make sure you don\u2019t stress yourself.\n\n\u201cEat well and avoid things that will trigger it. Take something mild, like milk, to reduce the effect of that acid.\n\n\u201cEat at intervals and don\u2019t keep your tummy empty. If you keep your tummy empty, once you take food, it will go and trigger the pain there.\u201d\n\nAccording to WebMD, an online portal, the most common remedy for stomach ulcers is a combination of antibiotic drugs to kill the H. pylori bacteria and medications to get rid of acid in the stomach.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Hon Comrade Philip Shaibu on Tuesday said the administration of Governor Godwin Obaseki was reforming the local government administration in the state to perform optimally like the state government.\n\nBesides, he said the government is currently profiling personnel of the state vigilante groups who are complementing the efforts of the conventional security apparatus to ensure arms do not get into wrong hands.\n\n\n\nShaibu spoke when he received the leadership of Akoko-Edo Forum (AEF) that visited the deputy governor to raise issues of development as they affect the area.\n\nShaibu also assured the delegation led by Dr. Charles Jagun that the Obaseki administration remain committed to leaving lasting legacies behind as governor of the state with the strengthening of governance structure like the bureaucracy that could function on its own.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cGovernance has been in recess in the sense that we have as a situation whereby a governor does things as \u201cthe spirit leads\u201d because there are no structures like the bureaucracy that will run the system through the civil service.\n\n\u201cWe audited the 18 local government areas from 1999 and what we saw was shocking. The local governments are very rich but the level of wastage is alarming so we want to bring in a system that works for all, we want to bring the local governments to the level of the state. We want people.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn security, Shaibu said \u201cWe are profiling our personnel in the vigilante so that arms will not get into the wrong hands. We are putting our strategies in place so that we will not be caught unprepared because soon the federal government will know that the issue of community police or state police is inevitable.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier, Jagun expressed the worry of the people of Akoko-Edo about its seeming abandonment lamenting that the area was left out in the recent decentralization of the Ambrose Alli University (AAU), Ekpoma appealing to government to revisit the decision and consider bringing one of the campuses to the local government area to boost its socio-economic and infrastructural development.\n\n\n\nHe also drew the attention of the state government to the dilapidated Ojirami dam which has the capacity to provide pipe borne water to the entire Edo North Senatorial District and the poor state of the general hospitals in Igarra, Ososo and Ibillo that lack infrastructure and personnel.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said \u201cAkoko-Edo has been in existence since 1954 and the only local government that has not been split. It looked like we had been abandoned. The AAU multi campus policy has been rolled out but we appeal to the government to look at the possibility of extending it to Akoko-Edo local government area.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Akoko-Edo Forum which is made of professionals from all fields and enthusiasts who are passionate about the development of the area is ready to collaborate with the state government to meet our goals.\n\n\u201cMining activities are going in several parts of the local government area but the people are not feeling the impact, this we think can be improved.\u201d\n\n\n\nJagun also appealed to the deputy governor to ensure that the next local government chairman of the council would be visionary to redefine the development and administration of the local government area.",

          "text": "The Federal Government says with the coming up of affordable world class health facilities, Nigeria will soon put an end to the over N500 billion being spent on medical tourism annually.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed said this on Tuesday in Lagos at a media tour of Duchess International Hospital, a 100-bed state-of-the-art multi-specialist healthcare facility.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the private sector-owned purpose-built hospital was constructed through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), with financial support from the Bank of Industry (BoI).\n\nSpeaking after a tour of the hospital, the minister said with more world class healthcare facilities like Duchess Hospital coming on stream, Nigeria is set become a destination for medical tourists.\n\nHe said the country would soon welcome foreign patients and medical personnel on its shores rather than having its citizens travel yearly and spending more than N500 billion for medical tourism.\n\n\u201cWe as a country will also conserve our foreign reserves while earning foreign exchange, we will begin to reverse the brain drain in the health sector; create jobs and provide affordable and standard healthcare for our people.\n\n\u201cOf course, facilities like Duchess International are veritable tools for job creation, in addition to attracting medical tourists from across the world.\n\n\u201cIts a new dawn for the health sector and we are proud of what Duchess and other healthcare facilities are doing in bringing about this new dawn,\u2019\u2019 he said\n\nMohammed noted that although, the facility was private-sector driven, the Federal Government provided the enabling environment and funding for its realisation.\n\nHe recalled that in the wake of COVID-19, the CBN set up the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, which was later expanded to N200 billion.\n\nHe said the intervention fund was to provide credit support for the healthcare sector through long-term, low-cost financing.\n\n\u201cYou are also aware of the Federal Government\u2019s Intervention in the Healthcare Sector through the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\n\u201cThe NSIA has invested a total of 22.5 million dollars in two diagnostic centres in Kano and Umuahia (5.5 million dollars each) and the NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre in Lagos (11.5 million dollars). The NSIA is also committed to building a new quaternary hospital in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe essence of these financial interventions and projects in the critical healthcare sector is to fast-track the evolvement of world class healthcare facilities like this Duchess International Hospital.\n\n\u201cWith what we have seen here today, Nigerians can now get access to affordable and world class treatment in whatever is ailing them in many areas.\n\n\u201cThis includes emergency medicine, women\u2019s health, paediatric care, cardiovascular medicine, kidney dialysis, dental treatment, and eye care among others, \u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nWhile conducting the minister and his team of journalists round the hospital facilities, Dr Tokunbo Shitta-bey, the Chief Executive Officer, said the hospital was aimed at delivering the highest standard of healthcare to Nigerians.\n\nHe said the hospital would use the most advanced technology, personnel and treatments to provide Nigerians with the best medical expertise available anywhere in the world.\n\nShitta-bey emphasised that the guiding philosophy of the health facility was to cut down medical tourism in affordable manner with the same equipment and personnel found in the most advanced parts of the world.\n\nAccording to him, the facility is available for community service, patients in all strata of the society, offering wide range of specialised services and treatment.\n\nJustifying how affordable the hospital is, Shitta-bey said they charge only N5,000 for registration and consultation respectively.\n\nNAN reports that the six-storey hospital complex comprises of 16 Departments including the Cardiology Centre, physiotherapy room, ENT, Surgical and Gynecology Ward, Medical laboratories and Intensive and Critical care unit which are fully automated and equipped with modern equipment.\n\nIt also has the Endoscopy unit, Women and Children ward, Dialysis Centre, Dental Unit, Surgical Theatre (Modular and automated) and Pharmacy\n\nOthers are Emergency wards, Radiology Department, Play area for children and Learning and development Centre.

          "text": "Mbazulike Amechi\n\nBy Chimaobi Nwaiwu\n\nNNEWI \u2013 Foremost nationalist and First Republic Aviation Minister, Chief Mbazulike Amechi, Tuesday, took a swipe at the some Nigerians politician, particularly presidential aspirants who are claiming that nomination of interest forms were bought for them by people who are urging them to contest different positions in the 2023 general election, telling them to be ashamed of themselves.\n\nTerribly disappointed Chief Amechi, told Vanguard that, with their blatant lies, particularly from presidential seat aspirants, that people or groups bought forms for them, they are only telling the world that \u201csomebody who wants to preside over the government of over 200 million people, cannot make up his mind, that it is people that make up mind for him.\u201d\n\nChief Amechi said that it is only in a \u201cbreaking vessel\u201d called Nigeria, that politicians can come up with such blatant lies about people or groups buying forms for them, particularly the presidential seat aspirants, and people will believe them, saying that all their lies and maneuvers is calculated to keep away a certain section of the country out of the race.\n\n\u201cSo they think they are telling that to fools, they regard all Nigerians as fools and they are the fools we are looking like, for telling us that rubbish. Now somebody bought forms for you, somebody forced to agree and append your signature on the forms, what a lie.\n\nThe whole games they are playing is calculated to keep away certain section of the country. However it is for the people affected to come together and give a serious thought to their continued association or partnership in this breaking vessel called Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe things happening now about who occupies the seat of the president in 2023, is telling the world that this is a federation where corruption and stealing is officially allowed, committed and encouraged by the government. When you dole out N100 million naira to buy party nomination and interest form, how much is the yearly salary of the president of the country. It tells you that something is wrong with the fight against corruption.\n\nALSO READ:\n\n\u201cIs the yearly salary of the president of this country up to N200 million naira? How come appointees and lawmakers are doling out such an amount of money to buy forms, where did they get such money. Is the president making such amount of money genuinely every year.\n\nThey are telling Nigerians that it is rouges that are preparing to go in there. This is enough for the president to beware of people he wants to succeed him, He should know rouges are preparing to take over from him to control the keys of the treasury of the Central Bank.\n\n\u201cTheir intention is to scatter whatever that is remaining in the country and to squander the oil money and wealth of the country, that is what they are planning. Nobody is controlling them, they are telling the world that they are out of control, people that lack conscience.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody spend about N10 or N20 billion naira to contest election in a nation, when he enters into office, what do you think he will do, will he not first of all try to recover what he spent, and the most possible way or recovering what he spent, is it not by stealing from the treasury of the country, stealing the oil of the country, the only source of wealth of the country.\n\n\u201cHonestly I\u2019m very ashamed to be called a Nigerian, I\u2019m very ashamed to be called a Nigerian because this is not the country which I shed my blood and sweat in order for it to be found. This is not the Federation we fought for, and I\u2019m sure that the founding fathers of this country who are now in the other world will feel embarrassed and thoroughly ashamed that this is their country.\u201d\n\nChief Amechi, also expressed shock that an incumbent Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, is nursing ambition to become a president, to succeed his boss.\n\n\u201cAnd he is accepting that people bought form for him? And he proudly accepted it? Who is he talking to, does he think he is talking to idiots?\n\n\u201cAlso annoying is the claim that a group has equally bought form for former President Goodluck Jonathan. What a country! If former President Jonathan will be such a puppet that he can be manoeuvred like that, it shows the level of our intelligence, and the level of personalities that have presided over the affairs of this country. All of a sudden people who worked to throw you out of office are buying form for you to come back, yet they were the people that pushed you out of office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only God that will purify this country, it\u2019s not something He will do gently, he will wipe away this set of people out of the country, so that the wish of God for this nation to prevail. I doubt if this nation will continue to survive as a federation, I seriously doubt it.\u201d",

The results are there for all to see. Boko Haram terrorists have been forced back from controlling whole swathes of this country.\n\n\u201cInternally Displaced Persons are now returning to rebuild their communities.

          "text": "The Presidency has said President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration does not subscribe to suggestions that it would need to extend its tenure beyond the May 29, 2023 by six months to establish peace and security.\n\nIt also noted that calls on the administration to hand over to an interim government at the expiration of its second tenure is also unacceptable as it would be violating the rights of Nigerians to choose those whom they want to lead them through a democratic process.\n\nThe Presidency was reacting to two legal luminaries, Chief Robert Clarke (SAN) and Chief Afe Babalola, who in separate calls, expressed opinions suggesting that the administration should delay the upcoming general elections, extend its tenure by six months or constitute an Interim Government.\n\nThey both cited the national security crisis for their suggestions.\n\nBut a statement by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, noted that the administration had already started and is succeeding at stabilising the nation\u2019s security and hopes to complete the process before its signs out on May 29, 2023, emphasising the President Buhari would not violate the Constitution.\n\nOn call on the President to extend his stay in office by six months, the statement said: \u201cChief Robert Clarke, a very well-respected elder may be sincere in his wish for the President to extend his term by six months. We wish to categorically restate that the President will step down on May 29th, 2023, after serving two terms \u2013 as per the constitution.\n\n\u201cHaving been the first recipient of a democratic transfer of power from an incumbent administration to an opposition candidate in Nigerian history, the President is committed to extending and entrenching democratic values across the country. He shall, in turn, hand the privilege of serving the people of Nigeria to whomever they choose through free, fair and credible elections.\n\n\u201cHowever, Chief Clarke is right to say that without security, Nigeria would not likely realize its true potential as a peaceful and prosperous nation. That is why it has been at the core of this administration. The results are there for all to see.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram have been forced back from controlling whole swathes of this country. Internally Displaced Persons are now returning to rebuild their communities. These achievements have been accomplished through the bravery and determination of the Nigerian armed forces and the fortitude of the people of our nation.\n\n\u201cNew challenges have arisen and tackled in turn \u2013 whether it\u2019s the National Livestock Transformation Plan to alleviate herder-farmer clashes, the elimination of the leadership of ISWAP, or new efforts to combat banditry.\n\n\u201cTill the last day of the administration, the security of the citizens shall remain the administration\u2019s paramount concern. We shall finish the job. Yet, in any case, respect for the constitution and Nigerians\u2019 democratic rights remains the best path to securing and then maintaining peace\u201d, said.\n\nResponding to Babalola\u2019s call for an interim government, the statement said: \u201cyet there are others, such as Chief Afe Babalola, that believe elections should be suspended, with the current elected government replaced by an interim unelected administration.\n\n\u201cThis, he claims, is necessary to create a new constitution for the people, made possible, paradoxically, by ignoring their democratic rights. Down that path lies crisis and instability.\n\n\u201cInstead, this administration proposes something entirely simpler: honouring the constitution and people\u2019s right to decide\u201d, it said.",

          "text": "Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) has debunked claims Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK), also known as aviation fuel, was sold at N700 per litre in some parts of the country.\n\nMr Clement Isong, executive secretary of MOMAN spoke to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on yesterday in Lagos.\n\nNAN reports that Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) threatened to go on strike on May 9, claiming the cost of aviation fuel had risen to N700 per litre from N190 per litre.\n\nThe strike was, however, called off after appeals by the Federal Government and stakeholders in the sector.\n\nIsong said: \u201cI am not aware that aviation fuel is sold anywhere at N700 per litre. There has been an intervention by Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd., which is now bringing in ATK.\n\n\u201cIt gets into tank, all costs together, at about N500 per litre. If we use Ikeja (Murtala Muhammed Airport, local as a bench mark, it is sold there by marketers between N540 and N550 per litre.\n\n\u201cNobody with common sense will go and bring in ATK now that NNPC is bringing in product and selling it cheap.\n\n\u201cNNPC is bringing in the product because it is swapping it with crude and when it swaps it with crude, it uses Central Bank exchange rate of N419 to a dollar.\n\n\u201cThe product is deregulated. So, no normal person can go and get it at that exchange rate. You cannot use N589 (black market rate) to a dollar to bring in the product and sell at N550 per litre.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the intervention by NNPC has discouraged marketers from importing aviation fuel because it will be a bad business decision.\n\n\u201cATK as a product is handled very carefully. It is continuously filtered. It is carried by special trucks, so there are extra handling costs.\n\n\u201cEven with these costs, it is sold at the tarmac between N540 and N550 per litre in Lagos and by the time you carry it all over the country including transportation cost, it will be sold at about N570 or N580 at the farthest airport from Lagos.\n\n\u201cThere is no where aviation fuel is sold at N700 per litre,\u201d the executive secretary said.\n\nHe said enquiries made by MOMAN showed that aviation fuel was cheaper in Nigeria compared to other West African countries.\n\nIsong said: \u201cIn Ghana, aviation fuel is sold at Platt, North Western Europe, plus premium or minus at 1.25 dollars per litre.\n\n\u201cIn Liberia and Sierra Leone, it is selling at 5.70 dollars per gallon, which translates to 1.51 dollars per litre. So, those are your West African prices.\n\n\u201cNow, if you want to translate that to naira, if you are using the NNPC price which is N540, that is cheaper and even if you use the N700 they are claiming, it is still cheaper.\n\n\u201cWe are not selling it at N700 per litre because of the NNPC intervention. It is actually about 90 cents per litre with the NNPC price.\u201d\n\nIsong empathised with the airlines, Federal Government and Nigerians struggling with the consequences of the increment in the price of crude oil at the international market.\n\nHe blamed the hike in the price of crude oil and its derivatives, such as aviation fuel, petrol, diesel and kerosine on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe airlines know what they want, which is justification to increase their air fares. It is not only aviation fuel that has gone up, even though it is a contributory factor.\n\n\u201cCost of operation has gone up; there is inflation and anybody doing business will tell you that they are struggling. All businesses are struggling including the airlines.\n\n\u201cSo, maybe they are looking for bailout from the Federal Government because everybody needs some kind of bailout at the moment,\u201d he said.

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThis is as former CBN deputy governor and presidential aspirant of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Prof. Kingsley Maghalu, described Emefiele\u2019s involvement in politics as a massive breach of rule of law.\n\nMany analyst are of the opinion that his involvement in partisan politics can no longer guarantee the integrity of sensitive materials while others have called for his resignation or outright sack.\n\nFor several weeks Emefiele had denied rumours that he would be contesting in the 2023 general elections. Despite the rebuttals, last week, three interest groups, the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), \u201cFriends of Emefiele\u201d and \u201cEmefiele Support Group\u201d had purchased the All Progressives Congress (APC) Nomination and Expression of Interest forms valued N100 million on his behalf.\n\nBut reacting through his verified twitter handle, Emefiele had disowned the group, insisting that should he decide to contest for the political office, he would prefer to use his personal resources.\n\n\u201cI am humbled by the growing interest of those asking that I run for the office of president in the 2023 general elections: I have not come to that decision.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

However, should I answer their calls and decide to seek presidential nomination, I will use my own hard earned savings to buy my own nomination forms.\n\n\u201cI will do so without proxies, in an open and transparent manner in full compliance with the laws and Constitution of The Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he would continue to serve the country in his capacity as CBN governor until he received divine counsel to contest for a higher office.\n\nBut in a swift, he filed a suit at the Federal High Court in Abuja seeking an order to restrain the Federal Government from removing him from office over his presidential ambition.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThrough his counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome, on Monday, he sought for the order pending the hearing and determination of the substantive matter even as he prayed Justice Ahmed Mohammed to stop INEC from taking any action against him in the bid to contest in the presidential primary by virtue of his office.\n\nThe CBN governor made the prayers in an ex-parte motion dated and filed on May 9 by Ozekhome, seeking an order of maintenance of status quo ante bellum pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit. INEC is the first defendant, the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) is the second defendant in the suit. Moving the motion, Ozekhome said though his client had not told him under which political party he would love to contest, the application became necessary in order for the court to determine the constitutionality of his (Emefiele\u2019s) decision.\n\nIn his first reaction, INEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, in a statement by the commission\u2019s spokesperson, Rotimi Oyekanmi, said the commission would soon take a decision on the matter if Emefiele eventually joins the 2023 presidential race.\n\nYakubu, however, disclosed that the electoral agency might move its sensitive materials, which were being kept in the custody of CBN, if Emefiele formally declares his bid to vie for the number one seat.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe strategic partnership between the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Independent National Electoral Commission, which enables the commission to store its sensitive election materials with the CBN, has been in place for many years and is beneficial in several ways.\n\n\u201cIndeed, there have been various reports that the CBN governor is nursing an intention to run for the office of President. But, he is yet to formally declare his intention to run for the office of the president as of today.\n\n\u201cHowever, if and when he eventually does, the commission will look at the implications and take a decision on what becomes of the long-standing strategic partnership with the CBN.\u201d\n\nBut Maghalu, while picking his expression of interest form at the ADC Secretariat in Abuja, maintaied that Section 9 of the CBN Act makes it clear that the governor and the deputy governor are not allowed to engage in any other employment or vocation.\n\n\u201cSection 9 of the CBN makes it clear that the governor and the deputy governor are not allowed to engage in any other employment or vocation. A vocation is something that could take up your time, it may not be a job, it may not be something you could put your hands on, but once your mind is there but for the CBN Governor, his heart and mind is in politics up to the extent of going to a law court to support his ambition.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I want to say Nigerians have no business in rewarding this massive breach of the rule of law because the action of the CBN governor shows a contempt of the rule of law. And the individual has been incompetent and Nigerians should not promote incompetently.\n\n\u201cInflation is a very serious issue. If you have high inflation in a sustained manner the way we have it. It is a performance failure of the CBN because the President does not manage inflation, statutorily it is the function of the CBN. And under the CBN act, CBN is supposed to be independent. When I was the deputy governor of CBN in 2009/ 2014. There is a monitoring committee that ensures that prices of things are stable. We were able to bring inflation from double digit down to 8 percent before we left office. Now inflation is around 16 percent.",

          "text": "\u2022Ex-president says he didn\u2019t authorise purchase of APC forms\n\n\u202272 hours after another group bought form for Adesina, he\u2019s yet to deny presidential ambition\n\n\u2022Sale of forms closes today, 25 presidential aspirants jostle for ticket\n\n\u2022Lawan, Sylva, Ayade join race as Bakare formally declares\n\nDeji Elumoye, Sunday Aborisade, Adedayo Akinwale, Emmanuel Addeh and James Emejo in Abuja\n\n\n\nThe former president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, yesterday met with National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, in Abuja, a reliable source informed THISDAY. The meeting, THISDAY gathered, took place few hours after a Fulani group, under the aegis of the Nomadic Pastoralists and the Almajiri Communities, purchased the ruling party\u2019s nomination and expression of interest forms, sold for N100 million, for Jonathan. They urged him to contest for president under the party in 2023.\n\nThe sale of forms for elective positions in APC closes today, with 25 aspirants in the race for the presidential ticket in the party\u2019s primary election slated for May 30, 2023.\n\nLikewise, 72 hours after a coalition of 28 groups bought the N100 million APC forms for the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, he is yet to deny that he nurses presidential ambition. The AfDB president also met with President Muhammadu Buhari in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, during the ongoing conference organised by the United Nations.\n\nThe meeting between Jonathan and Adamu held at a secret location in Abuja and lasted about an hour, specifically between 9pm and 10 pm. At the end of it, the former president and the national chairman came out smiling, THISDAY learnt. Although the agenda of the meeting was not disclosed, it further strengthened speculation about the former president\u2019s likely defection to the APC which has been topic of discussion in political circles in the last two years.\n\nJonathan, in a statement by his media adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, said he was not aware of the purchase of forms and did not authorise it.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIt has come to the notice of His Excellency Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, that a group has purportedly purchased Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms, of the APC in his name.\n\n\u201cWe wish to categorically state that Dr. Jonathan was not aware of this bid and did not authorise it. While we appreciate the overwhelming request by a cross-section of Nigerians, for Dr. Jonathan to make himself available for the 2023 presidential election, we wish to state, that he has not in anyway, committed himself to this request.\n\n\u201cWe thank the general public for their concern, as we continue to encourage citizens\u2019 participation in the affairs of the country.\u201d\n\nA reliable source had told THISDAY that some leaders in West Africa, which included presidents of Niger, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, might have spoken on behalf of the AfDB president to Buhari.\n\nThere had been speculations that Jonathan wanted to take another shot at the presidency but on the platform of APC, the party that defeated him in 2015. The former president recently hinted that he was still consulting on whether to join the race or not in 2023.\n\nThe leader of the Fulani group that purchased the form for Jonathan, Ibrahim Abdullahi, said a lot of interest groups had been coming out to urge Jonathan to contest, adding that they needed to purchase the form to beat the deadline.\n\nHe said Jonathan had a comprehensive policy while in government to reform and integrate the Almajarai into the educational system of Nigeria.\n\nAbdullahi added, \u201cIt was the dream and the vision of President Jonathan to produce doctors, lawyers and engineers from Almajarai, but unfortunately, that laudable vision was abandoned once he left office.,\n\n\u201cAnother group that he tried to develop was the Fulani pastoralists. I believe if this government has continued with his vision, Nigeria would have become the Denmark, the Holland of the entire Africa, in terms of livestock production, in terms of milk, beef and so on.\u201d\n\nSale of Forms Closes Today, 25 Presidential Aspirants Jostle for APC Ticket\n\nThe sale of APC forms closes today, according to the timetable and schedule of activities of the ruling party, and submission of forms begins tomorrow.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that one of presidential hopefuls, Senator Bola Tinubu, would submit his nomination forms tomorrow.\n\nThe aspirants that have purchased forms so far are: former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Senator representing Ondo-North senatorial district, Prof. Ajayi Boroffice; Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Dimeji Bankole, Governor of the Central Bank, Godwin Emefiele and the President of African Development Bank, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina.\n\nOthers are: Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi; former Imo State governor, Senator Rochas Okorocha; Minister of State, Education, Hon. Chukwuemeka Nwajuiba; former Lagos State Governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu; former National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole; Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva and Uju Kennedy, the only female aspirants.\n\nAlso in the race are: Pastor Tunde Bakare; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; US-based Nigerian pastor of the Miracle Church International, and youngest presidential aspirant, Nicholas Felix; Ekiti State governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi; former Senate President, Sen. Ken Nnamani and Minister of Labour and productivity, Chris Ngige; Jigawa State Governor, Abubakar Badaru; former governor of Zamfara State, Sani Yerima; and Senate President Ahmad Lawan.\n\nThe governor of Cross River State, Prof. Ben Ayade, who received his nomination and Expression of Interest (EOI) forms purchased for him by sons and daughters of Cross River State, Arewa Youths as well as other interest groups across the country\u2019s six geopolitical zone, yesterday, said he would run for the office of the president in the 2023 general election. Ayade said he was confident of becoming the next president of Nigeria.\n\nHe said he \u201cwill be next president of this country.\u201d\n\nAyade said he would replicate his successes as a state governor at the national level and help address the country\u2019s myriad of challenges.\n\nOn his part, Bakare who formally declared in Abuja, yesterday, said his administration would attract a $2 trillion Foreign and Direct Investment (FDI) to the Nigerian economy. He said as president, his administration would deliver in four mandates namely: peace, progress; prosperity and possibilities.\n\nBakare explained that the Peace Mandate would achieve policy thrust on nationhood leadership, governance and national security, while the Progress Mandate would cater for sectors like education, healthcare, family and social development.\n\nHe added that the prosperity mandate would focus on economic management and infrastructural, while possibilities mandate would focus on science, technology and innovation; foreign policy, sustainability; arts, culture, entertainment and sports.\n\nThe spokesman of the Northern Solidarity Group for Timipre Sylva, Suleiman Abdullahi, said they purchased the firm for him because they believed in his capability.\n\nResponding, Sylva said he was honoured and humbled by the show of love, saying it shows commitment not to him, but to Nigeria.\n\nHowever, Lawan, who was formally presented with the expression of interest and nomination forms purchased for him by the group led by Nkire, said he had consulted widely and promised to play the game by the rules.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI have listened to various calls from all parts of our dear country, our dear nation Nigeria, for me to show interest to run for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to commit myself to this call and to this movement of Nigerians from all walks of life, rich, poor, north, south, east, west, male, female, old and young.\n\n\u201cI am joining lately. The field is already full of other aspirants. I want, at this point, to assure Nigerians that the APC is a very beautiful bride and that is why we have many aspirants.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Adjourns to May 12\n\nAlex Enumah\n\n\n\nJustice Ahmed Mohammed of the Federal High Court Abuja, yesterday ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) to appear before it on Thursday, over the participation of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr.Godwin Emefielein the 2023 presidential election.\n\nJustice Mohammed in addition ordered the CBN Governor to serve all court processes in relation to the suit he filed against INEC and the AGF who are 1st and 2nd defendants respectively.\n\nEmefiele had amongst others, approached the Federal High Court for an order restraining the defendants from preventing or hindering his participating in the process of the presidential election slated for February next year.\n\nSpecifically, he argued that by virtue of being a public servant he cannot be barred from participating in the political primaries of political parties by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nHe submitted that constitutional provisions stipulated that he can only resign his appointment as Governor of CBN 30 days to the presidential election which he is interested in contesting.\n\nAmongst the court processes he filed before the court was an application for maintenance of status, which he predicated on the fact that he would be prejudiced against or hurt if the court does not restrain the defendants from taking any step that would jeopardise his desire to contest the presidential election.\n\nArguing the motion for maintenance of status quo, Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, told the court that Emefiele \u201cis in a dilemma\u201d as to whether he can run in the forthcoming presidential election.\n\nAccording to Ozekhome, time is of utmost importance, following the fact that timeline for collection of nomination and expression of interest forms ends on Wednesday May 11.\n\nOzekhome in addition told the court that the timeline for the primaries and congresses of political parties have been fixed for May 30 to June 1, and unless the court intervened there could be a carriage of great injustice against his client.\n\n\u201cHe needs the protection of the court, the court needs to ensure that nobody does anything that will hurt him,\u201d the senior lawyer submitted, adding that if the court refused to grant the order for maintenance of status quo restraining the defendants from hindering Emefiele from participating in the primary election under a political party of his choice within this period, the case would amount to a mere academic exercise by the time parties return to the court.\n\nIn a short ruling, Justice Mohammed made an order \u201cdirecting the defendants to appear before him on Thursday why the order of status quo ante bellum should not be made by the court\u201d.\n\nJustice Mohammed also directed the applicant to serve all court processes including the motion exparte and hearing notice for Thursday May 12 on the defendants.\n\nIn the main suit marked. FHC/ ABJ/ CS/610/2022, the plaintiff sought the interpretation of certain parts of the constitution that has to do with his aspiration of contesting the 2023 presidential election.\n\nAmong the issues raised for determination are that whether any political party can validly rely on Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 to disqualify the plaintiff from participating in the congresses of any political party of his choice, \u201cwhere the plaintiff is protected by the provisions of Section 137(1)(G), 318 of the Constitution and Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cWhether by Section 137 of the Constitution plaintiff can be compelled to resign earlier than 30 days his position of Governor of CBN to participate in the primary of any political party of his choice for the purpose of the 2023 February 25 presidential election.\u201d\n\nEmefiele is further asking the court to determine whether he is a political appointee, who is affected by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act.\n\nHe said where the issues are determined in his favour, then the court should declare that; the defendants cannot validly rely on Section 84 (12) to disqualify the plaintiff from participating in the congresses of any political party of his choice where he is protected by Section 137 of the constitution.\n\nEmefiele also sought another declaration that by the provisions of Section 84 (3), a political party cannot by its constitution, guidelines or rules impose any nomination qualification or disqualification criteria or measures besides those prescribed under Sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 177 and 187 of the Constitution.\n\nHe further urged the court to declare that by the combined effect of Section 84 (3) of the Electoral Act, 2022 and 137 of the constitution, the plaintiff cannot be compelled to resign earlier than 30 days to the presidential election in February 25, 2023.\n\nHe sought another declaration that he can validly participate in the congresses of any political party of his choice as well as vote and be voted for.\n\nIn the suit dated May 4, 2023, but filed on May 5, 2023, Emefiele prayed the court for an order that the defendants cannot hinder or stop him from participating in the congresses or presidential primary election of any political party of his choice.\n\n\u201cAn order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from hindering or stopping him from participating in the congresses or presidential primary election of any political party of his choice.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 which barred political appointees from participating in the convention and congresses of political parties unless they resigned 30 days to such conventions or congresses does not affect him being a public officer.\n\nHe explained that being a public officer whose status is defined by Section 318 of the constitution, he can only resign as CBN Governor 30 days to the presidential election in line with Section 137 of the Constitution.\n\nOzekhome, while urging the court to hold that the constitution is Supreme above any other laws including the Electoral Act and the constitution, guidelines and rules of political parties, added that Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, had already been struck down for being inconsistent with the Constitution by Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court in Umuhia, Abia State.\n\nHe argued that although the judgment of Anyadike has been appealed against, it remains the law until it was set aside.\n\nIn the application of urgency in support of the suit, Emefiele submitted that it was within his right to contest the presidential election under any political party of his choice while still serving as Governor of the CBN, adding that all that was required of him was to give 30 days notice.\n\nHe, however, told the court that the defendants were \u201cmaking frantic efforts to disqualify him in the presidential primary election scheduled for May 30 to June 1 for not resigning before the primary.\u201d\n\nThe CBN Governor in addition said there was the urgent need for the court to hear the suit and, \u201cdetermine the rights of parties before the presidential election,\u201d adding that except this was done the plaintiff shall be wrongfully disqualified from participating in any of the primary of any political party of his choice.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Former Sokoto State Commissioner for Finance, Hon. Abdussamad Dasuki, has formally handed over the Ministry to the Permanent Secretary, Dahiru Balarabe Abbas.At the handover ceremony were the Accountant General, Umar B. Balarabe; Deputy Accountant General, Musa Mohammad Maccido; Director Debt Management, Murtala Umar Dogondaji; and Director Funds, Aliyu Abubakar Dange.\n\nDasuki who took over the affairs of the Ministry in 2019, had earlier tendered his resignation in March in compliance with the Electoral Act. He recently returned from a foreign trip to formally hand over to the permanent secretary.\n\nSpeaking at the handover ceremony, the former commissioner extolled Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal\u2019s sterling leadership, which has placed Sokoto in good stead for rapid growth and development.\n\nDasuki, who is the Santuraki of Sokoto, said with the prudent management of the resources of the state by the Tambuwal administration, the laudable reforms executed by the finance ministry and the various Legacy projects across the state, Sokoto was better positioned to compete favorably for investments and to meet the aspirations of its people.\n\nThe former commissioner said he feels fulfilled that he was handing over a reformed ministry that played a key role in the various reforms executed by the Tambuwal administration. He said with the reforms initiated and executed, the Finance Ministry was adequately prepared to continue to lead the way in the development agenda of the state government.\n\nHe recalled that at the inception of the Tambuwal administration, government finances were at the lowest ebb due to low FAAC Inflow, weak Internal Revenue Generation, abandoned and unpaid capital projects, and gratuity liabilities.\n\n\u201cIt was these and many others that the government had to grapple with at inception,\u201d he said, adding that the Ministry of Finance, whose sole responsibility is the management of public finance, disbursement, execution of financial policies and management of public debt and securities, was consequently saddled with the responsibility of reversing this ugly trend.\n\n\u201cFaced with these challenges, he said the Tambuwal administration came up with strategies to reform the public finance to ensure prudent management of resources, blocked loopholes in the state payroll and instituted a regime of transparency and accountability in public finance.\n\nDasuki said those reforms boosted the state\u2019s cash inflow and paved way for the provision of developmental projects across Sokoto.\n\nHe said the reforms of the state finances also received recognitions from major institutions, including a grant of $33m in three years and expecting another $22m before the end of 2022 from the World Bank for the commitment to the implementation of the States Fiscal Transparency, Accountability, and Sustainability (SFTAS) programme following its impressive score in the SFTAS ranking so far, placing it among the top three states in the country to achieve such ranking.\n\nSokoto also emerged first among the 36 states and FCT in the paying taxes column of the Subnational Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) Baseline Survey as announced by the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC).\n\nHe also listed the enactment of the harmonized Consolidated Revenue Law of 2019, which has helped the state to raise its IGR by 97 per cent.\n\nOther achievements of the ministry, according to Dasuki, include: continued automation of revenue processes; establishment of revenue codes for the state and all the 23 local governments; establishment of Single Treasury Account (TSA); Adoption of Cash Management Strategy; Adoption of Monthly Debt Arrears Clearance Framework on Contract and Gratuity payments; Establishment of SFTAS Secretariat; provision of utility vehicles, motor cycles, office furniture, ICT facilities and equipment; and construction of an ultramodern Revenue House and Complex.\n\nOthers include harmonizing state civil service database; sanitizing the state civil service salary and pension by linking BVN to personnel management data; provision of adequate manpower and ICT facilities for the salary department; training and retraining of staff for better output and performance; and implementations of N18,000 and subsequently N30,000 minimum wage and CONPCASS salary scale of tertiary institutions for civil servants, thus emerging as the only state in the Northwest that has been consistent with the payment of new minimum wage and with zero salary and pension arrears.\n\nDasuki also listed the enactment of Fiscal Responsibility Agency Law 2020 and constitution of its board; migration from Cash Basis Accounts to IPSAS Cash and later Accrual Basis ISPAS; and monthly payment of subsistence allowance to both foreign and local students and also cleared arrears of tuition fees.\n\nThe former commissioner thanked Governor Tambuwal for the opportunity to serve at the helm of affairs of the finance ministry for three years, adding that he is confident that the achievements recorded by the ministry has placed Sokoto on the front row of states that has reformed their finance sector for optimal performance.\n\nSee photos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I am most glad because he is from the North-east, the only zone alongside South-east that is yet to produce president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have always maintained an unambiguous stand that for justice, equity and fairness in our country, the next president of Nigeria after President Muhammadu Buhari should come from the South-east or the North-east.\n\n\u201cI have also told Nigerians that I would only run for president if the two major political parties (APC and PDP) zone their tickets to the South-east.\n\n\u201cThat is why I was disappointed with our southern brothers who are talking about fairness and equity but has zero tolerance for the same fairness and equity in the South.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of a South-easterner being president of Nigeria in 2023, I have my full support for a North-easterner. This is because it would be the closest to the equity, fairness and justice everyone is talking about. It further means that the justice is on its way to the South-east.\n\n\u201cI thank those who said they have picked presidential forms for me because they meant well for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cHowever, since there is no zoning and the contest is open to all Nigerians, I officially withdraw from presidential contest in 2023. I have also picked ticket to run for Abia North Senatorial zone and to complete the good work I started in Abia North.\n\n\u201cI urge all my friends, allies and supporters in the APC to toe the line of justice by supporting Senator Ahmad Lawan, a North-easterner for the presidential ticket of the APC.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Workers and Youth Solidarity Network has condemned the \u2018no work, no pay' policy of the Nigerian Government against workers of public universities in the country.\n\n\n\nThe WYSN, in a statement by its secretary, Dammy Owot said the policy is targeted at members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Non-Academic Staff Union of Allied and Educational Institution (NASU), Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT), who are currently on strike.\n\n\n\nThe group noted, \u201cTo us in the WYSN, the 'No work, no pay' policy is an attempt to intimidate the striking workers. ASUU members haven't received their salary for three months now in a Federal Government attempt to force them back to work.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, has spent N100m on an All Progressives Congress presidential expression of interest and nomination form!\n\n\n\n\u201cDespite the crisis in the Universities at the moment, the wives of Vice-Chancellors across Nigerian universities were set to travel to Istanbul, Turkey, for a five-day \u2018leadership course!\u2019 The plans were cancelled due to public condemnation.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe media of the ruling elite are all over the place saying that the ASUU strike hurts the students. It's clear that the children of the poor people are the ones that attend public schools.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the children of ruling elites are graduating from different international Universities across developed countries. And the Federal Government is the one to blame for this stalemate. Such hypocrisy!\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s annual budget for education is N1.29 trillion or 7.9%. Though this figure represents an increase compared to last year\u2019s, it is still far too low-UNESCO for example recommends 26% of the budget to be allocated for education.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe salute the University of Benin students for their courage to hold a protest for two days. Also, some students of the University of Lagos protested two days ago.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also extend our solidarity to Obafemi Awolowo University Students for their plan for protest actions. We urge all other university students across Nigeria to mobilise and organise a series of political actions to compel the government to meet ASUU, SSANU, NASU and NAAT\u2019s demands so that schools can be reopened.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe call on the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) to declare total support for ASUU strike and break away from dilly-dallying with a regime that doesn't care for education.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe call for unity of staff unions, students, workers and communities to mobilise for mass actions to force the government to back down and meet the demands of University unions.\u201d\n\n",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "title": "CAR becomes first African country to legalise crypto",
          "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has just become the first African country to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThe Parliament of the Central African Republic (CAR) today voted unanimously to sign a bill that will recognise Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency as national legal tender, according to a statement posted to the country\u2019s presidential Facebook page. After El Salvador, CAR is just the second country in the world to legalise it.\n\nThe bill was earlier proposed by Gourna Zacko, CAR\u2019s Minister of Digital Economy, and Calixte Nganongo, CAR\u2019s former Minister of Finance and Budget. Last week, lawmakers adopted proposals to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies and create regulatory bodies to oversee the use and adoption as well. At Parliament earlier today, the draft bill was officially adopted and will soon be signed into law.\n\n\u201cWith cryptocurrency, there is no more control of the Central Bank. You have your money, you send it to an investor for a business, you receive it in any currency, you can dispose of it in Dollar, Euro, CFA, or Naira,\u201d said Zacko, according to a report by iAfrikan.\n\nHow popular is crypto?\n\nAlthough bitcoin has gained worldwide popularity and usage in the past decade\u2014with global adoption growing by 2300% since 2019 and 103 countries allowing crypto trading\u2014governments and regulators worldwide are still debating its safety. At least 9 countries, including China and Qatar, have absolute bans on crypto, while 42 others have levied other forms of prohibition.\n\nFour African countries\u2014Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia\u2014have banned all forms of crypto trading, while 7 including Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon have some forms of prohibition regarding crypto trading.\n\nThese governments have cited numerous reasons for the bans from fraud and money laundering to tax evasion and terrorist financing.\n\nThese prohibitions, however, do not mean that crypto adoption amongst citizens isn\u2019t growing in these countries. In its 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, Chainanalysis reported that Africa\u2019s cryptocurrency market grew by over 1200% between 2020 and 2021. Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania are also featured in its Top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. In fact, Kenya is leading the continent in peer-to-peer crypto trading.\n\nChainanalysis\u2019 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report\n\nThis is what makes the CAR\u2019s adoption an interesting feat. The country hasn\u2019t topped any charts, the highest crypto transactions don\u2019t originate from it. In fact, at 11%, CAR has the fifth-lowest internet penetration rate in Africa, and this brings into question the feasibility of crypto adoption in the country. As of 2020, only 48% of its population had access to mobile connections, while less than 2.8% were connected to social media. Unlike mobile money, trading, storing and transacting with cryptocurrencies require both smartphone and internet connections, both of which the CAR is low on.\n\nCentral African Republic's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is interesting.\n\n\n\nIf they manage to do transactions via USSD, this might just work. Not sure how BEAC (central bank for 6 central African countries that use XAF currency tied to Euro) will react. pic.twitter.com/mUvxrgfhNA \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) April 27, 2022\n\nWhile CAR remains the first and only African country to legalise cryptocurrency for now, other African countries are rushing towards another form of digital currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which are digital representations of fiat currencies and unlike crypto, can be regulated by their central banks.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

Discussing the good, he said that the absence of regulation in the blockchain space gives people the opportunities to experiment. Also, you don\u2019t need to be in a specific place to build and launch your product.\n\nChimezie added that there are tons of African-specific problems requiring blockchain-specific solutions. Also, the lack of legacy systems is an advantage for blockchain startups, giving them opportunities to build new solutions.\n\nChimezie then reiterated the importance of branding to new founders in the blockchain space. He advised founders to look at brand strategy and messaging as a relationship. He added that businesses should look at their brand strategy as a relationship between them and their customers.\n\nChimezie discussed how Adaverse plans to help blockchain-focused startups. He said Adaverse could help in terms of tokenisation design, articulate how the token economy of the project should look like, technical consultation, skills and talents acquisition, marketing, financial support, and mentorship.\n\nIn the past three months, Adaverse has made some investments, and they are looking forward to kickstarting their accelerator program soon.\n\nStartups can get up to $500,000 if Adaverse finds what they are building to be interesting enough. Also, if the project valuation ranges from 2 to 30 million dollars, it increases the chances of being accepted into the program. Adaverse has already invested in about seven startups, which include Canza, Cassava, and Afriguild, among others. ,\n\nAdaverse investment interests cut across solutions building on the emerging Web3. Some of the portfolio companies already funded are focused on cross border payments, Web3, DeFi, talent protocol, NFTs, gaming and p2p systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYosuke Yoshida, Ex-CEO of EMURGO Japan and co-CEO for the Middle East\n\nThe next speaker, Yosuke Yoshida, Ex-CEO of EMURGO Japan and co-CEO for the Middle East, highlighted that Cardano is a third-generation blockchain built to improve previous generations, which are Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively.\n\nCardano is unique because they look to solve the scalability problem present in the blockchain space. The settlement layer and the combination layer are the layers present in the Cardano blockchain.\n\nSecondly, interoperability is another important solution that Cardano aims to provide in the blockchain space. They look at connecting with legacy companies such as banks.\n\nFinally, sustainability. The Cardano blockchain is in the third stage of development out of five, and they plan to open the development and contribution to the community after the fifth stage is complete.\n\nYosuke said that more improvement is being made on the blockchain, and they constantly go through peer review, which means that they spend a lot of time in research. They collaborate with people in academia and implement after considerable research has been done.\n\nHe then mentioned that they have been collaborating with different projects in the blockchain, and Adaverse, who organised and hosted the hangout, was one of them.\n\nThe goal of the collaborations is to increase the Cardano blockchain usage and encourage founders to build solutions that will be hosted on the blockchain.\n\nEMURGO has many arms, which are not limited to EMURGO ventures, EMURGO Africa, including standard technology tools available on the platform, such as the Yoroi wallet, which is the main wallet of the Cardano blockchain. EMURGO, in partnership with Adaverse, has a venture capital wheel where they plan to invest in blockchain centred startups.\n\nEMURGO has invested in a host of startups that offer web3-based solutions, one of which is API3, and they plan to do more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShogo Ishida, Executive Director, EMURGO Africa and Middle East\n\nShogo Ishida, Executive Director, EMURGO for the Middle East and Africa, talked about investments, requirements and what they expect founders to have when applying for funding.\n\nHe highlighted some points, which include having a team. Founders should try not to build alone.\n\n\u2018A team is very important. However, If you have a team, are they good enough?\u201d\n\nShogo further said that they are responsible for all the EMURGO syndicates, and they have built a 100 million dollar investment wheel.\n\nTherefore, they want to know what the founders have been building, and they want to know how they can help.\n\nSpeaking on why there is a focus on Africa, Shogo said there is an identification (ID) issue, especially in developing countries. The lack of ID cuts people off many benefits, which is why they partnered with the Ethiopian government and built schools. They look at creating and providing digital IDs and increasing access to financial services.\n\nIn their bid to enter the African space, they have invested and partnered with Adaverse and Adanian labs.\n\nIn his closing remarks, Shogo said founders have to be passionate about their projects. Giving a hint on what they expect from founders, Shogo said that giving a general overview of the project or demography is not enough. Founders should do in-depth research and make them understand what and who the target market is.\n\nIn summary, they at EMURGO will look at the team, research, product and the traction or engagement it gets. Founders and developers are encouraged to build their solutions on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nFounders in need of funding are encouraged to send their pitch deck to apply at https://www.adaverse.co/ and may send a follow-up mail to chuta@adaverse.co.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fortunate to really enjoy what I do for work, and want to have more of an impact on the people I work with.\u201d \u2014 Saze Ibraheem, Head of Marketing, ART X Collective.\n\nIn November 2019, Jack Dorsey, Twitter ex-CEO and Square CEO, visited Lagos, Nigeria, on the first leg of his African tour. His activities peaked at a town hall at Techpoint Africa\u2019s headquarters. Saze Ibraheem, who moderated the panel session with three other Twitter executives, was consulting for Techpoint Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Parag Agrawal, (former Twitter CTO), Mike Montano (Engineering Team Lead), Jack Dorsey, (ex-CEO ), Kayvon Beykpour (Product Lead), and Saze Ibraheem (Moderator) all listening to Quoted Replies being pitched\n\nSaze (short for Osazemen) has spent more than a decade in marketing, focusing on technology, emerging media, and retail. When she isn\u2019t consulting for a business intentional about growth, Saze is creating and converting leads to happy customers or leading marketing strategies.\n\nInterestingly, Saze tried her hands on an extremely challenging project early in her career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI like really big, bold, audacious ideas!\u201d\n\nIn what she considers her most significant achievement, ten years ago, she and her partner, Lade Ibraheem, organised TEDx Ikoyi, one of the first TEDx events in Nigeria. The event brought a diverse selection of thought leaders in the country together to speak on the theme, The Other Side of The Story, which was inspired by Chimamanda Adichie\u2019s TEDx talk with a similar title. This was instrumental in Saze receiving the Gates Foundation TEDxChange Scholarship and becoming a TEDx Ambassador for Africa.\n\n\u201cWe started TEDx Ikoyi because we felt like there\u2019s a lot more to Nigeria than existing negative stereotypical narratives. At that time, you\u2019d Google \u2018Nigeria\u2019, and the results you\u2019d see were like\u2026\u201d she scoffs, recollecting the results, and continues, \u201c\u2026 I mean, we have great thinkers, visionaries, and artists; we can take good pictures, what is going on here?\u201d she asks with a quizzical look as we sit for a chat at her home in Lagos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChatting with Saze Ibraheem at her home in Lagos\n\nI can say that the event has played a part in shaping the Nigerian narrative. While writing this article, I stumbled on some beautiful pictures from the event on Behance, which a Nigerian photographer captured.\n\n\u201cThe event was really affirming. We worked with a number of partners and were able to deliver a tasteful and impactful event that we thought really showed multiple sides of our country. Nigeria is many things, and we felt it was important to show its plurality.\u201d\n\nTEDx Ikoyi was a massive undertaking for Saze; however, she has been part of arguably bigger things. She was part of Hilary Clinton\u2019s US State Department initiative, TechWomen, a professional exchange programme for women-in-tech in emerging regions. This enabled her to spend some time in Silicon Valley, where she built relationships with startups and a strong network of African women in tech.\n\nWhere it all started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaze Ibraheem, Head of Marketing, ART X Collective\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so bullish on Lagos; it really has my heart. I love the mix of people here, the energy, the vibrancy.\u201d\n\nBorn in Lagos to parents from Edo State, Nigeria, Saze was fortunate to be exposed to books and computers from a very young age, thanks to encouraging parents and an excellent academic environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am eternally curious. I ask a lot of questions because I am genuinely interested, and I\u2019m excited to learn and understand even more. I think that my love for reading, knowing more, and researching has helped when I go into new sectors. I am exceptional at understanding user behaviour and how they want your product to solve their problem. That\u2019s my special sauce.\u201d\n\nSaze has an economics degree from the University of Manchester and an integrated marketing communications certificate from New York University. She had her eyes set on becoming an engineer but changed her mind in secondary school when her economics teacher, Mr Adewonyi, exposed her to the psychology of decision making within the constraints of demand and supply.\n\nShe recalls her creativity and penchant for business and how she could not figure out just what to do with them at the time.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, someone should have told me [that] marketing is how you use creativity to solve business problems, but no one did.\u201d\n\nShe adds how marketing as a course was unpopular at the time and that she found it hard to imagine it as a profession. Her creative spirit was as alive as her love for economics, and as an undergraduate, she gave \u2018artistic Saze\u2019 room for some expression.\n\n\u201cWhile at the university, I started a T-shirt line that I sold in Manchester and Lagos stores. I did my first fashion show and art exhibition right after graduating and always did things that brought commerce and creativity together to create community.\u201d\n\nSleeves up, fingers in the dirt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaze Ibraheem, Head of Marketing, ART X Collective\n\nHer first industry experience was in the UK, with a short internship at the Ford Motor Company and a stint at a financial services firm where she learnt the basics of relationship management and customer service.\n\nBack in Nigeria, her year-long National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) experience after graduation took her to Abuja Technology Village. She calls this an exceptional experience that exposed her to the tangible potential of tech on a large scale in Nigeria.\n\nShe entered the world of marketing via operations at MultiChoice, where she was actively involved in market research in different cities and coordinating mobile payments; she also introduced moving customer service to social media. Saze appreciates the creative freedom her boss, Kapa Kaumba, gave her to execute her ideas.\n\nOne of her wins was doing the first online campaign to sell decoders which attracted massive sales.\n\n\u201cI found out that a lot of the ideas I was coming up with were marketing-related. Again, at that time, I just thought marketing was maybe, events; it wasn\u2019t very clear.\u201d\n\nBefore long, she got the clarity she needed from Donald Etim, the then Head of Marketing, and was convinced she was in the right space. Saze left for New York University to study integrated marketing communications and get more knowledge in the field.\n\n\u201cIt was incredible! It gave me [the] vocabulary for a lot of the ideas that I had. I had these hunches, but I didn\u2019t have ways to craft my hypotheses or articulate what I had to say. It gave me that confidence.\u201d\n\nAs a product manager and later marketing partnerships manager at online marketplace, Jumia, Saze was involved in sealing partnerships with businesses that have large audiences. If anything stood out for her, it was executing the rebrand from Kasuwa & Sabunta to Jumia in 2012.\n\nIn 2016, she joined Facebook as growth manager for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I was really proud of doing there was making a case to prolong support for feature phones as they were and continue to be ubiquitous in emerging markets. At the time, we also launched Facebook in Hausa, which really increased accessibility in the region.\u201d\n\nIn between, she also founded 4Twenty3 with an initial plan to carve a niche in digital marketing.\n\nMentioning some of the brands the agency has served, Saze says, \u201cWe worked with Jade Osiberu and her team to build out Ndani TV, the digital content marketing platform at GTBank, to create programming, asking questions like \u2018What should GTB look and sound like if it was a tv show?\u2019\u201d\n\nClassifieds marketplace, OLX (acquired by Jiji); Techpoint Africa; and Alara Lagos, a luxury retailer, are also on the list.\n\nUp the ladder and still going\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaze Ibraheem, Head of Marketing, ART X Collective\n\nSaze usually prefers to help businesses turbo-charge their ideas, but she hasn\u2019t always been a fan of entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I was an accidental entrepreneur. I became one because nobody was doing what I wanted to do. People didn\u2019t really understand digital marketing at the time, so like Nike, I just did it! I\u2019m an extrovert; I like people, I like being in a team, I like brainstorming, and I like community. That\u2019s where I thrive, and I\u2019m very happy to be able to do that now.\u201d\n\nAmidst the global pandemic in July 2020, Saze joined ART X Collective, producers of the annual ART X Lagos fair, to spearhead its marketing efforts. Here, Saze got her \u201c360 moment\u201d because she put her cumulative experience in business, culture, and digital marketing to play.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we delivered was our first online-only fair. So, being able to bring all of those different skills and expertise to something I\u2019m very passionate about, which is amplifying and supporting creatives on the continent, was really fulfilling.\u201d\n\nAs head of marketing, she manages online and offline campaigns, business development for sponsorships and consulting, and local and international PR, among others. Her workdays involve stakeholder engagement, developing strategy, and team building.\n\nOne of her strengths is her ability to manage a team in a way that\u2019s authentic to her. As a leader who doesn\u2019t enjoy micromanagement, she loves to identify exceptional people and provide conducive environments for them to thrive and shine.\n\nTo keep up with the constantly moving parts, Saze uses good old-fashioned sticky notes. She listens to audiobooks and podcasts for productivity and has a vast library of physical books. For work, she uses Google\u2019s suite of tools and Asana.\n\nFamily and friends are important to her, and for work-life balance, WhatsApp and Calm apps come in handy. And to relax, she watches sci-fi movies, takes luxurious holiday breaks, gets massages, eats, and travels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

And that\u2019s one reason we have the Techpoint Africa Podcast.\n\nToday, one of the podcast highlights was Elon Musk\u2019s plan for Twitter. While Bolu discussed the plan, one glaring question the editorial team and I had was: Are Africans a part of this new Twitter? I mean, are you even part of Musk\u2019s equation?\n\nTo get a clear picture of what I\u2019m talking about, please listen to it here. Remember to share with your family and friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nInstagram\u2019s plan to start testing NFTs\n\nPaymob\u2019s $50 million Series B\n\nFacebook phasing out some of its features\n\nManara\u2019s $3 million pre-seed\n\nInstagram to start testing NFTs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, Monday, May 9, 2022, Instagram CEO, Adam Mosseri, announced that the platform would begin testing NFTs with select creators this week in the United States.\n\nHe also said that there would be no fees for posting or sharing a digital collectible on Instagram.\n\nPresently, the supported blockchains for showcasing NFTs on Instagram are Ethereum and Polygon, with support for Flow and Solana coming soon. Rainbow, Trust Wallet, and MetaMask are among the third-party wallets that will be supported.\n\nCreators and participants in the test can now share NFTs that they have created or purchased. These NFTs can be shared in your main Feed, Stories, or messages.\n\nMosseri explained that only a small number of people have access to the test, but the company intends to roll out more NFT-related functionality in the future based on feedback from its initial testing.\n\nWeb3 \u2019bout to take over: Recall that in April 2022, Telegram\u2019s Telegram Open Network (TON) Foundation announced the availability of crypto payment capabilities.\n\nThis means that users can download Telegram\u2019s official wallet bot, which allows them to buy, trade, and send cryptocurrencies to other wallets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, keep in mind that on January 2022, Twitter Blue added another feature for its users: the ability to connect a crypto wallet and upload an NFT as a profile picture for mobile iOS users, which it added to accommodate high user demand.\n\nMeanwhile, Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, stated that similar functionality would be added to Facebook soon and possibly to other Meta apps in the future. He also claimed that Meta will be working on augmented reality NFTs, or 3D NFTs, that can be added to Instagram Stories using Spark AR, the company\u2019s software AR platform.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Fisayo Fosudo\u2019s escapades in tech and finance to Hillary Omitogun\u2019s journey as a Web3 UX researcher at Nestcoin, we have a star-studded line-up of speakers at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022).\n\nTickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nPaymob\u2019s $50 million Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaymob, an Egyptian fintech that allows merchants to accept digital payments online and in-store, has raised $50 million in Series B.\n\nPayPal Ventures, Kora Capital, and Clay Point led the round. Also, British International Investment (formerly the CDC Group), Nclude, and three unnamed Egyptian banks participated.\n\nThe fintech company was founded by Islam Shawky, Alain El Hajj, and Mostafa Menessy. It collaborates with a diverse range of businesses and merchants. Its omnichannel payment infrastructure \u2014 which Islam claims is the largest in Egypt \u2014 allows them to accept payments in various ways.\n\nThese options include mobile wallets, QR payments, bank card installments, BNPL, and consumer finance payment options. Paymob also offers a PoS solution for offline merchants, allowing them to accept in-store card payments.\n\nPaymob claims to serve merchants in other markets, including Kenya and Palestine but has yet to open a branch in these countries. Instead, the company\u2019s sights are set on a few Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) \u2014 political and economic alliances of six Middle Eastern countries \u2014 and North African markets.\n\nBesides, the funds will also increase its market share in Egypt and add new offerings to its product suite, like expense management software and working capital provision.\n\nFacebook is phasing out some features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash\n\nSocial media consultant, Matt Navarra, announced that Facebook, the social media giant, will phase out Nearby Friends \u2014 a feature that finds out if any of your friends are nearby so you can hang out \u2014 on May 31, 2022.\n\nAlso, weather alerts, location history, and background location will be phased out the same day.\n\nSupposedly, these features will no longer collect information after that date, and the previously shared location history and background location information will be deleted by August 1, 2022.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Facebook says it will continue to collect users\u2019 location data for other experiences to personalise and improve its products and recommend ads to you.\n\nIs this similar? Aside from social networking apps, Apple and Google both provide tools for finding friends and family, as do dedicated family tracking services like Life360.\n\nManara\u2019s $3 million pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManara, an edtech startup, has raised $3 million in pre-seed for its cohort-based training platform to grow the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region\u2019s tech talent pool.\n\nStripe led the startup\u2019s pre-seed round, while LinkedIn Founder, Reid Hoffman; Y Combinator founder, Paul Graham; Lean Startup founder, Eric Ries; and Careem founder, Mudassir Sheikha participated.\n\nWhat does it do? Launched by Iliana Montauk (CEO) and Laila Abudahi (CTO) in 2020, the startup bills itself as a social impact edtech startup that provides computer science training to anyone who qualifies.\n\nWhile there is no tuition fee, students must contribute 10% of their salary to Manara during their first two years of employment. Also, the company claims that its alumni have been placed at large tech companies like Meta and Google in Europe and the United States.\n\nAccording to Manara, 86% of its trained engineers receive job offers within five months of graduating, and others receive up to a 300% pay increase after the training.\n\nThe startup intends to use the funds to increase its annual training capacity from 60 to 6,000 engineers. They also plan to launch a self-service product for interview practice, networking, and mentoring, aimed at software engineers worldwide.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nAFS Global STEM Accelerators is looking for females between the ages of 15 and 17 years to apply for its 12 week all-virtual programs focusing on emerging and critical STEM skills and fields, global competence education, and social impact (co-developed with the University of Pennsylvania).

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade, commerce, and the entire system of value exchange are no longer confined to the geographical boundaries of one country. These days, businesses strive to reach a global audience, leveraging the power of technology to achieve results. However, despite the efforts of businesses (both small and large scale) to tap into the potential of borderless transactions, they have continually faced a series of challenges, prominent among them are the exorbitant charges of traditional banks and fintechs, and the unfavourable fluctuation in value of national currencies. This is especially true for businesses in emerging markets across Africa, Asia, South America, and the rest of the world. This is without considering the periodic shifts and changes to governmental regulations in these countries.\n\nAs a way out, IvoryPay aims to help businesses, merchants, and creators maximise gains by providing them with an alternative route to making and receiving payments. Built on the Solana blockchain, IvoryPay\u2019s aim is to help online businesses facilitate bankless transactions through cryptocurrency. With IvoryPay, businesses in emerging markets will be able to reduce the cost of transacting, increase transaction processing and payment confirmation speed, and accept payments in stable currencies.\n\nThe IvoryPay ecosystem comprises three components which include the Ivorypay payment gateway solution, the NFT Storefront, and the IVRY token. The payment gateway infrastructure helps online businesses easily accept payment in stablecoins and the IVRY token, offering customers the option to make payments using the most convenient means. Businesses on IvoryPay can accept payments using QR codes, checkout integrations, payment links, and buttons. The NFT Storefront will provide digital creators and businesses the opportunity to better monetize and diversify their revenue stream. Creators can choose from pre-existing templates to easily set up their storefront and be operational in no time, with an integrated payment system that allows them to sell the NFTs seamlessly. The IVRY token, which is the native cryptocurrency of the project will be used as a means of exchange between customers and merchants and it will also be used for staking purposes.\n\nThe idea to create an alternative means of payment facilitation that birthed IvoryPay was conceived by Oluwatobi Ajayi and Ope Akinremi, who are also Co founders of Uptrend Africa, one the biggest crypto marketing agencies in Africa championing grassroot cryptocurrency adoption. Oluwatobi who has worked in the crypto/alternative payment space over the past couple of years is of the belief that \u201cglobal businesses have reached a point where the barriers to trade should be non-existent and payment solutions should present businesses with multiple options with the end goal of simplifying payment processes and enhancing user experience without the need to break a sweat or empty your pocket in the process\u201d.\n\nOpe further added that \u201cconsumers are the backbone of the global economy and it is the foremost responsibility of all forward-thinking businesses to be in tune with the demands of their consumers. Thinking forward, in this case, would imply offering users the means to make payment in the manner they find most convenient, and trendy\u201d.\n\nWith the project in its development phase, it is only a matter of time before Ivorypay launches its robust payment architecture. The project could be a game-changer for online businesses in emerging markets and global commerce as a whole.\n\nFor more information, you can visit www.ivorypay.io.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s top banker Emefiele in eye of the storm",
          "text": "Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, is increasingly in the spotlight as indications that he is eyeing the presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has triggered more reactions.\n\nFollowing the purchase of APC presidential nomination and expression of interest forms worth N100 million by \u201cfarmers and patriots\u201d on May 6, Emefiele said on Saturday that he had yet to decide to contest the presidential election, adding that he was awaiting divine direction \u201cin the next few days\u201d.\n\nHe said should he heed the call to run for the presidency, he would use his \u201cown hard-earned savings from over 35 years of banking leadership to buy my own nomination forms\u201d.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that the CBN governor had been a card-carrying member of APC since February 2021.\n\nThe Federal High Court in Abuja, on Monday, declined to grant the prayers of Emefiele\u2019s lawyers to bar him from being disqualified to contest for the presidential ticket of any political party ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nHis lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, had earlier on Monday urged the court to issue an interim order stopping the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) from disqualifying him from participating in the primary election of his preferred political party.\n\nBut ruling on the ex parte application, the judge, Ahmed Mohammed, ruled that he would rather order INEC and the AGF to appear to state their side of the case instead of granting the CBN governor\u2019s request.\n\nThe judge said having read the affidavit in support of the motion, it was more appropriate to direct the defendants to appear in court on May 12, to show cause why Emefiele\u2019s request should not be granted.\n\nThe court also ordered that Emefiele\u2019s filings should be served on the defendants before the next hearing date.\n\nOzekhome filed the \u2018ex-parte\u2019 application on May 9 for an order of court for maintenance of status quo, fearing that Emefiele might be disqualified from running in the presidential primaries.\n\nCBN\u2019s monetary policies under scrutiny\n\nSince speculation became rife that the country\u2019s top banker was planning to contest for the office of president, many analysts have raised concerns about whether his monetary policy decisions were really in the interest of the country.\n\nIn 2015, the central bank set up a N220bn financing for local rice farmers, and last week, some farmers bought the bank\u2019s governor a presidential nomination form.\n\n\u201cIt is important that the central bank and indeed the governor are politically neutral,\u201d says Ayodele Oni, partner at Lagos-based commercial law firm Bloomfield, \u201cWithout this neutrality, monetary policy will be self-serving and politically motivated,\u201d Oni said.\n\nEyo O. Ekpo, a former commissioner in the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission and CEO of Excredite Consulting Limited, said the most precious resource or asset of the statutory regulator of any market, particularly the regulator of banking and finance markets of Nigeria, is credibility, which in turn rests on a number of factors including being totally apolitical.\n\n\u201cIt is the only way to retain credibility, the absolute trust of your key stakeholders \u2013 market operators, consumers and general public, government and staff \u2013 assure them that partisan politics will never influence your decision-making and assure that the regulator will indeed obey the same CBN Act that Emefiele pushed hard to bring into being,\u201d Ekpo said.\n\nSince 2016, the CBN had resorted to unorthodox policies and strategies to fix monetary challenges of the economy, with little or no complementary support from the fiscal side.\n\nUnder Emefiele, individuals, non-financial institutions and even banks have been restricted from the Open Market Operation \u2013 a financial instrument the CBN uses to manage liquidity in the financial market and achieving price stability, leaving only foreign portfolio investors in that space.\n\nWhile this move may have helped the CBN to reduce the cost of managing liquidity and made it cheaper for government to borrow, it has left domestic investors with little option for good returns both from the volatile stock market and the declining Treasury bills.\n\nEmefiele\u2019s decision to run for president will force a more critical look at the motives behind these policies.\n\nMonetary policy decisions made under the CBN governor to hold rates when other countries were raising them, blocking access to foreign currency for over 40 commodities and spending a fortune defending the naira when other countries were loosening official control to attract investments will be examined under new lenses.\n\n\u201cHow does the head of an institution whose insulation from politics is statutorily assured turn round to dive into that same politics while still a full time head of that institution?,\u201d Ekpo asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable, yet here we are faced with that bizarre reality. The credibility of both Emefiele himself and the CBN are terribly impaired by his descent into the political arena.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the situation is made worse by his deliberate failure to resign as governor before entering partisan politics.\n\n\u201cHe clearly has no respect for the CBN and its stakeholders; but the CBN is one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest regulatory and law enforcement institutions and I believe that it will somehow survive this,\u201d Ekpo added.\n\nWhat the law says about CBN governor\u2019s personal causes\n\nThe CBN Act, 2007 says the central bank shall be \u201can independent body in the discharge of its functions, in order to facilitate the achievement of its mandate under this Act and the Banks and other Financial Institutions Act, and in line with the objective of promoting stability and continuity in economic management.\n\nIt says the governor shall be in charge of the day-to-day management of the bank and shall be answerable to the board of directors for his acts and decisions.\n\n\u201cThe governor and the deputy governors shall devote the whole of their time to the services of the bank and while holding office, shall not engage in any full or part-time employment or vocation whether remunerated or not, except such personal or charitable causes as may be determined by the board and which do not conflict with or detract from their full-time duties,\u201d the Act says.\n\nIt says the governor shall cease to hold office in the bank if he \u201cis guilty of a serious misconduct in relation to his duties under this Act\u201d.\n\nAccording to the law, the governor may resign in his office by giving at least three months\u2019 notice in writing to the President of his intention to do so and any director may similarly resign by at least one months\u2019 notice in writing to the president of his intention to do so.\n\nIt says: \u201cIf the governor, any deputy governor or director of the bank does resign or otherwise vacates his office before the expiry of the term for which he has been appointed, there shall be appointed a fit and proper person to take his place on the Board for the unexpired period of the term of appointment\u2026\u201d\n\nEmefiele\u2019s action, gross misconduct \u2013 PDP, others\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in a statement by Debo Ologunagba, its national publicity secretary, said, \u201cEmefiele\u2019s involvement in politics without resigning as CBN Governor amounts to gross misconduct in contravention of Section 11 2 (2)(c) of the CBN Act.\u201d\n\nThe party drew the attention of Nigerians to the provisions of the CBN Act 2007 and particularly referenced Section 9, which provides that \u201cthe Governor and the Deputy Governors shall devote the whole of their time to the service of the bank and while holding office, shall not engage in any full or part-time employment or vocation, whether remunerated or not\u2026\u201d\n\nIt noted that the provision was clear in demanding that 100 percent of the time, the expertise of the CBN governor and deputy governors shall be dedicated to the service of the CBN.\n\n\u201cThis is because the CBN is critical to the integrity and stability of our economy,\u201d it said.\n\nAccording to the PDP, Section 030422 of the Public Service Rule states that no public officer shall (a) hold any office, paid or unpaid, permanent or temporary, in any political organisation (b) offer himself/herself or nominate anyone else as a candidate for any elective public office (c) indicate publicly his support of or opposition to any party, candidate or policy and (d) engage in canvassing in support of political candidates\u201d unless such officer resigns his appointment.\n\nIt said Section 030502 (g) of the Rule lists \u201cengaging in partisan political activities\u201d as serious act of misconduct.\n\nThe PDP said Emefiele\u2019s involvement in \u201cpartisan politics while still holding office as CBN governor underpins the impunity, lawlessness and recklessness of the Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration\u201d.\n\nIt said: \u201cIt is now evident that the summersault of the economy under Mr. Emefiele as CBN governor has been influenced by a personal partisan interest for which the CBN under his watch allegedly allowed multiple leakages in our financial regulations through discriminatory exchange rate policies and nebulous subsidies to funnel billons of naira to political lackeys to fund a presidential ambition.\n\n\u201cBy this, Mr Emefiele has become a clear and present danger to the health, integrity and reputation of the CBN and our nation\u2019s financial sector. His continued stay as CBN governor will further destroy investors\u2019 confidence in the integrity of our nation\u2019s financial regulatory institution.\u201d\n\nRead also: Gov Akeredolu, others demand resignation of CBN boss Emefiele over presidential bid\n\nChristian Okeke, a Political Science lecturer at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, said it was morally expedient, for the purpose of fairness, equity and fair play, for people holding appointive public offices and seeking elective posts to resign from their current offices.\n\nAccording to him, the appointees do not even need Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 or any similar instrument to force them to do the right thing.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is disappointing as it is disturbing that most of the people aspiring for office of the president within the ruling party are not showing good examples. They are not also helping their government.\n\n\u201cI feel sad that they do not want history to be kind to them. And I actually have pity for that situation. They forget that there is tomorrow and that no matter how long it takes, they must, one day, be called upon to render account of their stewardship.\u201d\n\nEzenwa Nwagu, executive director of Partners for Electoral Reforms, said Emefiele should resign if he is interested in running for president, going by the CBN Act.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think first is to look at what the CBN Act says. The CBN Act already constraint him not to be in that platform and still running for election. So if he wants to contest election, he should resign, especially against the background that sensitive election materials are kept in the CBN vault. So, the man who presides over CBN cannot sit tight there and contest election.\n\n\u201cHe already knows that if he wants to contest, he has to resign. To even ask about the moral justification is to pretend that we don\u2019t know what the CBN Act talks about that.\u201d\n\nReacting to the issue, Yinka Farounbi, a former chairman of Ikeja branch of the Nigerian Bar Association, said it was morally wrong for Emefiele to contest the presidential ticket of his party while still retaining his position.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening is unfortunate; this is the same person in charge of the economy. We did not know he had political ambition and belonged to the APC. There is no hope, if we continue to find people like this in positions of authority. If I were him, I would save my face, integrity and resign to pursue my ambition,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Nigeria is not heeding calls to cut compulsive spending and manage a ballooning debt service cost that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts will gulp 92 percent of public revenues this year.\n\nRising global interest rates has made it more expensive for frontier and emerging markets to borrow money from the international market, yet Nigeria\u2019s debt appetite remains high as government expenses pile. This year, Abuja increased its spending plans to make room for a nine-fold increase of a controversial petrol subsidy.\n\nThe government is planning another Eurobond sale of $950 million in May, according to Zainab Ahmed, the finance minister. That will be the second time this year that the government is tapping a volatile Eurobond market that many sovereigns have steered clear off for fear of high pricing.\n\nNigeria\u2019s return to the international debt market at a time investors are wary of the volatility across financial markets shows the government\u2019s urgent need for cash.\n\nWasteful spending like the petrol subsidy will continue this year, gulping nearly a third of the federal budget and pushing the budget deficit to the highest in 23 years, according to Central Bank data compiled by BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cThe sad reality is that the federal government is running a very large deficit which cannot practically be funded only from the local markets,\u201d said Egie Akpata, chairman of Lagos-based financial advisory firm, Skymark Partners Limited.\n\nSome analysts had expected the government to return to the market much later than the new May timeline given by the finance minister.\n\n\u201cEurobond yields have been rising, so the sooner Nigeria sells a new issue, the cheaper it would be relative to waiting till later in the year,\u201d Akpata said.\n\n\u201cThe issue would likely be successful, but Nigeria may pay a substantially higher rate than the recent March issue\u201d Akpata added.\n\nRead also: Why economy remains key to unlocking Nigerian capital markets \u2014 experts\n\nNigeria successfully issued the continent\u2019s first Eurobond in 2022, raising $1.25bn in March at the cost of 8.375 percent, a premium over its dollar bonds due 2028, which were trading at a 7.83 percent yield at the time.\n\nThe sale shocked global fund managers who felt the market conditions did not support a Eurobond issue on the back of rising funding costs which was partly fueled by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt was unexpected,\u201d Tatonga Rusike, the London-based sub-Saharan Africa economist at Bank of America Corp, said of Nigeria\u2019s Eurobond sale.\n\n\u201cOur base case expectation for Nigeria\u2019s issuance was in the second half\u201d of the year, Rusike said, though admitting that despite high oil prices, the government continues to run a budget deficit, requiring external financing.\n\nNigeria, which should benefit from the rally in oil prices, is unable to do so due to challenges from oil theft to low production and the rising cost of the petrol subsidy bill which the government said it was taking the Eurobond to partly fund.\n\nThe World Bank estimates Nigeria\u2019s subsidy bill will top N4 trillion ($9.6 billion) this year.",

They also use it as a marketing tool to even increase the rent for their houses because the people are assured of stable power. So, for instance, those who are building serviced apartments, they rather connect to the facility than to the others available.\u201d\n\nAn estate manager operating in Ugbor axis, Mr. Nelson Osamudiamen, said the option of connecting to Ossiomo Power changes a lot of things for residential and industrial areas.\n\n\u201cThe industrial areas are even better served because they need electricity to keep the machines running, which is not what you get everywhere in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, residential real estate benefits when it provides electricity with which we can use in winning clients.\u201d\n\nAn economic analyst, Ikponmwosa Nosakhare, said the development is critical to development in the state as the entrant of a new player ensures better service to the people.\n\n\u201cIt is great that BEDC, which used to dominate the market, now has a competitor. With this, we have a more stable market situation as people are now provided with options when considering power solutions in their homes or industries.

This is an unintended error, and we can only correct it with this amendment now before us\u201d, the Deputy Senate President said.\n\nSpeaking after the bill to amend the 2022 Electoral Act was passed, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks, said that the amendment became imperative in view of the deficiency created by the provision of section 84(8) of the extant Act.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe amended Electoral Act of 2022 that we passed this year, has a deficiency that was never intended and that deficiency will deny all statutory delegates in all political parties from participation in congresses and conventions.\n\n\u201cAnd, therefore, such a major and unintended clause has to be amended before the party primaries starts in the next eight days. This is an emergency legislation, so to speak.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is that the National Assembly \u2013 the two chambers \u2013 would finish with the processing of the amendment of this bill, between today (in the Senate) and tomorrow (in the House of Representatives), and then the Executive will do the assent.\n\n\u201cThat is so important to enable every statutory delegate to participate in the party primaries right from the beginning that will start on the 18th of May, 2022.\n\n\u201cSo, this is an emergency effort to ensure that nobody is denied his or her rightful opportunity as a delegate, especially the statutory delegates, and these are those who are elected.\n\n\u201cThese are the President, Vice President, Members of the National Assembly, Governors, Members of the State Houses of Assembly, Chairmen of Council and their Councillors, National Working Committee Members of all the political parties and so on.\n\n\u201cThis is a fundamental effort to ensure that we address this within the week, so that by next week, the Electoral Act, 2022 (amended version), will be very salutary for us to start our party primaries.\u201d",

As of now no party has selected its presidential candidate. What is utmost in the mind of every political party is to win election. No party will throw the opportunity away. The South-East needs the presidency but we can\u2019t do it alone. We need the support of other zones,\u201d he said when asked his take on the clamour for zoning of the presidency to the Southeast in 2023.\n\n\u201cIn 1999, the two political parties, the PDP, and All Peoples Party/Alliance for Democracy APP/AD through internal mechanism chose their candidates from the South-West so that head or tail the winner of the presidential election would come from the South-West. It was done to assuage the zone.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 situation is repeating itself and many Nigerians are in support of the presidency going to the South-East. Let the two major political parties -APC and PDP pick their candidates from the South-East so that justice will be seen to have been done.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the prevailing insecurity in Southeast, the promised to name sponsors in two weeks time.\n\nAsked why he did not name sponsors of killings in the state, the governor said at a stakeholders meeting, recently, security agencies asked him not to do so because they were still investigating the killings.\n\n\u201cI contacted the security agencies two weeks ago, they asked for two weeks more. I hope in two weeks time, those responsible will be revealed to Nigerians. The security agencies asked for more time to do their investigation,\u201d he disclosed.\n\nSpeaking on the alleged disunity among five governors of the Southeast, Uzodimma said: \u201cThe situation in the South-East is not different from other zones. We are working. We are united and working together to ensure security. Security issues are not discussed in the open. It is not true that we are not talking to ourselves.\u201d\n\nOn last week\u2019s Supreme Court judgement, which gave 17 disputed oil wells to Rivers State, Governor Uzodimma said he was yet to get the details of the judgement.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen details of the judgement. It is too early to celebrate. I want to wait till I see the details. Some of the oil wells are in Oguta Local Government Area of Imo State. Does it mean Oguta is now in Rivers State? I have a lot of respect for the Supreme Court. Until I see the details of the judgement, if there are areas that are not clear I will approach the court for interpretation,\u201d he said.",

We are going to intervene. We will make concerted and sustained efforts to bring back ASUU and the Federal government to the negotiating table so that we are able to resolve as quickly as possible those issues that are now very knotty and have stopped our Universities from reopening, that is now making our students walking the streets all over the country.\n\n\u201cBut I want to appeal to you too, since we are going to make effort to bring back everybody back to the negotiating table, you should give us a chance to do that believing that we are going to find a solution because it is not only enough to bring them back to the negotiating table, but we will participate and I want to make sure that we find the solution when we start the negotiation again.\n\n\u201cNow that you have come here, we are going to make sure that everybody in this sector especially those in public sector who has responsibility and mandate perform their functions.

We have taken this prayer. We have endorsed it and we will work for it as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportunity for me also to appeal to ASUU to suspend this strike period because there is no way ASUU can negotiate with the Federal government when it is on strike. So it is an opportunity for us to have them, at least create a window, suspend the strike for a certain period and let us see how far we can go.\n\n\u201cI want to be very positive that we are going to resolve this issue as soon as possible by the Grace of God,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nThe Senate President said the 2009 agreement which is the crux of the matter was not properly thought out before it was signed.\n\n\u201cSomebody just wanted ASUU to go back to the classroom and just signed everything there.

          "text": "The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Tuesday, said that the Senate will intervene in the lingering dispute between the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) by bringing back the two parties to the negotiation table.\n\nLawan made the promise to the officials of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), who were led to his office by a concerned Methodist Bishop, Dr. Sunday Ndukwo Onuoha.\n\nThe NANS President, Sunday Asefon, who spoke for his other colleagues, lamented their continued stay at home and disruption of their academic programme, urging the Senate President to intervene in the dispute between the Federal government and the University teachers.\n\nResponding, the Senate President expressed unhappiness about the turn of events, recalling that the Senate had intervened in the past before everything broke down again.\n\nHe, however, promised that the Senate would wade in again and expressed optimism that the issues would soon be resolved.\n\n\u201cYou are in the right place. We are going to intervene. We will make concerted and sustained efforts to bring back ASUU and the Federal government to the negotiating table so that we are able to resolve as quickly as possible those issues that are now very knotty and have stopped our Universities from reopening, that is now making our students walking the streets all over the country.\n\n\u201cBut I want to appeal to you too, since we are going to make effort to bring back everybody back to the negotiating table, you should give us a chance to do that believing that we are going to find a solution because it is not only enough to bring them back to the negotiating table, but we will participate and I want to make sure that we find the solution when we start the negotiation again.\n\n\u201cNow that you have come here, we are going to make sure that everybody in this sector especially those in public sector who has responsibility and mandate perform their functions. We will make sure they do that.\n\n\u201cBecause you have come, I think we also have some tonic enough in us. Time is of essence and we must do whatever is necessary to get this issue resolved,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nAlso responding to the threat by the students to distrupt political activities, Lawan appealed to them to continue in the path of consultation and avoid confrontation.\n\n\u201cI want to also advise, I don\u2019t think it will be necessary to distrupt political activities. We shouldn\u2019t do that and we don\u2019t need to do that.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is to continue to follow the path of consultation, consolidation and avoid confrontation. It is when you emphasise consultation, it is much easier for us to find something that you can consolidate.\n\n\u201cYour prayer that you want the Federal government and ASUU back to negotiate and resolve the issues. We have taken this prayer. We have endorsed it and we will work for it as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportunity for me also to appeal to ASUU to suspend this strike period because there is no way ASUU can negotiate with the Federal government when it is on strike. So it is an opportunity for us to have them, at least create a window, suspend the strike for a certain period and let us see how far we can go.\n\n\u201cI want to be very positive that we are going to resolve this issue as soon as possible by the Grace of God,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nThe Senate President said the 2009 agreement which is the crux of the matter was not properly thought out before it was signed.\n\n\u201cSomebody just wanted ASUU to go back to the classroom and just signed everything there. We must understand that there are things that when we promise, we should do, we must do,\u201d Lawan stated.",

A vote for Dr. Sanni Abdullahi Ozomata is a vote for quality representation.\n\n\u201cYou all would have noticed that Dr. Sanni Abdullahi Ozomata is not present here and is not involved in the purchase of this form. As a matter of fact, he is, at this moment, in Saudi Arabia performing the lesser Hajj. So we shall submit this form to Alh. Abdulrahman Obini, the CWC chairman of the Ozomata 2023 campaign organisation, in order to present same to him upon his return.\n\n\u201cWe hope that he accepts this gesture as an entrustment from the good people of Okene/Ogori-Magongo constituency.\n\n\u201cWe also take this moment to appreciate the executive governor of Kogi State, His Excellency, Alh Yahaya Adoza Bello on his developmental and transformative strides in Kogi State.

          "text": "The Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) Abubakar Malami (SAN) has had all sales and disposals of assets made under the Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulations, 2019 annulled by the Federal High Court in Lagos.\n\nThe Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulations, 2019 were also declared unconstitutional by the court as \u201can invalid statutory instrument.\u201d\n\nThe Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulations, 2019, were found to be \u201cultra vires the office and powers\u201d of the AGF, according to the court.\n\nOn Monday, May 9, Justice Ambrose Lewis-Allagoa issued the order in the case FHC/L/CS/40/2021, which was filed by the plaintiff, Incorporated Trustees of HEDA Resource Centre, against the AGF as the lone defendant.\n\nThe Inter-Ministerial Committee on the Disposition of Assets Forfeited to the Nigerian Government was inaugurated by the AGF on November 9, 2020.\n\nThis, according to the minister, was in accordance with the President\u2019s directive in October 2018 following recommendations of the Presidential Audit Committee on Recovery and Management of Stolen Assets and a need for efficient management of the assets.\n\n\n\nBut HEDA, through its counsel, Omotayo Olatubosun, challenged the AGF\u2019s power to set up the committee.\n\nIt argued that the regulations conflicted with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Act, Trafficking in Persons (Prohibition) Enforcement and Administrative Act, 2015, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) Act, 2004 and Independent Corrupt Practices Commission Act (ICPC), 2000, among others, on the matter of disposal of final forfeited assets.\n\nThe plaintiff sought nine reliefs, including the nullification of all disposals of assets by the AGF\u2019s Committee.\n\nIn its judgment, the court dismissed the AGF\u2019s preliminary objection argued by its counsel, Tolu Mokunolu, and granted all of HEDA\u2019s reliefs as prayed on the motion paper.\n\nJustice Lewis-Allagoa held: \u201cI am entirely in agreement with the submission of counsel for the plaintiff that the Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulations, 2019 are contrary to the statutory provisions of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC Act, Trafficking in Persons Cohabitation Enforcement and Administration Act, NDLEA Act and Immigration Act.\n\n\u201cA careful perusal of the above statutory provisions will show the provisions for the Attorney-General of the Federation to make regulations for the agencies for disposal of assets under the various enactments listed above.\n\n\u201cThe above statutory enactments are therefore the enabling source of the Attorney-General of the Federation to the regulations.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the administrative powers to be exercised by the Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation must flow from the enabling statutes.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to state that the powers of the Attorney-General of the Federation do not override the provisions of the enabling statutes stabilising the powers of the law enforcement agencies and anti-corruption agencies and consequently the powers referred to in the commencement clause of the regulations merely are to be exercised in accordance with the Acts not to usurp the mandatory powers vested in the law enforcement agencies and the anti-corruption agencies.\n\n\u201cI am therefore in agreement with counsel for the plaintiff that the executive orders or any other forms of definition can be issued pursuant to session 315 of the Constitution; however, they are limited to enactments predating the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe Acts under Consideration in this instant suit were enacted after the 1999 Constitution and do not fall within the ambit of session 315 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cIn all and for the reasons hereinbefore given in this judgement, the questions put for determination in the originating summons are answered in favour of the plaintiff and all the reliefs sought are granted as prayed.\n\nThis is the judgment of the court read in the open court.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Plaintiff\u2019s reliefs granted by the judge include a declaration that by the ICPC Act, the Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulations, 2019 \u201cis an invalid statutory instrument the former having conferred no power arrogated by the Defendant to himself in the latter Regulations;\n\n\u201cAn Order nullifying the Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulations, 2019 as an invalid statutory instrument same being in excess of the provisions of the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission Act, 2000;\n\n\u201cAn Order nullifying all sales and disposals of assets made by the Defendant pursuant to the said Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulations, 2019 same being ultra vires the office and powers of the Defendant\u201d.\n\n\n\nSome officials in the Federal Ministry of Justice had been reportedly selling off forfeited and retrieved assets owned by the Nigerian Government.",

          "title": "June 3 deadline on primaries: INEC turns down 37-day extension request by political parties",
          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Tuesday rejected appeals by political parties to review its timelines and schedule of activities, specifically, to shift deadline for party primaries to July 9 instead of the commission\u2019s date of June 3.\n\nWelcoming party leaders at the 2nd consultative quarterly meeting with political parties, INEC Chairman Professor Mahmood Yakubu reiterated that the position of the commission on strict compliance to the timeline and schedules of activities remains sacrosanct as any review would encroach into another activity.\n\nYakubu stated: \u201cI hereby reiterate the position of the Commission that there will be no review of the timelines. There are so many inter-related activities that are associated with the timelines which must be carried out.\n\n\u201cAny review to extend the timeline for one activity will affect other activities and put unnecessary pressure on political parties and the Commission. This will ultimately result in more complications than what the extension seeks to achieve.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the commission will not review the timelines. Working together, we should ensure fidelity to the timelines in conducting transparent and democratic primaries for the purpose of electing candidates for the 1,491 constituencies for which elections will be held on 25th February and 11th March 2023.\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of working together to comply with the requirements of law, the Commission has prepared a document to guide political parties in the conduct of primaries and nomination of candidates for election, including a checklist of the documentation required for a successful nomination.\n\n\u201cThe guide is among the documents contained in your folders for this meeting. Similarly, the Commission has prepared a calendar of party primaries for presidential, governorship, national and state assembly seats based on the proposals submitted by political parties as at Friday 6th May 2022. This document is also contained in your folders for this meeting.\u201d\n\nOn inclusivity\n\nYakubu also reminded the parties of their commitment to promoting inclusivity in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cAs you conduct your primaries and nominate candidates for elections, this is the appropriate time to remind you of your commitment to promoting inclusivity in the electoral process. Women, Youths and Persons with Disability (PWDs) have been yearning for greater representation, particularly in elective positions.\n\n\u201cTo assure citizens that you are not paying lip service to this commitment, political parties should encourage greater involvement of all under-represented segments of the society as candidates for elections.\n\n\u201cThis is the only way we can change the reality of increasingly low level of representation of these critical segments of the society in legislative assemblies in particular and the governance of our country in general,\u201d the INEC boss reiterated.\n\nOur case \u2013 Parties\n\nResponding to the chairman\u2019s speech, Chairman of the Inter- Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Engineer Yabagi Yusuf Sani, made a strong case for a shift in the date for the primary elections from June 3 to July 9.\n\nYabagi said this was based on what he called \u201cthe imperatives of ensuring free and credible polls.\n\nYabagi said INEC, under the leadership of Prof Mahmood Yakubu, \u201chas won the confidence of the IPAC and all well-meaning citizens, friends of our country and democrats around the world as a result of the zeal, courage and dexterity which have so far, hugely resulted in the conduct of elections marked by unprecedented high level of transparency, credibility, integrity and widespread acceptance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is within the framework of the enduring bond between the INEC and IPAC in service to the country, that all the eighteen registered political parties on the platform of IPAC are jointly, without exception, requesting the INEC to consider a slight adjustment to the recently announced timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general elections,\u201d Yabagi pleaded.\n\nHe further said: \u201cIn summary, the General Assembly of IPAC, after an exhaustive examination of the INEC timetable and related issues, arrived at a unanimous decision to request for an extension of thirty-seven (37) days to the deadline of the time frame for the conduct of party primaries and resolution of conflicts arising from the primaries.\n\n\u201cBy implication, the IPAC leadership is appealing to the INEC to extend the deadline for the conduct of party primaries and resolution of ensuing conflicts from the present INEC given date of 3rd June, 2022 to the 9th of July, 2022.\n\n\u201cSome of the issues considered by the IPAC General Assembly which necessitated the call for extension in the timeframe of the present INEC timetable and schedule of activities are based on certain circumstances and developments that have hampered timely and strict compliance by the political parties to the timetable.\n\n\u201cSome of the constraining developments which, we believe were not considered and therefore, not factored by the INEC while drawing up its schedule of activities, include the following:\n\n\u201cThe Christian Lenten season and the Muslim fasting in the month of Ramadan respectively followed by the celebrations of Easter and Eid-el-Fitr, (Sallah), in which the vast majority of party members were involved.\n\n\u201cThe developments inevitably therefore, greatly disrupted planned activities and programmes of the political parties, leading to the loss of about two weeks out of the allotted time of the timetable. It is also, noteworthy that, the scenario was the first time that the two major events in the Christian and Muslim calendars would be occurring around the period of general elections in the country.\n\n\u201cThe forthcoming gubernatorial elections in Ekiti and Osun states within the timeline of the INEC for the conduct of party primaries were additional remarkable distractions and constraints that obviously affected the political parties because, most of them are, understandably, preoccupied with preparations for the conduct of the elections.\n\n\u201cVery pertinently, the IPAC General Assembly regards the time allotted by INEC for the conduct of party primaries as too short in view of the efforts required by the political parties for effective and scrupulous screening and selection of qualified and quality flag bearers.\n\n\u201cThe significance of a tidy selection of party candidates in the elections comes, on the long run, with the benefits of minimising conflicts with all the likelihood of slowing down the electoral process.\n\n\u201cRelatedly, while the unprecedented large number of aspirants jostling to emerge as candidates of their various political parties in the coming general elections, have made the task of screening very cumbersome and demanding, the political parties have also had to be cautious and painstaking in the screening and selection procedures as a safeguard against creating rooms for disruptive incidents of litigation by aggrieved aspirants.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn making the request for extension in the INEC stipulated timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general elections, we in the Inter-Party Advisory Council, are not unmindful of the provisions of the Constitution and the Electoral Act with respect to timelines in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe are however, of the considered view that our request will not, in any way, tantamount to an infringement or, a breach of any extant laws and provisions. This is because, the alterations that we are demanding, will not affect the statutory dates already fixed for the conduct of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cWe are praying for the slight changes in the timetable for the conduct of party primaries in full consciousness of our position as key stakeholders in the nation\u2019s democratic process and who, at the bottom of it all, constitute not only the greatest beneficiaries but, as the platform of all the registered political parties, we are in fact, the fulcrum around which the entire system and processes revolve.\n\n\u201cWe should, therefore, be seen as a body of responsible and patriotic interest bloc with a very high sense of responsibility and commitment to the success of every crucial stage and aspects in the electoral chain.\n\n\u201cBy way of illustration and reinforcement of our position that the request for slight modifications in the INEC schedule of activities is not, as such, without a precedence, I wish to recall the nation\u2019s experience in 2019, when in the heat of the general elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission called for a twenty-four shift in the conduct of a scheduled segment of the exercise.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the postponement neither affected the smooth conduct of that year\u2019s entire exercise, nor did it reduce its perception and acceptance by the public as a fair, credible and transparent election.\n\n\u201cBy the way, I should perhaps, also recall that in the 2019 incident referred to above, the political parties on the platform of the Inter-Party Advisory Council, overwhelmingly and solidly stood by the Independent National Electoral Commission by unanimously supporting the call for a shift in the conduct of the election.\n\n\u201cThat show of solidarity and decision of the political parties was informed by their patriotic consideration of the fact that in the circumstance, taking that course of action was the most rational option, in the superior imperatives of democracy, the electoral process, peace and tranquillity in the polity.\n\n\u201cThis time around, we are expecting the INEC, to regard the quest of the political parties for an extension in the timeline for the conduct of party primaries as a decision that is in the ultimate best interest of the nation\u2019s democracy and specifically, the smooth and successful conduct of a rancour free, credible, transparent, free and fair elections in the year 2023,\u201d IPAC further canvassed.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

Remember that it is about food and nutritional security, the well-being of our farmers, improved income and less use of chemical sprays for environmental sustainability,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking on the safety of the improved PBR Cowpea, the director-general, National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA), Dr. Rufus Ebegba, assured Nigerians the crop is safe for both human consumption and the environment.\n\nHe stressed that the PBR, genetically-modified with a non-harmful substance sourced from the soil (Bacillus Thuringiensis) that resists insect attacks and infestation of the staple food, was subjected to several rigorous risks analysis and safety tests by the Federal Government before approval for public consumption.\n\nAlso, the country coordinator, Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology OFAB, Nigeria chapter, Dr. Rose Gidado, said Nigeria has etched her place in the comity of nations with the commercialisation of the PBR Cowpea. Nigeria\u2019s action, she said, has caused other African nations to come learn from her success. She stressed there is no difference between the conventional cowpea and the modified one. \u201cApart from being resistant to insects, they share the same characteristics in taste, colour, texture etc.\u201d",

There are so many inter-related activities that are associated with the timelines which must be carried out.

This will ultimately result in more complications than what the extension seeks to achieve.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the Commission will not review the timelines.

This is emergency legislation, so to speak. Our expectation is that the National Assembly \u2013 the two chambers \u2013 would finish with the processing of this amendment of this bill, between today (in the Senate) and tomorrow (in the House of Representatives), and then the Executive will do the assent.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President added, \u201cThat is so important to enable every statutory delegate to participate in the party primaries right from the beginning that will start on the 18th of May, 2022. So, this is an emergency effort to ensure that nobody is denied his or her rightful opportunity as a delegate, especially the statutory delegates, and these are those who are elected.\n\n\u201cThese are the President, Vice President, members of the National Assembly, governors, members of the State Houses of Assembly, chairmen of councils and their councillors, national working committee members of all the political parties, and so on.\n\n\u201cThis is a fundamental effort to ensure that we address this within the week, so that by next week, the Electoral Act, 2022 (amended version), will be very salutary for us to start our party primaries.\u201d",

          "text": "The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo state Taiwo Adisa has slammed Senator Teslim Folarin, a governorship aspirant on the platform of the opposition All Progressives Congress in the state, for claiming that none of the opposition party\u2019s gubernatorial aspirants is as worse as Makinde.\n\nAdisa, in a statement in response to Folarin\u2019s attack on Governor Makinde, said that the Senator \u201cdished out lies about Makinde\u201d while declaring his governorship ambition at the APC Secretariat in Ibadan.\n\nThe governor\u2019s aide, who wondered why Folarin turned an event designed for him to declare his 2023 governorship ambition into a fiesta of lies, said the Oyo State electorate would not fall for the lies of APC chieftains, including Folarin, against Governor Makinde.\n\nThe governor\u2019s aide declared that it was laughable that despite the massive infrastructure development, improvement in the education and health sectors and other efforts of the Makinde government in the last three years, Folarin could still say he was coming to rescue Oyo State \u201cbecause every tangible project in the state was done by the previous government.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adisa, rather than Folarin articulating details of his in comparison to Makinde\u2019s globally acclaimed Roadmap to Accelerated Development of Oyo State, 2019-2023, he only marshaled a couple of lies, which insulted the sensibilities of Oyo State residents across the five zones of the state, who have continued to laud Governor Makinde for good governance in the state.\n\nAdisa, commended Folarin for telling residents of Oyo State what they already suspect; that governorship aspirants in APC were bad products, as according to him [Adisa], there is no basis to compare Makinde with any of them.\n\nAdisa said: \u201cWe have read with amusement words credited to an Oyo APC governorship aspirant, Senator Teslim Folarin, that he is coming to rescue Oyo State and that none of the aspirants in the ill-fated APC, Oyo State chapter is as bad as Governor Makinde.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we must commend Folarin for letting the Oyo State public know that governorship aspirants in APC are bad products. However, there is no basis to compare any of the APC governorship aspirants with Governor Makinde.\n\n\u201cNobody can compare light with darkness. In three years, Makinde has done what the APC government failed to do in eight years; building over 500 kilometres of road, putting in place a free and qualitative education system, improving the health and security sector and all that.\n\n\u201cSenator Folarin was also credited to have said that all tangible projects in the state were done by the previous government. This is an outright lie and we are sure that the people of Oyo State do not need such a lie. The people will not fall for cheap lies and deceit.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to ask whether it was the previous APC government that built the 65 km Moniya-Iseyin road, the 45km Saki-Ogbooro-Igboho Road, the 12km Awotan- Akufo concrete road, the 38km Oyo-Iseyin road and the 76 km Ogbomoso-Iseyin road, which are at various stages of completion as we speak.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe people will also ask whether it was the failed APC administration of 2011 to 2019 that built the magnificent Bus Terminals at Ojoo and Challenge as well the Terminals at Iwo Road and Old Ife Road, which are nearing completion.\n\n\u201cIt can be seen that Folarin has not been in touch with the reality in Oyo State, he thus needs to connect with Oyo State people and his followers, who could tell him the state of things regarding infrastructure development under the Makinde government.\n\n\u201cHe needs to at least be conversant with his local government, Ona-Ara, where massive developments are ongoing. He needs to be told that in his Ona-Ara Local Govt of origin, the Makinde government is building the 37-kilometre Akanran-Olorunsogo-Dagbolu and 21 Ajia-Airport Road with spur to Amuloko and the two will be commissioned shortly.\n\n\u201cIn order to end his apparent lack of information or is it denial of reality, we will volunteer to take the senator on a tour of tangible projects across the state, from Moniya-Iseyin Road, to Asipa-Sabo-Gedu-Oroki Road to the Saki Township Road, and also visit ongoing road projects in Oyo-Iseyin and the 76-kilometre Iseyin-Ogbomoso roads and end the trip in Ona-Ara.\u201d\n\nAdisa warned Folarin to stop his unnecessary obsession with attacking Makinde, urging him to focus on how to convince his partymen in the APC to accept him as candidate despite his undemocratic credentials.\n\n\u201cWe urge Folarin to focus his energy on convincing those he met in APC, when he defected from PDP which he ruined with his undemocratic tendencies, rather than inciting the people and engaging in baseless conspiracies against a government that is delivering good governance,\u201d the statement added.",

          "text": "The head of the World Health Organization said on Tuesday China\u2019s zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy is not sustainable given what is now known of the virus, in rare public comments by the U.N. agency on a government\u2019s handling of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that it is sustainable considering the behaviour of the virus and what we now anticipate in the future,\u201d WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a media briefing.\n\n\u201cWe have discussed this issue with Chinese experts. And we indicated that the approach will not be sustainable\u2026 I think a shift would be very important.\u201d\n\nHe said increased knowledge about the virus and better tools to combat it also suggested it was time for a change of strategy.\n\nThe comments come after China\u2019s leaders have repeated their resolve to battle the virus with tough measures and threatened action against critics at home even as strict and prolonged lockdowns exact a heavy toll on the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nSpeaking after Tedros, WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan said the impact of a \u201czero-COVID\u201d policy on human rights also needs to be taken into consideration.\n\n\u201cWe have always said as WHO that we need to balance the control measures against the impact they have on society, the impact they have on the economy, and that\u2019s not always an easy calibration,\u201d said Ryan.\n\nHe also noted that China has registered 15,000 deaths since the virus first emerged in the city of Wuhan in late 2019 \u2013 a relatively low number compared with nearly 1 million in the United States, more than 664,000 in Brazil and over 524,000 in India.\n\nWith that in mind, it is understandable, Ryan said, that the world\u2019s most populous country would want to take tough measures to curb coronavirus contagion.\n\nStill, China\u2019s zero-COVID policy has drawn criticism ranging from scientists to its own citizens, leading to a cycle of lockdowns of many millions of people, anguish and anger. Most other nations that shared its approach initially have now at least begun a transition to strategies to live with the virus.\n\nThe continued outbreaks also underscore how difficult it is to stop the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. read more\n\nUnder zero-COVID, authorities lock down large population areas to stamp out viral spread in response to any coronavirus outbreak, even if just a small number of people test positive.\n\nShanghai\u2019s measures have been particularly strict, with residents allowed out of compounds only for exceptional reasons, such as a medical emergency. Many are not even allowed out of their front doors to mingle with neighbours.\n\nIts quarantine policy has also been criticised for separating children from parents and putting asymptomatic cases among those with symptoms.\n\nHighlighting the far-reaching impact of prolonged lockdowns on global manufacturing and supplies of critical goods, General Electric\u2019s (GE.N) healthcare unit outlined on Tuesday the drastic measures it has taken to deal with shortages of dye used for medical scans and tests in the United States caused by the suspension of its Shanghai factory.",

          "text": "Billionaire Elon Musk said Tuesday he would reverse Twitter\u2019s ban on former U.S. President Donald Trump when he buys the social media platform, the clearest signal of Musk\u2019s intention to cut moderation of the site.\n\nMusk, the world\u2019s richest person and chief executive of Tesla Inc, has inked a $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. He has called himself a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d but given few specific details of his plans.\n\nMusk is expected to become Twitter\u2019s temporary CEO after closing the deal, Reuters previously reported according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\nThe question of reinstating Trump has been seen as a litmus test of how far Musk will go in making changes.\n\nMusk, speaking to the Financial Times Future of the Car conference, added that he and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey believe permanent bans should be \u201cextremely rare\u201d and reserved for accounts that operate bots or spread spam.\n\nMusk said the decision to ban Trump amplified his views among people on the political right, and he called the ban \u201cmorally wrong and flat-out stupid.\u201d\n\nThe suspension of Trump\u2019s account, which had more than 88 million followers, silenced his primary megaphone days before the end of his term and follows years of debate about how social media companies should moderate the accounts of powerful global leaders.\n\nTrump was permanently suspended from Twitter shortly after the Jan. 6 riot on the U.S. Capitol. Twitter cited \u201cthe risk of further incitement of violence\u201d in its decision.\n\n\u2018OUGHT TO BE EVERYWHERE\u2019\n\nConservatives, who have accused San Francisco-based Twitter of bias against right-leaning views, have cheered the prospect of Trump\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cHe (Trump) ought to be everywhere he can,\u201d Republican Senator Rick Scott told reporters when asked about Musk\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cWe ought to have free speech in this country. We shouldn\u2019t have social media companies that are restricting people\u2019s ability to get their message out,\u201d added Scott.\n\nDemocrats have said Trump\u2019s potential reinstatement could constitute a threat to democracy, although some hope that a frequently-tweeting Trump could upset their base and rev up turnout in the November midterm congressional elections.\n\nTwitter declined to comment.\n\nTrump had previously told Fox News that he would not return to Twitter even if Musk purchases the platform and reinstates his account, and said he would use his own social media app called Truth Social, a Twitter-like platform that launched on the Apple app store in lat February and in which users post \u201ctruths\u201d instead of tweets.\n\nTrump has revved up his messaging on the new platform after a slow start, posting about 50 times, mostly in the last week, to his 2.7 million followers.\n\nThe platform is owned by Trump Media & Technology Group, which is led by Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman. There was no immediate comment from a Trump spokesperson.\n\nDuring the conference, Musk said the deal to acquire Twitter could be done in two to three months in the \u201cbest case scenario.\u201d But he added Twitter has not yet filed the proxy for a shareholder vote to approve the deal, and there were still outstanding questions that needed to be resolved.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Twitter shares fell to a level that indicated the stock market took the view for the first time that it was unlikely that Musk would make the acquisition for $44 billion, as he originally agreed.\n\nReuters",
