          "title": "Insecurity: Discordant tunes trail Southern governors\u2019 call for national dialogue",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu, Abuja\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the recent call for a national dialogue to address the various challenges, particularly the insecurity bedeviling the country, prominent Nigerians added their voices to the conversation.\n\nGovernors of 17 Southern states had in a meeting in Asaba, the Delta state capital, demanded a national dialogue even as they tasked President Muhammadu Buhari to take urgent steps to restructure the country. They also berated the first citizen for making \u201clopsided appointments\u201d in flagrant negation of the federal character principle since he assumed office in 2015.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to Vanguard, constitutional lawyer and human rights activist, Mike Ozekhome said opposition to the Asaba declaration by some Northern elements is difficult to comprehend.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe sudden unexpected kick by some Northern elites against the patriotic resolutions passed last week at a meeting held in Asaba by the 17 Southern Governors of Nigeria is quite worrisome and definitely uncalled for. They (Northern elites) may probably be afraid that the South has finally woken up and shaken off its Stockholm syndrome.\n\nI guess they are scared that the assumed long-suffering \u2018slaves\u2019 of Nigeria may finally achieve their overdue liberation, liberty, and freedom, and attain their independence from the asphyxiating grip of perpetual overlords, \u2018slave\u2019 masters, Neo-colonialists and territorial expansionists.\n\n\u201cThey may fear that under a true fiscal federation anchored on the principles of federalism, everyone will now be required to contribute to the baking of the national cake and not just merely sharing it.\u201d\n\nThe Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN, also expressed shock at the sudden turn of events, following the rejection of open grazing of cattle by some Northern leaders. According to Ozekhome, Nigerians can \u201cclearly recall that it was the Northern governors that actually first set the ball rolling at their virtual meeting of 9th February 2021 on the urgent need to ban open grazing. Their communiqu\u00e9 was to the effect that open cattle grazing should be immediately abolished.\n\n\u201cWhy the sudden and inexplicable somersault by some of the same Northern elites? What are they worried about? What do they know that the rest of us Nigerians do not?\u201d he asked.\n\nAlthough dialogue may go a long way at addressing many of the challenges facing Nigeria today, Anthony Sani, immediate past Secretary-General of the Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, told Vanguard that sincerity in the proposed national conference would be taken with a pinch of salt.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m not opposed to any national dialogue for the purpose of dispelling misconceptions in the hope of commanding loyalty to the Nigerian project, such dialogue should add value to the polity and not for a mere publicity stunt,\u201d he said.\n\nRather than convene another conference, Sani said leafing through recommendations of past confabs may help the nation out of her current woes.\n\nHe continued: \u201cNigeria has experienced three conferences in recent history- General Sani Abacha, President Olusegun Obasanjo, and President Goodluck Jonathan confabs. Since the conferences comprised unelected delegates, their reports could not possibly be binding. But these reports can still serve as resources for the political parties and the legislatures to enrich the quality and volume of their manifesto and also legislative deliberations.\u201d\n\nThe ex-scribe further called for caution in the implementation of an outright ban on open grazing, saying, \u201cthough I agree that open grazing is not the best practices for improved livestock, I do not share the view that banning it this time when the landless herders do not have the wherewithal is practicable.\u201d\n\nFor rights activist, Aisha Yesufu, all that is needed to change the fortune of the country for good is for President Buhari to sit up and face the challenges of governance squarely.\n\n\u201cNigerians are so interested in motion without movement. What is the national conference going to address that Nigerians have not been talking about over the years? Is the national conference our Commander-in-Chief? We either get the Commander-in-Chief to get to work or he should be impeached, sacked, or whatever so that someone else who is ready to do the work can come in.\n\n\u201cDo we need a national conference to tell us that we are being killed? Are the terrorists holding a national conference on how to go about killing Nigerians? What we don\u2019t have is a competent Commander-in-Chief and that is why we are losing the war against insurgency,\u201d she stressed.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nThe Federal Executive Council (FEC), at its meeting on Wednesday, approved a total sum of N8.8 billion for the completion of the Bagwai irrigation project in Kano State and the Biu water supply project in Borno.\n\nEngr. Suleiman Adamu, Minister of Water Resources, told State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, that the Bagwai irrigation project was stalled due to lack of funds.\n\n\u201cToday, I presented two memos to the FEC; both of these memos are requesting for augmentation for existing and ongoing projects; one for irrigation and one for water supply.\n\n\u201cThe first one was for expansion and completion of the Bagwai Irrigation Project on Watari Dam in Bagwai local government area of Kano state; we have sought for an augmentation of N3.76 billion, which was approved.\n\n\u201cThe contract has been ongoing and at some point suspended because of lack of funding.\n\n\u201cIt was awarded to Messrs Dantata and Sawoe Construction Company Limited; mobilised in 2006 for an initial period of two years; the scope of work was a special irrigation scheme involving 872 hectares.\n\n\u201cWe have done an audit, in line with our policy since the inception of this administration and since I came into office in 2015, whereby we are laying more emphasis on completion of ongoing and abandoned projects.\n\n\u201cTherefore, council was gracious to approve this augmentation with the sum of N3.762 billion, bringing the new contract sum to N9.2 billion from N5.4 billion, inclusive of 7.5 per cent VAT, with an additional completion period of 24 months plus another 12 months liability period.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said that the second memo was a request for augmentation for the Biu Water Supply Project that started in 2001.\n\nAdamu said that the project ran into a lot of problems, mainly associated with funding and the Boko Haram insurgency.\n\n\u201cSo, we sought for an augmentation; there were two contracts; Lots one and two, which have now been merged into one contract in favour of Nalado Nigeria Limited, who are the contractors for one of the Lots.\n\n\u201cBut because the contractor for Lot one has decided to opt-out of the contract, we sought approval of the Bureau of Public Procurement and the other company that was doing the Lot; Nalado Nigeria Limited, agreed to take over the Lot which was being executed by Mothercat.\n\n\u201cSo, the total augmentation, like I said, is N5.063 billion, bringing the contracts sum now to N9.36 billion from N4.29 billion, inclusive 7.5 per cent VAT, with a new completion period of 24 months.\n\n\u201c We hope that these projects will be implemented in earnest and hopefully, we will be able to get them completed by 2023 for the overall benefit of the people.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said it was prudent to complete the projects rather than embark on new ones because a lot of investment had already been made and the investment would be lost if the projects were abandoned.\n\n\u201cIf we are not able to complete them to a logical conclusion to ensure that the people they are meant for directly benefit from them, then it would have been a lost investment.\n\n\u201c That is why we are laying a lot of emphasis on completion of ongoing and abandoned projects. We have made a lot of progress in that regard since 2015 or 2016,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n(NAN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

It has now remained the most virulent form of banditry in Nigeria and the most pervasive and intractable violent crime in the country.\n\n\u201cKidnapping is on the increase in Nigeria and it is prevalent across all the geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cSome blame the rise of this criminal activity on poverty, religion, politics, deficiency of existing laws, unemployment, connivance of security agents, corruption, and greed among others.\n\nHe further stated that unemployed youths are turning to kidnapping to get money as a survival strategy and ransom payment must be discouraged to stop kidnapping.\n\nHe, therefore, urged the federal government to provide adequate security, strengthen the economy as a matter of urgency, accelerate its poverty alleviation programmes and provide employment opportunities targeting youths who are mostly involved in these acts.",

In families we have Christians and Muslims, you have ethnic nationalities in your country, you have inter-married.\n\n\u201cSo, all this noise people are making is trying to draw attention to what they can get out of this country, and if you look at them, they are in the minority.\n\n\u201cIn this country, there are excellent people that mean well for common man and humanity, and that is what God created us to do.\u201d\n\nThe Sultan who is also the Co-chairman of NIREC said he is a believer of dialogue which his religion taught him.\n\nThe religious leader who expressed sadness over the security situation in the country said: \u201cSo, let\u2019s continue to work together, let\u2019s continue to sit together, let\u2019s continue to dialogue, am a total believer in dialogue and nothing will change my mind because my religion teaches me to always dialogue and I believe no problem is too big enough not to be resolved when we sit down and talk because even wars are fought to bring peace but if you know you can bring peace without fighting a war, then why do you have to take up arms.\n\n\u201cPeace is the most important aspect of our lives because without peace we can\u2019t even worship. It is a very trying time for our country Nigeria for so many reasons, most notably insecurity which does not allow anybody to do what he or she wants and at the time and place he or she wants.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we are very worried about the way things are in our Great country at this time because things are really very stressful and there is no doubt about it, and you don\u2019t have to tell anybody things are bad, and I believe that the authorities know much better than us\u201d.\n\nOn his part, the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Reverend Samson Ayokunle said insecurity has paralyzed activities across the country.\n\nAyokunle who is also the Co-chairman of NIREC said food security is being threatened as farmers are being killed by bandits in their farms.\n\nHe said: \u201cMany things are not right with the nation, the most challenging one today is insecurity which has almost paralyzed all human activities apart from the havoc the restriction brought about by Covid-19 has done.\n\n\u201cTo travel short distances today calls for serious prayers, and traveling with perhaps every security personnel because of kidnapping for ransom, ritual killing, armed robbery, insurgents attack, banditry and other forms of violent attack.\n\n\u201cFarmers\u2019 lives are threatened on their farms while some have been killed while farming. The result of attacks on farmers is a scarcity of farm products which will lead to famine if care is not taken by those in authority quickly\u201d.\n\nWhile expressing worry over the daily killings of innocent citizens, he called on religious leaders to unite and speak against the deplorable state of the nation.\n\nHe cautioned that breaking up the country may not solve the problem, but the government should be proactive in addressing issues that cause agitations.\n\nThe CAN President also called for more funding of security forces and close monitoring of how the funds are being spent.\n\n\u201cIntelligence gathering which we have been shouting about as panacea to the activities of the criminals and in order to identify where these criminals have never been taken seriously by the government both federal and state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cReligious leaders, this is the time for us to unite and speak in unison against all these evils before being wiped away by the criminals.\n\n\u201cThe daily bloodshed is worrisome and must stop, while we commend our security forces for doing their best, we urge the government to fund them better and monitor the utilization of such funds so that it might be spent on what it is released for.\n\n\u201cBreaking the nation into fragments may not be the answer, however, proactiveness of those in power to prevent the causes of agitation for secession is the right step to keep the nation as one,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Secretary to the government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha said the level of insecurity in Nigeria is so high that religious and traditional rulers must assist the government to tackle it.\n\nMustapha who was represented by the Permanent Security in his office, Morris Mbaeri said \u201cin every ethnic group, there are good people and there are criminal elements. While the leaders in each ethnic group should caution their children, religious leaders should publicly reject the ideology of those who claim to be killing in the name of religion by giving a counter-narrative.\n\nHe charged NIREC to go beyond statutory meetings to assist the government with useful information: \u201cbecause security is the concern of everybody, no matter where you come from and the religion you practice.\u201d",

Where for historical ties, support came to Nigeria from the UK, and to the G5 from France, the terrorists do not recognise these border-aligned distinctions. We must be agile and flexible, cooperating cross our borders to cut the head off their groups.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we have already done much to strengthen our bond. Intelligence sharing is well developed, along with training against improvised explosives. But there is more we can do in cross-border military exercises and coordinating strategy. At the same time, we know France has borne much of the strain for combating terrorism of the region, and we \u2013 the leaders of Sahel countries \u2013 must also do more to present a unified front to lobby other Western nations, particularly Great Britain and the United States and the European Union for further military and humanitarian assistance.\n\n\u201cHowever, we know that military gains do not provide the whole solution. Without security, economic opportunity remains fragile. Without economic opportunity, the propensity for conflict grows. The solution must therefore be two pronged. If we do improve those conditions, it leaves our people vulnerable to indoctrination, as one is vulnerable to COVID-19 without a vaccine.\u201d\n\nHe said across the world, conflicts and coronavirus have gone hand in hand.\n\nHe noted that as governments have struggled to contain COVID, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel, adding that terrorism is no common across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\n\u201cAround the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorism have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon, and Niger.

It needs to be a better election, not perfect but better to consolidate and improve Nigeria\u2019s democracy, and I think the Governor very much agree with me on that.\u201d\n\nThe envoy disclosed she had a very fruitful discussion with Governor Wike, and their discussion revolved around the economy, prospects of his vision including youth employment, challenges he is facing and his plans to tackle them.\n\nSpeaking on the issue of security, the High Commissioner said Britain is helping the Nigeria military to build its combat capacity in tackling insurgency, including Boko Haram in the northern part of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to her, the British military has had its presence in Nigeria for several years and has continued to offer training on how to counter insurgency in the northern part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn the North in particular, we are sharing our experiences in counter insurgency from Northern Ireland, from Iraq and from Afghanistan.

          "text": "\u2022Buhari: Insecurity grows propensity for conflict\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Christopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\nThe acting Inspector-General of Police (IG), Mr. Usman Alkali, yesterday launched a new operation to battle the rising insecurity in the South-east.\n\nHe also charged policemen in the region to be ruthless with secessionists.\n\nThe launch of the new security strategy, codenamed \u201cOperation RP\u201d is coming barely 24 hours after the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Enugu State was attacked and property burnt by yet-to-be-identified hoodlums.\n\nAlso yesterday, President Muhammadu Buhari said without security, economic opportunity would remain fragile and the propensity for conflict would grow, adding that military gains do not provide the whole solution.\n\nAlkali, at the launch of the operation in Enugu, charged policemen serving in the South-east region to deal ruthlessly with criminals and secessionists that may attempt to take the risk of testing their will.\n\nHe urged policemen to be firm with criminals that may be threatening citizens within their area of jurisdiction.\n\nThe IG advised police personnel participating in the special operation to see their deployment as a call to national duty.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe police leadership and the entire nation are looking out for two major outcomes as you discharge your duties during this operation: first, to stabilise the security order in the South-east in the shortest possible time; second, to be professional in your conduct as you strive to attain this objective.\u201d\n\nThe IG advised the policemen to be civil with law-abiding citizens, respect the rights of the citizens and undertake the operation within the dictates of rule of law.\n\nHe, however, charged them to defend themselves against any armed group that might attempt to attack them, or any police assets and other critical national infrastructure.\n\nHe described the people of South-east as historically peaceful, tolerant, innovative, industrious and entrepreneurial, who are highly respected citizens that have made their marks in the field of academics, scientific inventions and commerce.\n\nHe, however, lamented that although the Igbo are a unique ethnic group that freely and peacefully lives with others across the country and within the South-east, the events of late had altered the positive narrative.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe zone in recent years has been witnessing increasing cases of kidnapping, armed robbery and communal violence. This trend has of late been laced with inter-ethnic intolerance and separatist agitation as championed by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\u201cThe separatist agenda of this group has assumed an armed dimension in which important political and community leaders as well as personnel and assets of the Nigeria police, military and other security agencies are being constantly targeted in clearly well-coordinated, premeditated violent attacks in the region.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the launch of \u2018Operation RP\u2019 was conceptualised to ensure that \u201cwe should as a people, be determined to build a consensus, partner in condemning any act of criminality and resolve to work with the police and other security agencies towards identifying, isolating and bringing the criminal elements within our communities to deserved justice.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere must come a time in the life of a nation when we, as a people, must strengthen our will, and resolve to mobilise and deploy all our assets towards confronting these criminal elements, take the battle to their doorsteps, and make a clear statement that the few deviants within us cannot and will not re-order our cherished national values. The time is now.\u201d\n\nEnugu State Governor, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, expressed optimism that the operation would lead to the retooling of security architecture in the South-east.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday\u2019s event could not have come at a better time than now giving the point of insecurity in the country. In the past week, we have been saddened by the spate of killings of security operatives in their line of duty and destruction of security infrastructure and other public institutions in Nigeria, especially in the South-east.\n\n\u201cIt is our expectations that today\u2019s event will herald the rejigging and retooling of international security architecture in the South-east geopolitical zone to bring it up to speed with an emerging dimension of criminality.\u201d\n\nInsecurity Grows Propensity for Conflict\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday warned that without security, economic opportunity will remain fragile and the propensity for conflict will grow.\n\nHe also said that because of the post-COVID-19 pandemic, Nigeria and France must seize the chance to strengthen its economic and military ties.\n\nBuhari stated this in an article entitled: \u2018Post-COVID-19 Pandemic, Nigeria and France Must Seize the Chance to Strengthen Military and Economic Ties,\u2019 published yesterday by a Paris-based magazine, Le Point.\n\nHe said across the world, conflict and coronavirus had not been far apart and the war against the coronavirus was one Nigeria was fully united with France in a strong determination to overcome.\n\nThe solution, according to him, therefore, is to improve those conditions, as it leaves the people vulnerable to indoctrination.\n\nHe said: \u201dAs governments have struggled to contain COVID-19, jihadists have taken advantage in the Sahel \u2013 the vast arid stretch of territory that lies between the Sahara and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cTerrorist incidents have become tragically common across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Around the Lake Chad Basin, Boko Haram terrorists have taken advantage of the pandemic and pushed back into my country Nigeria, whilst still launching raids and attacks in Chad, Cameroon and Niger.\n\n\u201dWe have seen more than once how Boko Haram \u2013 which in French means \u201cl\u2019\u00e9ducation Occidentale est un p\u00e9ch\u00e9\u201d \u2013 can regroup, morphing in form and tactics. A matter of only a few years ago, they were reduced to a territory-less group, where once they had controlled an area in Nigeria three times the size of Lebanon.\u201d\n\nThe president said as the world emerges from COVID-19, there is a chance to rebuild.\n\n\u201cThough we always knew it, COVID-19 underlined how interconnected and interdependent the world is. With that shattering reminder, we can create a world with the idea at its forefront \u2013 one that provides security and opportunity for all,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari stated that the infection is spreading further afield and reaching into the heart of Europe and France is not being spared the malignant, with innocents murdered on its streets.\n\nSaying in that context fate is generally linked, the president highlighted that Paris had been active in the common fight.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe French Operation Barkhane has provided critical boots on the ground in shoring up security across our region. Though challenges remain, it has ensured a wide expanse of territory has not descended into a lawless playground where terrorists masquerading as fighting for Islam groups can freely flourish and multiply. That assistance has been profoundly appreciated in the region.\n\n\u201dNow Nigeria and France should deepen our anti-terror cooperation if we are to overcome this scourge \u2013 particularly in the aftermath of the murder of the late President of Chad. Where for historical ties, support came to Nigeria from the UK, and to the G5 from France, the terrorists do not recognise these border-aligned distinctions. We must be agile and flexible, cooperating across our borders to cut the head off their groups.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says proceeds of marginal fields used to augment FAAC\n\nNdubuisi Francis and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe federal government is weighing some options as discussions with Anglo-Dutch oil company, Shell Petroleum Development Company, begin over its plan for total divestment from onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, yesterday in Abuja listed three possible options being considered as comprising a takeover of the company\u2019s stake in the oil and gas industry by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC); acquisition by indigenous operators and involving a mixture of local players and other foreign independent operators in the process.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch energy giant has been gradually selling its onshore assets for over a decade in Nigeria.\n\nShell, operator of Nigeria\u2019s onshore oil and gas joint venture (JV) SPDC, had recently indicated it would no longer continue to be exposed to the risk of theft and sabotage.\n\nThe company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Ben van Beurden, however, said yesterday that its onshore operations in the Nigerian oil and gas industry were no longer compatible with its long-term climate strategy.\n\nHe also told investors that the additional community issues in the Niger Delta were becoming a huge challenge for the company.\n\nHowever, Sylva who fielded questions from journalists on the issue stated that while the federal government is in consultations with the oil giant on the divestment move.\n\n\u201cSome actually feel that Shell should not hurriedly divest and to at least stay,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWhere Shell has completely divested from a sector is not good for us.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that the executive arm is discussing with the National Assembly on the quick passage of the long-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), saying that the bill will be passed lastest next month.\n\nSylva said: \u201cI want to tell you that PIB is fully on course and we are very happy because we have focused on that for a long time and we had many meetings with the National assembly and stakeholders.\n\n\u201cToday, I believe that we are all basically satisfied with where we are. The National Assembly has given a timeline. They actually gave April but a few things happened. But give or take, I still believe that the passage of the PIB will not go beyond June.\n\n\u201cWe are hopeful that between now and June, they will pass the PIB. I don\u2019t think we are far away with the passage of the PIB.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the nation\u2019s future lies in its vast gas reserves, which have been abandoned for decades, adding that the development of the huge gas potential will fast-track the diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cUnfortunately, what should have helped us are the laws around the oil industry and this has not happened over the last 20 years we have been tinkering with the laws. And yet, this law will power a lot of progress in this industry because the problem we have in the gas sector in Nigeria is that there are no clear fiscal regimes in the legal framework.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, harnessing the country\u2019s gas reserves which currently stands at 203 trillion TCF, will not only create jobs but also open more linkages with other sectors of the economy.\n\nSylva stated that the 203 trillion proven gas reserves were discovered in the course of oil exploration, adding that a conscious exploration could yield as much as 600 trillion tcf.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople have become more aware of the need for us to move towards gas. Last year, one of the first things we were able to achieve was the NLG Train7 final investment decision (FID) that has eluded the country for a long time.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, with the development of Nigeria\u2019s gas reserves, over $16.1billion has so far come into the country as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).\n\nHe added that the Nigeria Gas Commercialisation programme is fully on course, while the autogas policy is being finetuned in collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which is to bring in conversion kits and make soft loans available for marketers to fit their filling stations.\n\nFor the policy to work effectively, he said there must be enough vehicles and filling stations.\n\nOn the recent judgement against Nigeria by a Milan court on the Malabu oil deal, the minister stated that the decision on the next move would depend on legal advice from the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami.\n\nThe minister also said the $1.5 billion required for the proposed rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt Refinery had been secured, adding that putting the refineries in shape was necessary before considering what options are better to run them, including using operations and management (O&M) experts.\n\nOn subsidy removal, Sylva said the federal government did not lack the courage or political will to float petrol price, but was considering stakeholders\u2019 views.\n\nHe stated that proceeds of the recent sale of marginal fields from Signature Bonuses were used to augment the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for April.\n\nOn reports in the social media that he collected $25 million from Saipem to award a contract in LNG Train 7, he said the contracted had already been awarded to Saipem before his appointment.\n\nShell CEO: Nigeria Onshore Oil Incompatible with Company\u2019s Climate Strategy\n\nOil multinational, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, yesterday shed more light on its decision to divest from onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nThe company said its onshore operations in the Nigerian oil and gas industry were no longer compatible with its long-term climate strategy.\n\nThe company stated that it had been under increasing pressure from investors to slash emissions and pivot toward cleaner energy, even as the tension was on show at its shareholder meeting yesterday.\n\nBloomberg reported that while speaking at a shareholders\u2019 meeting, the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, told investors that the additional community issues in the Niger Delta were becoming a huge challenge for the company.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe balance of risks and rewards associated with our onshore portfolio is no longer compatible with our strategic ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe cannot solve community problems in the Niger Delta and the company has started discussions with the government on how to move forward.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say explicitly that Shell wanted to sell the remainder of its oil assets in the Niger Delta, nor did he provide a timetable.\n\nThe company\u2019s long-term energy transition plan laid out to investors for the first time received overwhelming support, but a competing resolution asking for stricter targets also garnered more votes than ever.\n\nAdding to the tension, shareholders were meeting as the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that all new oil and gas developments needed to stop immediately for climate targets to be met.\n\nShell also acknowledged its green strategy is complicated by its spill-prone operations in Nigeria, where it has been pumping out oil for half a century.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch company has been gradually selling onshore assets in Nigeria for more than a decade, as it sought to put aside chronic problems such as pollution caused by ruptured pipelines and the resulting legal battles with local communities.\n\nThe issue has become more acute in the past year after Shell pledged to transform itself into a clean energy giant and gradually winds down its oil and gas business to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nYet a full retreat would be an obvious endpoint to years of gradual divestment, even as Shell has reduced its total number of onshore licences in Nigeria by half over the past decade and has been focusing on offshore oil fields and gas operations in the country.\n\nThe shareholders\u2019 meeting was dominated by investors\u2019 questions on Shell\u2019s climate strategy, ranging from pleas to set more ambitious targets on reducing carbon emissions and phasing out fossil fuels, to a request that the company \u201cstop apologising\u201d for the products it sells.\n\nWhen asked about an IEA\u2019s new report on stopping new oil and gas fields, Chairman, Chad Holliday, said Shell hadn\u2019t had time to study the report but would do so in due course.\n\nShell\u2019s energy transition plans, which forecast a big expansion in clean energy but also decades more oil and gas production, received nearly 89 per cent votes, while a competing proposal from the group rose to 30 per cent, more than double a year earlier.\n\nShare this:

          "text": "El-Rufai vows not to negotiate with NLC\n\nDeclares NLC president wanted\n\nBy John Shiklam\n\nThe Kaduna State Government has announced the dismissal of all nurses below Grade Level 14 for embarking on strike.\n\nA statement issued on Tuesday by the Special Adviser on Media and Communication, Muyiwa Adekeye, said the state Ministry of Health has been directed to advertise vacancies for the immediate recruitment of new nurses to replace those dismissed.\n\nThe statement also disclosed that \u201cnurses disconnected oxygen from a two-day-old baby in an incubator on Monday at the Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital, when they joined the National Labour Congress (NLC) strike\u201d.\n\nIt added that the nurses involved have been recommended to the Ministry of Justice for prosecution.\n\nIt also directed all government ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to submit their attendance registers to the Head of Service, while those in Kaduna State University should submit same to the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) and the Commissioner for Education.\n\nAdekeye said: \u201cSalaries that could have been paid to the dismissed nurses will be given as extraordinary occupational allowances to the health workers who are at their duty posts to fill the gap of those absconding from duty.\u201d\n\nThe statement commended \u201cdoctors and some categories of health workers that are trying to run public health facilities\u201d.\n\nAdekeye expressed \u201cregrets that some nurses have joined the unlawful strike and engaged in sabotage of some of our health facilities\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cNurses were implicated in the forceful discharge of patients in many health facilities.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe government also warned that any academic staff of KASU that does not report for work will be dismissed, adding that government \u2018\u2019will not tolerate the brazen shutdown of electricity, attack on public infrastructure and buildings, locking up hospitals and forcefully discharging patients\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe statement said the action of the NLC was \u201cequivalent to the actions of the bandits kidnapping and menacing our citizens\u201d.\n\n\u201cBandits illegally use arms, but the NLC is deploying mob action for exactly the same ends.\n\n\u201cEfforts to dress up criminal activity as industrial action do not change the reality of lawbreaking that has unfolded, including their persistently ignoring the prohibition against impeding essential services,\u2019\u2019 Adekeye said.\n\nHe reiterated that the President of the NLC, Ayuba Wabba \u201cand his senior confederates in the NLC have been declared wanted and will be vigorously prosecuted for violations of the Penal Code of Kaduna State, the Miscellaneous Offences and the Trade Dispute (Essential Services) Acts\u201d.\n\nThe statement advised Wabba \u201cand his cohorts to report to the Ministry of Justice and the police headquarters to make their statements\u2019\u2019.\n\nAlso speaking with journalists in an interview on Tuesday, Governor Nasir El-Rufai declared that he will not negotiate with striking workers.\n\nThe governor also declared the President of NLC, Wabba, wanted for alleged \u201ceconomic sabotage\u201d.\n\nEl-Rufai accused Wabba of allegedly attacking facilities, declaring that he will be prosecuted for economic sabotage.\n\n\u201cThey attacked facilities, they engaged in economic sabotage. That is an offence under the Miscellaneous Offences Act and we want him, we will bring him to justice.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for him, he should report to the nearest police station or report to us. He will be prosecuted for economic sabotage,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe also stated that there is no ground for any compromise with the NLC, insisting that the labour union has used its last ultimate weapon and he will not change his position.\n\n\u201cThere is no grounds for compromise. They (NLC) have used their last ultimate weapon, it will not change anything. We will not change our position,\u201d El-Rufai said.\n\nReacting, the NLC President, Wabba, said he is waiting for the governor to arrest him. Speaking while while leading a peaceful procession by workers on Tuesday in Kaduna, Wabba said the issue is not about him but about workers, adding that: \u201cWe are here and waiting for him to come and arrest us. This is not about me, it is about Nigerian workers.\u201d\n\nThe state chapter of the NLC had on Monday commenced a five-day warning strike to protest against the sacking of thousands of workers by the state government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We went to council to approve the outline business case for the carrier; then, the council raised some questions and asked us to go and look at the memo again and bring it back.\n\n\u201cSo, once it comes back and the outline business case is approved by council, we will go to the full business case which is now going to the market and establishing the national carrier.\n\n\u201cIt is our intention to have the national carrier running in 2021, which is this year; unfortunately, due to COVID-19, which took the greater part of last year, since March last year, activities have almost been impossible.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said though the pandemic negatively affected civil aviation, in terms of establishment of the national carrier, it made it a much better time to establish the carrier than before.\n\nSirika said for obvious reasons, Nigeria would have fast access to equipment; deliveries of the aircraft would be faster and the rates might be cheaper.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria has a massive market and population to sustain an airline, adding that updates would be provided on the progress of the project after the next presentation to FEC.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe COVID-19 has exposed the nation; lack of having very strong, viable airline is bad for the economy of Nigeria and for any country for that matter; tourism for example is badly affected by lack of airline.\n\n\u201cFinally, to just say that Nigeria is the best candidate to have an airline; 200 million people that travel sometimes almost for nothing, sitting within the West African Region, 400million people; contiguous to Central Africa, 600million.\n\n\u201cTwice the population of the US; equal to the population of entire continental Europe; at the centre of Africa, Nigeria, equal distance from all locations; rising middle class, propensity to fly is high; Nigeria is the best candidate for a very robust carrier.\n\n\u201cIn this 2021, we will try to do all the needful and probably intend to start operations somewhere in the first quarter of 2022.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerians mourn a painful dip day for crypto, but the rallying cry is \u201cHODL!\u201d",
          "text": "Moses Francis has had a heart-breaking Wednesday. Looking at his Binance app, every graph is red. He holds four coins \u2013 Tron, Doge, Litecoin and Ripple. They have been bleeding value all day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been holding for over a year now. I\u2019ve come across a lot of dips. But I haven\u2019t encountered one as bad as this,\u201d he says to TechCabal.\n\nFrancis is not alone. In Nigeria, thousands of users have felt burned on a day of massive slumps in value of virtually every notable cryptocurrency traded across the globe. \u2018Bitcoin\u2019, \u2018Binance\u2019, \u2018Elon Musk\u2019 and \u2018Crypto\u2019 are among top trends on Twitter.\n\nBitcoin is the hardest hit \u2013 the value has crashed as low as $32,000 from a previous high of $65,000 in mid April. But the wave has shaken BNB, Binance\u2019s cryptocurrency, as well as Ethereum, the currency of the NFT world.\n\n\u201cI am feeling down. Anytime I open Binance, I feel as though I want to purge,\u201d says Ogechukwu (he gave just his first name) who has held Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017.\n\nMany reacted to the crash by choosing to see the funny side.\n\nBitnob, a Lagos-based cryptocurrency exchange, had a request for Risevest, a stock and real estate investment startup.\n\nHi @Risevest are you hiring?\n\n\n\nWe dey find work \u2014 Bitnob (@Bitnob_official) May 19, 2021\n\nSomeone imagined the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s governor must be feeling good about his crypto warnings earlier in the year. (\u2018Ponzi\u2019 also became a top trend in Nigeria).\n\nEmefiele looking at all these crypto tears pic.twitter.com/mN3ve6CVGL \u2014 Editi Effi\u00f2ng (@EditiEffiong) May 19, 2021\n\nBut the jokes do not mask the pain of the dip\u2019s strokes. Victor Asemota, a Nigerian businessman and startup investor, lamented in a tweet.\n\n\u201cI take it back. Crypto is now worse than equities. I have lost all my gains this year and the last in a few hours.\u201d\n\nIndeed Bitcoin has now lost all of the gains made since February 8, the day Tesla announced it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for its highly-demanded cars. In the three months since, BTC rose steadily.\n\nThat rising tide drove up the value of other currencies. The biggest beneficiary of the Elon Musk-fueled bull market was Dogecoin, whose value rose an incredible 12,000% between January and the first week of May. $1,000 (\u20a6380,000) worth of Doge in January was worth $121,000 (\u20a646 million) just a few weeks ago.\n\nBut Musk has caused a different kind of turbulence, 49 days after that boom announcement.\n\nAt 11 pm on May 12, Musk tweeted ominously that Tesla will not be accepting Bitcoin for car payments. The reason given was that because Bitcoin takes a lot of energy to mine, it would be unfitting for a company that sells electric cars to directly encourage activities that potentially harm the environment.\n\nAnd just like that, the Cryptoverse has been in a tailspin.\n\nFrancis, a 21-year-old medical student, says more than half the value of his coins have vanished with Wednesday\u2019s dip. He is taking it cheerfully, mustering some laughter on our call. He suspects some foul play has fueled the dip.\n\n\u201cThis dip is because crypto whales have sold off en masse. After this dip, they will re-buy and make gains. I think this thing is planned.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence at the moment of a coordinated sell-off by BTC holders. Observers and long-time holders believe the cryptocurrency market is merely experiencing a correction, a tendency familiar with veteran stock market traders.\n\n\u201cThe case for Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Eloho Omame, co-founder of FirstCheck Africa, a Nigerian startup investment firm, told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cCrypto markets were always volatile. So honestly it\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s not unexpected. Long term, I\u2019m bullish. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens today.\u201d\n\nThat feeling \u2013 that this dip is not abnormal or catastrophic \u2013 has helped keep heads cool even as crypto exchange apps continue to look bloody.

          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nAs our interview drew to a close I asked her what dreams and goals she had. \u201cEssentially, I just want to be happy\u2026\u201d This was how she began her answer.\n\nThe other part of her answer that stuck with me was her plan to sell natural hair wigs to \u201cblack women everywhere.\u201d\n\nWith her business Natural Girl Wigs, she now ships to black women in over 65 countries.\n\nWe talk about growing up in Lagos and falling in love with her hair. Her story takes us from building a community on social media to later growing a successful tech-enabled business with that same community.\n\nHer name is Oluremi Martins-Areola and this is her life in tech.\n\nIt\u2019s all about hair. Black hair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a very interesting view of my hair.\u201d\n\nMany Nigerian millennials remember where they were when Agbani Darego won the Miss World Pageant in 2001. I remember a lot of rejoicing on my street when the announcer said \u201cMiss Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFor Oluremi, the pageant was one thing to be excited about but Darego\u2019s iconic hairdo would be the thing with the lasting influence.\n\n\u201cMy father would indulge me during the weekends and take me to go do the Agbani Darego style,\u201d she said.\n\nBy Monday she had to return to whatever hairstyle her secondary school had assigned. But for those weekends, Oluremi\u2019s hair could do whatever she wanted it to.\n\nShe went on to study history and diplomatic studies at the University of Lagos but for her, deciding on what to study was not something she had bothered about too much.\n\n\u201cIt was actually never about what I was going to study. I always knew that school would be a stepping stone to whatever I wanted to achieve. I felt I was going to go into some type of media or doing a business that had an impact so I felt like it was okay to do anything in school.\u201d\n\nWhile at the university, she became active on social media and started learning about digital marketing through online courses. This would help her land a job as a social media manager for a consulting firm right out of school.\n\nShe changed jobs a few times before finally working at Image Boosters, a digital agency where she would begin to form the idea for her business.\n\n\u201cIt was a personal awakening for me because I had this beautiful natural hair and anytime I wanted to buy wigs or protective styles it was always these European or Indian weaves.\u201d\n\nOluremi\u2019s business started with an Instagram page where she built a community of black women who wanted to care for their hair but also get access to wigs made just for them.\n\n\u201cI thought, why shouldn\u2019t I have wigs that look like my natural hair\u2026\u201d\n\nShe soon began selling wigs sometime in 2018 and eventually left her job after six months of running the Instagram account.\n\nLooking back on her decision to leave paid employment and face her business full time, Oluremi tells me it was tough. She had just gotten a promotion that came with more money and deciding to leave at that time felt scary.\n\nBut by the end of her first year, she had made revenue of up to six figures in dollars \u2013 and she hadn\u2019t even set up her website yet. Her dream of reaching black women around the world was slowly starting to take shape.\n\nBuilding Natural Girl Wigs\n\nBefore the pandemic, Oluremi already ran a remote workforce. Save for the actual making of the wigs, there was no need for her staff to be physically present for anything. She counts this as one of the reasons the pandemic didn\u2019t disrupt her business too much.\n\nNatural Girl Wigs is currently in its third year. After making impressive sales in the first year, it became important for the company to have its own solutions available on a website and not just a social media account.\n\nThe business now caters to black hair in different ways. Of its features, The Hair Quiz stands out. With the quiz, customers are able to answer questions about their hair and are provided with recommendations on hair care and products.\n\nThe website also provides hair tutorials and content tailored to black hair.\n\nOne of the toughest parts of running an e-commerce business anywhere in the world today has to be logistics. To ease the strain of shipping to one of her biggest markets \u2013 the U.S. \u2013 Oluremi had to start manufacturing the wigs in the U.S. as well.\n\n\u201cLogistics is a serious challenge we\u2019ve faced. We currently work with a third party entity that handles delivery for us.\u201d\n\nWith Natural Girl Wigs now delivering to countries all over the world, Oluremi points out how a community was key to growing.\n\n\u201cThe theme for the initial Instagram page was just me posting things around beauty and lifestyle to a great community of people that would be interested in the product I was going to launch.\u201d\n\nThe community has continued to grow and Natural Girl Wigs currently has close to 60,000 email subscribers.\n\nLooking to the future\n\nFor Oluremi, the future for Natural Girl Wigs involves scaling manufacturing. A lot of the materials being used are currently being imported from China and other countries.\n\n\u201cWhen I was doing my research, I realised that most of the manufacturers of hair are Chinese or Asian and a future I would like to explore is one where I have a factory where we make hair from scratch in Africa.\u201d\n\nAway from work, there are a few things Oluremi enjoys: hanging out with her husband, going to restaurants, attending events in Lagos. She hopes to continue to do these things that make her happy.\n\nShe would also like to help people realise the paths to their own goals and dreams.\n\nWhether through her Instagram videos on growing your business or any other medium she may use soon, Oluremi is keen on letting people know that it\u2019s never too late to go for the things they want because as she puts it, \u201cwhenever you wake up is your morning.\u201d",

          "text": "According to Nigeria\u2019s national broadband plan (2020-2025), broadband penetration should hit 90% by 2025. It is an ambitious goal given that for years, broadband penetration has hovered around the 30% region.\n\nBut there has been some recent progress. A tweet from the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami, revealed that in 2020, broadband penetration increased to 43.3%. Analysts like Gbenga Sesan have noted that the figures the ministry claims are wrong and that broadband penetration is less than 10%.\n\nWhatever the correct figure is, Nigeria still has some ways to go due to a mix of challenges, one of which is infrastructure and an inability to standardise fees. For broadband access to increase throughout the country, network operators have to dig up roads and lay optic fibre cables.\n\nThey cannot install such hardware without a Right of Way (RoW) approval from state governments. But RoW fees are high and it is expensive to lay cables; so broadband connectivity suffers.\n\nWhile RoW is a source of revenue for state governments, the big picture is that if any of these states reduce the fees, they may attract telcos to make a significant broadband investment. In 2020, MTN requested approval from the Ekiti state government to lay 160km of fibre optic cables after reducing its RoW fees.\n\nGovernors agree to slash Right of Way fees\n\nStandardising RoW fees is one way to encourage telcos to make investments in broadband infrastructure, so in 2020, Nigeria\u2019s 36 governors agreed to an important step \u2013 a standardised RoW fee of \u20a6145/m.\n\nSo far, only Kaduna, Ekiti, Katsina, Plateau, Ekiti, Kwara, Anambra, and Imo are implementing the new fees one year after the agreement. States like Benue, Ogun and Lagos charge N2,500, N4,000, N750 per Linear Meter.\n\nIt is unclear why these states are not implementing the new fees, but stakeholders continue to mount pressure regardless. There are reports that the Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) is looking at signing a Memorandum of Understanding with states to bring down RoW charges.\n\nThere have also been discussions on the floor of the National Assembly, but it has not translated into lower fees mostly because the governors reserve the right to fix these fees.\n\nRegardless of this power, the governors of the remaining 29 states must play the long game and lower prices because deepening broadband penetration is a big win for Nigeria as a whole.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Google has announced new features and looks coming to the Google ecosystem in its annual Google I/O event. Held virtually on YouTube on Tuesday, September 18, 2021, some of the most exciting announcements were Android 12, changes in Google Workspace, and a new artificial intelligence.\n\nGoogle I/O (aka I/O) is Google\u2019s annual developer conference. In this year\u2019s edition, Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, said the event \u201chas always been a celebration of technology and its ability to improve lives.\u201d\n\nAndroid phones will now have a new privacy feature that lets them see which apps are using their device\u2019s sensors, such as cameras and mics. The privacy dashboard will allow users to revoke access to apps they don\u2019t trust.\n\nIt appears tech giants are making efforts to ensure users feel safe using their devices. On April 23, 2021, Apple announced a new update to iOS 14.5. According to Verge, the biggest feature of the software update is the app tracking feature that notifies users of apps tracking their usage across other apps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsides from that, Google revealed Smart Canvas, a new addition to its Workspace tools, to improve digital working experience. This addition is to help workers collaborate effectively within a digital workspace. With Smart Canvas, teams can create a brainstorm table. It also provides results based on an analysis of each member\u2019s contribution.\n\nGoogle will also incorporate a dedicated Google Meet button into Google Docs, Sheets, and every other Workspace tool. This will enable teams to hear and see each other while collaborating on a project.\n\nWhile Google is helping teams work closely together with its digital workspace features, it is also creating real-time 3D models of people to bring them closer to their loved ones.\n\nDubbed Project Starline, Google claims this new technology project will help friends, families, and co-workers have a semblance of closeness though they\u2019re miles apart. Google will use high-definition cameras and other advanced software and hardware to create a 3D model of a person moving and communicating in real-time.\n\nGoogle\u2019s push for realism is perhaps why it has also announced Language Model for Dialogue Application (LaMDA). Described by Pichai as Google\u2019s latest breakthrough in natural language understanding, Google claims LaMDA will carry on a conversation no matter what it is being discussed.\n\nInterestingly, LaMDA will not be trained on text alone. The language model will be able to understand conversations based on images, audio, and video.\n\nThe LaMDA demo during I/O displays far more intelligence than Google\u2019s AI assistant. Users might now be able to have realistic conversations with their mobile phones.\n\nUnveiling Android 12 with exciting visuals and animations, Google is bringing more personalisation options to the Android experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the beta version of the new OS is out, it is only available to a select number of Android phones.\n\nThis year\u2019s Google I/O comes with a lot of exciting new features and technologies. And while Google\u2019s presentation might be dazzling, only users can determine the effectiveness of these features.\n\nFeatured image credits: Dylan Carr on Unsplash\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

All unregistered SIMs will be blocked- Ursula @ the CEOs summit today @amapomaa_b @MagdaleneApent1 @MBawumia @GIFECGhana @NitaGhana @UrsulaOw @GMIC_Social pic.twitter.com/JAcwhXWA8p Advertisement \u2014 Ministry of Comms (@mocghana) May 18, 2021\n\nThe re-registration doesn\u2019t require going to any telecom outlet as the process can be carried out on mobile devices with a dedicated USSD code, as long as one has the Ghana Card.\n\nGhanaians who are yet to get the Ghana Card can obtain one for free by visiting any National Identification Authority (NIA) office in the country from July.\n\nThis move is part of plans to strengthen Ghana\u2019s digital economy by creating unique IDs, adding them to the country\u2019s database, and in the process, reducing incidences of fraudulent digital activities, which have become commonplace.\n\nGhana Card is issued by the NIA to residential and non-residential Ghanaian citizens and serves as a means of identification in diverse situations like property acquisition, travel pass, etc.\n\nWith a population of over 29 million people, the number of mobile subscriptions in Ghana as of 2019 was 40.93 million, according to Statista.\n\nIn recent times, cybercrime in Ghana has become more prevalent. Ghana\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digitalisation, Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, believes this is a huge step in curtailing these activities and creating a structure for accountability in the country\u2019s digital economy.\n\nGhana\u2019s latest plans can be likened to what\u2019s happening in Nigeria currently, with mobile subscribers having to link their SIM cards to their National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nRecall that this led to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) suspending SIM card sales and registration for four months and intensifying NIN registration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecent statistics show that some progress was made in this period, with over 51 million subscribers registered in four months.\n\nHowever, there were downsides as telcos steadily lost subscribers and revenue. A recent Techpoint Africa article suggested that forcing people to go out to get their NIN might have caused a spike in the country\u2019s COVID-19 cases.\n\nOne can only hope that the process is less tedious in Ghana, with the NIA looking to open more offices across the country before June. So far, over 15.5 million Ghanaians have gotten the Ghana Card.\n\nTelda raises $5m pre-seed | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode! Listen to Built in Africa\n\nComments",

          "title": "Ugie Ododua; Festival Telling A Story Of A Risen Kingdom \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAs a serving Corper with the Nigerian Observer Newspaper, I walk pass the magnificent Oba of Benin\u2019s palace on my way to work from the popular Ring Road Junction. Each time I sight the palace, I would have a reverberant curiosity of how the palace looks like on the inside. I imagined that the palace most hold a lot for my curious mind.\n\nAlas, dreams come through and I was at the Oba\u2019s palace last week for the Ugie Ododua Festival with my other senior colleague reporters. It was exciting to be where I had longed to be. Enquired what the festival is about and an elderly man in the audience replied that it was a ceremony for the purification and sanctification of the land, to ward off evil and appease the gods for bountifulness in the land.\n\nTo say that Benin Kingdom was and is still rich in cultural heritage is almost cliche. The vividity of the cultural cosmology of the Benin people is not only in the history books that we read but also the oral traditions and customs of the people give credence to their cultural aesthetics. A trip to Benin city will leave you with out a doubt of its cultural renaissance.\n\nA few meter away from the Oba\u2019s palace is the Benin National Museum which houses some of the finest arts and crafts of the Benin people. It serves as a tourist attraction to visitors seeking to know more about the ancient great Benin Empire.\n\nThe Ugie Ododua festival usually takes a period of fourteen days. The first seven days are observed as indoor activities while the later seven days are observed as public performances, the one we attended being the grand finale with dignitaries far and near in attendance. While the palace was crowdy, the atmosphere was solemn. As a cultural enthusiast nothing could be more gratifying than to witness the epic festival.\n\nDuring the festival, seven Ododua masquerades dressed in red regalia come out in a single file from Ugha-Erhoba accompanied by members of the Iwebo Palace Society, chiefs Osague, Osa and Osuan of Benin Kingdom. Each of these seven masquerades represent a deity in the kingdom.\n\nWith unique drum beats, dance steps and incantations, each masquerade marched to the throne of the Oba ( King) to offer supplication and pay homage. The Benin people see the Oba as both political and spiritual head of the kingdom.\n\nThere were also the Ononges ( the dukes of the kingdom) and the members of the royal family who were all dressed in white paraphernalia. They all made obeisance to His Royal Majesty. I indeed feasted my eyes on the legendary display of culture.\n\nSpeaking of the historical background of Ugie Ododua festival, the Benin people trace the origin to Oba Eweka1 who used the festival to commomerate the successful return of Oramiyan the son of Ododua to his ancestral home, the Benin kingdom which also marked the return of of Obaship era after a period of interregnum.\n\n\u201cToday, the festival is celebrated at the instance of OmoN\u2019ObaN\u2019Edo, Aku Akpolokpolo to offer prayers to Ancestors for blessings and protection of Oba, members of the Royal family, chiefs and the entire people of the kingdom and beyond.\u201d Remarked a titled chief.\n\nBut the sanctity of Benin Kingdom had suffered a setback in 1897 when the British colonial forces razed Benin City, massacring an unknown number of people and bringing a violent recess to the advancing civilization to the Kingdom of Benin, which had thrived for centuries as one of West Africa\u2019s major powers. The invasion was to avenge the killing of an earlier force by the soldiers of the Oba.\n\nThere are records that during the raid, British troops looted at least 3,000 precious artifacts made by the Edo people, including ivory statues, carved elephant tusks, ceramics, masks, carved portraits of Obas (or kings) and their mothers, and more than 1,000 intricately decorated brass plaques that once adorned ancestral altars and court buildings in the city\u2019s royal palace.\n\nIn the wake of last year\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests that re-echoed around the globe of injustices against the black people around the world, there is an invigorating call for the restitution of looted treasures from the African continent by the Western countries during the dark years of incursion and colonialism. Many museums and organizations across the Europe where these looted artifacts especially the Benin Bronzes are kept have heeded the call.\n\nAs reported by BBC in April, the German Culture Minister, Monika Gruetters has disclosed that \u201cthe first return of the looted treasures were expected to take place in 2022\u201d.\n\nThe tragic retaliatory invasion of Benin Kingdom by the British government seemed to be the end of the once ebullient kingdom but we know that the history of mankind is replete with rise and fall or fall and rise as the case maybe. Benin rose again and about a century and half later, the sanctity of the people\u2019s culture is still upheld with a stylish dignity.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving corps member with the Nigerian Observer.\n\nEmail: benomanga01@gmail.com\n\n...",

Let me start by congratulating Nigerian Exchange Group Plc on its recently concluded demutualisation, which is the first in the country. I recall signing the Demutualisation Bill in August 2018, paving the way for the long awaited demutualisation of the then Nigerian Stock Exchange.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also important for me to highlight that the history of NGX Group is tied to that of the Nation itself founded 61 years ago at a pivotal time when Nigeria gained her independence. The Exchange continues to play its part in nation building by stimulating economic growth and providing a platform for businesses and individual to save and raise capital through innovation, diversified products and services, enabling regulatory environment and much more. The occasion of the demutualisation of The Nigerian Stock Exchange is yet a proud moment for all of us, and indeed all Nigerians deserve congratulations for this feat as it is the beginning of a new era for the capital market,\u201d President Buhari added.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Group Chairman, NGX Group Plc, Otunba Abimbola Ogunbanjo stated, \u201cThe Exchange has come a long way, through different leadership regimes \u2013 civilian and military \u2013 that have overseen multiple boom and bust economic dispensations within the Nigerian economy, to emerge as a leading integrated market infrastructure in Africa and the engine of growth for Africa\u2019s largest economy. Our story is one birthed from resilience, collaboration, determination and continued focus on our vision. A true Africa story. With demutualisation, NGX Group is well positioned to enable strong economic growth and contribute its quota to the development of the Nigerian capital market, and the African Continent.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, NGX Group Plc, Mr. Oscar N. Onyema, OON noted that, \u201cAt Nigerian Exchange Group Plc, we have a vision to be the premier Exchange hub for Nigerian businesses and for the wider African economy building on the strong reputation and corporate governance the NSE has established over the years. As we march bravely into the NGX era, we look forward to impact creating partnerships that will unlock value for our stakeholders, whilst improving the state of the Nigerian economy. It is a period to reinforce on the global stage, our great African pedigree and the Stock Africa Is Made of.\u201d\n\nThe unveiling event culminated in a Closing Gong Ceremony where the CEO, Nigerian Exchange Limited, Mr. Temi Popoola, CFA, stated, \u201cI am delighted to have hosted His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, our special guest of honour. Today\u2019s epochal Closing Gong Ceremony could not have been possible without Mr President\u2019s support. The NGX era is indeed very exciting for us and we will continue to champion the growth of the African capital market through trade and investments that will facilitate Africa\u2019s economic recovery and reposition the continent for sustainable economic development. Partnerships are a critical element of our strategy and we will continue to engage our stakeholders whose support is essential to the achievement of our aspirations in this NGX era.\u201d\n\nIn her closing remarks, the CEO, NGX Regulation Limited, Ms. Tinuade Awe stated, \u201cMy deepest gratitude goes to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency, Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, for gracing us with his presence and honouring our invitation to close the market on the official launch day of the NGX era. This has truly been an inspiring event and we have our amazing line-up of speakers to thank for that.

tax waivers, sustainable power supply, improve security of men, materials and equipment, eliminate multiple regulations and charges, recognize telecommunications infrastructure as public utility infrastructure; and engender public trust and confidence.\u201d\n\nThe Senate further called on Federal Government to ensure that global standards for the deployment of 5G technology are strictly adhered to, while looking out for lessons learnt by countries that have already deployed in order to guide our own deployment.\n\n\u201cLessons from South Korea, the first country with substantial deployment would be instructive in this regard.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that intense safety standards and precaution, based on available evidence, are put in place for wireless radiation system ahead of wide scale implementation,\u201d the upper chamber advised.\n\nIt added that given the infancy of the technology across the globe and claims and counter claims surrounding the probability of health injury posed to public health by the level of exposure to radio frequency, further attention should be given to testing and researching potential health risk that may arise from the deployment of 5G network Nigeria, considering real life situation rather than just laboratory conditions.\n\nThe Senate urged the Federal Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy to expedite the action of the Joint Committee put in place to develop Consultation Document (CD) for the deployment of 5G in Nigeria which include planning spectrum identified for the technology with the inputs of all relevant stakeholders such as the relevant Committees of the National Assembly and the security agencies.\n\nIt also further tasked the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy to publish the outcome of the work of its Technical Advisory Committee charged to advise on emerging technologies and products and, as a matter of urgency, build the National Backbone which will run from Lagos to Katsina (Trans-Saharan Optic fibre network) to move much of the bandwidth from the shore to the hinterland and for distribution to the geopolitical zones.\n\nThe Senate insisted that despite the almost general consensus concerning the harmlessness of 5G to human health, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), in collaboration with the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), Federal Ministry of Health, Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, Federal Ministry of Environment, and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) among others, should locally conduct a scientifIc experimental study over a period of about 6 months to ascertain if a correlation exists between 5G networks and public health.\n\nConcerning the interaction between COVID-19 and 5G network technologies, the Senate observed that there is no connection between them, maintaining that, \u201cthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a biological agent a virus which is scientifIcally unconnected with the 5G technology.\u201d",

          "title": "Navy Marks 64th Anniversary, Impounds N3bn Crude In 2021",
          "text": "The Nigerian Navy said it has intercepted about 128,612 barrels of crude oil valued at about N2,598,219,624 and 15,317,150 litres of AGO valued at over N3million between January and May this year.\n\nAlso seized from the oil thieves within the time under review was 5,150 litres of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) valued at about N1million and 3,193,251 litres of Dual Purpose Kerosene (DPK) valued at about N606,717,690 within the time under review.\n\nThe Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, disclosed this on Wednesday at a press briefing to mark the 64th anniversary of the Nigerian Navy at the Naval Headquarters in Abuja.\n\nRepresented by the Chief of Policy and Plans, Rear Admiral Christian Ezekobe, the CNS attributed the success of the fight against economic saboteurs to the increased effort of the NN Operation Bases especially through Operation RIVER SWEEP.\n\nSpeaking on the loss of 200,000 barrels of crude by the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), he said such could not be attributed to pipeline vandalism, adding that perhaps some insiders may have facilitated such crime.\n\n\u201cAnytime we dismantle illegal refineries,we call them to come and evacuate but they (NNPC) don\u2019t come . However,they have assured us that going forward it will change,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, another key factor that contributed to the clampdown was the NHQ sensitisation and directives to all Bases on zero tolerance to Crude Oil Theft (COT) and illegal bunkering activities.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am delighted to inform you that the current administration of NN is focused on capacity building in order to improve maritime security in Nigerian waters and the Gulf of Guinea (GoG). The maritime threats that have significant effects in Nigeria\u2019s maritime environment are piracy and sea robbery, Crude Oil Theft (COT), illegal oil bunkering, smuggling, Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IUUF), insurgency, hostage taking as well as human and drug trafficking.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn order to combat these threats, the NN adopted the Total Spectrum Maritime Strategy (TSMS) to guide its operational engagements. The strategy is based on a proactive layered response within 5 conflict spectrums characterised by distances to and from the coast.\n\n\u201cWithin the last four months, the NN conducted and also participated in 13 Exercises (Ex) and operations (ops) geared towards combating illicit activities in Nigeria\u2019s territorial waters especially the back waters.\n\n\u201cPertinently, these Ex and ops which are considered as game changers include Ex TSARE TEKU, Ex SECURED WATERS, Ex AMJI JIJI, Op RIVER SWEEP, Op CALM WATERS and Op TRI-PARTITE JOINT BORDER PATROL amongst others. Some combined Exercises such as Ex OBANGAME EXPRESS were also conducted in collaboration with regional and international navies and other maritime stakeholders for the good governance of the nation\u2019s maritime space including the Gulf of Guinea.\u201d\n\nOn anti-piracy operations, Gambo revealed that, \u201cit is important to state that the NN has deliberately instituted dedicated operations and initiatives to enhance its policing capability towards the peaceful use of the nation\u2019s maritime environment. These initiatives have engendered several recorded successes in the operations of NN bases.\n\n\u201cFor instance, 13 incidents of piracy attacks were recorded from July \u2013 December 2020. However, as from January \u2013 May 2021, there were only 5 pirate attacks. The rate of pirate attacks have been on the decline from what was witnessed in the last half of the Year 2020. Let me therefore say with all sense of modesty that this is attributed to our increased number of hours and sustained presence at sea.\u201d\n\nHe continued that, \u201cthe Service has also performed credibly well in the fight against COT and illegal oil bunkering considering the short period that this administration has been in the office. The NN has through ops conducted by ops bases and Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) cumulatively deactivated a total of 95 illegal refineries between January and May 2021.\n\n\u201cThese activities were complemented with series of swamp buggy ops in the areas were illegal refineries were discovered. To appreciate this effort, may I state that from records, 477 illegal refining sites were deactivated between July and December 2020. This figure drastically decreased in the last 4 months (January \u2013 May) to 95. The reduction in the number of illegal refining sites deactivated can be attributed to the ongoing swamp buggy operations in the Niger Delta which makes it difficult for perpetrators to reactivate immobilized illegal refining sites.\n\n\u201cThe NN also recorded successes in anti-COT ops which has reduced illegal oil dealings within the Nigerian maritime environment within the period under review. For instance, the NN denied criminal oil entrepreneurs about 128, 612 barrels of crude oil valued at about N2,598,219,624 and 15,317,150 litres of AGO valued at over N3 Million.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, approximately 5,150 litres of PMS valued at about N1 Million and 3,193,251 litres of DPK valued at about N606,717,690 were impounded from criminals between January and 17 May 2021. The success of denying Nigeria\u2019s economic saboteurs thousands of barrels and litres of crude oil and AGO and saving the nation billions of Naira could be attributed to the increased effort of the NN Ops Bases especially through Op RIVER SWEEP. Another key contributing factor to the success is the NHQ sensitization and directives to all Bases on zero tolerance to COT and illegal bunkering activities.\n\n\u201cThe anti-smuggling ops are another critical area that the NN recorded success during the last four months. The NN through 2 key anti \u2013 smuggling ops, namely: Ops TRI-PARTITE JOINT BORDER PATROL and CALM WATERS has ensured round the clock presence and effective patrol of all identified hot spots of smugglers. From records, 91 NN ships clocked a total of 7,552 hours at sea during the period under review, leading to a significant decline of smuggling activities in our waters.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding, two suspected rice smugglers, two smuggling boats and seve vehicles cumulatively laden with 1,842 bags of rice were arrested within the period under review. In a related development, the Nigerian Navy Ship LUGARD in Lokoja recently arrested 2 suspects with 16 bags of Cannabis Sativa weighing a total of 550kg.\n\n\u201cThe suspected smugglers and their boats with products were handed over to the respective prosecuting agencies; referring to EFCC, NCS, NIS and NDLEA for further action. Details of the persons and number of bags of rice seized are as shown on the screen. These achievements also reinforce NN drive towards eradicating rice smuggling in support of the FG policy on local rice production.\u201d\n\nThe CNS also noted that there was increased maritime domain awareness within the last four months, adding that, \u201cthe NN carries out round the clock surveillance of Nigeria\u2019s maritime space using the Regional and Maritime Awareness Capability (RMAC) and Falcon Eye facilities in addition to the use of vessels and helicopters.\n\n\u201cThe NN has 24 Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) Centres located across the Nigerian coastline. Due to their availability, NN patrols are now more mission oriented with attendant reduction in operational logistic costs. The infrastructure has been instrumental in several known rescue as well as classified operations,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also gave highlight on fleet renewal, \u201cto enhance NN\u2019s response capability, the present leadership of the NN under V Adm Awwal Gambo is fully committed to acquiring more requisite mix of platforms for the Service. In this light, the NN took delivery of the Hydrographic Survey Vessel on Mon 17 May 21 in Lagos.\n\n\u201cThe vessel sailed from Saint Nazaire, France for Lagos on 18 Apr 21 and is named after the decommissioned NNS LANA. The renewed emphasis on fleet renewal by this administration is further underscored by ongoing efforts for procurement of another 35 metres survey vessel and 3 Leonardo Helicopters.\n\n\u201cIn an effort to boost operations, the Service recently took delivery of 4 C- Falcons interceptor boats for Nigerian Navy Special Boat Service. In addition, 90 Rigid Hall Inflatable Boats have been procured. The NN has continued to engage local companies such as Messrs Epenal, Tuwasco and SEWA to build platforms for the Service.\n\n\u201cThis has not only enhanced local content development but facilitated capacity building in Nigeria\u2019s maritime industry. Importantly, all this would not have been possible without the continuous support of the FG under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR.\u201d\n\nOn human resource management, he observed that, \u201cthe NN is a technical Service that requires well trained and motivated personnel to man and operate its high value assets. To this end, the NN has maintained its standard of producing professionally competent personnel, who are regularly given qualitative training both within and outside Nigeria in line with international best practices.\n\n\u201cNotably, NN professional schools are being affiliated with relevant tertiary institutions and professional bodies in the country. More so, most of the courses offered at the NN professional schools and colleges are given requisite accreditation in order to improve performance of the under training officers and ratings as well as make the certificates obtained relevant outside the Service.\n\n\u201cI am glad to assert that, these have greatly assisted in building further capacity and human resource management and thereby enhancing maintenance and operations of the fleet.\n\n\u201cOn manpower generation, the NN has recently commissioned 45 officers and enlisted 1,170 ratings. These newly commissioned and enlisted personnel have already joined the fleet. Presently, the training for another sets of officers is ongoing at both the Nigerian Defence Academy Kaduna and Nigerian Navy College Onne while the recruitment exercise for the next set of ratings is at its final phase.\n\n\u201cWith respect to welfare, I would like to reiterate that the development and welfare of NN personnel are core aspects of NN administration. It is in this spirit that the CNS during his maiden address stressed that the issues of personnel welfare shall be taken seriously by his administration.\u201d",

          "text": "Acting Inspector-General of Police Usman Alkali issued a directive to police officers yesterday ordering them to deal ruthlessly with criminal elements and secessionists who try to put their will to the test.\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of widespread security breakdowns across the region.\n\nPolice officers are being killed in attacks on their stations in the Southeast and Southsouth, which are often burned.\n\nGunmen are indiscriminately killing police officers at checkpoints.\n\nInmates were released after an assault on the Owerri correctional center.\n\nThe separatist group Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) has increased its violent activities.\n\nSeparatists\u2019 voices have become stronger in the Southwest, with Prof. Banji Akintoye and Sunday Igboho at the forefront.\n\nThe acting Inspector General of Police (IG) initiated Operation Restore Peace (Operation RP) at Michael Okpara Square in Enugu, the state capital, yesterday.\n\nAlkali said: \u201cYou are charged to be civil with the law-abiding citizens, but firm and ruthless with criminal elements and secessionists that may attempt to take the risk of testing your will or threatening the citizens within your area of jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance to the goals of this special operation, I charge you to henceforth, defend yourselves courageously against any armed group that attempts to attack you, any police assets, and other critical national infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThe IG advised the police officers and men on the special operation to see their deployment as a call to national duty.\n\nOn expectations, he said: \u201cFirst, to stabilise the security order in the Southeast in the shortest possible time. Second, to be professional in your conduct as you strive to attain this objective.\u201d\n\nAlkali said: \u201cThe zone in recent years has been witnessing increasing cases of kidnapping, armed robbery and communal violence.\n\n\u201cThis trend has of late been laced with inter-ethnic intolerance and separatist agitation as championed by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\n\u201cThe separatist agenda of this group has assumed an armed dimension in which important political and community leaders, as well as personnel and assets of the Nigeria Police, military and other security agencies, are being constantly targeted in clearly well-coordinated, premeditated violent attacks in the region.\n\n\u201cAside from this, the deepening inter-ethnic prejudice and intolerance in the region are also occasioning unjustifiable inter-ethnic violence and counter-violence.\n\n\u201cApart from the massive loss of property and fatalities to lives, the violent campaigns are beginning to have a damaging effect on the socio-economic development of the region.\n\n\u201cThis trend is being compounded by the illegal proliferation of firearms as well as the deployment of the social media by the leadership of IPOB to indoctrinate, misinform, and misdirect Southeasterners towards the path of violent separatism.\n\n\u201cThis evolving trend constitutes a major threat to our nation\u2019s internal security and national unity and, hence, requires urgent sets of all-inclusive actions to roll back the disastrous tide.\n\n\u201cWe should as a people, be determined to build a consensus, partner in condemning any act of criminality and resolve to work with the police and other security agencies towards identifying, isolating and bringing the criminal elements within our communities to deserved justice.\n\n\u201cThere must come a time in the life of a nation when we, as a people, must strengthen our will, and resolve to mobilise and deploy all our assets towards confronting these criminal elements, take the battle to their doorsteps, and make a clear statement that the few deviants within us cannot and will not re-order our cherished national values. The time is now.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s launch of \u2018Operation RP\u2019 by the Nigeria Police is aimed at this direction and it follows the directives of Mr President to the Nigeria Police to re-evaluate and emplace new operational strategies to stem the tide of violence and secessionist agenda not only in the Southeast but across the country.\n\n\u201cAs the lead agency in the internal security framework of this country, the Nigeria Police under the current dispensation acknowledges that the duty of securing the lives and property of the citizens is its primary mandate.\n\n\u201cThe launch of \u2018Operation RP\u2019 in Enugu today is the first in the line of our strategic Action Plan to restore peace across the country and in the coming days, the special operation will be extended to other parts of the country to address peculiar crimes including banditry, kidnapping and armed robbery in other geopolitical Zones.\n\n\u201cIt is to be emphasised that \u2018Operation RP\u2019 will cover all the states within the Southeast geopolitical zone. I am confident that with the support of all strategic stakeholders, the operation will in due course, change the current security narratives in the Zone for good.\u201d\n\nThe operation will be carried out by the Force\u2019s operatives in coordination with the Armed Forces, the intelligence community, and other sister security agencies, according to the police chief.\n\nHe enlisted the help of civil society, especially traditional rulers, religious leaders, youth organizations, business organizations, cultural organizations, and professionals.\n\nWith the support of all strategic stakeholders, the IG predicts that the operation will eventually change the region\u2019s existing security narratives.\n\nIfeanyi Ugwuanyi, the governor of Enugu State, thanked Alkali for the service.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, he said, \u201cgiven the country\u2019s burgeoning insecurity.\u201d\n\nHe enlisted the help of civil society, especially traditional rulers, religious leaders, youth organizations, business organizations, cultural organizations, and professionals.\n\nWith the support of all strategic stakeholders, the IG predicts that the operation will eventually change the region\u2019s existing security narratives.\n\nIfeanyi Ugwuanyi, the governor of Enugu State, thanked Alkali for the service.\n\nIt couldn\u2019t have come at a better time, he said, \u201cgiven the country\u2019s burgeoning insecurity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have institutionalised functional collaboration between our neighbourhood watch groups, forest guards and security agencies, especially in the area of intelligence sharing.\n\n\u201cEnugu State Security Trust Fund Law is in place to ensure sustainable funding for security agencies in our state. The deployment of our Automated Drone Surveillance Solution to give the needed impetus to our security surveillance is underway.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have not rested on our oars in providing a safe and secure environment for residents to live, work and enjoy life,\u201d the governor said.\n\nGovernors of the states of Ebonyi, Imo, and Abia were served by their deputies.\n\nThe Elders Consultative Forum of Abia State (AECF) has cautioned against militarizing the region.\n\nThe AECF said doing so would be counter-productive in a statement issued by its National President, Archbishop Princewill Ariwodo, and its National Secretary, Rev. Joseph Adiele, at the end of their meeting in Umuahia, Abia State\u2019s capital, yesterday.\n\nIt denounced the military\u2019s arrest of Eze Awurum, who was allegedly labeled as an IPOB supporter, and cautioned against extrajudicial killings of Igbo youths.",

Critical parts of the state\u2019s economy have been paralyzed as a result of the protest.\n\nIn response, the Kaduna State government declared Wabba and other NLC leaders wanted under the Miscellaneous Offenses Act for economic sabotage and attacks on public facilities in Kaduna State.\n\nIn response to El-Rufai\u2019s statement, Falana called the argument that the labour leaders had broken the Miscellaneous Offences Act \u201claughable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe statement is laughable as it is common knowledge that Comrade Wabba and his colleagues are on the streets of Kaduna leading the peaceful protests embarked upon by the entire workers in the State since yesterday. The order of the Governor cannot be enforced for the following reasons:\n\n\u201c1. By the combined effect of the Trade Union Act and the Nigerian Constitution, Comrade Wabba and other labour leaders have the unquestionable rights to participate in the peaceful warning strike and mass protests against further retrenchment of workers in the Kaduna State public service.\n\n\u201c2. The Miscellaneous Offences Act is not a state statute but a federal enactment. To that extent, if Governor El Rufai has evidence that Comrade Wabba and other labour leaders have contravened any provisions of the Act he is required to lodge a complaint in any of the police stations in Kaduna State. The Governor lacks the power to declare any alleged offender wanted under the Act or any other law whatsoever.\n\n\u201c3. Furthermore, since Comrade Wabba and other labour leaders are entitled to the fundamental right of fair hearing including the presumption of innocence guaranteed by section 36 of the Constitution the Governor of Kaduna lacks the power to declare them wanted.\u201d",

          "text": "By JUMOKE SANNI\n\n\u2026Appeals For Understanding Over Okada Ban\n\nLagos State First Lady, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday urged residents especially market men and women to be more security conscious and promptly report any suspicious movement around them to relevant security agencies.\n\nShe also appealed for understanding and cooperation of the people on the decision of the state government to restrict operation of commercial motorcycles, popularly known as Okada in certain areas, saying it was important for the provisions of relevant laws to be enforced to sanitize the environment.\n\nThe Governor\u2019s wife said this at a one-day Seminar on Sanitation and Security for market leaders organized by the Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials (COWLSO) in collaboration with the Ministry of Local Government and Community Affairs, held at the Secretariat of Ikorodu West Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Owutu.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who is also the COWLSO Chairman, said the recent security situation in the country had made it imperative for everyone to be security conscious and alert relevant authorities in the event of strange developments and movement across the state.\n\n\u201cOn security, we should all know that security is everybody\u2019s business. Everyone is a security officer and that includes you and me. Let us be security conscious and when we see something, we must say something. We are in the era of #Sorosoke (speaking up) and we all have to alert the relevant authorities when we notice something strange in our respective areas.\n\n\u201cYes, there has been an announcement on the ban of Okada (Commercial motorcycles). However, let me reiterate that all Okada people are not bad people. We need to correct that impression but if we notice something, we have to act.\n\n\u201cSecurity of lives and property is very important. May God guide and lead Mr Governor in the right direction. Lagos is a friendly place; we are accommodating and we love to have people among us. But there is this saying that where there is no law, there is no crime. Just as there are laws in the marketplace, there are laws in the land and those laws need to be complied with at any point in time,\u201d the First Lady said.\n\nShe disclosed that the seminar, which is the second in the series, was put together as part of efforts to play up issues around sanitation, security and safety in markets across the state, adding that it was important that hygiene and cleanliness in the marketplace, as well as security must be taken seriously, going forward.\n\n\u201cSanitation is very important. Safety in the market too is important. We have to switch off all electrical appliances at the close of business of the day; we have to ensure that our markets are properly administered and that\u2019s why we have come up with this initiative.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I want to urge our market men and women to ensure cleanliness of your respective markets and also be security and safety conscious,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso speaking, Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Dr. Wale Ahmed said the seminar was timely coming after the recent inauguration of Lagos State Market Advisory Council (LASMAC) by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to ensure proper administration of markets, as well as the security developments in the country.\n\nAlso, Iyaloja General, Chief (Mrs) Folashade Tinubu-Ojo commended COWLSO for the initiative of the seminar, saying the First Lady deserved to be appreciated for her interest in the welfare and wellbeing of market men and women in the state.\n\nIn his presentation, Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu said as part of efforts to ensure security, market leaders should henceforth prevent people from sleeping in the market, while all loaders and shop assistants must be properly profiled.\n\nThe CP, who was represented by an Assistant Commissioner of Police, Mr Oludotun Odubona said opening and closing time in markets must be maintained, as well as CCTV cameras installed at strategic locations in addition to proper illumination and local security personnel, among others.\n\nIn a related development, the First Lady also commissioned the ultra-modern Adeboruwa Market in Igbogbo/Baiyeku LCDA, comprising of 200 Shops and 160 K-Clamp Shops, with other facilities such as Standard Car Park, Modern Toilets, among others.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "By JUMOKE SANNI\n\n\u2026Appeals For Understanding Over Okada Ban\n\nLagos State First Lady, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday urged residents especially market men and women to be more security conscious and promptly report any suspicious movement around them to relevant security agencies.\n\nShe also appealed for understanding and cooperation of the people on the decision of the state government to restrict operation of commercial motorcycles, popularly known as Okada in certain areas, saying it was important for the provisions of relevant laws to be enforced to sanitize the environment.\n\nThe Governor\u2019s wife said this at a one-day Seminar on Sanitation and Security for market leaders organized by the Committee of Wives of Lagos State Officials (COWLSO) in collaboration with the Ministry of Local Government and Community Affairs, held at the Secretariat of Ikorodu West Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Owutu.\n\nSanwo-Olu, who is also the COWLSO Chairman, said the recent security situation in the country had made it imperative for everyone to be security conscious and alert relevant authorities in the event of strange developments and movement across the state.\n\n\u201cOn security, we should all know that security is everybody\u2019s business. Everyone is a security officer and that includes you and me. Let us be security conscious and when we see something, we must say something. We are in the era of #Sorosoke (speaking up) and we all have to alert the relevant authorities when we notice something strange in our respective areas.\n\n\u201cYes, there has been an announcement on the ban of Okada (Commercial motorcycles). However, let me reiterate that all Okada people are not bad people. We need to correct that impression but if we notice something, we have to act.\n\n\u201cSecurity of lives and property is very important. May God guide and lead Mr Governor in the right direction. Lagos is a friendly place; we are accommodating and we love to have people among us. But there is this saying that where there is no law, there is no crime. Just as there are laws in the marketplace, there are laws in the land and those laws need to be complied with at any point in time,\u201d the First Lady said.\n\nShe disclosed that the seminar, which is the second in the series, was put together as part of efforts to play up issues around sanitation, security and safety in markets across the state, adding that it was important that hygiene and cleanliness in the marketplace, as well as security must be taken seriously, going forward.\n\n\u201cSanitation is very important. Safety in the market too is important. We have to switch off all electrical appliances at the close of business of the day; we have to ensure that our markets are properly administered and that\u2019s why we have come up with this initiative.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I want to urge our market men and women to ensure cleanliness of your respective markets and also be security and safety conscious,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso speaking, Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Dr. Wale Ahmed said the seminar was timely coming after the recent inauguration of Lagos State Market Advisory Council (LASMAC) by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to ensure proper administration of markets, as well as the security developments in the country.\n\nAlso, Iyaloja General, Chief (Mrs) Folashade Tinubu-Ojo commended COWLSO for the initiative of the seminar, saying the First Lady deserved to be appreciated for her interest in the welfare and wellbeing of market men and women in the state.\n\nIn his presentation, Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu said as part of efforts to ensure security, market leaders should henceforth prevent people from sleeping in the market, while all loaders and shop assistants must be properly profiled.\n\nThe CP, who was represented by an Assistant Commissioner of Police, Mr Oludotun Odubona said opening and closing time in markets must be maintained, as well as CCTV cameras installed at strategic locations in addition to proper illumination and local security personnel, among others.\n\nIn a related development, the First Lady also commissioned the ultra-modern Adeboruwa Market in Igbogbo/Baiyeku LCDA, comprising of 200 Shops and 160 K-Clamp Shops, with other facilities such as Standard Car Park, Modern Toilets, among others.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The Senate has approved the deployment of the 5G network in Nigeria, following the outcome of investigations by a Joint Committee mandated to carry out same.\n\nThe approval followed the consideration of the report of the Joint Committee on Communications, Science and Technology, ICT and Cyber Crimes, and Primary Health Care and Communicable Diseases.\n\nThe report was laid and presented by the Chairman, Senator Oluremi Tinubu (APC, Lagos Central), during plenary on Wednesday.\n\nThe upper chamber during consideration of the report, adopted the Joint Committee\u2019s recommendations which were outcomes of investigation into the Status of 5G Network in Nigeria and its technological impact on Nigerian citizens.\n\nThe upper chamber amid the adopted recommendations posited that the technological impact of 5G will revolutionize Nigerians\u2019 way of life from education to agriculture, security to entertainment, and governance in general if the technology is deployed.\n\nIt explained that its decision to recommend the deployment of the 5G technology was based on information provided by Government establishments such as the Federal ministry of communications and Digital Economy, the Nigerian Communications Commission, the Office of the National Security Adviser, the National Information Technology Development Agency etc, and other telecoms professional organisations such as the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) and the Global System of Mobile Communications Association.\n\nIt, however, added that though no license has been issued to any Mobile Number Operator on commercial basis, Nigeria should still observe the trend of 5G deployments around the globe and engage in extensive sensitization of the public through all channels before commencement of commercial deployments in the country.\n\nAccordingly, the Upper Chamber urged relevant Government Agencies to embark on preparing the ground by putting the necessary infrastructure and technology in place for its eventual deployment.\n\nIt emphasized that, \u201cthis period of ground preparation is expected to be utilized to complete feasibility studies for the various broadband projects in order to ascertain actual cost implications for their implementation, complete sustainability plans, provide enabling environment including free Right of Way (ROW); tax waivers, sustainable power supply, improve security of men, materials and equipment, eliminate multiple regulations and charges, recognize telecommunications infrastructure as public utility infrastructure; and engender public trust and confidence.\u201d\n\nThe Senate further called on Federal Government to ensure that global standards for the deployment of 5G technology are strictly adhered to, while looking out for lessons learnt by countries that have already deployed in order to guide our own deployment.\n\n\u201cLessons from South Korea, the first country with substantial deployment would be instructive in this regard.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that intense safety standards and precaution, based on available evidence, are put in place for wireless radiation system ahead of wide scale implementation,\u201d the upper chamber advised.\n\nIt added that given the infancy of the technology across the globe and claims and counter claims surrounding the probability of health injury posed to public health by the level of exposure to radio frequency, further attention should be given to testing and researching potential health risk that may arise from the deployment of 5G network Nigeria, considering real life situation rather than just laboratory conditions.\n\nThe Senate urged the Federal Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy to expedite the action of the Joint Committee put in place to develop Consultation Document (CD) for the deployment of 5G in Nigeria which include planning spectrum identified for the technology with the inputs of all relevant stakeholders such as the relevant Committees of the National Assembly and the security agencies.\n\nIt also further tasked the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy to publish the outcome of the work of its Technical Advisory Committee charged to advise on emerging technologies and products and, as a matter of urgency, build the National Backbone which will run from Lagos to Katsina (Trans-Saharan Optic fibre network) to move much of the bandwidth from the shore to the hinterland and for distribution to the geopolitical zones.\n\nThe Senate insisted that despite the almost general consensus concerning the harmlessness of 5G to human health, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), in collaboration with the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), Federal Ministry of Health, Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, Federal Ministry of Environment, and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) among others, should locally conduct a scientifIc experimental study over a period of about 6 months to ascertain if a correlation exists between 5G networks and public health.\n\nConcerning the interaction between COVID-19 and 5G network technologies, the Senate observed that there is no connection between them, maintaining that, \u201cthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a biological agent a virus which is scientifIcally unconnected with the 5G technology.\u201d",

In the same vein, the 36 states of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory wanted approval of Peace Corps of Nigeria to establish its formation in all schools and colleges in their various states and I have the written approval to that effect.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the issue that we are duplicating responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Youth Development and the Federal Ministry of Education is completely out of place.\n\n\u201cI want to say Mr. Chairman that based on the dynamic nature of the society, the time has come for the Nigeria Peace Corps to be elevated from the level of volunteerism to that of government driven oprational template.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, in a remark before declaring the public hearing session open , said observations made by President Muhammadu Buhari in the earlier bill refused assent during the 8th National Assembly , have been taken care of , in preventing such re \u2013 occurrence .",

The House of Assembly has been operating their own autonomy since two years even before they started talking about it in this country.\n\n\u201cIt has worked; I have not found any reason to regret that action. So, I believe too that there is no reason why the judiciary cannot run its own autonomy.\n\n\u201cI do also believe that it does not stop the arms of government from relating with each other.\n\n\u201cThe budgets are made on a yearly basis and the only challenge is that many times we are unable to fund it in full. However, what will be released on a monthly basis will be subject to the returns that come from Federal Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC),\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that with the commencement of the full process, the Chief Judge had been empowered to effect his own direct approvals without having to resort to the governor.\n\n\u201cI am very happy to do that because it reduces the number of files on my table. So, I want to announce the full autonomy of the judiciary with the setting up of the committees.\n\n\u201cI am not doing this for any gains. I believe that it\u2019s right and just; I believe too that it\u2019s in the best interest of governance in our nation and that\u2019s how we have also thought about it in the House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cI want to generally advise that autonomy does not stop governance from progressing; in fact, it helps governance and I believe that it is something worth doing,\u2019\u2019 Okowa stated\n\nHe thanked judges in the state for their role in ensuring delivery of justice.\n\n\u201cSo my Lord, the Chief Judge, I want to congratulate you for setting up the committee.\n\n\u201cApart from the files that are expected to come to my office, I will advise that no further files should be sent because you are now expected to approve your files by yourself because that\u2019s the process of the autonomy.\n\n\u201cWe thank God that whatever that has a beginning has an end, and I am glad that you have worked so hard to improve on the judicial process in the state.\n\n\u201cI truly appreciate your service to the state and the relationship you kept with the executive arm of government and my family. It was God who made it possible for you to conduct my inauguration in 2015 and 2019.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary in Delta has continued to walk tall and what I hear happening in other states, I never witnessed it here.\n\n\u201cI have never had cause to worry here and I must thank the Chief Judge and all his brother judges for their cooperation.\n\n\u201cIt is my prayer and hope that God will continue to be with you in the course of your retirement,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nEarlier, Justice Umukoro had said that he led the judges to visit the governor as part of the valedictory activities leading to his disengagement as a judicial officer and head of the judicial arm of government in Delta.\n\nHe expressed appreciation to Governor Okowa for his support to him since he became the helmsman of the judiciary in 2015.\n\n\u201cSince I came on board six years ago, you treated me as a brother and I am grateful for your support even during the death of my wife.\n\n\u201cAs Chief Judge of Delta, I can confidently say that we have never had any crisis and we have been able to manage ourselves effectively.\n\n\u201cI am here to deeply appreciate you for supporting me throughout my tenure as Chief Judge of the State and to also thank you for approving the process for the implementation of full autonomy for the state judiciary,\u201d he stated.",

          "title": "Analysts Differ on Buhari\u2019s Quest for Fresh $6bn External Loan",
          "text": "Financial analysts and the organised private sector on Tuesday expressed mixed feelings over Nigeria\u2019s rising public debt following a fresh request by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly to approve a $6.18 billion foreign loan.\n\nBefore the latest request, Nigeria\u2019s total external debt stood at $33.348 billion, while total public debt stock as of December 30, 2021, which was released by the DMO in March 2021, stood at N32.915 trillion.\n\nBuhari, in different letters to both chambers of the National Assembly urged the lawmakers to approve his request to borrow N2.3 trillion ($6.18billion) external loan to finance part of the 2021 budget deficit of N5.6 trillion.\n\nThe president in another letter also canvassed a concurrent approval by the legislature for a total sum of $3,837,281,256, \u20ac910,000,000 and grant component of $10,000,000 for donor fund projects under the 2018-2020 federal government external borrowing rolling plan.\n\nThe two request letters, dated May 6, 2021, came a month after the Senate and the House of Representatives approved $1.5 billion and \u20ac995 million external borrowings for the federal government to finance various priority projects and to support states facing fiscal challenges.\n\nBuhari\u2019s requests were contained in different letters addressed to the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, and the House Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\nThe letters were read at Tuesday plenary by the two presiding officers.\n\nThe president said the request for the N2.3 trillion loan to finance the 2021 budget deficit was in line with the provisions of Sections 21(1) and 27(1) of the Debt Management Office (Establishment, Etc.) Act, 2003 (DMO Act), which states that no external loan shall be approved or obtained by the minister unless its terms and conditions shall have been laid before the National Assembly and approved by its resolution.\n\nAccording to him, the loan will enable the federal government to fund critical infrastructural projects in power, transportation, agriculture and rural development, health, education, among others.\n\nHe said the loan would be sourced from a combination of multilateral and bilateral lenders, as well as from the International Capital Market (ICM) through the issuance of Eurobonds.\n\nAccording to him, from recent trends in the ICM, it is now possible for Nigeria to raise funds, and this explains why the federal government is proposing that the new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act should include issuing Eurobonds in the ICM.\n\nHe estimated that Nigeria may be able to raise $3 billion or more, but not more than $6.183 billion (the amount provided in the 2021 Appropriation Act) in a combination of tenors between five-30 years.\n\nHe said the outcome would, however, be determined when Nigeria approached the market.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201dThe purpose of this letter is to request for a resolution of the National Assembly to raise the sum of N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) provided as new external borrowing in the 2021 Appropriation Act (Item No. 330) to part-finance the budget deficit of N5.602 trillion. The right honourable speaker may wish to recall that the 2021 Appropriation Act provides for N4,686,775,885,696.00 as new borrowings (item No. 328) to part-finance the 2021 fiscal deficit, of which 50 per cent or N2,343,387,942,848.00 (about $6,183,081 ,643.40 at the budget exchange rate of $1.00/N379) is specified as new external borrowing.\n\n\u201dThe Senate President and right honourable Speaker may also wish to note that the allocation of N2.343 trillion to new external borrowing in 2021 Appropriation Act is consistent with Nigeria\u2019s debt management strategy, which seeks amongst other objectives, to moderate \u2018debt service costs by accessing relatively cheaper external funds, and free-up space in the domestic market for other borrowers.\u201d\n\nFor concurrent approval of donor fund projects, the president, in the second letter, said the projects would be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), French Development Agency (AFD), Islamic Development Bank, China Eximbank, China Development Bank, European Investment Bank, European ECA, KfW, IPEX, AFC, India EximBank and lnternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).\n\nBuhari explained that the projects and programmes in the borrowing plan were selected based on positive, technical and economic evaluations as well as the contributions they would make to the socio-economic development of the country, including employment generation and poverty reduction.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201dSenate President and the right honourable Speaker may also wish to know that all the listed projects form part of the 2018 2020 external borrowing plan and covered both the federal and state governments\u2019 projects and are geared towards the realisation of the Nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan that cut across key sectors such as infrastructure, health, agriculture and food security, energy, education and human capital development and COVlD -19 response efforts.\n\n\u201dA summary of some key projects in each of the six geopolitical zones and a summary on the expected impacts on the socio-economic development of each of the six geo-political zones are attached herewith as Annex II and III.\n\nGiven the importance attached to the timely delivery of the projects listed in the proposed borrowing plan and the benefits both the federal and state governments stand to gain from the implementation of same, I hereby wish to request for the kind consideration and concurrent approval of the House for 2018 2020 federal government external borrowing (rolling) plan to enable the projects to become effective.\u201d\n\nAnalysts Differ over Borrowing Request\n\nSome of the economic experts who spoke to THISDAY yesterday warned that the current bid to accumulate more public debts would mortgage the future of the country and its future generations.\n\nThey were also worried that the current move is not being done in a transparent manner that would enable Nigerians to know the specific projects the loan would be tied to and the institutions the government intended to borrow from.\n\nHowever, some others believed that the current move to borrow externally would enhance the country\u2019s foreign reserves and stabilise the value of the naira.\n\nOne of those who felt that the federal government should jettison the idea of accessing fresh foreign loan at this period is a professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom, Prof. Akpan Ekpo.\n\nEkpo told THISDAY yesterday that he was worried that the current move by the federal government would worsen Nigeria\u2019s public debt management and subject future generations to financial bondage.\n\nHe advised the government to surgically reduce the bloated cost of governance in the country, warning that the government should be more concerned with its debt to revenue ratio as well as solvency and liquidity ratios because oil, which is its revenue base, is very shaky by depending on exogenous factors that it could not control.\n\nEkpo said the country\u2019s debt-servicing burden was taking almost one-third of Nigeria\u2019s annual budget.\n\nHe stated: \u201cSo, we are building debts for future generations to pay. Right now, Nigeria is merely scratching at its debt by servicing it without touching the principal.\u201d\n\nEkpo, who was the immediate past Director-General of the West African Institute of Financial and Economic Management is also concerned about the transparency of the proposed borrowing.\n\nThe Director-General of Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), Mr. Timothy Olawale, said it would be carelessness on the part of this government to be borrowing and building unsustainable debt burden for future generations and succeeding governments.\n\nOlawale said: \u201cWe have repeatedly said that the government should cut its coat according to its cloth. It must look for where and how to reduce its over-bloated governance structure that has been consuming so much. And there are one thousand and one budget heads they can do away with without retrenching workers. The Oronsaye Panel\u2019s report recommendation that ministries and agencies of government should be merged is still unimplemented.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo, borrowing is a lazy way of escape from reality. If you cannot afford a particular lifestyle, commonsense dictates that you should come back and restructure your lifestyle to suit your income. But rather than doing this, the government keeps on borrowing to satiate its appetite for luxury and flamboyance.\n\n\u201cWell, we are not in support of this and we will want the government to be very prudent and mindful of the future of our economy, the future of the project called Nigeria and the future of generations yet unborn.\u201d\n\nA professor of Finance, University of Lagos, Prof. Winifred Iyiegbuniwe, warned that Nigeria should not continue to borrow and dissipate them on wasteful expenses.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe problem is that we cannot continue to be borrowing in this manner and dissipate them through wasteful expenses. I have a problem as a financial economist when I am not convinced of what the government is doing with these borrowings. If we can borrow for specified and identifiable capital projects, fine. But if it is to borrow for consumption, no! We should cut our coat according to our cloth.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed that all the long talk about removing fuel and electricity subsidies and plugging loopholes in tax collections are yielding nothing. They seemed to be too much talking with too little action. The only foreign borrowing that will make sense is one that is tied to a specific project. So, the government must be more specific about the infrastructure it intends to finance.\u201d\n\nSome analysts, however, said that the plan to borrow $6.18 billion external loan would strengthen Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves but cautioned that it could also lead to heightened debt burden if not channelled to productive sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Head of Research at Agusto Consulting, Mr. Jimi Ogbobine, said: \u201cThis could help boost foreign reserves at this point in time. But what we need to do is to complement it with other policies like the harmonisation of the exchange rate so we can stimulate foreign direct investments (FDI) once again because we cannot survive on using loans to boost our foreign reserves.\u201d\n\nOgbobine, however, noted that \u201cthere are other ways of deficit financing because debt is not the only way of getting financing, which could also be done through taxes and sale of assets.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at all the unproductive assets and think of how we can get them out of the government\u2019s books in order to reduce recurrent expenditures on these assets,\u201d he stated.\n\nSimilarly, the Head, Retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham, Mr. Ayodeji Ebo, said: \u201cWe know government is constrained with a shortage of fund but it should ensure that major part of the borrowing will go to the productive sector. There is really no harm in borrowing as long as it is used for productive purposes.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Dr. Muda Yusuf, expressed concern that the rising debt profile of the federal government might not be sustainable because the debts will become a problem when the revenue base is not strong enough to service them.\n\nYusuf said: \u201cWhat is needed is the political will to cut expenditure and undertake reforms that could scale down the size of government, reduce governance cost and ease the fiscal burden on the government.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the debt should be used strictly to fund capital projects that would strengthen the productive capacity of the economy.\n\nHe also advised government to shift \u201cemphasis to concessionary financing against commercial debts that are typically very costly.\u201d\n\nAPC Mortgaging Future, Says PDP\n\nMeanwhile, the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday raised the alarm over another plan by the federal government to borrow N2.3 trillion.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of PDP, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, told THISDAY that the additional loan request would mortgage the future of generations yet unborn Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are alarmed like any other Nigerian on this fresh loan request. It is simply to mortgage the nation and the future of the younger ones as they will be held in bondage by debts.\n\n\u201cThe funniest thing is that upon all these loans, there is nothing tangible to show with the loans so far obtained. As a party and as Nigerians, we are worried. What is simply happening is just mis-governance and incompetence In all these multiple loans, the truth is that you cannot point any finger and say, this is what the Buhari administration has done with it.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Dike Onwuamaeze and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos",

The vaccines that expired are not being used during the vaccination campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cOn behalf of the government, I assure all Malawians that no one will be given an expired COVID vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe burned vaccines were the remainder of 102,000 doses that arrived in Malawi on March 26 with just 18 days until they expired on April 13. All other doses of the shipment, donated by the African Union, were successfully administered, she said.\n\nThe health minister thanked WHO, the African Union and India for donating the vaccines.\n\n\u201cThis has made it possible for Malawi to embark on the COVID vaccination campaign currently underway,\u201d she said, without mentioning the WHO\u2019s pleas not to burn the vaccines.\n\nThe calls not to destroy the vaccines came too late for Malawi, a small southern African country of about 20 million people, ministry of health spokesman Joshua Malango told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWe had stopped observation of proper storage mechanisms and the vaccines would have still been damaged in one way or the other,\u201d he said.\n\nMalawi will still have adequate stocks of COVID-19 vaccines in both public and private health facilities, health secretary Charles Mwansambo said. The government has not said where it will get more vaccines.\n\nMalawi\u2019s got its first consignment of 360,000 AstraZeneca doses in early March from the U.N.-backed COVAX initiative which is providing vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. The country received another batch of 50,000 AstraZeneca doses from the Indian government. With the AU donation, Malawi had a total of 512,000 AstraZeneca doses.\n\nSo far 212,615 doses have been given in Malawi. The country has 34,216 confirmed cases, including 1,153 deaths, according to the Africa CDC.\n\nCurrently, the country is seeing a decrease in the disease, with the 7-day rolling average of daily new cases in Malawi dropping from 0.07 new cases per 100,000 people on May 4 to 0.04 new cases per 100,000 people on May 18.
