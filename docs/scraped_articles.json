          "text": "A founding member of the Arewa Consultative Forum and elder statesman, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, says the secessionist agitation by the embattled leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, weakens the chances of the Igbo people to produce a credible presidential candidate in the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe spoke in an interview with Channels TV on Sunday monitored by The PUNCH.\n\nAccording to the 96-year-old statesman, the South-East geopolitical zone must convince Nigerians beyond any reasonable doubt that it is ready to occupy the exalted office in 2023.\n\nKanu, who is in the custody of the Department of States Services, is facing terrorism-related charges before Justice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court in Abuja. He and his group had listed alleged marginalisation of the Igbo people in governance, insecurity, as part of the reasons for his agitation.\n\nWith the 2023 elections fast approaching, demands for a President from the South-East continues to rise, with socio-political groups like the Ohanaeze Ndigbo; as well as the five governors in the South-East calling for the zone to produce the next President, after the eight-year regime of the incumbent, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), who is from Daura, Katsina State.\n\nOhanaeze and the governors led by Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State claimed that no President has emerged from the zone since Nigeria\u2019s return to democracy in 1999.\n\nSome politicians in the South-East have since defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress and opposition Peoples Democratic Party as part of permutations for the next presidential election.\n\nSpeaking during the interview, Yakasai said the Igbo people must not sit back and demand that the next Presidency be zoned to them.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe card is on the Southeastern people\u2019s desk. It is up to them to try to reach out. I\u2019m a strong supporter of a President from the South after Buhari and also if he can come from the South-East I have no problem.\n\n\u201cMy quarrel is that this is not something you just stay at home and pray that people will just dash it to you; you have to show interest, you have to be serious, you have to try to convince people that you are really up to the task. This is what in my opinion is missing from the South-East.\n\n\u201cThere is that desire on their part but they are not exact in their position to manifest that desire to convince people that are rarely serious about it.\n\n\u201cThere is this anxiety in Nigeria about the position of the South-East because it is surprising to many people including people like me\u2026This Nnamdi Kanu who ordinarily to me would not be a good candidate for the governorship of any of the South-Eastern state is now claiming the attention (and) support of prominent people in the South-East is making people doubt if the South-East is really ready to produce a credible candidate that would help Nigeria as a whole. That doubt is there.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Peter Okutu, Abakaliki\n\nThe Special Assistant to Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, Mr. Francis Nwaze, weekend stated that his boss was strategically increasing the State\u2019s revenue generation capacity through infrastructural Development in different parts of the State.\n\nNwaze who stated this during a media chat with Newsmen in his office in Abakaliki added that Governor Umahi was looking beyond the now, to adequately reposition the State for future competitiveness in various aspect of the Nigerian economy.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cUmahi is planning for the future of Ebonyi State. His expectations are that as soon as all his infrastructural arrangements are on ground, the revenue generation capacity of the State will increase.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something so unique about the King David University of Medical sciences. The University is going to be the first University in entire Africa that will be producing Dialyzers. By the grace of God Ebonyi State will have patent in the arrangement. That means that any person or State or country that want to go into the e production of Dialyzers will come to Ebonyi State and make payment to be able to get the dialyszer.\n\n\u201cThat place is a world class University. It is unique on its own. . It has the composition of the Universityl building, laboratories, theatres and so many characteraitic of a world class institution. There\u2019s staff quarters and accommodation for students of all levels. The security of the place is guaranteed. They are working on having a-24 hour power supply. It\u2019s a complete package of a World-class University.\n\n\u201cWe have about 17 twin flyovers located strategically in different parts the State including rural areas. There\u2019s a flyover that the Governor said that since some people say there nothing special about Ebonyi, he is going to put \u2018construction confusion\u2019 there; So that if you want to enter the Ebonyi State Shopping Mall and the Ecumenical Centre for the first time, you must ask question that will lead you through the flyover to the desired location. You cannot find that kind of flyover anywhere in the country. You will not see that kind of flyover anywhere in the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s is unique and smart. It makes Ebonyi a smart city. There Iyere flyover in Afikpo South. When completed, will be saving about 50 lives per annum because of the unfortunate incident that usually occur there before the emegence of the flyover. People usually die there because of the sharpness of the bridge.\n\n\u201cAs I speak to you, Umahi has constructed about 500 different roads that have been constructed including rural roads. Local Governments in Ebonyi has a minimum of 20km roads already constructed. That\u2019s why in Ebonyi, it easier to connect to other LGAs within 45 minutes.\n\n\u201cMany people have said that how you know you have entered Ebonyi State is when your vehicle stop entering gallops on the road. Ebonyi State has moved from the dust of the nation to the true Salt of the Nation.\n\n\u201cThe ring road project is one of the best projects that is ongoing in the State and it is made up of 199 kilometers. It wasn\u2019t easy but because of whom Umahi is, it was possible. He was able to secure approval for the loan from the Federal Government and the sponsoring banks. When these roads will be completed, it is going to connect 8 LGAs in the State.\n\n\u201cAt the completion, Ebonyi will become a different city entirely because the road connectivity will be superlative. The State is moving speedily. That people who long left the State for about two years always miss their way around the State.

The cost of transportation for human and goods across the country, will skyrocket and other things connected, which will have a spiral effect on general living standard of the populace; the suffering will be multi-dimensional. Please let all stakeholders be sensitive to this avoidable path and do the needful.\u201d\n\nHe admonished the government to do all it could to revive the four ailing refineries in the country, with a view to ensuring they operate at optimal level for a lasting benefit, for the country and its people.\n\n\u201cBy whatever means, let the Federal Government put its heart into ensuring that our refineries are back to life. In addition, in order to stem the rising cost of living, farmers and others connected to them should be encouraged. This is what can help our economy,\u201d he stressed.\n\nWhile maintaining that the Christian body would always support policies that would enhance good governance, he charged the government to put in place tangible palliative measures that could ameliorate the hardship being experienced.\n\n\u201cWithout begging the issue, there should be well defined palliative measures in place that can cushion the effect of the hardship being experienced by Nigerians, especially the commoners. One is not talking about political palliatives that never last. We have seen enough of such.\n\n\u201cAn increase in the price of petroleum from its present N165 to N340 per litre, can trigger tension and crises in the country, which in turn can paralyse our economy if not handled with utmost care.Again, the planned introduction of N5,000 for 40 million poor Nigerians, is to create a cesspool of corruption. How do you define \u2018the poor? They, mostly, don\u2019t use telephones. They, mostly, don\u2019t have bank accounts. How will the money get to them?\u201d\n\nHe advised government to be wary of policies that could jeopardise the conduct of the 2023 general elections, insisting that all hands must be geared towards steering the wheel of the country to safety.\n\nHe also implored the government not to relent in its efforts at ensuring that security challenges in the country become a thing of the past.\n\nMeanwhile, President of Vision Africa, Bishop Sunday Onuoha, has blamed the socio-economic and political challenges ravaging Nigeria and the world on lack of love and tolerance.\n\nHe stated this at the annual harvest thanksgiving of the Methodist church Nigeria, Cathedral of Unity, Diocese of Abuja, yesterday.\n\nHe stressed that Nigeria is one and must learn to forgive each other in order to be able to regain its lost sweetness.\n\n\u201cFor this country is regain its lost glory and move forward economical, we must learn how to forgive each other. Once we have a group of people, offence must certainly occur. So, there is need for us to continually forgive ourselves.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be discouraged due to the level of crisis in the country because God is still in charge and is out to deliver the country. We need to love ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe clergy, therefore admonished Nigerians not to be discouraged, adding that God is still in charge \u00e0nd is set to redeem Nigeria.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nSenators elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Young Progressives Party (YPP) have technically abandoned activities on the floor of the Senate, investigations by Daily Sun have revealed.\n\nThere are 109 senators, elected every four years during general elections. According to laws governing activities of the Senate vis-a-vis the National Assembly, lawmakers are expected to sit at least 180-181 days in a year. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, the Senate has failed to meet this constitutional requirement. Besides shutting the National Assembly for months in 2020, it has also reduced the number of sittings in a week.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nIt now holds plenary on Tuesdays and Wednesdays between 10.30 or 11am and ends before 2pm. Thursdays, which were hitherto sitting days have been jettisoned.\n\nSimilarly, attendance during plenary has plummeted since 2020. Many senators who barely turn up, register and abandon the chamber half way into the day\u2019s legislative business.\n\nBut the Senate spokesman, Bashir Ajibola, has attributed the development to other busy schedules of lawmakers. He claimed that lawmakers were busy with other legislative functions, hence they can\u2019t attend plenary regularly.\n\n\u201cMany Senators are busy with committee works on appropriation and oversight functions as well as seeing to the implementation of capital and Zonal Intervention projects in their constituencies,\u201d he claimed.\n\nSome senators however disagree. Senator Smart Adeyemi, who represents Kogi West, attributed the apathy to last year\u2019s outbreak of COVID-19. He also listed other factors that maybe responsible.\n\nThe former national president of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), urged newsmen to look at the register of the Senate and tell Nigerians those who fail to attend plenary.\n\nThough he conceded that it was not in a position to castigate his colleagues, he, however stated that lawmakers elected by the people must attend plenary, as that remains your first responsibility.\n\nHe said: \u201cI always attend plenary. I contribute well on the floor of the Senate and no one can fault that. But there are some lawmakers I can\u2019t recall the last time I saw in plenary. I don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t come. The media can help us find out.\n\n\u201cThe primary responsibility of a senator is to attend plenary. It also depends on the senatorial district you represent. Some people consider certain factors. Some maybe sick or may have traveled outside Nigeria. Those are possibilities and I can speak for others.\n\n\u201cThis apathy started last year during COVID-19. There maybe other reasons which I can\u2019t tell because I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA prominent senator from the North, said attending plenary was becoming an exercise in futility, since 2019, when Ahmad Lawan assumed office as President of the Senate.\n\nHe said lawmakers were micromanaged and not allowed to speak freely on important national issues unlike in the past. The senator complained that whenever any issue pertaining to President Muhammadu Buhari is discussed, Lawan seldom allows it.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t discuss anything freely about Buhari,\u201d he complained. \u201cLawan doesn\u2019t permit it. If you go too deep, he will turn off your microphone and that ends it. I don\u2019t see any reason why I should sit there and be caged. Avoiding it is the best option for me.\u201d\n\nAnother senator from the South East who chairs a sensitive committee, said it was unnecessary to attend plenary since every request from President Buhari is seldom subjected to any serious debate by Lawan.\n\nHe lamented that loan requests, confirmations and budgets, can\u2019t be tampered with by the Senate, claiming that Lawan will never permit. He said until the Senate is serious to perform its duties of checking the excesses of the Executive, attending plenary was unnecessary.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "*AfDB president says Africa should not be penalised for new strain\n\n*Wants vaccine manufacturing accelerated in continent\n\n*Emefiele, OPS seek proactive action Ramaphosa urges countries to reverse travel ban\n\nObinna Chima and Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nNigeria yesterday expressed solidarity with South Africa as it struggled with some of the difficulties posed by a new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, discovered in the country. The Nigerian government warned Western countries against discrimination against South Africa following travel restrictions imposed on Southern African countries in the aftermath of the new virus discovery.\n\nThe federal government said President Muhammadu Buhari would go ahead to receive South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who had been scheduled to visit Nigeria from today with other top officials of his administration, on a three-day visit.\n\nMinister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, stated Nigeria\u2019s position in a chat with THISDAY ahead of a media briefing scheduled for today in Abuja on the matter.\n\nRamaphosa called for reversal of the travels restriction.\n\nIn a similar vein, President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, yesterday voiced displeasure at the stigmatisation and penalisation of Africa for new COVID-19 variants discovered on the continent. Adesina urged the acceleration of vaccine production in Africa.\n\nLikewise, some members of the organised private sector (OPS) advised the federal and state governments in Nigeria to take proactive steps to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The OPS members said this during separate interviews with THISDAY.\n\nThat was as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, said at the weekend in Lagos that the dire implications of the food export restrictions by some countries during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 should not be lost on Nigeria.\n\nEhanire insisted that the move by Western countries to ban or try to isolate South Africa was discriminatory. He this was because the variant detected in South Africa and also in Botswana and other countries had similarly been detected in Belgium, Italy, Germany and other countries.\n\n\u201cSo, the federal government condemned the rush to ban or isolate South Africa by European countries, without isolating Belgium, Italy and other European countries that have more direct flights into the United States of America and among themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister argued that the position of the Western countries on the virus was not backed by science, saying so far, even if it is a mutation, the new COVID-19 variant has not caused any new deaths or proved to be worse than the Delta variant.\n\nEhanire stated, \u201cTherefore, the world should wait for that time, than to be enmeshed in heavy discrimination against South Africa. Why would they isolate South Africa? The federal government would open its doors to Ramaphosa and others who are coming from South Africa until science says otherwise. People should be vigilant.\u201d\n\nThe AfDB president, who wrote on his Twitter handle, stressed that Africa was not the source of the COVID-19 virus, which had continued to put the world on edge.\n\nThe new COVID-19 variant was first discovered in South Africa and has since been detected in Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Czech Republic, and Hong Kong.\n\nOwing to its discovery, Israel on Saturday announced that it was banning all foreigners from entering the country. The ban, pending government approval, was expected to last two weeks. Israelis returning from countries on the red list, which included countries in Southern Africa, would be required to isolate for seven days in a designated hotel.\n\nAustralia also banned the entry of foreigners who had travelled to nine Southern African countries in the past 14 days, including South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, and Zimbabwe.\n\nSouth Korea, too, imposed restrictions on travellers from eight southern African countries, its Disease Control and Prevention Agency announced Saturday.\n\nForeign nationals traveling from South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Eswatini, Malawi and Mozambique were banned from entering South Korea, the agency said.\n\nBut Adesina warned, \u201cAfrica should not be labelled and penalised for COVID-19 variants and mutations that occur randomly elsewhere in the world. Africa is not the source of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThere must be global justice, equity and fairness in access to vaccine. Global vaccine supply system has underserved Africa. Protecting one\u2019s home alone in the midst of a forest does not work.\n\nPut out the forest fire.\n\n\u201cAfrica must accelerate the manufacturing of its own vaccines and set up its own \u2018healthcare security defence system\u2019. Africa must no longer outsource health security of its 1.8 billion people to the benevolence of others.\u201d\n\nEmefiele reiterated the need for Nigerians to look inwards, considering the country\u2019s huge population. He said the pandemic presented an opportunity to fix critical infrastructure in the country so as to reduce dependence on other countries for most of the continent\u2019s needs.\n\nThe CBN governor stated, \u201cAs I\u2019ve asked in some of my recent treatises on the opportunities of the pandemic, what if the pandemic occurs again and we witness an extended restriction in movements and export bans? What if these restrictions become a new normal? What if another pandemic occurs in which all borders are closed, with food and medical imports significantly curtailed? What if the rich among us, even when they can afford to pay for their medical bills abroad, cannot travel out of our shores because of these extended lockdowns?\n\n\u201cAre we going to allow our hospitals to remain in their current state without equipment and state of the art facilities? For how long shall we continue to rely on the world for anything and everything?\u201d\n\nHe noted that in 2020, following the provision of vaccines, countries began to ease movement restrictions and demand in certain sectors began to recover to pre-COVID levels. Unfortunately, the surge in demand for the vaccines contributed to significant supply chain disruptions, which contributed to elevated inflation in advanced and developing markets, Emefiele added.\n\n\u201cFor example,\u201d he said, \u201cthe Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities, in October 2021, stood at its highest level since July 2011, because of the initially exogenous supply disruption I am about to describe.\n\n\u201cFinally, tragic as these outcomes were, even more alarming was the reaction of many countries at the height of the pandemic. All over the world, countries responded by fighting for themselves and taking measures to protect their own people, regardless of the spill-over effects on the rest of the world. According to the World Customs organisation, a total of 32 countries and territories adopted stringent and immediate export restrictions on critical medical supplies and drugs that were specifically meant to respond to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) urged the federal and state governments to be vigilant in testing people arriving Nigeria in order to track and contain the spread of Omicron in the country.\n\nDirector General of the NACCIMA, Mr. Ayo Olukanni, told THISDAY yesterday that government should not let their guards down but pay attention to the possibility of the spread of the new variant in the country.\n\nOlukanni advised government at all levels to encourage Nigerians that had not taken the COVID-19 vaccines to do so.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe should not let our guards down on this issue. Implicitly, there will be more testing and, of course, those people who have not taken the COVID-19 vaccine should be encouraged to take it now. In fact, this is the time to make it compulsory for everyone to have the vaccine.\n\n\u201cWe should also be more stringent with people who are coming in from Omicron\u2019s high risk areas.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said government should not contemplate locking down the economy because of the new variant.\n\nOlukanni said, \u201cNo! I do not think that a lockdown will achieve any purpose. Our economy is just coming out of recession and we should not take actions that would push it back to another round of recession.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, said the government should be vigilant and proactive in managing the spread of the new variant in the country. Yusuf, the immediate past Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, also told THISDAY that the government should apply a risk-based approach by tracing arrivals into Nigeria from high-risk locations. He also advised against another lockdown of the economy.\n\nYusuf said, \u201cWhat the government should do is to trace the locations that represent high risk of importing the new variant into Nigeria and restrict entries from those locations for now.\n\n\u201cConsidering that Nigerians in those countries will be coming home and no one can say that they will not come home.

          "title": "NDIC to Adopt Risk-based Approach in Determining Banks\u2019 Premium",
          "text": "*Says in event of banks\u2019 failure, 97% depositors would be covered\n\nUgo Aliogo\n\nThe Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) said it was reviewing its approach for determining the premium by banks to its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF), with a view to adopting a risk-based approach.\n\nManaging Director of NDIC, Mr. Bello Hassan, disclosed this in a keynote address he delivered at the 2021 Editors\u2019 Forum, with the theme, \u201cEnduring Extreme Disruptions: Resilience and Reinvention for Banking System Stability and Deposit Insurance,\u201d organised by the corporation in Lagos at the weekend.\n\nThe NDIC, in calculating premiums from deposit money banks, usually chose between adopting a flat-rate premium or a system that sought to differentiate premiums on the basis of individual-bank risk profiles.\n\nA flat-rate premium system has the advantage of being relatively easy to understand and administer. Also, it allows the strong banks to subsidise the weak ones for the stability of the financial system.\n\nHowever, it does not take into account the level of risk that a bank poses to the deposit insurance system, and can, therefore, be perceived as unfair, in that the same premium rate is charged to all banks, regardless of their degrees of risk.\n\nHassan explained NDIC had commenced the review of its approach \u201cto the determination of premium/contribution by banks to our DIF to a more risk-based approach to ensure that, the probability of the risk crystallising becomes a major factor in the pricing methodology of our premium going forward.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOn timely support to insured institutions, we have identified the need to reconsider our criteria for qualification of financial institutions to provide realistic terms and conditions in order to facilitate prompt access to technical and/or financial support in line with the Sec\n\n(2)(1)(b) of the NDIC Act whilst also protecting the corporation from possible downside risk.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed that the corporation had commenced the process of strengthening its failure resolution and liquidation mandate through the improvement of its internal processes and procedures as well as enhancing effective collaboration with relevant stakeholders to ensure that it discharges its responsibilities more efficiently.\n\nHe said the review became imperative given the need to implement prompt corrective actions on ailing or failed banks, improve processes in addressing challenges in liquidation and, most importantly, provide timely reimbursement of insured sums to depositors of failed banks.\n\nIn the area of deposit insurance as a distinct mandate of the corporation, the NDIC boss pointed out that from statistics, the corporation\u2019s deposit insurance coverage limits were not only adequate but also robust enough to engender confidence in the banking system.\n\nFor instance, in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the total number of accounts in the deposit money banks stood at 83 million; 99.1million; 112 million and 128.4 million respectively.\n\nHe added, \u201cOut of these numbers, the N500,000 coverage limit fully covered 99.4 per cent; 97.6 per cent; 97.5 per cent and 97.6 per cent of accounts, respectively. The implication is that in the event of bank failure, above 97 per cent of depositors would be fully covered by the corporation.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that pursuant to the provisions of the NDIC Act, several failure resolution initiatives, such as Open Bank Assistance (OBA), Purchase & Assumption (P&A), and Mergers & Acquisition (M&A) had been adopted in resolving distress in various banks from 1989, culminating in the novel bridge bank option to resolve four problem banks in 2011 and 2018.\n\nThe bridge bank option, according to him, did not only prevent a systemic crisis, it secured N1.021 trillion deposits which ensured that depositors had continued access to their funds and financial services. The implementation of the bridge bank option also saved over 12,667 jobs while over 877 branch network and services of the affected banks were maintained.\n\nHassan said, \u201cThe corporation\u2019s accomplishment in the payment of guaranteed sums and liquidation dividends speaks volumes for its commitment to the discharge of its unique mandate. NDIC had paid a cumulative sum of N8.268 billion to 443,946 insured depositors and N100.080 billion to uninsured depositors of deposit money banks in-liquidation as at September 30th, 2021, while N3.413 billion was paid to 90,945 insured depositors of microfinance banks and N1.218 million to uninsured depositors. In the same vein, cumulative insured amount paid to 1,553 depositors of closed primary mortgage banks as at 30th September, 2021 stood at N110.15 million while N7.965 million was paid as uninsured deposits.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, the payment of N1.274 billion to 991 creditors and N4.886 billion to 965 shareholders of banks in-liquidation as at September 30, 2021 underscored the corporation\u2019s success story in bank liquidation. What this implies is that the corporation had realised enough assets to pay all the insured and uninsured depositors of the banks that present themselves for payment.\n\nCurrently, 19 out of the 49 DMBs in-liquidation fall into this category.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How Army, Using Informants, Infiltrated, Arrested Fleeing Terrorists in Lagos",
          "text": "*9 Brigade intercepts, arrests another with explosives\n\n*Uncovers more sleeper cells in Lagos, Ogun\n\n*Army establishes new brigade in Adamawa\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi\n\nMore details have emerged on how the Nigerian Army trailed and arrested in Lagos some 13 Boko Haram terrorists, who had coordinated and carried out several deadly attacks on troops in the North-east, including those that killed many security operatives.\n\nThe suspects were arrested during a raid on their hideouts at the Itapeju area of Apapa, in Lagos.\n\nTHISDAY reliably gathered that after carrying out several deadly attacks on civilians and troops, the suspects fled to Lagos and hid in a terrorist sleeper cell at Itapeju.\n\nAccording to findings, the terrorists had fled to Lagos because operatives of Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK), a Joint Task Force in the North-east, launched a massive reprisal onslaught, which dealt decisively with the terrorists, bandits and other criminals in the axis.\n\nHowever, the troops gradually built intelligence, with the help of credible informants, and infiltrated the terrorists, leading to their arrest.\n\nIn a tight need-to-know operation, the army had swooped in on the hideouts and arrested the suspects. At the moment, they have been transferred back to Maiduguri theatre of operation for profiling before hand over to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.\n\nIn a similar development, the 9 Brigade, 81 Division of the Nigerian Army, on Friday in Lagos arrested one Ibrahim Abdullahi with eight 600mm mortar bomb explosives.\n\nThe 24-year-old suspect, alongside his accomplices, were said to have attempted to infiltrate the Ikeja cantonment with the explosives, when they were accosted by operatives, who demanded to know the contents of their bag.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Faruk Yahaya, charged officers and soldiers of the newly formed 6 Brigade of the Nigerian Army to exhibit professionalism and discipline in the conduct of their operations and other engagements in their area of responsibility. Yahaya gave the charge today during a tour of the Headquarters, 6 Brigade, Nigerian Army, Jalingo, as part of his operational and assessment visit to formations and units of the Nigerian Army across the country.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the officers on duty at 9 Brigade, Nigerian Army, Lagos, were alerted by the suspicious movements of the suspect and his collaborators currently at large.\n\nOn sighting the uncharged mortar and the detonators, Abdullahi was swiftly arrested while the others fled. He was immediately profiled and handed over to the State Criminal Intelligence Department (SCID), Panti, Yaba, which had equally commenced investigation.\n\nThat same Friday, the suspect was charged before the Ebute Meta Magistrates\u2019 Court and consequently remanded in custody while moves are in top gear to mop up other fleeing suspects.\n\nThe prosecutor, Inspector Olatunde Kehinde, asked the court to remand the defendant in custody pending the outcome of investigation and the advice of Department of Public Prosecution (DPP).\n\nPresiding Magistrate, Mrs. A.A. Oshoniyi, ordered the remand of Abdullahi pending the outcome of DPP\u2019s advice.\n\nIn another breath, THISDAY has gathered that the recent mop up of suspects in Lagos had spurred the army to intensify moves to uncover all probable sleeper cells in the state and Ogun, both under same jurisdiction.\n\nGiven the continuous onslaught in the North-east, the dislodged terrorists have continued to move down to Lagos and other South-west states to hide as they hatch further plans to carry out their nefarious activities. In the past five years, there have been several attempts by terrorists to wreak havoc on Lagos, especially, volatile areas like Apapa with tank farms, which were foiled by security agencies. There have also been alleged plans to blow up the Third Mainland Bridge.\n\nIntelligence made available to THISDAY indicated that the dislodged terrorists from the North were scattered across Lagos.\n\nLagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, once confirmed intelligence reports about the growing number of sleeper cells across the state. Odumosu had, however, reassured citizens that the police and other security agencies were on top of their game to infiltrate the groups, dislodge and arrest them.\n\nTHISDAY\u2019s independent checks at the Kirikiri Maximum Correctional Centre attested to the large number of Boko Haram suspects, who had been tried and sentenced for their acts against humanity.\n\nSome of the aborted attacks were re-echoed by the Department of State Services (DSS), which in a recent memo to the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), dated November 25, 2021, raised the alarm over plans by insurgents to attack military bases and border towns.\n\nIn the alert addressed to the Customs Area Controller, Ogun Area Command, Abeokuta, the DSS advised customs and other security agencies in the country to put counter-measures in place.\n\nTitled, \u201cPlans by insurgents to launch attacks on military bases in various border communities,\u201d the letter, signed by the DSS Director, Ogun State Command, M.B. Abdullahi, said, \u201cAvailable intelligence indicates plans by insurgents and criminal elements to carry out simultaneous attacks on military posts and bases in various border communities across the nation anytime from now.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cIn view of the foregoing and the likelihood, such attacks not limited to the military personnel only, all law enforcement and security agencies with operational bases at border communities are advised to take note of the above threat and emplace countermeasures with emphasis on personal security of operatives to frustrate the planned attack, please.\u201d\n\nIn Jalingo, Yahaya was given a security brief on the brigade\u2019s area of responsibility by the Commander 6 Brigade, Brig Gen Hillary Mabeokwu.\n\nThe army chief pledged to provide requisite logistics for the full take-off of the new brigade. He later commissioned the newly constructed 6 Brigade Garrison office and Quarter Guard, before proceeding to inspect the proposed permanent site of the brigade.\n\nAn army statement said the Chief of Army Staff expressed appreciation to the government and people of Taraba State for providing the Nigerian Army land to build the brigade.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Between August 2021 and October 2021, the price increased by 47%.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, Oyo State has the highest average cost of cooking gas as of October 2021.\n\nThe graph above shows the increase in the price of cooking gas since November 2019.\n\nTo see the top ten states by average cost of cooking gas as of October 2021, kindly follow this link.\n\nThis is brought to you courtesy of our Intelligence by Techpoint team; for more insights like this, you can follow them here and here\n\nAfrica-focused Sanicle raises $160k\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSanicle\u2019s website\n\nLast week, women-focused startup, Sanicle (Padbanque) received an impact investment of $160,000 from Platform Capital,\n\nCo-founded by Chaste Inegbedion (Chief Period Officer), Roxanne Stewart (CEO), and Sage Oni (CTO), Sanicle officially launched in January 2021 with a plan to demystify periods by promoting period literacy while destigmatising women in menstruation.\n\nIts primary offerings, however, include a period box, a book, and a board game called Period Genie. The Period Box, which contains period essentials, and the book (Period Passport) authored by one of the co-founders are available on the business\u2019 eCommerce platform, sanicle.shop.\n\nThe impact fund, as the CPO revealed, would be deployed to make the eCommerce platform more robust and evolve the game to become a community to period management.\n\nWith more technology positioned towards period tracking, Sanicle\u2019s end game is to make period literacy mainstream to all genders, and not only women.\n\nYou probably didn\u2019t see this\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nFound this gem of an artiste, thanks to a friend this weekend.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we introduced our latest series, The Next Frontier, and talked about the shape of the edtech industry in the future. This week, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, we\u2019ll be talking about fintechs.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech industry is one of the largest and probably the most advanced. Having produced five of Africa\u2019s seven unicorns and some of the largest funding rounds we\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s probably a safe assumption.\n\nBut what\u2019s the next big thing? What kind of models can we expect to see? This week, we talked with Adedeji Olowe (Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria) and Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO.\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t necessarily tell the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next big thing\n\nThe very first question we asked Olowe was the level of growth the industry has achieved so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had significant growth so far. But the interesting bit to me is not where we are coming from, it\u2019s how far we still have to grow. So whatever is exciting you about fintech right now, you haven\u2019t seen anything. I don\u2019t think the space has grown up to 2-3% of its capacity.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, using the example of Nigeria\u2019s average transaction size for transfer, he believes transfers would be free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a level where transfers of a certain amount would be free, and after that, we can actually bring in financial inclusion for everybody. So you will now see transactions like, \u2018Oh, I want to send \u20a650 to Ogheneruemu,\u2019 \u2018 I want to spend \u20a6100 to buy bole,\u2018 and then it would be free.\u201d\n\nOf course, he agreed that there would be a limit to transferable amounts, putting the benchmark at \u20a610,000 weekly. But in his words, \u201cat that level, it would just become explosive.\u201d\n\nHow soon will this happen? Well, he believes this could happen as soon as next year, helping to drive Nigeria\u2019s sluggish cashless policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the first question Techpoint asked Hassan centred around the direction the industry would be going in. His answer, three phases of growth.\n\n\u201cI believe that there will be a lot of regulatory involvement in the next two to three years. And what this means is that we would see the regulators actually actively helping the ecosystem. I\u2019m someone that supports regulation because where there\u2019s regulation, I feel like there would be a lot of innovation as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlowe had a similar opinion, albeit somewhat different. \u201cI know that people don\u2019t like CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) regulating prices. But the funny thing is that CBN\u2019s pricing has done more to expand the market than anything else.\u201d\n\nFor some context, at some point, transfers in Nigeria cost \u20a6100; now, they cost between \u20a610 and \u20a650.\n\nThe second phase, according to Hassan, however, would be a hotbed of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nThe third phase is a companies-funding-companies stage.\n\n\u201cWe would see more fintech companies, funding more fintech companies. And what this means is that you could see a company like Mono investing in other interesting companies that are, for example, using our infrastructure. We\u2019ve seen this happen with Visa and Mastercard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already happening, but people are not talking about it. But I think it will be more public next year, and this is mostly because of the traction we\u2019ve seen in the fintech industry.\u201d\n\nFor him, all of the attention the fintech industry is and would be getting would be very helpful to aid other industries in getting more funding. Olowe agrees.\n\nNew technology or new business models?\n\nCurrently, the fintech industry is very API and cloud computing driven. However, Olowe and Hassan believe that rather than disruptive technologies, it would be a more disruptive business model.\n\nCiting companies like Inflow Finance and Sproutly Nigeria, Hassan says infrastructure like Mono\u2019s would be the base of novel business models.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy sense is that we would see more business models, more developers, and more interesting companies coming up because of infrastructure like us. I mean, if you look at it, in 2016 and 2017, Paystack made PiggyVest possible. Without Paystack, PiggyVest wouldn\u2019t be a company.\n\n\u201cThat was a new business model that wasn\u2019t available in Nigeria before Paystack. So I think that kind of emergence of new business models and successful companies is what we will see in the next couple of years. And that\u2019s what excites me most.\u201d\n\nFor example, a business model that enables seamless confirmation of transactions or rounds up the remainder of every transaction made into money that can be put into savings.\n\nBut maybe some technology\n\nFor Olowe, apart from free transfers, one aspect he believes has been severely overlooked is contactless cards. Interestingly, according to him, banks have been given out contactless cards in the past year.\n\nA quick Google search reveals that a contactless card would look something like this with a sideways WiFi signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by kreatikar on Pixabay\n\nTo confirm this, we did a quick experiment using both old and new debit cards. We found that the new cards had sideways WiFi signals while the old cards didn\u2019t.\n\nEssentially, a contactless card can be used without being handed to PoS merchants or shop attendants. You can place it directly on the machine, and your transaction is immediately approved.\n\nSo, why are they not being used? Olowe gives two reasons: acceptance and payments.\n\n\u201cThe only challenge is that the amount to spend is not on those cards. Number two, the PoS needs to accept contactless cards, and those two things need to meet each other.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olowe, these contactless cards are supposed to act as a limited store of value. For example, the Cowry cards used for payment in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Lagos State. You have to put some money in the card to use it, essentially transferring a specific amount to be used for payment.\n\nSo, for this to work, you need to transfer money for use into the card itself and not your bank account, and then readers for these cards must be available.\n\nMerging the old with the new\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) changed its name to Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO). According to Group CEO Segun Agbaje, \u201cWe believe that a holding company structure will allow us to take advantage of new business opportunities in the emerging competitive landscape and strengthen our earnings base.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been no outright moves, there have been speculations that this signals the company\u2019s shift into a more technological arena.\n\nWe asked Olowe what he thought of banks playing in the fintech space in the future, and he believes it would be pretty impossible.\n\n\u201cTraditional banks would go into fintechs, and they would fail miserably, and that is not a guess. Why? Because they don\u2019t have the DNA to run a fintech. Banks can\u2019t be agile. Banks don\u2019t place customer service, user experience as paramount. Forget about them talking about it. It\u2019s not just part of them.\u201d\n\nHe says it is doubly worse for traditional institutions in the insurance space.\n\nInterestingly, Hassan disagrees, and he believes this could mean better and stiffer competition and even more acquisitions.\n\nOther predictions\n\nEvery week, I receive a newsletter from Samora Kariuki called Frontier Fintech. I first subscribed in August 2021. Since then, he has talked about several things like the modernisation of banks, the possibility of an African super app \u2014 one of my favourites \u2014 and digital bank valuations.\n\nIn last week\u2019s newsletter, Kariuki made some interesting predictions, which you can find here.\n\nIntrigued? Then you\u2019d love to be at Techpoint Build 2021, where discussions like this and concerning other industries would be held.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 has been a good year for African startups. This year, the continent has already minted five unicorns. After the lull in investment activities in 2020, investments in African startups are on track to exceed the $2 billion record set in 2019.\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, the bulk of the funding has gone to fintech startups with the fragmented nature of the continent\u2019s financial system providing an opportunity for innovative founders and investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurin Hainy, CEO and Co-Founder of FairMoney\n\nAs of October 2021, Africa: The Big Deal reported that 57% of the amounts raised which was slightly above $1.6 billion has gone to fintech startups. One such fintech is FairMoney, a digital bank that currently offers lending services in Nigeria, India, and France.\n\nIn July, the startup raised a $42 million Series B led by Tiger Global to consolidate its position in India and Nigeria. This follows its $10 million Series A round raised in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, November 18, 2021, the company hosted investors, the media, and industry leaders at its first investor conference. Following a brief introduction, the CEO and co-founder, Laurin Hainy took to the stage to share the startup\u2019s journey since inception.\n\nIn his welcome address, Hainy revealed that the conference was \u201cconceived to provide an avenue for capital market operators, investors, fintech players, regulators, industry associations, and other financial industry participants to discuss the role of digital financial models in providing meaningful financial inclusion for Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Patryk Kalisz, Head of Controlling and Reporting, FairMoney; Siddharth Kulkarni,\n\nExecutive Sponsor, Lending, Nigeria at FairMoney; Nicolas Berthozat, Co-Founder\n\nFairMoney and Juris Rieksts-Riekstin\u0161, Head of Risk, Nigeria, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s\n\nconference.\n\nIn Nigeria, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals and small businesses without collateral. This is the segment FairMoney serves and Yaw Mante, the startup\u2019s Head of Finance revealed that not only have they been able to offer loans to these people, but they have also had a very low default rate.\n\nHe disclosed that in order to do this, the startup makes use of data science and underwriting algorithms to predict how likely an individual is to default on their loan before deciding how much risk they are able to take.\n\nIn the absence of data on users, the startup may initially give such customers smaller amounts to gauge their ability to repay the loans. Depending on how the borrower performs, they are then able to offer higher amounts to them. So far, in 2021, the startup has given out loans worth more than \u20a670 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Oluwatomide Oluwole, Finance Manager, FairMoney; Henry Obiekea, VP Capital\n\nMarkets, FairMoney; Yaw Mante, Head, Finance \u2013 FairMoney and James Edeh, Head,\n\nCompliance, FairMoney, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s conference.\n\nHaving recently acquired a microfinance license, Mante explained the reason for that, \u201cLoans are not the only products that our customers need. They need to be able to pay, they need to be able to save, they need to be able to invest. The way that we think about our business is that we look at our customers, we look at what they need and we try to work with them to provide that.\n\nIn order to do all of these things, we need to upscale our license and hence why we acquired the microfinance license. Over time, we\u2019ll look at our options to continue to provide more complex products and services to our customers.\u201d\n\nWith several players in the fintech industry, Mante discussed the startup\u2019s evolution towards a multi-product full-fledged digital bank. \u201cOur unique selling point is we want to be able to provide all of the banking needs of our customers but we start with the product we think is the most pressing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a lot of startups, a Series B is often followed by expansion. However, Hainy says FairMoney would consolidate its position in its current markets. \u201cI think we\u2019re very excited about the opportunities in Nigeria and India. They are two out of the four biggest countries in the world and they\u2019re very underserved.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Obiekea, VP Capital Markets, FairMoney\n\nHe also pointed out that while the fintech space in India and Nigeria possess some similarities, there are more people in India who possess some level of digital identification compared to Nigeria.\n\nThere was also a panel session on the role of fintech startups in financial inclusion in Nigeria. It featured Nicole Yembra, Founder and Managing Partner of Chrysalis Capital, Sonnie Ayere, GMD/CEO, DLM Capital Group, Yaw Mante, Head of Finance, FairMoney, and Bayo Rotimi, Managing Director of Greenwich Merchant Bank.\n\nDespite the progress recorded by fintech startups in the country, the jury is still out on how much impact they really have with the vast majority of the country still lacking access to the financial system. Hainy sees this as a challenge and believes that FairMoney is perfectly positioned to solve this challenge.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If we do not do something about controlling our population growth, there will be a huge gap between our capacity to narrow the growth rate and our development.\n\n\u201cYes, we could turn the 200 million-plus people we have today into a huge economic asset if we manage that growth. If we don\u2019t and allow it to grow without proper planning, we will continue to play catch-up for decades to come.\n\n\u201cFor us in government, it is a big risk that we must now begin to address and put our acts together. We believe in what you are doing. From that start point, we believe in what you are doing and will need guidance and support on how to make sure that this issue becomes prominent on the agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s not taking the place it needs to take in our conversations about our development. One of the roles we expect and hope you will help us to play is just getting this debate about our population control on the agenda,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor noted, \u201cFor us in Edo, it\u2019s about our people. It is about capacity, education and health, which is at the base. We have strengthened our basic education. The kids are now learning, our teachers are motivated and there are significant outcomes in our learning process.\n\n\u201cWe are pushing the same model in our healthcare space. Thank you so much for the push for vaccine manufacturing. It is so important. As a country, we must build our capacity. The pandemic will be with us for a while. We can\u2019t continue to be dependent.\n\n\u201cWe need help to carry out our own subnational census. We just commenced a 30-year planning process. We cannot do socio-economic planning, as well as our physical and urban planning without data. While working on the national population census, we also have to commence our own census with our planning process,\u201d Obaseki said.\n\nEarlier, the UN under Secretary-General and Executive Director, UNPF, Dr. Natalia Kanem, commended the governor for establishing a special court for prosecuting offenders of gender-based violence in the state.\n\n...",

About a year ago, I had the honour of opening one of their flagship stores in Lagos State and a remarkable architectural piece in Lekki where they sell only agricultural produce.\u201d\n\nOutlining the gains of commissioning the cashew factory in the state, the governor said, \u201cFirst, you will recall that as a government, we said we are going to create jobs for our people and made it clear that it is not the government that creates the jobs but the private sector. But for them to create these jobs successfully, the government must support them, create the enabling environment and help them reduce risks to make profits and ensure that their businesses are sustainable.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cSecondly, the government identified the areas the jobs will come from, and on top of the list is agriculture. We are very pleased with the bold step and initiative Farmforte has taken in the state.\n\n\u201cThirdly, my administration will continue to encourage more investments in Edo State as investment does well here because it is a state of the progressives. Investments here are protected by the people themselves. I encourage younger men and women to come into agriculture as there are immense opportunities in the sector.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwith the facility in the state, the government will encourage farmers in Edo North and other areas where cashew is grown to farm and harvest the fruits, while the nuts will be processed.\u201d\n\nObaseki noted, \u201cThe key risk is to get enough cashew seeds. We would like to work with you as a government to encourage our farmers with improved seeds and off-take agreements to encourage them to cultivate and grow more. I would like to work with you to build capacity and encourage farmers to grow cash crops as you will give them a price for their produce.\n\n\u201cWe want Edo to be number one when it comes to cashew production. It is just one of the many products that we will be supporting because it has an easy market. We are proud of what you are doing here in the state, as we encourage more young people to be enterprising. My administration is ready to continue to support you as you do your businesses and grow wealth.\u201d\n\nThe Co-Chief Executive Officer, Farmforte, Mr. Osazuwa Osayi said the facility will produce 5,400 metric tons of cashew per annum, noting that the produce will be processed in the factory in Edo State and will positively affect between 2,000 to 3,000 smallholder farmers that grow cashew in the state.\n\n...",

          "title": "THE 3,906 INMATES STILL ON THE RUN AND AREGBESOLA \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe attacks on military formations and correctional facilities do not mean that the ministers of defence and interior have abandoned their duties. Those that abandoned more than 25 armoured tanks purchased by Aregbesola in Osun are accusing the minister of abandoning his duty at the ministry of interior. I want to put the records straight that the rehabilitation and upgrading of correctional centres have not been included in Nigerian budgets since 2015.\n\nIf resources are made available today, Rauf Aregbesola will rehabilitate and upgrade correctional facilities to meet 21st century standard across Nigeria to prevent future jailbreaks. Rauf Aregbesola, Minister of Interior has ambition plans for the upgrade and rehabilitation of correctional facilities across the states to prevent future jailbreaks. Recently, the committee on appropriations was mandated by House of Representatives to include the rehabilitation and upgrade of the correctional centres in the 2022 budget estimates. The House noted with concern the recent cases of jailbreaks, saying that it was dangerous for such convicted criminals to be let loose. It was concerned that if adequate steps were not taken to re-arrest the escaped convicts and provide adequate security in correctional centres, some of the criminals who escaped may become more emboldened to the point of forming terrorist groups that would put the country in jeopardy.\n\nAregbesola has plans to rehabilitate and upgrade the Correctional Centres with latest and sophisticated arms such as GPMG and automatic machine guns and other security electric fence wires attached with shocking gadgets and highly sophisticated CCTV Cameras provided there is budgetary provision.\n\nThe federal government has disclosed that it would establish six new modern custodial facilities in the six geo-political zones in the country. The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, disclosed this in Kano while inspecting the ongoing model maximum security custodial facility project at Janguza in Kumbotso Local Government Area of the state. Aregbesola said the project was part of projects initiated by the federal government to reform the correctional service. A shift to prioritizing rehabilitation programs would address the root cause of crime and lead to an overall more effective prison system that discourages people from recommitting crimes. Thus, it is important to focus on implementing policies that would prevent inmates from engaging in criminal acts once released. As it stands now, the current correctional system is doing a horrendous job: over 75 percent of released inmates are re-incarcerated within five years of discharge from prison. Thus, it is clear that punishment is ineffective. Prioritizing and strengthening rehabilitation programs would prepare inmates to be better members of society and be less likely to commit crimes again. There are various programs that have been implemented that have shown tremendous success. He said: \u201cWe are actualising our commitment to reform the correctional service that we have in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Aregbesola, \u201cWhat we have here is a model of what we expect to have nationwide. Here, we have a 3,000 custodial facility, which we plan to replicate in each of the six geo-political zones in the country. \u201cIt is designed for inmates awaiting trial, a petty, medium and maximum security facility,\u201d the minister said.\n\nAregbesola, who has expressed satisfaction with the project, commended President Buhari for his support to the correctional service reforms aimed at enhancing its operations.\n\nIn his remarks, the Controller-General, Nigeria Correctional Service (NCoS), Mr Ahmad Jafaru said that the project was designed with court, dormitories, school, hospital, skills acquisition centre and a mosque, among others. He said the project would be commissioned this year, adding that the ancient Kurmawa Maximum Prison had been upgraded into a rehabilitation centre.\n\nRECENTLY, the Minister of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, made a statement over the frightening attack on correctional centres across the country. He declared that no fewer than 3,906 inmates were still on the run after a number of jailbreaks in parts of the country, but that the Federal Government had the capacity and wherewithal to recapture the fleeing inmates, including convicted hardened criminals. \u201cHow long can they continue to run from the state? The state is a patient bird. You can run, but you can\u2019t hide. We have their biometrics; whenever and wherever they appear to transact business, their cover will be blown,\u201d he said.\n\nThere have been at least eight jailbreaks in the last one year, and a large proportion of the inmates remain on the run. This scenario speaks volumes about the performance of the Federal Government in ensuring the general security of life and property in the country. Between 2017 and July this year, at least 4,307 inmates were believed to have escaped from correctional centres. In 2021 alone, more than 2000 inmates were freed in two jailbreaks. The figures included 240 inmates that were freed after gunmen invaded a detention facility in Kogi State with explosives in September 2021. On April 5, about 2000 inmates were freed in Imo State when gunmen blew up a correctional facility and later attacked the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the state police command and freed a number of suspects. There were also cases of attempted jailbreaks at the Ikoyi Correctional Centre in Lagos State and a similar facility in Bauchi State, as well as Ubiaja in Edo State.\n\nAccording to Aregbesola, biometrics of all inmates in the country has been captured, and it is the hope of the Federal Government that this exercise will aid the tracking and re-arrest of the escapees. The former governor of Osun State stressed that the recent attacks on some correctional facilities in the country are a reflection of the insecurity in Nigeria. He explained that the government is on the trail of some of the attackers with a couple of them arrested in Imo State. The minister assured Nigerians that a ministerial task force will soon be inaugurated to enforce the re-arrest of all escapees and their collaborators.\n\nAregbesola\u2019s comments come a few weeks after gunmen attacked the Medium Security Custodial Centre in the Abolongo area of Oyo State with an unconfirmed number of inmates escaping from the facility. A few hours after the siege, the Federal Government said operatives had recaptured some of the inmates. The Interior Minister in his reaction to the incident assured Nigerians that \u201cthe Federal Government will pursue not just those who attacked our facility, but those who have escaped lawful custody\u201d.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes via inwalomhe.donald@yahoo.com\n\n...",

          "text": "A member of the Lagos panel on police brutality constituted to probe the Lekki shootings of October 20, 2020, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa (SAN), has said that the EndSARS panels set up by state governments across the country are legal and can probe the brutality and extrajudicial killings committed by members of the Nigeria Police Force and the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe senior advocate said the judicial panels were set up at the behest of the Federal Government, through the National Economic Council, and therefore cannot be termed illegal because the findings of some of the panels aren\u2019t in favour of the government of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAdegboruwa\u2019s intervention is in response to the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo who on Sunday, dismissed the EndSARS panel set up by the Lagos State Government and the report it presented to the state government recently.\n\nKeyamo had said the panel was illegal because it was out of the jurisdiction of the panel to investigate the activities of Federal Government institutions and officials such as the Police and the Army.\n\nBut in a statement on Monday titled, \u2018The Legality Of #EndSARS Panels\u2019, Adegboruwa said, \u201cThe Federal Government has recently muted the idea that all the Judicial Panels of Inquiry set up by the various States across the Federation, especially that of Lagos State, are illegal.\n\n\u201cIt has never been part of our legal system in Nigeria, for a plaintiff who approached the court in the first instance, to turn around to challenge the legality or jurisdiction of the court,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe EndSARS Panels were set up at the behest of the Federal Government, through the National Economic Council. In the case of the Lagos Panel, the federal government, through the Nigerian Army, voluntarily submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the Panel, the federal government called witnesses, it tendered documents and it made very lengthy presentations.\n\n\u201cA party cannot approbate and reprobate at the same time. Thus, a party who initiated a process and willingly and actively participated in that process, cannot turn around, after judgment, to plead illegality or absence of jurisdiction, simply because the outcome is unfavourable. We must strengthen our institutions to make them work.\n\n\u201cWhile we all await the White Paper from the Lagos State Government, it is important for government to build trust in the people in all its dealings and utterances.\u201d\n\nRecall that the Justice Doris Okuwobi-led Lagos panel on November 15, 2021, submitted its report to the Lagos State Government, indicting the police and the military in the killing of at least nine persons at the Lekki tollgate on October 2020, 2020.\n\nThe 309-page leaked report stated, \u201cThe atrocious maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters while sitting on the floor and waving their Nigerian flags and while singing the National Anthem can be equated to a massacre in context.\u201d\n\nLagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who received the report, said he had constituted a Committee to bring forward a White Paper within the next two weeks to be considered by the Lagos State Executive Council.\n\nUnited States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, on a two-day official visit to Nigeria recently, had said that the submission of the report by the Lagos panel was an important step towards accountability for killings and rights abuses allegedly committed by soldiers and policemen.\n\nBlinken had met with the Nigerian President at Aso Rock in Abuja, and Buhari had said the Federal Government was waiting on Lagos State and other state governments to come up with their conclusions.\n\nBut Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed subsequently said, \u201cIt is simply incredible that a judicial panel set up to investigate an incident has submitted a report laden with allegations, the same allegations it was set up to investigate in the first instance.\n\n\u201cInstead of sitting for all of one year, the panel could have just compiled social media tales by the moonlight on the incident and submitted, saving taxpayers\u2019 funds and everyone\u2019s time. That report is nothing but the triumph of fake news and the intimidation of a silent majority by a vociferous lynch mob",

          "title": "Malabu scandal: Documents reveal Seplat chairman, ABC Orjiako\u2019s role",
          "text": "Ambroise Orjiako played the role of a top adviser to Dan Etete in the infamous Malabu scandal, in which the Nigerian government controversially handed a lucrative oil field to Mr Etete, who sold it to Shell and Eni and shared part of the proceeds with some senior government officials.\n\nNew court records show that between 2009 and 2011, Mr Orjiako, who is the chairman of Seplat Energy, Nigeria\u2019s biggest quoted oil and gas company, took part in several meetings between Mr Etete, Shell and Eni, where they negotiated the amount to be paid to Mr Etete for Oil Prospecting Licence (OPL) 245.\n\nMr Orjiako, who previously led Shebah Petroleum, helped arrange at least one of such meetings, and informed Shell officials that the attorney general at the time, Mohammed Adoke, was willing to meet with them to move the discussions forward.\n\nHe attended a meeting on October 6, 2009, alongside Mr Etete, Umaru Bature (a former member of the House of Representatives who prosecutors said represented the interest of Aliyu Gusau, former National Security Adviser), Peter Robinson (Shell\u2019s commercial vice president for sub-Saharan Africa) and Guy Colegate (senior business advisor of Shell International Exploration & Production) where OPL 245 was discussed.\n\nIn the end, Helko Nigeria Ltd., a company in which Mr Orjiako was director, got $2.2 million from the booty.\n\nThe revelations are contained in documents filed by Agip, a subsidiary of the Italian oil major, Eni, at a U.S. court, and obtained by PREMIUM TIMES.\n\nMr Orjiako could not be reached for this report. Phone calls and email messages to his firm, Seplat, were not responded to.\n\nAbacha Connection\n\nThe Malabu case, possibly Nigeria\u2019s biggest government-backed corporate heist, began in 1998 when Mr Etete was petroleum minister under Sani Abacha.\n\nAlongside the kleptocrat dictator, they seized the OPL 245 and awarded it to Malabu, a company set up by Mr Etete and Mr Abacha\u2019s son.\n\nMr Etete assumed control of the firm after Mr Abacha\u2019s death, and controversy over the ownership of the block and the company lingered for years with the Olusegun Obasanjo administration at one point revoking the award, triggering legal battles.\n\nThe Jonathan government eventually recognised Mr Etete as the owner of the block, and helped negotiate its transfer to Shell and Eni for $1.3 billion. The windfall was shared between Mr Etete and top cabinet members in the government, court records show.

Shell would then pay Mr Etete for the 40 per cent equity.\n\nThe oil firm demanded that its payment take into account the funds it already expended on the field (exploration and signature bonus, together $600 million \u2013 according to the court document).\n\nThe talks reached a stalemate when Mr Etete turned down Shell\u2019s initial offer of $300 million. Mr Etete said other investors were interested in the oil block and held talks with Eni separately. He also rejected Eni\u2019s offer.\n\n\u201cEtete asked Shell to come up with a figure for what they would pay for the 40% farm-in.

          "text": "Ambroise Orjiako played the role of a top adviser to Dan Etete in the infamous Malabu scandal, in which the Nigerian government controversially handed a lucrative oil field to Mr Etete, who sold it to Shell and Eni and shared part of the proceeds with some senior government officials.\n\nNew court records show that between 2009 and 2011, Mr Orjiako, who is the chairman of Seplat Energy, Nigeria\u2019s biggest quoted oil and gas company, took part in several meetings between Mr Etete, Shell and Eni, where they negotiated the amount to be paid to Mr Etete for Oil Prospecting Licence (OPL) 245.\n\nMr Orjiako, who previously led Shebah Petroleum, helped arrange at least one of such meetings, and informed Shell officials that the attorney general at the time, Mohammed Adoke, was willing to meet with them to move the discussions forward.\n\nHe attended a meeting on October 6, 2009, alongside Mr Etete, Umaru Bature (a former member of the House of Representatives who prosecutors said represented the interest of Aliyu Gusau, former National Security Adviser), Peter Robinson (Shell\u2019s commercial vice president for sub-Saharan Africa) and Guy Colegate (senior business advisor of Shell International Exploration & Production) where OPL 245 was discussed.\n\nIn the end, Helko Nigeria Ltd., a company in which Mr Orjiako was director, got $2.2 million from the booty.\n\nThe revelations are contained in documents filed by Agip, a subsidiary of the Italian oil major, Eni, at a U.S. court, and obtained by PREMIUM TIMES.\n\nMr Orjiako could not be reached for this report. Phone calls and email messages to his firm, Seplat, were not responded to.\n\nAbacha Connection\n\nThe Malabu case, possibly Nigeria\u2019s biggest government-backed corporate heist, began in 1998 when Mr Etete was petroleum minister under Sani Abacha.\n\nAlongside the kleptocrat dictator, they seized the OPL 245 and awarded it to Malabu, a company set up by Mr Etete and Mr Abacha\u2019s son.\n\nMr Etete assumed control of the firm after Mr Abacha\u2019s death, and controversy over the ownership of the block and the company lingered for years with the Olusegun Obasanjo administration at one point revoking the award, triggering legal battles.\n\nThe Jonathan government eventually recognised Mr Etete as the owner of the block, and helped negotiate its transfer to Shell and Eni for $1.3 billion. The windfall was shared between Mr Etete and top cabinet members in the government, court records show. Shell and Eni and their officials have been tried in Europe for their roles in the transaction.\n\nWhile it was known Mr Orjiako had links to the Malabu case, reported by PREMIUM TIMES for years, it was not exactly clear what his role was \u2013 until now.\n\nMr Orjiako announced last week he will be stepping down from Seplat Energy\u2019s board of directors in May 2022.\n\nThe board of Seplat Energy thanked him for his \u201cstrategic vision, drive and limitless energy\u201d.\n\nMr Orjiako said, \u201cThe past 12 years at Seplat Energy has been exhilarating for me.

The report that some of the bad elements, including bandits and kidnappers, have relocated to Kwara and Kogi states is alarming.\n\n\u201cThe Kwara State government needs to improve on the security situation in the state by using the Amotekun structure to combat the growing spate of insecurity in the state.\n\n\u201cThe success recorded in securing the South-west through Amotekun is encouraging and the security initiative is yielding positive outcome.\u201d\n\nGang leader killed\n\nAlso, Police special forces have killed a notorious kidnap gang leader, Yellow Magaji, after raiding their hideouts in Kaduna, just as military special forces killed the gang leader of last Sunday\u2019s attack on Kaduna-Abuja highway.\n\nThe bandits had terrorised Kaduna-Abuja highway in a spate of attacks killing a former FCDA Director, Alhaji Kabiru Hamidu and abducted several others Sunday and Monday.\n\nThey, however, met their waterloo when the military forces took the battle to their camps in the forest, killing their leader and several others.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Kaduna state, ASP Muhammed Jalige, said this on behalf of the Commissioner of Police Abdullahi Mudasiru.\n\nJalige said: \u201cOn November 24, 2021, operatives of the Kaduna Police Command in collaboration with the Federal Intelligence Bureau and Special Tactical Squad Force headquarters, Abuja, raided a facility at Ungwan Maijero area of Sabon Tasha in Chikun local government area of Kaduna state.\n\n\u201cThe raid, which was on the directive of the Commissioner of Police, Mudassiru Abdullahi, acting on credible intelligence, was carried out against, a facility \u201cknown as Sir Joe Guest Inn located at NO.8 Sajo Street Unguwan Maigero area of Sabon Tasha in Chikun LGA of Kaduna state where a report of suspected bandits were said to have lodged.\n\n\u201cWhile the cautiously coordinated raid was ongoing, the suspected armed bandits on sensing danger took to their heels shooting sporadically leading to a gun duel with the operatives. One notorious bandit popularly called Yellow Magaji a.k.a Arushe was wounded in the shootout, whereas his equally notorious partner Yellow Ashana and others escaped with bullet wounds.\n\n\u201cThe wounded bandit, Yellow Magaji was among a syndicate of bandits terrorising Kaduna-Abuja highway of recent, was thereafter taken to Barau Dikko Teaching Hospital for possible resuscitation to obtain useful information but was confirmed dead on arrival by a medical doctor.\n\n\u201cAfter an extensive search of the scene, the operatives recovered one AK47 rifle loaded with 23 rounds of 7.62 X 39mm live ammunition, 14 expended shells and one Boxer motorcycle belonging to the bandits. The owner of the facility who harbours the criminals was equally arrested for questioning.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police salutes the courage of the operatives and most importantly the source of the valid information. He urged other members of the public to assist security operatives with prompt information as he assures them of absolute confidentiality while acting on the intel.\n\n\u201cThe CP urged law abiding citizens to be vigilant and security conscious of their immediate environment.\u201d\n\nMilitary neutralise bandits too\n\nMeanwhile, following the spate of attacks on Kaduna-Abuja highway, Military Special Forces chased dozens of bandits terrorising the highway, including leader of last Sunday attack on the highway to their hideouts in Kaduna forests and killed them.\n\nThe onslaught on the bandits and kidnappers, according to sources, led to the killing of the leader of the bandits, who killed former Director of the FCT and abducted his police orderly and many others on the highway last Sunday, and several other bandits during a fierce battle between the Special Forces and the bandits.\n\nCombat ready security agents were seen on motorbikes and other vehicles; heading to the forests in search of more bandits to neutralise as security agents takes the battle to the bandits, further into their hideouts.\n\nZaria LG workers freed\n\nAnd also from the Kaduna state Police Command came the cherry news that 10 out of the 13 abducted staff of the Zaria local government council have been released.\n\nPolice image maker in the state, ASP Jalige told journalists Sunday in Zaria that the kidnapped staff were released Saturday, adding that efforts were on to ensure the release of the remaining three victims.\n\nHowever, the PPRO declined comment on whether ransom was paid to secure the release the abducted staff.\n\nDirector, Education and Social Development, Mrs Deborah Mugu, her deputy, Dalhatu Aliyu-Awai, and 11 other staff members of Zaria local government were abducted by gunmen.\n\nThe staff was abducted at Kidandan, Giwa local government Kaduna state, on their way for a condolence visit to Dogara Abdullahi, a staff, who lost his father.\n\nA family source who craved anonymity, said the staff members were released after payment of N40m ransom to the kidnappers.\n\nHe added that family members of the victims contributed money to pay the ransom.\n\nHe added that the kidnappers did not release three of the abducted staff because some conditions for the release was N40m and three brand new motorcycles.\n\n\u201cOnly the money that was taken to them, that is why they refused to release the three staff.\n\n\u201cThe freed victims are yet to be united with their families because they were taken to an undisclosed hospital for medical examination,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nWhen contacted, chairman, Zaria local government, Alhaji Aliyu Ibrahim, said he cannot add anything to what the family source told NAN.\n\nAsked whether the council would provide the new motorcycle to get the three remaining staff released, Ibrahim said: \u201cFall back to your source.\u201d (NAN)\n\nArms supplier in Zamfara\n\nSimilarly, Zamfara state police command tactical operatives in collaboration with FIB/STS led by DSP Hussaini Gimba, arrested 30- year-old woman, Fatima Lawali in Gusau, the state capital, for allegedly supplying arms to bandits.\n\nCommissioner of Police Ayuba N.

          "text": "Putting in place travel bans that target Africa attacks global solidarity, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said through its regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti.\n\nMs Moeti, in a statement Sunday evening, said travel restrictions may play a role in slightly reducing the spread of COVID-19 but place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods.\n\n\u201cWith the Omicron variant now detected in several regions of the world, putting in place travel bans that target Africa attacks global solidarity. COVID-19 constantly exploits our divisions. We will only get the better of the virus if we work together for solutions,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Ms Moeti, \u201cif restrictions are implemented, they should not be unnecessarily invasive or intrusive, and should be scientifically based, according to the International Health Regulations which is a legally binding instrument of international law recognized by over 190 nations.\u201d\n\nShe commended the transparency of South African and Botswana adding that they shared life-saving public health information.\n\n\u201cThe speed and transparency of the South African and Botswana governments in informing the world of the new variant is to be commended. WHO stands with African countries which had the courage to boldly share life-saving public health information, helping protect the world against the spread of COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis week, nations will be joining a special session of the World Health Assembly, organised by WHO to discuss how to collectively prepare and respond better to pandemics, building on their commitments to the International Health Regulations,\u201d the official said.\n\nShe urged all countries to respect their legal obligations and implement scientifically based public health actions, adding, \u201cIt is critical that countries which are open with their data are supported as this is the only way to ensure we receive important data in a timely manner.\n\n\u201cWhile investigations continue into the Omicron variant, WHO recommends countries to take a risk-based and scientific approach and put in place measures which can limit its possible spread. Flight bans have been imposed on southern African countries, but so far only two have detected the new variant. Meanwhile, countries in other regions have reported cases of Omicron.\u201d\n\nWHO said it is scaling up support to genomic sequencing in Africa. Sequencing laboratories should have access to adequate human resources and testing reagents to work at full capacity, the statement read.\n\n\u201cWHO is ready to support the additional human resource needs as well as mobilise funds and technical expertise to reinforce COVID-19 response activities including surveillance, treatment and infection prevention and community engagement in southern African countries.\u201d\n\nThe global health agency urged countries to take key steps to enhance efforts to track the Omicron variant, including ensuring their PCR testing equipment can detect it, increasing their sampling and sequencing of COVID-19 test samples by at least double to 150 samples a week from the current average of 75, and review past sequencing samples for potential signs of Omicron.\n\nIn September 2020, WHO and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention launched a network of 12 laboratories to reinforce genome sequencing of the virus. Genomic surveillance has advanced significantly since the start of 2021, with the continent recording a five-fold increase in the number of genomes sequenced.\n\nTravel restrictions\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how countries moved to restrict travels from southern African countries following the emergence of the new variant.\n\nThis newspaper also reported that the Africa CDC frowned at the restrictions. It noted that over the duration of the pandemic, it has observed that imposing bans on travellers from countries where a new variant is reported has not yielded a meaningful outcome.\n\nThe new variant: B.1.1.529\n\nOn November 25, 2021, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa announced the detection of a new variant of the SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, following genomic sequencing. This variant is currently labelled as lineage B.1.1.529.\n\nThe emergence of this new variant coincided with a sudden increase in cases in the Gauteng province of South Africa and was, accordingly, closely monitored by the health authorities in the country.\n\nIt was detected in 77 samples collected between November 12 and 20 from Gauteng Province, four samples from Botswana and one sample in Hong Kong.\n\nThe B.1.1.529 variant, later named Omicron by the WHO, displays multiple mutations across the virus genome, which encodes the spike protein responsible for virus entry into host cells.\n\nSome of the mutations have been detected in previous variants, such as Alpha and Delta, and have been associated with increased transmissibility and immune evasion.\n\nMany of the other identified mutations are not yet well characterised and have not been identified in other currently circulating variants.\n\nMore investigations are underway to determine the possible impact of these mutations on the capacity of the virus to transmit more efficiently, to impact vaccine effectiveness and evade immune response, and/or to cause more severe or milder disease.\n\nConcerns in UK, EU countries\n\nAnd following the discovery of two cases of the super-mutant Omicron Coronavirus variant in the UK, European countries have been put on red alert with the detection of the new variant in Belgium, Botswana, Hong Kong, The Netherlands, Czech Republic, and Israel, sparking global concern and a rush to ban travel.\n\nA report Sunday by the World Health Organisation (WHO), Omicron, the new potentially more contagious variant of the coronavirus has been reported in more European countries after the UK, just days after being identified in South Africa.\n\nMany countries have already imposed travel restrictions on flights from southern Africa amid fears that Omicron variant has the potential to be more resistant to the protection offered by available vaccines.\n\nBut experts say such restrictions may be too late to stop Omicron from circulating globally\n\nCountries are now on high alert even as the coronavirus pandemic has claimed the lives of more than five million people around the world.\n\nIn Czech Republic, the spokesperson of a regional hospital in the northern Czech city of Liberec confirmed the new Omicron strain in a woman.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues from the department of genetics and molecular diagnostics confirmed the strain with 90-per cent probability after a sequence analysis.\u201d\n\nCzech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has said the woman visited Namibia and flew back to the Czech Republic via South Africa and Dubai.\n\n\u201cThe woman was vaccinated and had mild symptoms of the disease,\u201d Babis added.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nThe Minister of State for Labour and Employment, and a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Festus Keyamo, has faulted the judicial panel of inquiry set up to investigate cases of police brutality and SARS-related abuses across the country.\n\nResponding to a question about the position of the government specifically regarding a leaked report by the Lagos judicial panel, the human rights lawyer described the panel as illegal.\n\n\u201cI will not answer this question as a sitting minister,\u201d he said on Channels TV\u2019s Sunday Politics. \u201cI will answer this question as a Senior Advocate of Nigeria and so, I am entitled to my own opinion. This is not the Federal Government\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cFor me, that panel was an illegal panel\u201d.\n\nHe argued that, according to the Tribunal of Enquiry Act of Lagos State, \u201cIt states that the governor has the power to inquire into the conduct of any person, underline any person and then chieftaincy matters and on and on, and then any other matter within that to promote the good of the public.\n\n\u201cHowever, any person that was defined in Section 21 to mean public officers of the states, because when they say any person, any person of the state within the State, officer of the state is defined to me, somebody within the public service of Lagos state of the local government, as the case may be.\n\n\u201cIn other words, it is only people over whom Lagos State has control, that they can inquire into their conduct. If you don\u2019t have control over me, you can inquire into my conduct. Policemen, the Armed Forces, military, are not officers of Lagos states, they are officers of the Federal Government by virtue of the Constitution. It\u2019s only the Federal Government that can control the conduct of policemen and the military. Lagos State is not in control and cannot legislate regarding police matters.\u201d\n\nHis comments come days after the leaked report by the panel indicted the operatives of the Nigerian Army and Police, saying they indeed shot at unarmed protesters.\n\nRELATED:\n\n#EndSARS Panel: Sanwo-Olu Sets Up Four-Member Committee For White Paper Report\n\n#EndSARS Panel Report A Waste Of Time, Taxpayers Money \u2013 Lai Mohammed\n\nWhile the report has yet to be officially released, days later, the panel submitted its findings to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nOne of the reports was on claims of police brutality while the other was on the shooting in the Lekki area of Lagos State on October 20, 2020.\n\nThe Nigerian army had, however, denied shooting live rounds at protesters, telling the judicial panel that only blanks were used.\n\nAs part of efforts to further get to the root of the matter, Governor Sanwo-Olu on Monday, set up a four-member committee led by Lagos State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN) to raise a White Paper on the reports submitted by the judicial panel.\n\nKeyamo\u2019s comments come two days before the committee is expected to submit its recommendations to the National Economic Council (NEC) for discussion and possible implementation.",

Australia\u2019s ASX 200 and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index pared early morning losses later in the day.\n\nTwo-year Treasury yields edged up to 0.55 percent, after falling 14 basis points on Friday in the most significant drop since March last year. Fed fund futures had pushed the first rate rise out by a month or so.\n\nOil prices also bounced $3 a barrel to recoup some of Friday\u2019s shellacking, while the safe-haven yen took a breather after its run higher.\n\nMarcel Thieliant, an economist at Capital Economics in Singapore, told Al Jazeera the implications of the variant for the regional economy were not clear-cut.\n\n\u201cA more transmissible variant could prompt even more disruptions and restrictions to domestic activity, particularly in China given its zero-COVID strategy,\u201d Thieliant said. \u201cAt the same time though, Asian exporters would benefit if the rest of the world imposes renewed restrictions on services spending and goods spending therefore remains strong.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has designated the Omicron strain a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d, but has stressed that it is not yet clear whether it is more severe or transmissible. The world health body has said \u201cpreliminary evidence\u201d suggests the variant may more easily infect people who have recovered from COVID-19 than other strains.\n\nAngelique Coetzee, the South African doctor who alerted the world to the variant, told the BBC on Sunday the symptoms she had seen in patients so far had been \u201cextremely mild\u201d, and she believed the world was at this stage panicking unnecessarily.\n\nDozens of countries have nonetheless shut their borders to the southern part of Africa in response to the variant, with Asia-Pacific nations including Singapore, Australia and Japan implementing or mooting even broader travel restrictions.\n\nTrinh D Nguyen, a senior economist at Natixis, told Al Jazeera the variant posed a risk, but she remained \u201coptimistic\u201d about the region\u2019s reopening and recovery.\n\n\u201cVery little is known about the new variant and there is news that symptoms are milder from South Africa,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cAsia excluding China just made marginal opening up after being suppressed by the Delta variant and markets are cautious, especially tourism exposed economies like Thailand that rely on not just its own opening up but the rest of the world being willing to live with COVID-19, variant or not, given that we now have tools to fight the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe remain optimistic about the region opening up and see this as a risk but hopefully the world has evolved to adopt an endemic strategy as we have more knowledge and tools to fight the virus.\u201d",

But it wants the US to make the first move.\n\nWestern diplomats have warned that time is running out to negotiate a solution because of the significant advances Iran has made in its uranium enrichment programme, which is a possible pathway to a nuclear bomb.\n\nIran insists that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful.\n\nThe talks between Iran and the five countries still party to what is known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) \u2013 China, France, Germany, Russia and the UK \u2013 began in the Austrian capital in April, with US representatives participating indirectly.\n\nA senior US official told the New York Times that an agreement on which steps needed to be taken and when by Washington and Tehran was \u201clargely complete\u201d before the Iranian presidential election in June.\n\nEbrahim Raisi, a hardliner and strident critic of the West, won the race to succeed Hassan Rouhani, a moderate who negotiated the JCPOA with Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nMr Raisi promised before taking office in August that he would not to let the talks drag on, but he did not agree to return to Vienna until earlier this month.\n\nHe has insisted that Iran\u2019s negotiators will not back down \u201cin any way\u201d in defending its interests.\n\nThe Iranian foreign ministry has said they want an \u201cadmission of culpability\u201d from the US; the immediate lifting of all US sanctions; and a \u201cguarantee\u201d that no future US president would unilaterally abandon the deal again.\n\nMr Biden\u2019s special envoy for Iran, Robert Malley, has said the US is prepared to take all of the steps necessary to come back into compliance, including lifting the sanctions imposed by the Trump administration that crippled Iran\u2019s economy.\n\nBut Mr Malley has also warned Iran that the \u201cwindow for negotiations\u2026 will not be open forever\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is not a chronological clock, it\u2019s a technological clock.
