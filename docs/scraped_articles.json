When someone reached out to me that Kaduna State was doing a lot in ICT, that there are so many things seriously going on, and that they needed somebody to help them put it together\u2026.if I was interested? Quite honestly, because it was Mallam, whom I\u2019ve always had the highest respect for, I just said ok without hesitation. They needed somebody to help them put up an organization and I completely assumed they\u2019ll be looking for a Kaduna State indigene or at least a northerner, neither of which I am of course.\n\nBasically, what went through my mind was, the possibility of a consultancy \u2026meaning I will spend six months, put the organization in place, help them look for the lead ICT person, mentor the individual and then I\u2019m gone. The availability of a rail service meant I could come in and out of Kaduna two/three times a week, do the work and get out. So I said \u201cOk, I\u2019m interested.\u201d\n\nA few days later the gentleman came back, he said \u201cthis is like the same thing you did at the Federal level.\u201d He is actually from Microsoft, so he knew me and knew my antecedents. He was like \u201call they want is for you to replicate the same thing\u201d. In all honesty, I continued to see it as a part-time consultancy. Until,one of Mallam\u2019s very senior advisers and confidant called me.\n\nI was on holidays. He was very direct \u2026and insisted on nothing less than two years, then I knew this six months would not fly. I initially said one year\u2026.he said no no no no no, we want two years. At that point I knew I couldn\u2019t have it my way.\n\nBut eventually I came to Kaduna. Again, I didn\u2019t know anything about Kaduna. So I took the Wednesday train which only runs twice. I finished under two hours, but I had to wait till 6pm to catch the train back to Abuja.\n\nSo that\u2019s how I ended up here, working for Kaduna State Government. And it\u2019s been interesting , because I found out that they are in a hurry, they\u2019re still in a hurry\u2026. I\u2019ll rather work with someone who is in a hurry, than work with somebody who takes his time and who\u2019s not be in a hurry, no sense of urgency, you know. There\u2019s a sense of urgency here which we are all driving, so that\u2019s how I ended up as Chief Information Officer and Special Adviser ICT,to Nasir El-Rufai.\n\nIn a sense you\u2019ve always known El-Rufai?\n\nYes, I have always known him. I\u2019ve actually enjoyed a favor from him in 2001 or 2002 when he was a Director General of BPE (The Bureau of Public Enterprises). First, he moved the BPE from Lotus Notes, which was the dominant e-mail platform before Microsoft Exchange. He also graced our product lunch. He has always been a strong advocate of technology. So I\u2019ve known him for about 20 years professionally speaking.\n\nSo that made it easy for you to say yes?\n\nYes, because I\u2019ve always known him. \u2026.he is serious minded, committed, keeps his promises, and believes in the transformation power of technology. El- Rufai , has a vision beyond what most people understand. In the public sector space in Nigeria as far as ICT goes, it\u2019s difficult to find a leader who understands technology, and has the political capital to drive through the programmes like he does. When they have political capital, they don\u2019t understand technology; it\u2019s a distraction, it\u2019s an annoyance, it\u2019s an irritation. When they understand technology, they don\u2019t have the political capital, so they cannot push things, and sometimes they don\u2019t have either. They have no political capital and they don\u2019t understand technology, but unfortunately they have the responsibilities to oversee technology.\n\nSo that\u2019s a disaster and we\u2019ve seen a few of them come and go. So it was very easy to accept to work with Mallam because he has both.\n\nDown the line, from six months, you have spent two years\u2026 and from the look of things the whole 4 years. So how has it been?\n\nLet me start from the non-technology bit.\n\nThe last two years has been back to school\u2026school of governance, learning capable leadership, with colleagues and listening and debating, and learning\u2026. beyond what is your own core and reinforcing some impressions that you have, especially of the leader.\n\nOf course it has it\u2019s challenges, sometimes we take on a bit too much and we have to drop a few things, reprioritize\u2026 the economy as we know is going through very challenging times, so we can\u2019t do as much as we want to \u2026some things have been slowed down, because of cash flow. There hasn\u2019t been a dull moment, anyway. It\u2019s sometimes stressful, it\u2019s sometimes exhilarating\u2026.on the whole\u2026I\u2019m happy I\u2019m here.\n\nThere is this perception and narratives about Nasir El-Rufai by some interests. Your friends know you are here\u2026.so what\u2019s their reaction\u2026.what do they say to you, considering their perception about Nasir El-Rufai, the man you work for?\n\nAll sorts of reactions \u2026.like what are you doing with that man, he is a bigot, he is very cruel\u201d, in all honesty also, quite a number appreciate him\u2026.they describe him as a strong man and do ask me to extend their greetings to him.\n\nThere are some people, who wish that in their own part of the country, they have leaders like El-Rufai. I guess figuratively, the good and the bad are the cross he has to carry. I have been here for two years and I know he is not a bigot.\n\nHe is a man of very strong opinions, you can\u2019t hold that against him, but I think he is also, like they say in America, he follows the science so he\u2019s an evidence based man. So he takes decisions based on evidence. He is human, he is not always right, and I think I\u2019ve seen him yield to superior arguments or superior evidence\u2026 but he\u2019s not a bigot. He is a victim of his own standards, he is a victim of his antecedents, so people hold him to higher levels of expectation than they hold other people, but the only problem is that most times they do it maliciously.\n\nYou talked about El-Rufai being a victim of his own standards, a victim of service and all that. \u2026but there is no way you will make an omelet without breaking eggs\u2026the difference is his willingness to break eggs. Nigerians want development but they don\u2019t want the eggs broken, isn\u2019t that a problem? Don\u2019t you find this funny?\n\nWe are Nigerians, so at this stage in my life I\u2019ve come to understand, accept that fact\u2026am proud being a Nigerian irrespective of all that you know.\n\nYes, I find it funny, because,as far as El-Rufai is concerned\u2026I\u2019ll be hard pressed to see any decision he\u2019s taken in governance, in his public life; I\u2019m not stressing in politics, I\u2019m not a politician,from when he came to BPE or even PIMCO (Policy Implementation and Monitoring Committee), to today, that you can say, was not well thought through or was not in the public interest.\n\nI\u2019ll give an example. I was talking to somebody two weeks ago and she said that people are suffering, and that in the previous government, \u201cwe dey see something\u201d, \u2026.I\u2019m not making this up.\n\nMy reply was , so what do you want? This is a woman with children. I went on. Do you want good hospitals and good schools for your children, or do you want to dey see something once in a while? She said, \u201cwalahi , the man is trying but he\u2019s too harsh\u201d. She said, again am quoting her, \u201cIf you put all the past governor\u2019s together, they haven\u2019t achieved, what this man has achieved, all of them put together .\u201d\n\nLike you said, you can\u2019t make an omelet without breaking eggs, and again\u2026 people don\u2019t recognise that resources are very finite, and that you have to choose what you can do with available resources\u2026so sometimes you prioritise.\n\nYou\u2019ve related officially, now you\u2019re working for him, what perceptions about El-Rufai have changed, and which ones have been reinforced in the last two years?\n\nSo let\u2019s start with the ones that have been reinforced; his understanding of governance is unmatched, it\u2019s unparalleled because governance is multi-dimensional, it\u2019s not about just awarding populist contracts. Yes, roads are very important, it\u2019s infrastructure but there\u2019s still a huge element of populism, because people can see roads easily but we are talking about Justice Reforms, Public Service Reforms, Human Capital Development, both within the public service, and the populace in general. I knew he knew it, but I didn\u2019t know how well he knew it.\n\nSo, these things I find very stimulating and like I said, even though I am an IT person and I\u2019m supposed to be concerned with IT\u2026.but I can\u2019t close my eyes to what I am seeing .\n\nSo, those have been reinforced and the ones that have been refreshing that I have found is the humaneness of the person, the quality of leadership, off course you cannot be a leader if you are not humane, you can\u2019t lead people if you don\u2019t care for the people.\n\nI think both as a leader of a government and a team of people, and as a leader of a state, I would like to say that I find that he genuinely cares for people. And sometimes it has to be tough love, but it is there and he understands his constituency. Again, that\u2019s one of the things that people tend to say against him, but it\u2019s the other way around. I wish other leaders would be like that and identify and love their people.\n\nThe impression of some people is that he is brash and here you are saying he is a humanist, that he loves his people\u2026.\n\nAs a human being, I have seen him lose his temper a few times, but he\u2019s not brash, and when he is wrong he has reversed himself, so he can\u2019t be brash, but he is definitely not arrogant. He is confident, he\u2019s intelligent and he also doesn\u2019t have false humility, either. A lot of people will say I am talking nonsense,but this is what I see and I think I\u2019ve been close enough and observant enough to be sure of what I am saying.\n\nIn the Kaduna State Executive Council that you are a member \u2026you have colleagues from Delta State, Kogi State, Bauchi, Adamawa State, Kwara State, Ogun State \u2026and your good self from Anambra State, clearly the most diverse council in Nigeria other than the Federal Executive Council. Do you wonder why even this doesn\u2019t change those perceptions about him?\n\nBecause Nigerians are cynical, we are a cynical people. We lack trust, we don\u2019t believe whatever our leaders say; maybe it\u2019s from experience. Now they probably look at me and conclude\u2026.his appointment is a tokenism\u2026they want to use him \u2026.maybe he wants to run for presidency. \u2026.so Nigerians are very cynical. Like he El-Rufai himself says, \u201cOnly God knows what is in the heart of every one of us.\u201d For some people, my appointment changed their view, for others \u2026.but that\u2019s the nature of man\u2026.even if you line up every single thing El- Rufai has done\u2026they will still look for something because, it is what it is\u2026\n\nExactly what do you do for the Kaduna State Government; the larger picture, the goals of the ICT Policy of the state. He has done well attracting you, a key player in the industry?\n\nTechnology is a tool, an enabler, it\u2019s not an end unto itself. We are charged with the effective and efficient deployment and application of technology first of all, in all spheres of governance and public service delivery, as an instrument to enhance governance and public service delivery, and also in the socio-economic development of the state.\n\nFor instance, social media has become a very strong instrument of governance. Social media moves along \u2026 without the CIO interfering, but where the CIO comes in for example is that we are supposed to be able to deliver government services online and then use social media to let people know\u2026.do you know you can do ABC online? So we support in different areas, we\u2019re working on digital identity for the state, very closely with the Identity Management Commission through the Kaduna State Residents Registration Agency (KADSRRA),because kaduna state government wants to plan based on more accurate information. Sometimes I wish we had started this about two yes ago before I came here.\n\nWe are enhancing information flow and decision making in government through automation, service delivery, institutional membrane, revenue, security, education, health, agriculture, even the basic capacity of human beings.\n\nWe train people, we are trying to ramp up a lot on human capital development both within the government and beyond the government.\n\nLast year, a study was conducted and I think only about 28/32% of the kaduna citizens have smart phones. So that means that as you and I know\u2026..the benefit of having online apps that you can deploy is not there for those without smart phones.\n\nNow we are also trying to drive connectivity in the underserved and unserved areas of Kaduna State so that people can begin to partake in government services.\n\nLook at COVID, people will say that COVID is the best thing that happened to ICT, because it was no longer some far-fetched, not for us kind of concept of the new way \u2026the new normal\u2026 It is the new normal and we have to accept that. One of the things for example that we have done, is that across all the tertiary institutions we have a PPP (Public Private Partnership) now that is delivering technology infrastructure and services from KASU (Kaduna State University) to College of Midwifery in Kafanchan, Shehu Idris Polytechnic and all of them, you know, the five of them. And we\u2019re driving down to the Secondary Schools, there are 547 in Kaduna and I think about 15 or 16 model schools here.\n\nWe have started School Management Systems to be able to enable even the management of the education system from the Ministry (Ministry of Education) to SUBEB (State Universal Basic Education Board) to the School Quality Assurance Authority to be able to get a handle of what\u2019s going on in the schools; tracking the teachers, tracking the students. Now if you think about that and take the identity element in it\u2026you are able to know who is where and plan accordingly.\n\nWe also have KADGIS (Kaduna Geographic Information System), it\u2019s been around for a while, we\u2019re seeking to improve it to make it easier and more convenient for people to access their services. Now you don\u2019t have to queue up at the bank, you can pay online, you\u2019re able to submit your receipts and process your things. So we\u2019re looking for a stage where ultimately in the case of KADGIS, you can actually start and finish your land application without showing up at their office, because you have logistics service providers. Today, they tell you CofO (Certificate of Occupancy) is ready\u2026, even the process of getting that CofO has been sped up because the Governor has the equipment that enables him to process that, because he is the ultimate person.\n\nThere are incremental improvements\u2026.quantum improvements but things are happening across. Of course we\u2019re constrained by the financial situation \u2026but in some areas we are working with PPPs, we\u2019re doing vehicle registration. A lot of what you\u2019ve seen \u2026it\u2019s not an accident that Kaduna state is fifth or sixth in IGR (Internally Generated Revenue) \u2026it\u2019s due to technology, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in KADIRS (Kaduna State Internal Revenue Service) which has a very dynamic young Chairman.\n\nSo there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s happening in different places. We\u2019re working on KASUPDA (Kaduna State Urban Planning and Development Agency) on street names and house numbering. We\u2019re working on that and we plan to make them available on digital maps. We\u2019re driving digital economy initiatives to encourage people to do a lot of things online, this again is post-COVID where services are delivered online\u2026internet, basic e-commerce; you want to order food, you want to order anything , you should be able to do that. We\u2019ve signed an MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) with Airtel, we\u2019ve signed a MoU with IHS Towers for urban and statewide broadband deployment.\n\nSo my assignment as Special Adviser and CIO goes round, some of which I\u2019m directly responsible for, some of which I hold an advisory role, you know, consultative and guiding other people \u2026this is what you should be doing. We have signed what we call framework agreements, to be able to acquire these tools cost effectively. \u2026anyone who knows the public sector\u2026knows that technology used to be the biggest racket\u2026government buying equipment for three or four times more than what it is worth. It\u2019s a work in progress but we\u2019ve significantly scaled back on that, eliminating duplication of projects.\n\nOk, you talked about impediments , finance, infrastructure and manpower\u2026..so where do we stand?\n\nWell, I leave that to the finance people but we have tried to make impact with what we have. What I know the government is trying to avoid \u2026is starting something we can\u2019t finish. So instead of eating 3 good meals or eating 3 poor meals we eat two good meals a day that are nutritious? So we have had to now prioritize within the priorities, you don\u2019t start anything because it\u2019s a flight of fancy so anything we do is a priority. T\n\nWell, the Governors themselves know they have to learn from each other, the PEAR group review mechanism. But what do other states have to learn from Kaduna State in terms of what you are doing in ICT?\n\nWe all have to learn from each other, so yeah I\u2019m sure we have a few things that we can share with people but I\u2019ll be honest with you, because I also call a few counterparts in other states and I say, hey how are you doing this. \u2026you see, when you learn, you learn how to avoid mistakes.\n\nTo avoid mistakes that Kaduna has made, you don\u2019t want them to?\n\nHaving been at the Federal level for eight years,I know the mistakes that we made and so even among my colleagues, I try very hard not to come across as knowing it all or being arrogant. Benefits from the experience I have, means I must do things differently. I interact with people in Lagos,in Ogun, in Kebbi, somewhat a bit of interaction with people in Anambara.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about your experiences, the gains of Covid, so we\u2019ve seen the benefits of the tools of technology. Kaduna state during the Covid didn\u2019t shut down\n\nNo we did not shut down at all\u2026 I mean I was in Lagos for four and half months at home and I actively participated in meetings. There were people who were reluctant initially, in fact my self and my colleagues, we had a laugh \u2026because some people felt there was a deliberate effort to marginalize them out of governance \u2026due to the migration to online. But there were also people who, because human nature is competitive, who now started competing among themselves to be the first people online whenever we had meetings, with the Covid taskforce and for other meetings, we had exco meetings online, Kaduna didn\u2019t shut down at all and decisions were taken and executed. Mallam was sick, but joined us now and again. When he had Covid, Deputy Governor held sway, everybody was onboard, SSG, Chief of Staff, Commissioners, everybody was onboard.\n\nSo the train has left the analog station?\n\nOh yes! Definitely the train has left. \u2026I like that analogy, the train has left, we are adding more coaches and getting more passengers on board, passengers in education, in health and agriculture you know, the will is there, the commitment is there, the Governor never fails at any point in time \u2026.he\u2019s not just talking, he means what he says and it also requires him to reprioritize resources. Recently as you know we did a right-sizing of the house, that was also technology based and scientific,it wasn\u2019t whimsical. There were bases and it\u2019s one of the key deliverables of technology, it\u2019s data to enable decision making, so he\u2019s a very data driven person. It is a very data driven government.\n\nBriefly, for the common man\u2026Frank Olisa\u2019s common man \u2026.what\u2019s the ICT policy of Kaduna State \u2026.so they can key in?\n\nWe have the \u2018Digital Strategy For The Government and The People of Kaduna State\u2019. What we did was to undertake an assessment of where things presently stand and which helped us to determine the building blocks that we needed to put in place , the different initiatives, sectoral initiatives that we have to have. So for example, the current assessment tells us that we don\u2019t have total coverage of the networks in Kaduna State\u2026.that there are schools, big schools that do not have any form of ICT, that at the Primary Health Centers or general Hospitals, there\u2019s an unacceptable degree of absenteeism among the staff and then the building blocks will tell you what to do that you have to\u2026 so we move into the building blocks\u2026 what do we do to fix these things? In Kaduna State,like you know the people are at the center of everything you do, so the assessment tells us that we need to get skilled people\u2026before we start spending money on computers. Based on the assessment, we can confidently tell you there\u2019s no point putting a computer in a school that has no roof or that the lab is not secured.\n\nSo if the staff\u2026.academic and non academic, do not have the right level of computer literacy, digital literacy and awareness, how do you begin to drive education with such people? Same goes for other spheres of governance, so the question we keep asking is, how can we increase the number of women who have bank accounts and who are capable of digital banking? You know, the things you and I have taken for granted in the last 15 years, but you\u2019ll be surprised that close to 70% of our women folk in this state do not have it. So how can you achieve financial inclusion today if people are not digital? if you do not use digital channels\u2026how can you improve traffic and security if you do not have cameras? Some of them would appear futuristic but we don\u2019t want to do that, even within the government we\u2019ve had arguments, people saying \u2026.why are you doing what you\u2019re doing\u2026just go into the bush and chase the bandits. Yes the bandits are in the bush\u2026unfortunately there is a threat, a real threat they\u2019ll come in and apart from banditry there are issues of general law and order, bad driving and all that. You know, we have a vehicle registration system, we have tax clearance system, so the building blocks are the people, the infrastructure, the legal frameworks that need to be out in place, constitutional and legal frameworks and power of course. So there are certain areas where we have to look for solar, alternative power and work would decrease and all that, so those are the building blocks and then now you begin to identify, even the acquisition of machines where in the past somebody would buy one computer for N900,000 and somebody else would buy the very same computer for N450,000, we\u2019ve put an end to all that by engaging with the original equipment manufacturers.\n\nSo things are more deliberate\u2026well thought out, what we need now is the focus and the \u2018will\u2019 to execute the plans we\u2019ve made \u2026the action orientation, results oriented and all that. So that\u2019s the strategy and that\u2019s what it means for the common man you know, when you talk about schools, we have our children in schools,talk about health care, you want to be able to move around.\n\nWe want people to go out into the world irrespective of their economic backgrounds to be confident and to be able to participate in the global economy and we want people to be healthy and not just in basic consulting, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware that we launched Zipline, the drone to deliver medicines. So you will never fault us for not trying, we will try and \u2026\n\nThat\u2019s working now?\n\nYes, that\u2019s working, we\u2019re at the pilot stage and then we\u2019re also doing some other Tele-health initiative, we have two Tele-health initiatives ongoing which we hope to be able to roll out across board,when we\u2019re done, because anything you\u2019re doing should not be a PR stunt. It should be something that can scale economically, sustainably, again, back to human capital it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\n\nNow, the Airtel limited and Kaduna State MoU on broadband connectivity, what exactly is that MoU all about?\n\nOK, it\u2019s an all encompassing MoU like I said, you put it in two blocks, one is to deliver services that will enhance governance and the second to deliver services that will enhance state wide development. So if you\u2019re talking about governance, we\u2019re going to provide connectivity.\n\nThe best form of infrastructure is fibre \u2026without doubt. Airtell, will make the investments in metro fibre, in the key areas and we will provide connectivity in Kaduna for about 95% of government offices\u2026all government MDAs through fibre. In the first instance they\u2019re will use radio because you can get radio up and running in a matter of days, two to three days and provide connectivity.\n\nMost of what we do now in terms of government resources, technology resources are cloud based, so you must have connectivity into the clouds which is what is happening in the whole world today. It\u2019s all about remote location, code location and cloud location of your technology platforms. So we\u2019re doing that across board as you probably know, we have what I call multi tenant locations, Government House is one, the Ministry of Public Works and Infrastructure campus is one, Investment house is another, State house is another one and the State Secretariat and the Ministry of Health across the road, so you will have all of them connected to each other and even the judiciary is going to be impacted, the legislature and all that. And so that\u2019s one deliverable, we\u2019re going to roll out fibre to the new galaxy mall coming, the Murtala Square shopping complex because as you know, in the modern day, both the automation of the shops requires technology for them to give you your invoices and all that and even shoppers these days, when you go to the developed world, you walk into a shop, every shop has a Wi-Fi, so Airtel will make their infrastructure available. Kaduna on it\u2019s part will clear all the bottlenecks and give them incentives committing to Airtel is an incentive because it\u2019s not free, they won\u2019t be paying for the right of way in addition to other incentives and waivers. Now four/five years ago maybe more, the cost of right of way, the fees paid to government constituted 80% of the cost of roll out infrastructure. We were very shortsighted,we made them pay,but at the expense of development because you really cannot develop today without technology.\n\nSo with the Airtel MoU, by the end of next year we have a joint commitment to have 3G the minimum standard for data across the entire state. So Airtel will give us 3G connectivity across the entire state, so it\u2019s not like when you go to some places and you say Oh I can\u2019t send data or you want to send money, you cannot,because of connection\u2026this obviously affects financial inclusion.\n\nIt might interest you to know, Sanga area, the Banks are not there, they are using Lafia which is in Nassarawa State.\n\nOur MoU will create the incentives for Airtel to be able to extend service to that for the people of Sanga.\n\nThe biggest challenge which is what has breed insecurity in Nigeria across the board is that government was cut off from the far reaches of different domains whether it is in Zamfara state or it is in Yobe, Niger, even parts of the South even though they have a smaller land mass but in the North it is more acute because the land mass is bigger, so a Governor cannot get up and say I want to do a quick dash to Sanga to know what\u2019s going on there. It\u2019s a five hour trip, you spend two hours then you turn around. So when you drive technology, you bring government closer to the people. It\u2019s real, it\u2019s not esoteric. it is real.\n\nIt\u2019s important that you have addressed why Kaduna State is investing in the building of infrastructure\u2026I understand you are going to build bases in about 40 locations \u2026no doubt ,there is a correlation between what you doing now and the war against insecurity. There\u2019s a business economic dimension to it. So the Kaduna State Government has been forced to do this, because the NCC, National Rural Telephonic Project is not working, so you have been forced to spend hard resources to support it.\n\nAnd what other partnerships do you have \u2026Microsoft?\n\nAnswer: You talked about the 40 based stations, that is the partnership with IHS.\n\nIHS is the biggest infrastructure for mobile network operators, they own 80% of all the towers in Nigeria, so we started from the security point of view, we identified the black spots that were cut off\u2026areas with high incidents of banditry and all other crimes \u2026..so we need to deploy connectivity because with connectivity, hopefully the security forces will be able to respond quickly.\n\nThe goal is a rapid response,whenever there is a distress cry for help, there has to be a maximum time , it will take to get a response. So the Kaduna State Government,is doing what is within its control.\n\nThen we\u2019ll continue to work with and encourage the Federal Security Agencies to be able to respond to those cries because at the end of the day these people are citizens and the Governor is responsible for them.\n\nWhere do you see Kaduna State ICT wise in the next five year?\n\nYou know, the beautiful thing",

          "text": "\u2022Why I fell for his job\n\n\u2022What makes him different\n\n\u2022He\u2019s data-driven and runs data driven govt\n\nMr. Gerald Ilukwe, is the Special Adviser to Governor Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Kaduna State.\n\nHe was the Pioneer \u2013 Managing Director of Galaxy Backbone Ltd, the ICT company of the Federal Government of Nigeria. In this interview, he speaks about the nature of his assignment in kaduna state, how Governor Nasir El-Rufai literally hijacked him, his working experience as a southerner working in a northern state and the governor.\n\nDefinitely, Kaduna state wouldn\u2019t have been part of your calculation considering your profession, maybe Lagos, Abuja \u2026 If someone told you, you would be here two years ago , what would have been your reaction?\n\nQuite frankly, I would have laughed him or her off. But again knowing that anywhere Mallam (Nasir El-Rufai) is, that great things happen there; with a lot of energy that could be possible but I would never have imagined that I\u2019ll be a part of it in the way I am today.\n\nSo what influenced you?\n\nAccepting to work for Nasir El-Rufai, wasn\u2019t difficult. Because I know that anywhere Mallam is, there\u2019ll be great things happening, and with a lot of energy. I would never have imagined that I would be a part of it in the way I am today. When someone reached out to me that Kaduna State was doing a lot in ICT, that there are so many things seriously going on, and that they needed somebody to help them put it together\u2026.if I was interested? Quite honestly, because it was Mallam, whom I\u2019ve always had the highest respect for, I just said ok without hesitation. They needed somebody to help them put up an organization and I completely assumed they\u2019ll be looking for a Kaduna State indigene or at least a northerner, neither of which I am of course.\n\nBasically, what went through my mind was, the possibility of a consultancy \u2026meaning I will spend six months, put the organization in place, help them look for the lead ICT person, mentor the individual and then I\u2019m gone. The availability of a rail service meant I could come in and out of Kaduna two/three times a week, do the work and get out. So I said \u201cOk, I\u2019m interested.\u201d\n\nA few days later the gentleman came back, he said \u201cthis is like the same thing you did at the Federal level.\u201d He is actually from Microsoft, so he knew me and knew my antecedents. He was like \u201call they want is for you to replicate the same thing\u201d. In all honesty, I continued to see it as a part-time consultancy. Until,one of Mallam\u2019s very senior advisers and confidant called me.\n\nI was on holidays. He was very direct \u2026and insisted on nothing less than two years, then I knew this six months would not fly. I initially said one year\u2026.he said no no no no no, we want two years. At that point I knew I couldn\u2019t have it my way.\n\nBut eventually I came to Kaduna. Again, I didn\u2019t know anything about Kaduna. So I took the Wednesday train which only runs twice. I finished under two hours, but I had to wait till 6pm to catch the train back to Abuja.\n\nSo that\u2019s how I ended up here, working for Kaduna State Government. And it\u2019s been interesting , because I found out that they are in a hurry, they\u2019re still in a hurry\u2026. I\u2019ll rather work with someone who is in a hurry, than work with somebody who takes his time and who\u2019s not be in a hurry, no sense of urgency, you know. There\u2019s a sense of urgency here which we are all driving, so that\u2019s how I ended up as Chief Information Officer and Special Adviser ICT,to Nasir El-Rufai.\n\nIn a sense you\u2019ve always known El-Rufai?\n\nYes, I have always known him. I\u2019ve actually enjoyed a favor from him in 2001 or 2002 when he was a Director General of BPE (The Bureau of Public Enterprises). First, he moved the BPE from Lotus Notes, which was the dominant e-mail platform before Microsoft Exchange. He also graced our product lunch. He has always been a strong advocate of technology. So I\u2019ve known him for about 20 years professionally speaking.\n\nSo that made it easy for you to say yes?\n\nYes, because I\u2019ve always known him. \u2026.he is serious minded, committed, keeps his promises, and believes in the transformation power of technology. El- Rufai , has a vision beyond what most people understand. In the public sector space in Nigeria as far as ICT goes, it\u2019s difficult to find a leader who understands technology, and has the political capital to drive through the programmes like he does. When they have political capital, they don\u2019t understand technology; it\u2019s a distraction, it\u2019s an annoyance, it\u2019s an irritation. When they understand technology, they don\u2019t have the political capital, so they cannot push things, and sometimes they don\u2019t have either. They have no political capital and they don\u2019t understand technology, but unfortunately they have the responsibilities to oversee technology. So that\u2019s a disaster and we\u2019ve seen a few of them come and go. So it was very easy to accept to work with Mallam because he has both.\n\nDown the line, from six months, you have spent two years\u2026 and from the look of things the whole 4 years. So how has it been?\n\nLet me start from the non-technology bit. The last two years has been back to school\u2026school of governance, learning capable leadership, with colleagues and listening and debating, and learning\u2026. beyond what is your own core and reinforcing some impressions that you have, especially of the leader.\n\nOf course it has it\u2019s challenges, sometimes we take on a bit too much and we have to drop a few things, reprioritize\u2026 the economy as we know is going through very challenging times, so we can\u2019t do as much as we want to \u2026some things have been slowed down, because of cash flow. There hasn\u2019t been a dull moment, anyway. It\u2019s sometimes stressful, it\u2019s sometimes exhilarating\u2026.on the whole\u2026I\u2019m happy I\u2019m here.\n\nThere is this perception and narratives about Nasir El-Rufai by some interests. Your friends know you are here\u2026.so what\u2019s their reaction\u2026.what do they say to you, considering their perception about Nasir El-Rufai, the man you work for?\n\nAll sorts of reactions \u2026.like what are you doing with that man, he is a bigot, he is very cruel\u201d, in all honesty also, quite a number appreciate him\u2026.they describe him as a strong man and do ask me to extend their greetings to him. There are some people, who wish that in their own part of the country, they have leaders like El-Rufai. I guess figuratively, the good and the bad are the cross he has to carry. I have been here for two years and I know he is not a bigot. He is a man of very strong opinions, you can\u2019t hold that against him, but I think he is also, like they say in America, he follows the science so he\u2019s an evidence based man. So he takes decisions based on evidence. He is human, he is not always right, and I think I\u2019ve seen him yield to superior arguments or superior evidence\u2026 but he\u2019s not a bigot. He is a victim of his own standards, he is a victim of his antecedents, so people hold him to higher levels of expectation than they hold other people, but the only problem is that most times they do it maliciously.\n\nYou talked about El-Rufai being a victim of his own standards, a victim of service and all that. \u2026but there is no way you will make an omelet without breaking eggs\u2026the difference is his willingness to break eggs. Nigerians want development but they don\u2019t want the eggs broken, isn\u2019t that a problem? Don\u2019t you find this funny?\n\nWe are Nigerians, so at this stage in my life I\u2019ve come to understand, accept that fact\u2026am proud being a Nigerian irrespective of all that you know. Yes, I find it funny, because,as far as El-Rufai is concerned\u2026I\u2019ll be hard pressed to see any decision he\u2019s taken in governance, in his public life; I\u2019m not stressing in politics, I\u2019m not a politician,from when he came to BPE or even PIMCO (Policy Implementation and Monitoring Committee), to today, that you can say, was not well thought through or was not in the public interest.\n\nI\u2019ll give an example. I was talking to somebody two weeks ago and she said that people are suffering, and that in the previous government, \u201cwe dey see something\u201d, \u2026.I\u2019m not making this up. My reply was , so what do you want? This is a woman with children. I went on. Do you want good hospitals and good schools for your children, or do you want to dey see something once in a while? She said, \u201cwalahi , the man is trying but he\u2019s too harsh\u201d. She said, again am quoting her, \u201cIf you put all the past governor\u2019s together, they haven\u2019t achieved, what this man has achieved, all of them put together .\u201d\n\nLike you said, you can\u2019t make an omelet without breaking eggs, and again\u2026 people don\u2019t recognise that resources are very finite, and that you have to choose what you can do with available resources\u2026so sometimes you prioritise.\n\nYou\u2019ve related officially, now you\u2019re working for him, what perceptions about El-Rufai have changed, and which ones have been reinforced in the last two years?\n\nSo let\u2019s start with the ones that have been reinforced; his understanding of governance is unmatched, it\u2019s unparalleled because governance is multi-dimensional, it\u2019s not about just awarding populist contracts. Yes, roads are very important, it\u2019s infrastructure but there\u2019s still a huge element of populism, because people can see roads easily but we are talking about Justice Reforms, Public Service Reforms, Human Capital Development, both within the public service, and the populace in general. I knew he knew it, but I didn\u2019t know how well he knew it. So, these things I find very stimulating and like I said, even though I am an IT person and I\u2019m supposed to be concerned with IT\u2026.but I can\u2019t close my eyes to what I am seeing .\n\nSo, those have been reinforced and the ones that have been refreshing that I have found is the humaneness of the person, the quality of leadership, off course you cannot be a leader if you are not humane, you can\u2019t lead people if you don\u2019t care for the people.\n\nI think both as a leader of a government and a team of people, and as a leader of a state, I would like to say that I find that he genuinely cares for people. And sometimes it has to be tough love, but it is there and he understands his constituency. Again, that\u2019s one of the things that people tend to say against him, but it\u2019s the other way around. I wish other leaders would be like that and identify and love their people.\n\nThe impression of some people is that he is brash and here you are saying he is a humanist, that he loves his people\u2026.\n\nAs a human being, I have seen him lose his temper a few times, but he\u2019s not brash, and when he is wrong he has reversed himself, so he can\u2019t be brash, but he is definitely not arrogant. He is confident, he\u2019s intelligent and he also doesn\u2019t have false humility, either. A lot of people will say I am talking nonsense,but this is what I see and I think I\u2019ve been close enough and observant enough to be sure of what I am saying.\n\nIn the Kaduna State Executive Council that you are a member \u2026you have colleagues from Delta State, Kogi State, Bauchi, Adamawa State, Kwara State, Ogun State \u2026and your good self from Anambra State, clearly the most diverse council in Nigeria other than the Federal Executive Council. Do you wonder why even this doesn\u2019t change those perceptions about him?\n\nBecause Nigerians are cynical, we are a cynical people. We lack trust, we don\u2019t believe whatever our leaders say; maybe it\u2019s from experience. Now they probably look at me and conclude\u2026.his appointment is a tokenism\u2026they want to use him \u2026.maybe he wants to run for presidency. \u2026.so Nigerians are very cynical. Like he El-Rufai himself says, \u201cOnly God knows what is in the heart of every one of us.\u201d For some people, my appointment changed their view, for others \u2026.but that\u2019s the nature of man\u2026.even if you line up every single thing El- Rufai has done\u2026they will still look for something because, it is what it is\u2026\n\nExactly what do you do for the Kaduna State Government; the larger picture, the goals of the ICT Policy of the state. He has done well attracting you, a key player in the industry?\n\nTechnology is a tool, an enabler, it\u2019s not an end unto itself. We are charged with the effective and efficient deployment and application of technology first of all, in all spheres of governance and public service delivery, as an instrument to enhance governance and public service delivery, and also in the socio-economic development of the state.\n\nFor instance, social media has become a very strong instrument of governance. Social media moves along \u2026 without the CIO interfering, but where the CIO comes in for example is that we are supposed to be able to deliver government services online and then use social media to let people know\u2026.do you know you can do ABC online? So we support in different areas, we\u2019re working on digital identity for the state, very closely with the Identity Management Commission through the Kaduna State Residents Registration Agency (KADSRRA),because kaduna state government wants to plan based on more accurate information. Sometimes I wish we had started this about two yes ago before I came here.\n\nWe are enhancing information flow and decision making in government through automation, service delivery, institutional membrane, revenue, security, education, health, agriculture, even the basic capacity of human beings.\n\nWe train people, we are trying to ramp up a lot on human capital development both within the government and beyond the government.\n\nLast year, a study was conducted and I think only about 28/32% of the kaduna citizens have smart phones. So that means that as you and I know\u2026..the benefit of having online apps that you can deploy is not there for those without smart phones.\n\nNow we are also trying to drive connectivity in the underserved and unserved areas of Kaduna State so that people can begin to partake in government services.\n\nLook at COVID, people will say that COVID is the best thing that happened to ICT, because it was no longer some far-fetched, not for us kind of concept of the new way \u2026the new normal\u2026 It is the new normal and we have to accept that. One of the things for example that we have done, is that across all the tertiary institutions we have a PPP (Public Private Partnership) now that is delivering technology infrastructure and services from KASU (Kaduna State University) to College of Midwifery in Kafanchan, Shehu Idris Polytechnic and all of them, you know, the five of them. And we\u2019re driving down to the Secondary Schools, there are 547 in Kaduna and I think about 15 or 16 model schools here. We have started School Management Systems to be able to enable even the management of the education system from the Ministry (Ministry of Education) to SUBEB (State Universal Basic Education Board) to the School Quality Assurance Authority to be able to get a handle of what\u2019s going on in the schools; tracking the teachers, tracking the students. Now if you think about that and take the identity element in it\u2026you are able to know who is where and plan accordingly.\n\nWe also have KADGIS (Kaduna Geographic Information System), it\u2019s been around for a while, we\u2019re seeking to improve it to make it easier and more convenient for people to access their services. Now you don\u2019t have to queue up at the bank, you can pay online, you\u2019re able to submit your receipts and process your things. So we\u2019re looking for a stage where ultimately in the case of KADGIS, you can actually start and finish your land application without showing up at their office, because you have logistics service providers. Today, they tell you CofO (Certificate of Occupancy) is ready\u2026, even the process of getting that CofO has been sped up because the Governor has the equipment that enables him to process that, because he is the ultimate person.\n\nThere are incremental improvements\u2026.quantum improvements but things are happening across. Of course we\u2019re constrained by the financial situation \u2026but in some areas we are working with PPPs, we\u2019re doing vehicle registration. A lot of what you\u2019ve seen \u2026it\u2019s not an accident that Kaduna state is fifth or sixth in IGR (Internally Generated Revenue) \u2026it\u2019s due to technology, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in KADIRS (Kaduna State Internal Revenue Service) which has a very dynamic young Chairman.\n\nSo there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s happening in different places. We\u2019re working on KASUPDA (Kaduna State Urban Planning and Development Agency) on street names and house numbering. We\u2019re working on that and we plan to make them available on digital maps. We\u2019re driving digital economy initiatives to encourage people to do a lot of things online, this again is post-COVID where services are delivered online\u2026internet, basic e-commerce; you want to order food, you want to order anything , you should be able to do that. We\u2019ve signed an MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) with Airtel, we\u2019ve signed a MoU with IHS Towers for urban and statewide broadband deployment.\n\nSo my assignment as Special Adviser and CIO goes round, some of which I\u2019m directly responsible for, some of which I hold an advisory role, you know, consultative and guiding other people \u2026this is what you should be doing. We have signed what we call framework agreements, to be able to acquire these tools cost effectively. \u2026anyone who knows the public sector\u2026knows that technology used to be the biggest racket\u2026government buying equipment for three or four times more than what it is worth. It\u2019s a work in progress but we\u2019ve significantly scaled back on that, eliminating duplication of projects.\n\nOk, you talked about impediments , finance, infrastructure and manpower\u2026..so where do we stand?\n\nWell, I leave that to the finance people but we have tried to make impact with what we have. What I know the government is trying to avoid \u2026is starting something we can\u2019t finish. So instead of eating 3 good meals or eating 3 poor meals we eat two good meals a day that are nutritious? So we have had to now prioritize within the priorities, you don\u2019t start anything because it\u2019s a flight of fancy so anything we do is a priority.\n\nWell, the Governors themselves know they have to learn from each other, the PEAR group review mechanism. But what do other states have to learn from Kaduna State in terms of what you are doing in ICT?\n\nWe all have to learn from each other, so yeah I\u2019m sure we have a few things that we can share with people but I\u2019ll be honest with you, because I also call a few counterparts in other states and I say, hey how are you doing this. \u2026you see, when you learn, you learn how to avoid mistakes.\n\nTo avoid mistakes that Kaduna has made, you don\u2019t want them to?\n\nHaving been at the Federal level for eight years,I know the mistakes that we made and so even among my colleagues, I try very hard not to come across as knowing it all or being arrogant. Benefits from the experience I have, means I must do things differently. I interact with people in Lagos,in Ogun, in Kebbi, somewhat a bit of interaction with people in Anambara.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about your experiences, the gains of Covid, so we\u2019ve seen the benefits of the tools of technology. Kaduna state during the Covid didn\u2019t shut down\u2026\n\nNo we did not shut down at all\u2026 I mean I was in Lagos for four and half months at home and I actively participated in meetings. There were people who were reluctant initially, in fact my self and my colleagues, we had a laugh \u2026because some people felt there was a deliberate effort to marginalize them out of governance \u2026due to the migration to online.\n\nBut there were also people who, because human nature is competitive, who now started competing among themselves to be the first people online whenever we had meetings, with the Covid taskforce and for other meetings, we had exco meetings online, Kaduna didn\u2019t shut down at all and decisions were taken and executed. Mallam was sick, but joined us now and again. When he had Covid, Deputy Governor held sway, everybody was onboard, SSG, Chief of Staff, Commissioners, everybody was onboard.\n\nSo the train has left the analog station?\n\nOh yes! Definitely the train has left. \u2026I like that analogy, the train has left, we are adding more coaches and getting more passengers on board, passengers in education, in health and agriculture you know, the will is there, the commitment is there, the Governor never fails at any point in time \u2026.he\u2019s not just talking, he means what he says and it also requires him to reprioritize resources. Recently as you know we did a right-sizing of the house, that was also technology based and scientific,it wasn\u2019t whimsical. There were bases and it\u2019s one of the key deliverables of technology, it\u2019s data to enable decision making, so he\u2019s a very data driven person. It is a very data driven government.\n\nBriefly, for the common man\u2026Frank Olisa\u2019s common man \u2026.what\u2019s the ICT policy of Kaduna State \u2026.so they can key in?\n\nWe have the \u2018Digital Strategy For The Government and The People of Kaduna State\u2019. What we did was to undertake an assessment of where things presently stand and which helped us to determine the building blocks that we needed to put in place , the different initiatives, sectoral initiatives that we have to have. So for example, the current assessment tells us that we don\u2019t have total coverage of the networks in Kaduna State\u2026.that there are schools, big schools that do not have any form of ICT, that at the Primary Health Centers or general Hospitals, there\u2019s an unacceptable degree of absenteeism among the staff and then the building blocks will tell you what to do that you have to\u2026 so we move into the building blocks\u2026 what do we do to fix these things?\n\nIn Kaduna State,like you know the people are at the center of everything you do, so the assessment tells us that we need to get skilled people\u2026before we start spending money on computers. Based on the assessment, we can confidently tell you there\u2019s no point putting a computer in a school that has no roof or that the lab is not secured.\n\nSo if the staff\u2026.academic and non academic, do not have the right level of computer literacy, digital literacy and awareness, how do you begin to drive education with such people? Same goes for other spheres of governance, so the question we keep asking is, how can we increase the number of women who have bank accounts and who are capable of digital banking? You know, the things you and I have taken for granted in the last 15 years, but you\u2019ll be surprised that close to 70% of our women folk in this state do not have it. So how can you achieve financial inclusion today if people are not digital? if you do not use digital channels\u2026how can you improve traffic and security if you do not have cameras?\n\nSome of them would appear futuristic but we don\u2019t want to do that, even within the government we\u2019ve had arguments, people saying \u2026.why are you doing what you\u2019re doing\u2026just go into the bush and chase the bandits. Yes the bandits are in the bush\u2026unfortunately there is a threat, a real threat they\u2019ll come in and apart from banditry there are issues of general law and order, bad driving and all that. You know, we have a vehicle registration system, we have tax clearance system, so the building blocks are the people, the infrastructure, the legal frameworks that need to be out in place, constitutional and legal frameworks and power of course.\n\nSo there are certain areas where we have to look for solar, alternative power and work would decrease and all that, so those are the building blocks and then now you begin to identify, even the acquisition of machines where in the past somebody would buy one computer for N900,000 and somebody else would buy the very same computer for N450,000, we\u2019ve put an end to all that by engaging with the original equipment manufacturers.\n\nSo things are more deliberate\u2026well thought out, what we need now is the focus and the \u2018will\u2019 to execute the plans we\u2019ve made \u2026the action orientation, results oriented and all that. So that\u2019s the strategy and that\u2019s what it means for the common man you know, when you talk about schools, we have our children in schools,talk about health care, you want to be able to move around.\n\nWe want people to go out into the world irrespective of their economic backgrounds to be confident and to be able to participate in the global economy and we want people to be healthy and not just in basic consulting, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware that we launched Zipline, the drone to deliver medicines. So you will never fault us for not trying, we will try and \u2026\n\nThat\u2019s working now?\n\nYes, that\u2019s working, we\u2019re at the pilot stage and then we\u2019re also doing some other Tele-health initiative, we have two Tele-health initiatives ongoing which we hope to be able to roll out across board, when we\u2019re done, because anything you\u2019re doing should not be a PR stunt. It should be something that can scale economically, sustainably, again, back to human capital it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\n\nNow, the Airtel limited and Kaduna State MoU on broadband connectivity, what exactly is that MoU all about?\n\nOK, it\u2019s an all encompassing MoU like I said, you put it in two blocks, one is to deliver services that will enhance governance and the second to deliver services that will enhance state wide development. So if you\u2019re talking about governance, we\u2019re going to provide connectivity. The best form of infrastructure is fibre \u2026without doubt.\n\nAirtell, will make the investments in metro fibre, in the key areas and we will provide connectivity in Kaduna for about 95% of government offices\u2026all government MDAs through fibre. In the first instance they\u2019re will use radio because you can get radio up and running in a matter of days, two to three days and provide connectivity.\n\nMost of what we do now in terms of government resources, technology resources are cloud based, so you must have connectivity into the clouds which is what is happening in the whole world today. It\u2019s all about remote location, code location and cloud location of your technology platforms.\n\nSo we\u2019re doing that across board as you probably know, we have what I call multi tenant locations, Government House is one, the Ministry of Public Works and Infrastructure campus is one, Investment house is another, State house is another one and the State Secretariat and the Ministry of Health across the road, so you will have all of them connected to each other and even the judiciary is going to be impacted, the legislature and all that.\n\nAnd so that\u2019s one deliverable, we\u2019re going to roll out fibre to the new galaxy mall coming, the Murtala Square shopping complex because as you know, in the modern day, both the automation of the shops requires technology for them to give you your invoices and all that and even shoppers these days, when you go to the developed world, you walk into a shop, every shop has a Wi-Fi, so Airtel will make their infrastructure available.\n\nKaduna on it\u2019s part will clear all the bottlenecks and give them incentives committing to Airtel is an incentive because it\u2019s not free, they won\u2019t be paying for the right of way in addition to other incentives and waivers. Now four/five years ago maybe more, the cost of right of way, the fees paid to government constituted 80% of the cost of roll out infrastructure. We were very shortsighted,we made them pay,but at the expense of development because you really cannot develop today without technology.\n\nSo with the Airtel MoU, by the end of next year we have a joint commitment to have 3G the minimum standard for data across the entire state. So Airtel will give us 3G connectivity across the entire state, so it\u2019s not like when you go to some places and you say Oh I can\u2019t send data or you want to send money, you cannot,because of connection\u2026this obviously affects financial inclusion.\n\nIt might interest you to know, Sanga area, the Banks are not there, they are using Lafia which is in Nassarawa State.\n\nOur MoU will create the incentives for Airtel to be able to extend service to that for the people of Sanga.\n\nThe biggest challenge which is what has breed insecurity in Nigeria across the board is that government was cut off from the far reaches of different domains whether it is in Zamfara state or it is in Yobe, Niger, even parts of the South even though they have a smaller land mass but in the North it is more acute because the land mass is bigger, so a Governor cannot get up and say I want to do a quick dash to Sanga to know what\u2019s going on there. It\u2019s a five hour trip, you spend two hours then you turn around. So when you drive technology, you bring government closer to the people. It\u2019s real, it\u2019s not esoteric. it is real.\n\nIt\u2019s important that you have addressed why Kaduna State is investing in the building of infrastructure\u2026I understand you are going to build bases in about 40 locations \u2026no doubt ,there is a correlation between what you doing now and the war against insecurity. There\u2019s a business economic dimension to it. So the Kaduna State Government has been forced to do this, because the NCC, National Rural Telephonic Project is not working, so you have been forced to spend hard resources to support it.\n\nAnd what other partnerships do you have \u2026Microsoft?\n\nAnswer: You talked about the 40 based stations, that is the partnership with IHS. IHS is the biggest infrastructure for mobile network operators, they own 80% of all the towers in Nigeria, so we started from the security point of view, we identified the black spots that were cut off\u2026areas with high incidents of banditry and all other crimes \u2026..so we need to deploy connectivity because with connectivity, hopefully the security forces will be able to respond quickly. The goal is a rapid response,whenever there is a distress cry for help, there has to be a maximum time , it will take to get a response. So the Kaduna State Government,is doing what is within its control.\n\nThen we\u2019ll continue to work with and encourage the Federal Security Agencies to be able to respond to those cries because at the end of the day these people are citizens and the Governor is responsible for them.\n\nWhere do you see Kaduna State ICT wise in the next five year?\n\nYou know, the beautiful thing\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has said that one of the major issues threatening Nigeria\u2019s unity is not far-fetched from the fact that many citizens do not see or treat the country as one body.\n\nTo that effect, he said there is need for sensitization and renewal of the mindset of the Nigerian population to come to understand and appreciate that what affects one affects all.\n\n\u201cYou see, the main problem is we need to sensitise our Nigerian population to understand and appreciate our oneness, so that when a problem starts in Akwa Ibom, the man in Sokoto should not think it is not his problem. The man in Sokoto should go to Akwa Ibom and help in solving that problem because if it finishes Akwa Ibom, gradually it will come to Sokoto. When it affects an Ibibio man, a Kanuri man will say it is happening to an Ibibio man. It will come to you.\n\n\u201cWe saw how Boko Haram started. People felt it was not my problem but at the end it reached all the nooks and crannies of Nigeria because even where there were no physical attacks, it sent shivers, fears, and suspicions among people.\n\n\u201cWhy, because many of us are not treating Nigeria as a body,\u201d Masari noted.\n\nFG should be blamed for lack of security not Governors \u2013 Gov. Masari tells Buhari\n\nWhile using the human body to illustrate the predicament which Nigeria finds herself, the Katsina Governor said:\n\n\u201cYou know in your body, if your ear is sick and the leg says it is not your business, It will go worse that the leg cannot work.\u201d\n\nHe admonished the citizens to see Nigeria as one body bind together by God, noting that people do not determine their place of birth, geographical location or the environment they grow up.\n\nAccording to the Governor, that is what makes America strong; that is where they draw their strength from.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my choice, it is not your choice where I was born or where you were born or where you were brought up and it is not mine.\n\n\u201cI am not an Hausa man in Katsina by my choice. It is in the wisdom of our creator. He (God) has meaning for this.\n\n\u201cIt means if you bring your experience and I bring mine, we put it in a basket, we will produce better results.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Americans are so diverse today yet they are the strongest because they brought whatever is best for the country in one basket and they are areas that are not negotiable,\u201d Masari added\n\nGovernor Masari made the remark while responding to a faction of the party, the All Progressive Congress, APC, who paid him a courtesy visit at the state\u2019s government house on Friday to seek his wise counsel in their bid to have the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo, succeed and continue with the good legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari come 2023.\n\nAccording to the group coordinator, Alhaji Ahmed Mohammed, the Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG) is a pro-APC group, with membership cutting across all sectors in the country, including serving and past Governors, current and former members of the National Assembly.\n\nOn PCG\u2019s quest for Vice President Osibanjo to succeed President Buhari, the Katsina Governor likened the scenario to putting the cart before the horse. He rather advised them to first extol and herald the good deeds of the APC government first before advancing the course of who would fly the party\u2019s ticket as that is what would convince Nigerians to vote the party again come 2023.\n\nHe urged the APC party stalwarts to go back to their locality and ensure that they have credibble people that would do the right thing for the country at the hems of affairs.\n\n\u201cSo, honestly, I think your going out is timely. In whatever you do, I advise you to market first, what APC has done. Why APC should be elected again in 2023, then whose benefits come second because, there has to be APC.\n\n\u201cAPC has to be strong enough to win an election before we can have a successful candidate.\n\n\u201cWhat is before APC now is bringing out credible leaders that will do what is right for this country.\n\n\u201cAs a party, all of us should go back to our locality and make sure that we have good people leading the party. If we have good people leading the party, the product from their leadership will always be good.\n\n\u201cAt an an appropriate time, I will reply you,\u201d Governor Masari said.",

          "text": "From John Adams, Minna\n\nOver 130 pupils abducted from Salihu Tanko Isilamiya School in Tegina, Rafi Local Government area of Niger State who were released by their abductors on Thursday night after almost three months in captivity have recounted their ordeals in the hands of their abductors.\n\nThe children said they were made to trek for three days without water or food while being escorted to the kidnappers\u2019 den.\n\nThe children, who were looking very sickly and jittery on arrival at the Government House in Minna, where they were received by the state governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, also recounted how they were fed with only noodles in the mornings and evenings.\n\nThey said throughout their almost three months in captivity, they did not bathe. They also said they slept under trees in the bush for almost one month before some shelter was improvised for them.\n\nSpeaking in Hausa, ten-year-old Umar told our correspondent that they slept on the ground in the bush for many days before they were moved to a different location where they were given mats. Three of them shared a mat, he said.\n\nSaid he: \u201cThey kept the girls separate from us when it was time to sleep but we always ate together. They gave two of us one sachet of water to share during meals, which was two times a day, and they did not give us water to bathe.\n\n\u201cThey did not beat us, they only told us that we would soon go back home, and that we should not be afraid. They told us that anybody who ran would die in the bush.\u201d\n\nThe children were abducted in broad daylight at about 11:00am on May 30, 2021 by heavily armed bandits.\n\nBut while briefing newsmen in Minna on Friday when he received the children, the governor said only 92 were abducted.\n\nBut only 91 returned, as the bandits could not account for the missing one, fueling speculation that he may have died.\n\nAfter 89 days in captivity, with series of negotiations between the parents and the bandits, and the payment of unspecified sums paid as ransom, the children walked into their freedom on Thursday night with mixed feelings from their parents.\n\nWhile some of the parents could not hide their joy and happiness over the release of their children, others could not hold back their tears over the dehumanising condition the children were subjected to in the last three months.\n\n\u201cWe believed that it is a will of God and we cannot question it. We thank God that the children came back at the end of the day, and life continues,\u201d one of the parents who identified herself as Hauwa said.\n\nBut Hajiya Hamza could not hold back her tears due to her daughter\u2019s condition. She said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe that this is my daughter. No, this is a wicked act.\n\n\u201cThis people don\u2019t know God. I don\u2019t think they have children. It is only God that will judge them and their generations yet unborn,\u201d she submitted.\n\nReceiving the children at the Government House in Minna, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, described as wicked the abduction of minors who were also subjected to inhuman treatment in the name of money, adding that nothing can be more wicked than kidnapping innocent children.\n\n\u201c I wonder how you can abduct a-year-old innocent child and keep him or her for over 80 days. We need to do whatever it takes to bring those that did that to justice.\n\n\u201cThis has affected the morale and confidence of people from sending their children to school. We are making more efforts to secure our schools and, I think that is working. Schools in the areas where we cannot provide adequate security, those schools we have already shut them down temporarily.\u201d\n\nOn the health of the victims, the governor explained: \u201cI have received information from the medical team that all our children, about 92 ,including two other ones that were kidnapped by bandits, are doing fine except four whose condition is critical. But we are going to release them to their parents.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the chairman of Rafi Local Government area and the Commissioner for Local Government for the roles they played in the return of the children.",

Akinwonmi was accompanied to the meeting by the 2019 PDP governorship candidate in Ogun State, Ladi Adebutu.\n\nOther party leaders also went to Secondus\u2019 office to confer with him.\n\nHowever, a mild drama ensured at the NEC hall, when the chairman of the Board of Trustees ( BoT), Senator Walid Jibrin informed party leaders that Secondus was insisting on attending the caucus meeting.\n\nThe information did not go down well with some of the party leaders, who objected vehemently.\n\nImmediately, the BoT chairman and the chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, Aminu Tambuwal, went to see Secondus, who was waiting at his office on the second floor of Wadata Plaza.

          "title": "Some men want me as second wife \u2013Eberechukwu Nwizu, actress",
          "text": "By Rita Okoye and Christian Agadibe\n\nAfter emerging winner of the 3rd edition of Amstel Malta Box Office (AMBO) reality show, Eberechukwu Nwizu announced her presence in the Nigerian movie industry with her knack for role interpretation.\n\nIn this interview, the sexy screen diva reveals her secrets to attaining stardom, how she stays scandal free, reasons she turned down several marriage proposals and what acting has denied her. Enjoy it.\n\nHow did you cope during the COVID-19 lockdown?\n\nIt was one of the best things that happened to me. The lockdown months were intense moment of self-reflection and self-discovery for me. It\u2019s why I am who I am right now. So, I thank God.\n\nWhat new thing did you discover about yourself during the lockdown?\n\nOh yes. I cooked better, far better! I thought I knew how to cook but after the lockdown, I discovered that I cook far better. Plus I now bake well too. Also, I found out that I care a lot about people. Now, I invest more time in people and things that matter.\n\nFemale filmmakers are gradually taking over Nollywood these days, what\u2019s your take on this?\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of taking over. It\u2019s a matter of expression. Female filmmakers in Nigeria are expressing their God given talents and skills at the highest level and creating their own niche. Before, no one was giving them the opportunity. But now, you can\u2019t deny that they know what they are doing. For me, it\u2019s a case of do what you do well and the rest will fall into place naturally.\n\nTell us about your major achievements this year?\n\nMy directorial debut, Ask Gina. It\u2019s quite an amazing achievement for me.\n\nWhat are the major challenges you face as a celebrity?\n\nManaging my time. So many apps, so many books to read, and many projects to work on, hence the need to be a master at time management.\n\nCan you share an embarrassing moment you have had with a fan?\n\nSomeone thought I was Omoni Oboli. It wasn\u2019t embarrassing but it was rather funny.\n\nLooking back, what would you change if the hands of the clock were to be turned?\n\nI would\u2019ve made extra efforts to speak my language, Igbo. I speak Igbo but not like Phyno, if you know what I mean. I\u2019m a proud Igbo girl. But the importance of learning one\u2019s language wasn\u2019t emphasized in my home, with all due respect to my wonderful parents. Maybe my words today will help other parents locally and globally to realize the importance of language culture at home. Just like my birth name, Eberechukwu, which means God\u2019s mercy and favour, I sound like a super hero. No more shortened form, I\u2019m sticking with Eberechukwu.\n\nAs a single parent, what lessons did motherhood teach you?\n\nMotherhood is a crown, only the strongest will survive.\n\nWhat\u2019s your relationship with your baby\u2019s daddy?\n\nThat is my private life. Marriage? I welcome marriage. The challenge is I just have to make time to get married.\n\nWhat are your relationship goals?\n\nPutting God first. Everything else naturally follows suit; and then, money, beauty, time management, strength of character and sex.\n\nWhat kind of man would you not date?\n\nIt\u2019s probably a man who doesn\u2019t forgive easily or care about others except himself, his immediate environment, staff, and parents.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about liposuction. Would you go under the knife to enhance your body?\n\nLiposuction is a gift to humanity from science. But I haven\u2019t thought about going under the knife.\n\nWhat movie project are you currently working on?\n\nIt is a movie about women who are trying to save their marriages. It features myself, LD Wolfie from Ghana, and Uche Elendu. The movie is about friends who are basically interested in helping each other save their marriages.\n\nWhat is the biggest sacrifice you\u2019ve ever made for your career?\n\nI can no longer walk freely on the street, like going to the Mallam next door to buy something. Also, there are some people out there that I feel some likeness for, but I feel I will end up being a trophy wife and then I would be unable to fulfill my divine purpose on earth. So, I had to turn down several proposals because of drags. But I know that when I see a genuine person, he would be able to accommodate my divine purpose.\n\nWas there a special quality that assisted you in elevating your career?\n\nMy case has been very different. It has been a situation of trial and error. If something doesn\u2019t work for me, I switch to the next strategy. I like to sleep peacefully at night, so I do things that wouldn\u2019t hurt anybody and that can make me move to the next level. Whatever skills I have to learn, I learn it because my career is 1% talent and 99% socializing. I have learned to improve on my social aspect, as that is what the business is all about. So, I had to change from being an introvert to extrovert.\n\nWhich of your movies would you say gave you the biggest break?\n\nI will start with Singles Note for my first break; I also did Tiwa\u2019s Baggage and then The Ghost and The Tout, and a couple of others. They were released in the cinemas and people never stopped talking about them. As a matter of fact, that was when I started being taken seriously.\n\nWhat attracted you to the man you\u2019re currently dating?\n\nHe is a people\u2019s lover. He cares a lot about people irrespective of their age. He has genuine affection towards people generally.\n\nCan it be described as love at first sight?\n\nI think it was \u2018like at first sight\u2019. We all know that the devil can also be tall and handsome, so sometimes you just have to spend time with the person first so you don\u2019t end up marrying a Lucifer.\n\nHow have you managed to stay scandal free?\n\nIf you check me out on Google, I have a few scandals. But it\u2019s always about \u2018oh, Ebere party a lot\u2019 kind of thing. It is usually not life threatening kind of scandal.\n\nWhat\u2019s the misconception that you think people have about you?\n\nPeople think I am not proud of my country. I think it\u2019s a big misconception because Eberechukwu is a very proud Nigerian girl.\n\nHave you ever been proposed to by a married man to be a second wife?\n\nYes, several times I have been asked to be a second wife, but I thought it was really funny to be one.\n\nHave you had your own share of sexual harassment?\n\nI have never been sexually harassed in the industry. Thank God.\n\nHow do you handle men that want to have an affair with you just because they see you on screen?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really make me feel special. Everyone likes something that is shining and beautiful like gold. If I wasn\u2019t on TV, the pressure may not be as much as it is now. But because I am on TV and good at what I do, people would always want a bit of that. So, for me, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s flattering but a natural thing.\n\nWhat usually inspires the character you interpret so perfectly in movies?\n\nI can\u2019t even take the credit; it\u2019s a divine gift. Also, I literally practice everyday. Before I take up any project, I do a lot of research. So, it\u2019s a continuous learning process for me.",

          "title": "Fresh fear in South East over RUGA plot",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThere is anxiety in the South East over allegation of renewed plot to create cattle colony or RUGA in the region under whatever guise, in line with the Federal Government\u2019s National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP). The fears heightened recently following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s insistence on reviewing grazing routes in 25 states of the federation.\n\nPeople also said that the body language of three governors in the zone, Hope Uzodimma (Imo), David Umahi (Ebonyi) and Willie Obiano (Anambra) indicates that they are not inclined to carry out the anti-open grazing ban of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum expected to take effect in respective states from September 1. Addressing State House Correspondents in Abuja after a meeting with the President, Uzodimma distanced the state from any law banning open grazing. He argued that though there is, at present no anti-grazing law in the state, he added that his government was trying to regulate grazing activities through collaboration between the farmers and herders.\n\n\u201cThey have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in my office and agreed to work together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd both parties are going about their businesses without interfering or causing any grievance or anger to each other.\u201d\n\nBut reacting to his statement, the Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL) and Igbo National Council (INC) asked Uzodimma to retrace his steps on open grazing. Goodluck Ibem, President General of COSEYL, said on Friday that Uzodimma was on his own because Imo people had made their position known that open grazing was not accepted in the region. \u201cAny Governor or person who dares to move against the popular will of the people will have Ndigbo to contend with,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are not in a military junta were the governor will override the popular will of the people. We warn all governors of South East to be very careful of their stance and what they go to Abuja to say or do.\u201d Stating its position, INC gave the governor a 14-day ultimatum to reverse his decision or face the wrath of the people of the state. National President of the group, Chilos Godsent in a statement he released to Saturday Sun urged the governor to consult with his people before taking such decisions. \u201cImo State cannot afford to stand against the decision of Southern Governors\u2019 Forum that was applauded by the masses,\u201d he added.\n\nBut a document sent to Saturday Sun seems to contradict Uzodimma\u2019s claim about Imo not having law banning open grazing. Signed by Emmanuel Ngozi Ibekwe, the then Clerk of the Imo House of Assembly, it was signed into law on January 19, 2007, by the then civilian of the state, Chief Achike Udenwa. Coded as the I.S.N. Law No.9 of 2006 of Imo State, it was entitled \u201cProhibition of Grazing of Cattle.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, it read: \u201c3. Rearing of Cattle on the streets, main roads, residential and commercial places in Owerri Capital Territory and cultivated areas identified as Restricted Areas in Imo State is hereby prohibited. \u201cRestricted Areas\u201d means Areas within Imo State that are cultivated, residential and commercial.\n\n\u201c4. A cattle rearer shall not take his cattle into cultivated farms within Imo State. 5. Any person who contravenes section 3 and 4 of this Law is guilty of an offence and on summary conviction shall, in the case of Section 3, be liable to a fine not less than N50, 000, and, in the case of Section 4, pay compensations to the crop owner to cover the total cost of crops destroyed or eaten by the cattle in addition to a fine which may be prescribed by the Magistrate Court.\u201d\n\nBut Governor Uzodimma later issued a statement acknowledging the existence of such a law while insisting that he was quoted by the Press For Obiano, Saturday Sun gathered that there was no sign of effort by both the Anambra State government and the State House of Assembly to enact a law banning open grazing in the state, a situation people said was ominous given the carnage by Fulani herders in parts of Anambra. Though Ebonyi State Government claims to have anti-open grazing law in operation, many said it was a fluke as people insist they neither knew when it was passed nor laid hand on it.\n\nA statement by Malam Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant on Media to the President, to the end that four states including Ebonyi had received N24 billion grant for ranching, though later debunked by the state government has further heightened the feeling that there was actually plot to institutionalize cattle programme in Ebonyi. The governor has, in a statement signed by Francis Nwaze, his Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, on Thursday, August 26, 2021, insisted that the state does not have and would not yield any piece of its land for RUGA, ranching or whatever name it is called. He also denied that his state has received N6 billion from the Federal Government for the development of ranching in the area.\n\nConfirming the Ebonyi government\u2019s position, Shehu said that the state was correct that it did not receive the sum of N6billion for ranching, but indicated that it got money for \u201cassociated projects\u201d. But not a few persons believe that the Ebonyi State Government has not come clean on the ranching issue, arguing that there must be something that was being covered up.\n\nReacting on the issue, Linus Okorie, former House of Representatives member for Ohaozara/Onich/Ivo Federal Constituency, said that Umahi\u2019s statement denied receiving money for ranching, but did not state what the money it received was for. According to him, to douse the public rage and avoid unnecessary controversies, the state government should make that further clarification.\n\nMany Igbo groups and indigenes of Ebonyi State said that it would amount to a sellout if actually the governor clandestinely dragged the state into the ranching imbroglio given what the South East had passed through in the hands of marauding Fulani herders in recent times.\n\nAbia Onyike, spokesman of Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Abia Onyike noted that the governor\u2019s romance with the powers that be in Abuja could be detrimental to Ndigbo. \u201cGov. Umahi has no mandate to establish any cattle ranches in connivance with the Federal Government,\u201d he said. On the enactment of anti-open grazing law, ADF said that Gov. Uzodimma has not behaved as a true Igbo with his plan to accommodate killer Fulani herders in the state with the signing of mere memorandum of understanding.\n\nSimilarly, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Wing and Igbo National Movement (INM) have declared that the South-East zone has no grazing routes for herdsmen. INM Executive Director, Anthony Olisa Okolo, who addressed newsmen alongside other leaders in Owerri, stated that they would resist such attempt by the President and his amenable South East governors.",

And to assure him that whatever happens, we will continue to work for unity, peace, security and progress of this country.\n\n\u201cI know that these are things that are dear to his (Mbang) heart. We want to assure you that Nigeria will continue to exist because the cost for Nigeria not to continue to exist is much more than the cost for us to make Nigeria to continue to exist.\n\n\u201cThere are many people \u2013 high and low \u2013 who can be described as enemies of Nigeria, but they will not win over those who are friends of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nObasanjo promised to continue to work for the peace and progress of a united Nigeria.\n\nThe former President eulogised Mbang for his steadfastness, which had kept their relationship intact over the years, and described the former President of the Christian Association of Nigeria as a lover of Nigeria.\n\nThe celebrant recalled how he and Obasanjo became friends and that since then \u201cwe have become brothers, but of different mothers.\u201d\n\nAlso at the event, the Akwa Ibom State Governor and Chairman of the occasion, Udom Emmanuel, thanked the former President and the celebrant for keeping together over the years, assuring that they would remain his fathers.\n\nThe book, a memoir, chronicling the journey of the octogenarian, is titled: \u201cMy Life and Times, a Memoir by Sunday Mbang\u201d.

          "text": "*Declares there are too many voices of anger calling for justice in the affairs of the nation\n\nOmon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nDelta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa has expressed worry about the various challenges confronting the country, calling on the federal government to convoke a national dialogue \u201cto enable Nigerians talk to one another on the way forward in tackling the issues threatening to wreck the nation\u2019s ship.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at an inter-denominational thanksgiving service to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the creation of Delta State, held at St. Peters Anglican Cathedral, Asaba, yesterday, Okowa said that the state of the nation required urgent but realistic approach that would ensure lasting solution to the various challenges threatening to tear the nation apart.\n\nThe governor said that the federal government should not pretend that all was well with the country as \u201cthere are too many voices of anger calling for justice, fairness and equity in the affairs of the nation,\u201d while urging the government to take steps to listen to the voices without further delay.\n\nHe expressed dismay that the nation was still paying lip service to its status as a federal system, as too much power is still concentrated in the centre against the principles of true federalism.\n\nHe likened the nation to the human body with many parts, which needed to be healthy for the whole body to function properly, saying that it could not be well with the nation, \u201cif it is not well with the component parts.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned against building the nation for the elite and the rich while the poor masses were left in the lurch.\n\nOkowa said, \u201cThe rich and the elite will not live peacefully in a country where there are many poor people.\n\n\u201cWe are still in a nation where so much power rests at the centre, with the federal government, and I believe that it is not right and it is time for more powers to be devolved to the states and more money and resources given to the states.\n\n\u201cNigeria will be better for it if we restructure, but the greatest challenge we have is as a result of insecurity and it is pushing many people more into the poverty line.\n\n\u201cAs a country, we are troubled and there are so many ethno-religious crises but it\u2019s time for us to sit down and talk, otherwise we may not be able to continue as a nation.\n\n\u201cIn staying as a nation, we must find solutions to the voices of anger and we must dispassionately look for the opinion leaders in the different parts of Nigeria and speak truth to ourselves.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the governor congratulated all Deltans on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the state\u2019s creation, noting that the state had come thus far because God\u2019s presence had been with it.\n\nOkowa recalled that when the state was created in 1991, it was greeted with cautious optimism, but thanked God that 30 years after, Deltans had become more united as a people.\n\nHe paid tribute to past leaders of the state for laying a solid foundation for its development, saying \u201cwe have come to realise that we are one people though with different ethnic groups and we have come to realise that we can only do better if we work together as one state.\n\n\u201cI thank our past leaders for laying a solid foundation for the development of the state which we have been building upon.\n\n\u201cWe thank God because that foundation is truly strong. Today in Delta we can look round and find that there are many growing towns in the state unlike most states.\n\n\u201cWe have several growing cities in Delta State and when you take a tour to many states, you will find out that God has truly blessed us in Delta.\n\n\u201cWe are growing at our own pace; we may not all be able to grow at the same pace and we must realise this as a nation,\u201d he stated.\n\nBishop of Anglican Diocese of Asaba, Rt. Rev\u2019d Justus Mogekwu, in his sermon said Delta was a microcosm of Nigeria because of the diverse ethnic groups in the state, but stated that in spite of the diversity, the people lived together in unity, love and peace.\n\nHe commended Deltans for their resolve to work and live together in the overall interest of the state, adding that a state where bigotry, bloodshed, bitterness, intolerance, among other vices, existed could hardly make any progress.\n\nQuoting from the Bible, Mogekwu said that the future was bright for the state, as long as Deltans continued to put their trust in God in all their ways.\n\nHe pointed out that politics without integrity has been the bane of Nigeria\u2019s development and urged politicians to stop cross-carpeting from one political party to another.\n\nThe thanksgiving service was attended by wife of the Governor, Dame Edith Okowa, Deputy Governor, Mr. Kingsley Otuaro; former governor of the state, Chief James Ibori; his former deputy, Sir Benjamin Elue and former military administrator of the state, Navy Captain Walter Feghabo (rtd).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerian fintech apps users confident despite regulatory crackdown",
          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time. Today, we have gone on to get a place of our own, and we\u2019re growing each passing day.\u201d \u2014 Onyekwere, CEO, Queen\u2019s Fruits.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, there are a lot of things that make a business thrive. And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised. During the lockdown, I was still able to onboard offline customers to our, at the time, new online platform, and this helped me reach more people and especially, made for ease of interaction with offline clients.\u201d \u2014 F.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Wole Soyinka, a Nobel laureate, has faulted plans by President Muhammadu Buhari to go ahead with the reopening of grazing routes across Nigeria despite opposition to the plans.\n\nPresident Buhari had recently approved recommendations of a committee to review 368 grazing sites, across 25 states in the country, and to determine the levels of encroachment.\n\nBut speaking at a press conference, Friday in Lagos State, Soyinka noted that such idea was not in the best interest of Nigeria.\n\nHe added that many experts have recently identified ranching as the solution to the perennial farmer-herder conflict across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cVirtually the whole nation is screaming that we do not want any open cattle grazing. Whether they go by the name of cattle routes or grazing reserves.\u201d\n\n\u201cRound the entire nation, we\u2019ve had opinions surmounting the antiquated mode of cattle rearing. Even the all-powerful, untouchable Miyetti Allah, even they have gone on record to say that ranching is what we want.\n\nRead Also: Buhari approves review of grazing reserves in 25 States\n\n\u201cAnd when we think all that debate is settled in rational terms, along comes a new version, rather like Decree 4, of Ruga, with the President insisting on sending his agents out to map out and recover the old grazing reserves when governments and people and experts, agronomists, business people are saying that this is a business and it should be conducted in this particular way.\n\n\u201cSo why is this President obsessed about something which is being rejected right, left and centre?\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, the scholar faulted the recent query the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission issued to Channels Television after interviewing some key personality on the state of the nation.\n\nRead also: Explainer: What are grazing reserves?\n\nHe likened it to Decree 4, an instrument designed to gag the press during the military era in Nigeria.\n\nSoyinka, while also condemning the Department of State Services (DSS) raid on Sunday Igboho\u2019s residence, called for the immediate release by the Benin Republic authorities.\n\n\u201cIgboho peacefully demonstrated, I don\u2019t consider someone calling for secession as committing a criminal act.

          "title": "HR experts give tips on interviewing for a dream job",
          "text": "Getting a job in Nigeria keeps getting tough as opportunities in the labour market are shrinking, leading to an all-time high unemployment rate of 33.3 percent.\n\nWith fewer opportunities in the job market, employers and recruiters may become strict in selecting applicants for the needed roles in their companies.\n\nThat is why it is important especially for those new to job hunting, to know the right guidelines when preparing for an interview towards getting a dream job.\n\nIn a previous BusinessDay article, tips to note when writing a compelling Curriculum Vitae (CV) were highlighted. Here is a follow-up and concluding part of the series. Some Human Resource (HR) professionals interviewed gave some key guidelines to note when preparing for an interview\n\nAdebambo Aina, HR Advisor at Afrinvest (West Africa) Limited, a wealth advisory firm\n\nAn interview gives you the opportunity to sell yourself by showcasing your knowledge and skill. That is why it is important that you speak intelligently and keep the conversation going as much as possible. When asked a question and you do not say much, it makes the interview boring, ending it quickly.\n\nRead also: 5 HR experts on how to write compelling CV\n\nKnow about the industry that the role you are being interviewed for. It gives you extra points because you know more about the basic things that concern that business.\n\nAsk one or two interesting questions; do not be shy to ask questions that you did not hear properly or understand. Also, practice your lines to know how you are going to grow in the conversation from the beginning so that you will be able to nail it. If you start on a good note, it gives you the assurance to flow well till the end. But, if you miss the first hurdle, then there is that tendency you might lose focus.\n\nLastly, most interviews are now done virtually. So, when given the link to the interview, try it out first. Make sure you have the zoom application, know how to navigate your way around it, have a good internet connection and a nice background.\n\nAbidemi Ajai, HR Manager at Nosak Farm Produce Limited, a fully integrated agro-industrial company\n\nFrom the point where an applicant receives an invite, it is important that he/she acknowledges it. That is what I look out for first.\n\nWhen you are asked certain questions, do not rush to answer even if you know them because it is not polite when you stop the interviewer from asking his or her full questions. It is feedback to them that you will be a good listener.\n\nAlso, it is important you provide answers based on the questions you\u2019re being asked. Please note that there is nothing wrong if you cannot answer a question. You can be honest and say you do not know it and that you will research it after the interview.\n\nJennifer Oyelade, director of Transquisite Consulting, an international human resource consultancy\n\nWhat will make a candidate really stand out is talking about information that is not obvious. So, research in detail about the achievements that the company has had in the last six months or one year, how long they have been in operation, new products or services they are launching and how their turnover was.\n\nIt shows that you have an interest in the company and not just looking for a job. I will also suggest candidates should have at least five solid questions to ask the interviewer that is surrounding career progression, what is expected for them in the role they are recruiting or applying for.\n\nUnini Mosimabale, HR at Alles Charis Gas Limited\n\nAlways maintain eye contact with each of the panellists regardless of who asked you the question as it shows a level of confidence. But don\u2019t hold the contact for too long so it doesn\u2019t seem rude as well.\n\nWhile answering, look from one panellist to the other so they know you are addressing them all, not just one person.\n\nDress decently and pay attention to solid or cooperate colours. You don\u2019t want to show up in a neon green jacket that screams \u201clook at me!\u201d Wear something like navy blue, black, deep brown, burgundy/wine jacket or skirt. Your dressing will boost your confidence too so dress well and smell nice. Sleep well the previous night so you can look fresh and relaxed.\n\nWinnifred Omobolanle, Operations Lead at Utiva, an Edutech company\n\nWhen questions are asked, try to understand and apply them to the company\u2019s situation. For example, I am doing back to back interviews for a group manager and I ask him or her a question on how they will generate (prospects) for the company or get people to be even interested in the products or services of the company. So, the way they answer the question at that time helps me to know when this person will understand what is required for him or her to do the job.",

          "text": "In the 1970s, leaving Nigeria for the United Kingdom as a mental health professional was inspired by his desire to acquire international experience for a good speciality practice.\n\nFemi Olugbile, former permanent secretary, Ministry of Health, Lagos State, was then thirsty for what lay ashore of Nigeria as he pursued a postgraduate degree in one of Edinburgh\u2019s best centres for mental health before returning to the country.\n\nOver four decades later, Nigeria is on the losing side of the quest for better economic benefits by emigrating medical professionals.\n\nNigerian medical doctors on Wednesday trooped in their hundreds to the Sheraton Hotel in Abuja for the recruitment exercise organised by the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health.\n\nThe professionals from different specialities defied the early morning rain for the exercise which began as early as 7 am, in pursuit of what they believe would be a ticket to a lifetime opportunity to escape the \u201cunfavourable working conditions\u201d endured in Nigeria for a relieving system in Saudi Arabia.\n\nJennifer Oyelade, director of Transquisite Consulting, an international human resource consultancy noted that Saudi Arabia could gain cheap labour from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf you look around the world, Nigerians are known for their excellence and education so it makes sense that Arabs will come to Nigeria to get the best of the best to take care of their citizens,\u201d Oyelade said.\n\nShe further added that it is going to be a win for professionals going abroad and a loss for those in Nigeria as their talents are being tapped in by international organisations that see their value and worth as they are ready to pay them for their expertise.\n\nDoctors who spoke to BusinessDay expressed optimism that they can finally toe a path to attain their career goals.\n\nThey decried that they feel neglected and unwanted in Nigeria following the attitude of the Nigerian government to their affairs, and are therefore determined to seize the opportunity presented by Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt was a mixed atmosphere of anxiety, excitement, and hope.\n\nThe interview process was held in two different sessions in order to speed up the process as more and more doctors arrived at the location. The seats were all occupied and many doctors were seen standing patiently waiting for their turn with their credentials.\n\nThe exercise is being conducted by consultancy agencies on behalf of the Saudi Ministry of Health.\n\nThe required categories are anaesthesia, ICU, paediatric, family medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology, eyes nose and throat (ENT), and emergency medicine, internal medicine, ophthalmology, radiology and surgery among others.\n\nThe recruitment exercise which began on Wednesday was conducted by PAS solutions, with another recruitment for medical registrars were held on Thursday in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe reason people are migrating is not to work in good companies but because they know that everybody is economically stranded,\u201d Femi Olugbile told BusinessDay.\n\nDaniel Ibiye, one of the doctors who attended the headhunting, tied the rush towards the offer to familiar challenges of unfavourable conditions of work and poor and inconsistent remuneration among others.\n\nRead also: Brain Drain 3.0: The exodus that\u2019s not being televised\n\nThe ongoing strike compounds the woes of welfare tussle with the federal government.\n\nIbiye thinks there is no incentive to stay back when he can make five times his current earnings in Saudi Arabia than in a country where doctors are not appreciated, despite pouring a lot of energy, and time into their work.\n\nIhuoma Okeke, an ophthalmologist said she can no longer bear the seeming lack of hopelessness in the country saying apart from the unfavourable working environment for medical practitioners, insecurity, on the other hand, is a major push factor.\n\n\u201cWe are not safe here. I don\u2019t feel safe here. I work at the Federal Medical Centre in Keffi, Nasarawa state and I\u2019m managing to see how I can cope,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI will not suffer the pains of medical school and residency training to be sacrificed overnight. Saudi Arabia is offering me a better working opportunity to build my career, they will guarantee my security and give me a better working condition.\u201d\n\nAndrew Agboola, obstetrician and gynaecologist looks forward to better pay.\n\nEven if he plans to go into private practice, he said the problem of multiple taxations at federal, state and local government levels is very discouraging.\n\n\u201cThe cost of equipment is high especially when you are importing them and the exchange rate. I personally can\u2019t even afford a good ultrasound scan. I am managing about N400, 000 or even second hand. Even to borrow a loan from the bank is also another problem, the challenges are just too much,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Debo Odulana, a medical doctor and founder, Doctoora, a platform that links health experts to equipment, most of the doctors heading to Saudi Arabia will use the country as a transit point to Europe or the United States.\n\nHe explained that doctors leave at two stages in their career: before they specialize and after they specialize. But because of the way things are going, Nigeria is seeing doctors leave in the middle of their specialist training, preferring to specialise abroad than to continue the training here.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the people going to Saudi Arabia are only going for a while so that they can go elsewhere because the barrier is very low. Most people will be able to prepare and write their exams to move to the UK. If a consultant leaves here, they have the potential to earn 10 times more. They get housing and most things covered as part of the employment,\u201d Odulana said.\n\nNigeria has about 35,000 doctors registered with the Medical and Dental Council. About 8,000 leave yearly, between 1,000 and 1,200 are added from university, and barely over 4,000 specialists are available across the entire country.\n\nNigeria will not be able to afford doctors until the central problem of poor healthcare funding is addressed, Odulana said.\n\nAnd as long as the country cannot fix the structure around payment for healthcare services both at the government and private level and doctors cannot earn well, the challenge will persist, he added.",

          "title": "Health, environment, safety top agenda as Edo Marks 30th anniversary \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said that the state government will continue to make investment in preserving the health, safety and environment of Edo people as the state marks its 30th anniversary.\n\nObaseki said this during the flag-off a tree-planting campaign held at Idu village in Orhionmwon Local Government Forest Reserve, as part of activities to mark the 30th anniversary of Edo State. The tree-planting campaign is in line with the government\u2019s reforestation initiative of planting ten million trees in the next ten years.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs we celebrate 30 years of the existence of Edo as a State, we must realize that we live in a world that is being ravaged by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We have lost loved ones: friends and family. Even as we celebrate our glorious nation and our proud heritage, circumstances demand that we must summon all effort, as a people, to ensure that we protect ourselves against the deadly scourge.\n\n\u201cConsidering the nature of this unusual enemy, we must quickly adopt a sustainable approach to effectively deal with this scourge along with the disruptions associated with it. That is why to defeat the virus, vaccination is a necessity.\n\n\u201cThose countries and communities with high rates of vaccination are recording fewer hospitalizations and lifting all restrictions. We have to be at the forefront of ensuring that we all get inoculated against COVID-19 so that we can build herd immunity and more lives will not be lost needlessly.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cAs we protect ourselves from the pandemic, we must also take cognizance of our environment. Environmental sustainability is key to our cultural and economic preservation. The rich forest reserves that our ancestors passed to us have been seriously degraded and depleted, leading to adverse weather conditions that threaten our existence as a people.\n\n\u201cEdo has always been known as the centre of the rainforest belt in Nigeria and West Africa and we have a responsibility to regenerate our forests. It is for this reason that we, collaborating with private stakeholders, have embarked on a reforestation program to have ten million trees planted in Edo State, over the next decade. We must balance environmental sustainability with livelihoods and strategically reclaim our expansive forest lands for present and future generations.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate Edo at 30 today, our emphasis and focus must be on environmental sustainability. In the post-fossil fuel era, we must strive to redevelop our natural resources in forestry and its value chain. That is why I will be planting trees as a significant step in leading our forestry regeneration goal of ten million trees in the next ten years.\n\n\u201cAlong with our forest regeneration drive, we also want to keep our forests and our land safe. With your support and collaboration of security agencies in the state, we will be re-establishing a forestry protection force to ensure that bandits cannot use our forest as basis to foster criminality,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nReassuring the government\u2019s commitment to the security of lives and property of Edo citizens, Obaseki stated: \u201cWe are determined to improve on the feat recorded so far in terms of security in the state and ensure that kidnapping, armed robbery, land grabbing and other criminal activities are reduced to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cOur security strategy is hinged on collaboration between the national security structure and the Edo State Community Vigilante Security Network so that community participation is a key driver in our security plan.\u201d\n\nHe further added: \u201cOur mission to Make Edo Great Again (MEGA) will only be a pipe dream without rethinking the methods that got us to this point and recalibrating existing systems to address our peculiar challenges, in the quest to compete and dominate in a fast-changing world. To achieve our mission of MEGA comprehensively, we must involve our kit and kin in Delta State.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore commencing discussions to establish a Bendel Commission to foster mutual cooperation and collaboration in economic, security, cultural and environmental matters between Edo and Delta States.\u201d\n\n\u201cI invite all Edo people to join in celebrating this 30-year milestone, as we have all shown resilience, courage, strength and determination in building a strong and virile state, even as we look forward to the next 30 years of growth and shared prosperity,\u201d the governor charged.\n\nSharing a brief history of the origin of the Edo people, Obaseki said \u201cthe Edo Nation has always been renowned as pacesetters: The old Midwestern Region, from where Bendel State was formed, was the first state in Nigeria to be created by a referendum, signaling how strongly we have always sought self-actualization, self-preservation and embraced democratic ideals.\n\n\u201cAs a people, we come from forebears who displayed exceptional sophistication in Arts, organization and development. This enthralled the Europeans when their ships berthed on our shores as far back as the fifteenth century. By this time, we had built an architectural marvel with the largest earthwork in human history, with city walls four times the length of the renowned Great Walls of China; traces of which are evident today in what is popularly known as the Benin Moat.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe world was awed by the splendour of Benin City, which by the 15th century had palm-oil-lit street lights which illuminated its very broad streets, some over a hundred feet wide, with underground channels to drain stormwater and check flooding.\n\nThis is not to mention our elaborate governance and judicial systems, with courts and enforceable penal laws.\n\n\u201cWith this deep history and heritage, we have survived the ages and our people have continued making indelible marks globally. The spirit and blood of our ancestors run deep in us. This strong sense of identity has led us to rise above our challenges in our quest for sustainable development, growth and progress; today, we celebrate yet another milestone.\n\n\u201cThroughout our history, the key driver of our prowess has been our human capacity. It cannot be different today. That is why we are emphasizing education as the fulcrum for our development. The Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) programme is globally recognised as one of the most significant Education reforms programme in Africa today.\n\n\u201cWe are repositioning our civil and public service to provide world-class service to Edo people at home and abroad. We have continued to invest in our youth through various programs spearheaded by the Edo Skills Development Agency (EdoJobs), which has given birth to numerous enterprises in the Edo Production Centres, Edo Tech Hub and Edo Creative Hub.\n\n\u201cThe next few decades will witness Edo State becoming the Technology Hub in Nigeria as we create more partnerships to train and develop thousands of young people into competent software developers and Tech solutions providers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough some of the challenges that beset us today may differ from those of our forebears, but like them, our ability to make deliberate, concerted and sustained efforts to overcome adversity is very much assured. In the face of difficulty, we will remain bold, decisive and united, as these values have always guaranteed our survival, advancement and triumph,\u201d he noted.\n\n...",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Notorious bandit sets conditions for peace in Katsina",
          "text": "A notorious banditry kingpin in Katsina State, Usman Idris, aka \u2018Ruga Kachallah\u2019, is asking for compensation for his burnt house and grains and the arrest of his wives as the condition for ending his criminal activities in the state.\n\nBut the police have responded that they are not interested in negotiating with Mr Kachallah because he had publicly renounced banditry on four previous occasions but had gone back to his old ways each time.\n\nMr Kachallah is believed to be leading criminal activities in Safana Local Government Area (LGA) of Katsina State, according to PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 findings.\n\nLocals and security sources in the state told this newspaper that a large army of bandits under him routinely kidnap people for ransom and rustle cattle without restraint.\n\nLawful business?\n\nHowever, the banditry kingpin is also involved in \u2018lawful business\u2019 that has endeared him to the local populace. He has many commercial vehicles on the road, which generate daily income for him and create employment for grateful locals.\n\nIn Tulumbusawa, \u2018Yartsaku, Makera, Gimi and Chirena in Safana LGA, locals obey his orders and seek his permission to cultivate their farmlands.\n\nIn the northern fringe of Runka town, the second largest community in Safana LGA, farmers have also submitted to the reign of the banditry kingpin.\n\nHowever, Mr Kachallah is not hiding in the forest like most other bandits. He lives in Gimi with his family. Recently, the residents of the town resisted an attempt by security agents to arrest one of his lieutenants, identified only as Gulbi.\n\nMr Gulbi is said to handle the sale of rustled cows for Mr Kachallah.\n\nThe police area commander in Safana, Dutsin-Ma, Danmusa, Kurfi and Batsari LGAs, Aminu Umar-Daye, withdrew his personnel in the face of resistance by the locals when he tried to take Mr Gulbi into custody.\n\nThe residents said the security agents would not be there to protect them from the fury of Mr Kachallah who they were sure would blame his aide\u2019s arrest on informants from the community.\n\nBut later on May 25, the security agents raided Mr Kachallah\u2019s house. Although he was absent, they got hold of two of his wives before setting fire to his house.\n\nBut residents mobilised to put out the fire. After allegedly being told that people from neighbouring Rumka helped the police in the operation, Mr Kachallah allegedly vowed to deal with the community.\n\nImmediately after the incident, Mr Kachallah kidnapped Lawan Garba, a primary school teacher from Rumka working in Gimi. He held the teacher hostage and demanded the unconditional release of his wives.\n\nOn May 29, he also allegedly abducted one Murtala Umaru, a grain grinder in Gimi, who also hailed from Rumka.\n\nOn June 8, one Bishir Lola and his son, Mubarak, were kidnapped while working on the farm. The kidnappers received N300,000 and N20,000 recharge cards as ransom for their release. However, days later, the decomposed corpses of the two were found abandoned in the bush.\n\nResidents blamed the crime on Mr Kachallah, saying it was to scare farmers away from their farms.\n\nMr Kachallah intensified his kidnap for ransom business. He vowed to continue until the security agents released his wives, which they eventually did in exchange for the release of the primary school teacher, Mr Garba, on July 11. Aside from having his wives back, a ransom of N300,000 was also reportedly paid to Mr Kachallah. He said the money was for the services of lawyers he hired for the release of his wives.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPolice onslaught\n\nIn 2016, Mr Kachallah, also known as \u2018Ruga Kachallah\u2019, had joined other banditry kingpins, including Abdullahi Karki, in renouncing banditry at a ceremony attended by the Secretary to the Government of Katsina State, Mustapha Inuwa, in Illela town of Safana LGA.\n\nBut soon after the ceremony, Mr Kachallah continued his reign of terror. His foot soldiers roam the communities looking out for strange faces and security movements as well as kidnap prospects and residents who deserve permits to cultivate their farmlands.\n\nOn June 12, one of his lieutenants, Idi Dolo, of Hausa ethnic group, was arrested by security agents in Gimi. Unconfirmed reports said Mr Kachallah sent money and lawyers to the police area command headquarters in Dutsin-Ma to press for his release.\n\nHowever, the police commissioner in Katsina, Sunusi Buba, quickly ordered the transfer of the suspect to the command\u2019s headquarters in Katsina to scupper any deal.\n\nUnder police clampdown, another of Mr Kachallah\u2019s foot soldiers, Jummah Tambai, fled Katsina with his family to Nasarawa State from where reportedly fled to a mining site in Osun State.\n\nMr Kachallah\u2019s father, Idris Maza, who hailed from Sullubawa in Safana LGA, also relocated to Banki in Anchau Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The father reportedly said he relocated because he could not stop his son from banditry.\n\nHardened criminal\n\nSani Na-Ammee, a former accomplice of Mr Kachallah who has renounced banditry, told PREMIUM TIMES that he tried to persuade Mr Kachallah to stop criminality.\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult for people who are used to counting millions as ransom to come back to normal living. For me now, I am even planning to sell off my motorcycle to raise some money to cultivate my farms,\u201d Mr Na-Ammee said.\n\n\u201cI told Alhaji Kachallah on different occasions to allow people to cultivate their farms but things deteriorated after security agents arrested his wives and burnt down his house. He started ignoring my calls because he knows my mission is peace.\u201d\n\nHowever, Mr Na-Ammee said he was able to convince Mr Kachallah to stop abducting local farmers in parts of Rumka. He said stopping people from going to farms can only further raise the already high cost of grains and make life difficult for the people of the area where he was born.\n\nWhy I am in banditry \u2013 Kachallah\n\nPREMIUM TIMES was able to get Mr Kachallah into a conversation on the telephone during which he acknowledged the crimes attributed to him.\n\n\u201cAll what you heard about me is true and I am doing that for a reason. The security agents arrested four of my boys and my wives and burnt 100 bags of my grains.\u201d\n\nMr Kachallah also gave his conditions for peace. He said the security agents should release all his boys and pay for the destruction of his grains, which he said is now sold at N30,000 per bag.\n\n\u201cI initially harvested 160 bags of grains but after I gave out zakat during Ramadan, I had 100 bags left. But the police area commander came and burnt them and went away with my wives.\n\n\u201cI called the area commander but he refused to pick my calls because he knew what he did. Also, I called the district head of Safana and the local government chairperson to help seek justice for me and release my wives but all to no avail,\u201d Mr Kachallah told PREMIUM TIMES.\n\n\u201cAfter all efforts were exhausted, I decided to take as hostage the primary school teacher, Mr Garba, until my wives were eventually released. But I am still demanding payment of compensation for the burning of my house and grains,\u201d Mr Kachallah said.\n\nHe named his arrested lieutenants as Lawalli Wamzam; Abdullahi Idris; Sule Yellow; and Idi Dolo. He said they are \u2018ordinary labourers\u2019 working on his farm plantations.\n\n\u201cI was among the first people that accepted the peace dialogue in Katsina. But I was poorly treated and given only a rickety motorcycle while the other repentant bandits were given preferential treatment. That is why I returned to the forest,\u201d Mr Kachallah said.\n\nMr Kachallah said after the initial peace dialogue, the state government was misled by the leaders of Miyetti Allah to ignore him and instead appease other bandits considered to possess more weapons than him.\n\n\u201cI went on my own round the forest and convinced bandits operating in my domain and beyond to accept the peace dialogue. Despite all these efforts, the Miyetti Allah leaders betrayed me and eventually blocked my little incentives coming from the government,\u201d Mr Kachallah said.\n\nNo condition for repentant bandit \u2013 Police\n\nThe police in Katsina, however, said they will not succumb to Mr Kachallah\u2019s tricks or accept conditions from any bandit willing to repent.\n\nThe police spokesperson, Gambo Isah, said Mr Kachallah had renounced banditry about four times only to backtrack after each occasion. He said the police would not fall to his deceit anymore.\n\nHowever, the police said they would welcome any bandit who voluntarily repents and renounces banditry unconditionally.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has stated clearly that there is no negotiation between the bandits and the government and that is the stand of the police in Katsina State,\u201d the police spokesperson told PREMIUM TIMES.\n\nThere was peace after talks with bandits \u2013 Government\n\nThe Katsina State Government insisted that its 2016 peace dialogue with bandits resulted in peace between farmers and herders in the state.\n\nThe chief press secretary to the governor, Aliyu Abdullahi, told PREMIUM TIMES that the dialogue needs to be adopted by governments in adjoining North-west and North-central states where bandits operate, to succeed.\n\nThe official said Mr Kachallah was among the initial bandits\u2019 leaders who earlier embraced dialogue, at a ceremony at Ilela town in Safana LGA, where many of his accomplices accepted the peace dialogue. However, he later returned to the forest to terrorise residents, he said.\n\nMr Abdullahi said the state government sincerely initiated the Dialogue/Amnesty Committee headed by the Secretary to the Katsina State Government, Mustapha Inuwa. However, the situation got worse due to the unorganised nature of the bandits operating in the forest transversing Katsina and Zamfara states.\n\nOn January 15, 2017, the committee facilitated the surrender of over 340 small arms from the bandits in Kankara LGA where the bandits\u2019 designated president, Buharin Daji (now killed); the state governor, Aminu Masari, and security heads serving in the state attended the event, Mr Abdullahi said.\n\nFollowing the event, the surrendered arms were destroyed under the supervision of the United Nations\u2019 delegation and the federal government. Communities in Katsina were living in peace following the peace dialogue, he said.\n\nThe state government built at least ten schools and dispensaries across the herders\u2019 communities as requested during the dialogue. He said the bandits refrained from attacking communities in 2017, 2018 and 2019; adding that there was peace in Katsina following the sincere peace dialogue with the bandits.\n\n\u201cThings started deteriorating in 2020 when the neighbouring Zamfara State announced its peace dialogue and amnesty for bandits in which many of the bandits didn\u2019t surrender their arms but relocated to Katsina, Kaduna and Niger states and started unleashing mayhem on residents,\u201d Mr Abdullahi said.\n\n\u201cThe renewed attacks in Katsina communities thwarted the ongoing construction of schools and dispensaries earlier reached in the agreement with the bandits in Katsina. The strange bandits made many areas dangerous for construction workers, which eventually truncated the peace process because the bandits are unorganized in the forest.\n\n\u201cThe adjoining North-west states need a holistic approach for either stick and carrots to address the menace of banditry. Katsina State Government is supportive of the security agencies in the state in whatever form in tackling the bandits. However, we would not dialogue with the bandits, anymore,\u201d the government spokesperson said.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), has said the decision of Imo State Governor, Sen. Hope Uzodinma to back out of the decision of Southern Governors to implement anti-open grazing laws in their states, is \u201can unfortunate betrayal of the Igbo race.\u201d\n\nRecall that Senator Uzodinma had after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday, backtracked from the resolution of Southern governors to ban upon grazing in the region, with deadline for legislation set for September 1, opting instead for what he called understating between farmers and herders in the state.\n\nReacting to the governor\u2019s decision in a statement by Abia Onyike, Chairman of its Media and Publicity Bureau, the ADF noted that the action Uzodinma has taken, \u201che has unwittingly renounced his membership of the Igbo race, an act which, within the context of Igbo Culture and tradition is a sacrilege. If indeed ha has done so, nothing short of spiritual cleansing can abate the wrath of Igbo Ancestors.\u201d\n\nThe ADF called on the governor to immediately reverse the decision and ban open grazing in line with the resolution of Southern governors.\n\n\u201cWe therefore advise him to quickly go for spiritual cleansing before he can be seen as a normal member of the Igbo race,\u201d ADF further noted.\n\n\u201cThe anti-open grazing law is the most focal law in Igbo land today. It is needed and intended to protect the Igbo race and safeguard her ancestral lands. So, for any Igbo Governor or person for that matter to renounce the anti-open grazing law is a pointer that he subscribes to the wiping out of the Igbo race from existence.\n\n\u201cOne of his lawyers has publicly acknowledged that there was an anti- open grazing law in Imo State, passed by the State House of Assembly during the tenure of former Governor Achike Udenwa, one of the predecessors of Gov. Hope Uzodinma.Thus what Gov. Uzodinma has done is to renounce an existing law made in the interest of the people. This is an impeachable offence.\n\n\u201cWhether the present Imo state Legislature takes action to preserve the Constitutional order order in Imo State or not, Imo state cannot claim to have a legitimate Executive Governor in the present circumstances.\n\n\u201cMay the Almighty God protect and preserve the people of Imo state and return a Constitutional order to their besieged state.\u201d",

Later, Goita was named interim president.\n\nAccording to Ndaw and Ouane\u2019s aides, the two leaders were placed under house arrest after their removal.\n\nECOWAS said on Friday that the two should be allowed to use all of their powers as former president and prime minister.\n\nFollowing an appeal by Ndaw and Ouane to the ECOWAS Court of Justice, which recently ordered that Mali justify their incarceration, the restrictions were lifted.\n\nSince their dismissal in May, neither Ndaw nor Ouane have made any public statements.\n\nFor his part, Goita has pledged to restore civilian authority and hold elections in February of the following year.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that the administration would be able to hold elections in such a short period of time in the face of widespread violence in Mali.\n\nThe government has been battling an armed revolt that began in the north of the country in 2012 and has now extended to the country\u2019s center as well as neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\nTo date, thousands of military and civilians have died in the battle.\n\nAccording to SITE Intelligence, the al-Qaeda-affiliated Group to Support Islam and Muslims claimed responsibility for an August attack that killed 17 Malian soldiers on Friday.",

          "text": "As several states hurry to remove their citizens studying in Plateau State as a result of the activities of bloodthirsty men on the prowl, killing unsuspecting residents, indigenes, and those who have become stuck, the state remains tense.\n\nRecall that Plateau State was recently thrown into an unexpected security crisis following the August 13 slaughter of over 30 travelers along Rukuba Road in the state\u2019s Jos North Local Government Area.\n\nThe victims were attacked while traveling from Bauchi to Ikare in Ondo State, the bulk of them were Fulanis born and raised in the state.\n\nAccording to the NEWS DIRECT, the incident sparked more attacks in the state, with some \u2018unscrupulous\u2019 individuals launching retaliatory attacks.\n\nDue to the security issue, numerous colleges in the state, including the well-known University of Jos and the Federal College of Forestry, have been compelled to cease academic operations and close their doors until normalcy returns.\n\nThe issue worsened on Wednesday after armed men suspected of being bandits massacred over 35 people in Yelwa Zangam village, Jos North Local Government Area of the State.\n\nBefore commencing the tragic assault, the perpetrators were alleged to have blocked the community\u2019s bridge, preventing security agencies from accessing the area.\n\nMany states in the country have rushed in to evacuate their citizens to prevent being massacred by gunmen alleged to be on the hunt in the state, apparently disturbed by the battles around the university and the continuous flaring of tension and promises of reprisals.\n\nIt will be recalled that the ASUU UniJos Chapters and the Students\u2019 Union Government, SUG, recently sounded the alarm about hoodlums suspected of being bandits killing students at the University.\n\nAt least eight states, including Benue, Enugu, Abia, Ogun, Oyo, Kogi, Kwara, and Gombe, have successfully evacuated their students from Plateau as a result of the ongoing retaliation strikes.\n\nSome stakeholders who spoke with DAILY POST about the ramifications of the evacuation stated it would have a bad impact on the pupils\u2019 mental health.\n\n\u201cThe shock, the emotional stress that those students went through even before they were evacuated is enough to keep them depressed,\u201d Dr Torwe Ngunan, a psychotherapist from Benue State, told our correspondent.\n\n\u201cSome of these students were eyewitness to the killings. They will have difficulties trying to reason properly at least for sometime due to the memory. Right now, they need to be engaged in some social activities so that they can put off some of the horrible memories\u201d.\n\nIn a similar vein, Dr Olawole Michael, a lecturer at the University of Abuja\u2019s Faculty of Social Science, bemoaned the disruption of academic activity in the impacted institutions.\n\n\u201cDefinitely it will affect both the students and the school. To think that after all the setbacks in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic, students are still forced to go home because of security crisis is not good for the ears.\n\n\u201cBe assured that most of the students that were evacuated will not return to the school. That will affect the institution also. No parent will allow his child to go to school in a place where he or she would not be safe,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the closure of the schools, according to DAILY POST, some students, mainly from the southern areas of the country, are still stranded in Jos city as fear of attack grows.\n\nHowever, ASP Ubah Gabriel Ogaba, spokesman for the Plateau State Police Command, told DAILY POST on Friday that security has been tightened up in all locations suffering agitation.\n\nAccording to him, security agents were on the scene prior to the evacuation of students from the State to guarantee that they were not affected by the perpetrators\u2019 mayhem.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there are still students left in the hostels. Many states have evacuated their citizens, some may not publish it in the media but they have.\n\n\u201cEven before the evacuations, we had security everywhere in the state to ensure safety of residents.\u201d\n\nThe Plateau State House of Assembly, on the other hand, issued Governor Simon Lalong a two-week deadline to address the current security situation and restore calm in the state on Friday.\n\nThis was revealed by Hon. Dasun Peter, the Chairman of the House Committee on Information and a member of the House representing Pankshin North, during a world press conference held by the State Assembly in Jos, the State Capital.",

James Akpanudoedehe, at the official inauguration of APC Digital Transformation Committee, Thursday at the national secretariat of the party, said the party would soon be having a paperless organization in which documents, Party registers, permanent membership cards and others would be computerized.\n\nThe 8-member committee is mandated to craft and implement a digital transformation strategy for the party, by digitizing the party membership record, and recommend how to use digital technology to enhance and make the party activities more efficient and effective. Buni noted that the world had since become a global village and ways have evolved whereby tasks are simplified and made more efficient, be it in private or public concerns, hence the party has demonstrated its commitment, tendency and capacity to finetune its activities and improve the ways and means of engaging the true owners of the Party-which are the masses.\n\n\u201cThe desire of the Leader of our Party-President Muhammadu Buhari is to see that this Party is energized from the bottom-up through more inclusive participation of the masses.\n\n\u201cMr. President is convinced that leveraging technology to transform our organization will add value to the overall objective of the formation of this Party, which is to win elections.\n\n\u201cIt is also our conviction that the introduction and improvement of digital intermediaries (e.g Software applications, websites, social network services) into the structure of our Party, to facilitate internal communication, engage in Political decision-making, organize political action, will transform the overall experience of participation for our party members.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the chairman of the committee, Mr Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, said, \u201d We ought to know that we have been given an unprecedented task. Things are changing and they are changing dramatically. The only way we can survive and thrive today is through technology. Things are changing and digital technology is becoming a source of inspiration for us to do what we do better.\n\n\u201d We can use technology to enhance our processes, services and also to deliver our traditional services more efficiently and transparently.

          "title": "Anambra Guber: Collapse your structure for APC, Okechukwu tells APGA -NigPilot",
          "text": "A chieftain of All Progressives Congress, APC , and Director General of Voice of Nigeria, VON, Mr Osita Okechukwu, has asked leaders of All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, to collapse the party and fuse into the APC as a pragmatic step towards successful and seamless prosecution of the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State.\n\nThe APC chieftain maintained that APGA and APC have a history of long cosy political understanding dating even back to 2013 when a faction of APGA joined the merger of APC, adding that one cannot in 2017, forget how President Muhammadu Buhari more or less saved His Excellency Wille Obiano from his traducers, hence his re-election.\n\nOkechukwu, who is also one of the founding members of APC, said it was that background of the cordial relationship that informed his recent counsel to APGA\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, that suggestion was made from the prism of the pragmatic Zikist political model, which joins us with APGA. Pragmatism is the best strategy for Ndigbo to kill two birds with one stone, because if APGA fuses into APC that will gift APC with three states in the Southeast geopolitical zone \u2013 a milestone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith three strategic states of Southeast in APC\u2019s kitty, that is a halfway stroke to Ndigbo\u2019s ambition of achieving Nigeria president of Igbo extraction in 2023. Therefore, I implore you to kindly consider the fruit in APGA joining APC to win the Anambra governorship. Other details will be cordially harmonized.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy take is that if the two parties-APGA and APC-come together under one bloc, it would then be possible for us to weigh the two flag bearers, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo and Senator Andy Uba, on the scale of which of them could better win the election in terms of acceptability, integrity, public service record, capacity and vision for good governance,\u201d the VON DG stated.\n\nOkechukwu, while faulting the claim by Chinedu Obidigwe that APC was plotting a forceful takeover of Anambra State insisted that the feasibility of his suggestion could be seen from the political understanding between the All Peoples Party (APP) and Alliance for Democracy (AD) in 1999.\n\nHe recalled: \u201cwe must recall that in 1999, based on strategic thinking, AD and APP were merged for the Presidential election.\n\n\u201cBut, although the powers that be wanted Chief Olusegun Obasanjo of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), every stakeholder in APP and AD, and indeed all progressive Nigerians saw the political understanding as a win-win offering on the ballot. So, with the benefit of hindsight, I am seeing the same opportunity for APGA and APC in Anambra State.\u201d\n\nObidigwe, the National Coordinator of APGA Media Warriors, had in a statement to journalists, criticised Okechukwu for asking APGA to integrate fully into APC and join the mainstream of Nigeria politics so as to help Igbo pick the Presidential seat in 2023.\n\nBut, Okechukwu told reporters in Abuja, yesterday, that APGA was missing the point by seeking to remain as a big fish in a small pond of regional politics that has only earned it just one state out of the entire federation.\n\nHe insisted that APGA can, apart from solving its intractable myriad of post-governorship primary litigations join its old ally, APC, to win the governorship, insisted on doing the same thing the same way and expecting a different result.\n\nThe VON DG pleaded with APGA leaders to give serious thoughts to his pragmatic suggestions, noting that indeed the time has come for APGA to explore other avenues to achieve the collective purpose for Ndigbo by teaming up with APC.\n\n\u201cThis tunnel vision of rigid partisanship has remained the bane of Southeast politics. Therefore, I am still calling on my friends in APGA to look up and count the stars. In 2017, President Muhammadu Buhari restored Governor Obiano\u2019s security details on the APC governorship campaign ground. In 2019, Obiano led APGA to reciprocate the grand political gesture of understanding by Mr. President.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, would it not make for a greater political impact and success, if APGA consummates what its leaders started right from 2014 by embracing APC in a closer embrace? They should show patriotism and respect for the campaign for Nigeria President of Igbo extraction by joining the mainstream, which APC\u2019s victory in the governorship poll will enhance,\u201d Okechukwu contended.",

Goita was later declared interim president.\n\nAides to Ndaw and Ouane had indicated that the two leaders had been kept under house arrest after their removal.\n\nECOWAS said on Friday that the two should enjoy all the rights associated with their roles as the former president and the former prime minister.\n\nThe lifting of restrictions follows an appeal from Ndaw and Ouane to the ECOWAS Court of Justice, which recently demanded that Mali justify their detention.\n\nNeither Ndaw nor Ouane has spoken publicly since they were dismissed in May.\n\nGoita, for his part, has promised to restore civilian rule and stage elections in February next year.\n\nHowever, there are doubts about whether the government will be able to hold elections within such a short timeframe in the shadow of rampant violence across Mali.\n\nThe government has been struggling to quell an armed uprising that first broke out in the north in 2012, and which has since spread to the centre of the country and neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.\n\nThousands of soldiers and civilians have been killed in the conflict to date.\n\nOn Friday, the al-Qaeda-affiliated Group to Support Islam and Muslims claimed responsibility for an August attack that killed 17 Malian soldiers, according to a SITE Intelligence.",

          "text": "Hurricane Ida battered Cuba with roof-ripping force on Friday as it churned toward a weekend US landfall along the Louisiana coast, prompting evacuations of flood-prone New Orleans neighborhoods and oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBy late on Friday, Ida was packing sustained winds of up to 80 miles per hour (129 kph), according to the National Weather Service, which expected the storm to intensify significantly before coming ashore as a major hurricane in southeastern Louisiana on Sunday afternoon or evening.\n\nAccording to the the US National Hurricane Center (NHC), Ida is now entering the Gulf of Mexico, adding that it is expected to rapidly intensify before reaching the northern Gulf Coast.\n\nForecasters said Ida would likely make US landfall as a robust Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, generating steady winds nearing 140 mph, heavy downpours and a tidal surge expected to plunge much of the Louisiana shoreline under several feet of water.\n\nInundation from Ida\u2019s storm surge \u2013 high surf driven by the hurricane\u2019s winds \u2013 will likely reach between 10 and 15 feet around the mouth of the Mississippi River, with lower levels extending east along the adjacent coastlines of Mississippi and Alabama, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nScattered tornadoes, widespread power outages and inland flooding from torrential rain across the region were also expected.\n\nLouisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, his state already reeling from a public health crisis stemming from a fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, urged residents to ready themselves for the hurricane immediately.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to finish your preparations,\u201d he told a Friday afternoon news conference. \u201cBy nightfall tomorrow night, you need to be where you intend to ride out the storm.\u201d\n\n\u201cIda certainly has the potential to be very bad,\u201d said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. \u201cIt will be moving quickly, so the trek across the Gulf from Cuba to Louisiana will only take 1.5 days.\u201d\n\nPeople were getting ready in New Orleans on Friday, lining up for groceries and petrol and filling sandbags at places around the city.\n\nSoon after being upgraded from tropical storm to hurricane status, Ida smashed into Cuba\u2019s small Isle of Youth, off the southwestern end of the Caribbean island nation, toppling trees and tearing roofs from dwellings.\n\nThe streets of Havana, the capital, were empty as residents shuttered themselves at home ahead of Ida\u2019s arrival, which government forecasters warned could bring storm surges to Cuba\u2019s western coastline.\n\nJamaica was also flooded by heavy rains, and there were landslides after the passage of the storm. Many roads were impassable, forcing some residents to abandon their homes.\n\nIda, the ninth named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season, may well exceed the strength of Hurricane Laura, the last Category 4 storm to strike Louisiana, by the time it makes landfall, forecasters said. But it pales in comparison to Katrina, the monster Category 5 storm that devastated the region in August 2005, claiming more than 1,800 lives.\n\nA hurricane watch was in effect from Cameron, Louisiana to the Mississippi-Alabama border \u2014 including Lake Pontchartrain, Lake Maurepas and metropolitan New Orleans.\n\nA dangerous storm surge was also possible along the Gulf Coast. If it pushes a storm surge at high tide, Ida could overlap some levees, with 2.1 to 3.4m (7 to 11 feet) of water predicted from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi.\n\n\u201cThere is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge, damaging hurricane-force winds, and heavy rainfall Sunday and Monday, especially along the coast of Louisiana,\u201d the hurricane centre said.\n\nThe mayor of Grand Isle, a Louisiana town on a narrow barrier island in the Gulf, said a voluntary evacuation late Thursday would become mandatory on Friday.\n\nBy the time it reaches the central Gulf Coast Sunday, Ida could dump 15 to 30cm (6 to 12 inches) of rain, with 50cm (20 inches) in isolated areas, from southeast Louisiana to coastal Mississippi and Alabama through Monday morning. More heavy rains are likely across Mississippi when Ida moves inland, causing \u201cconsiderable flash, urban, small stream, and riverine flooding\u201d, the hurricane centre said.",

          "title": "American Forces Keep Up Kabul Airlift Under High Threat Warnings",
          "text": "American forces working under heightened security and threats of another attack pressed ahead in the closing days of the U.S.-led evacuation from Afghanistan after a devastating suicide bombing, and U.S. officials said they had killed a member of the extremist group that the United States believes responsible for it.\n\nA U.S. drone strike early Saturday in eastern Afghanistan killed a member of the country\u2019s Islamic State affiliate, U.S. Central Command said. President Joe Biden has laid responsibility for Thursday\u2019s suicide bombing on that offshoot extremist group which is an enemy both to the West and to Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban and is known for especially lethal attacks.\n\nThe death toll in Thursday\u2019s suicide bombing rose to 169 Afghans, a number that could increase as authorities examine fragmented remains, and 13 U.S. service members.\n\nU.S. Central Command said American officials believed the militant killed in Saturday\u2019s drone strike had been involved in planning strikes against the United States in Kabul, and that there were no other known casualties.\n\nThe U.S. retaliation comes amid a steady flow of grim warnings from the White House and the Pentagon that there could be more extremist attacks targeting U.S. forces ahead of President Joe Biden\u2019s fast-approaching deadline Tuesday to end the airlift and withdraw American personnel.\n\nThe next few days \u201cwill be our most dangerous period to date\u201d in the evacuation, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, hours before the U.S. issued a security alert for four of the airport gates.\n\nThursday\u2019s bombing marked one of the most lethal attacks the country has seen. The U.S. said it was the deadliest day for American forces in Afghanistan since 2011.\n\nAs the call to prayer echoed Friday through Kabul along with the roar of departing planes, the anxious crowds thronging the airport in hope of escaping Taliban rule appeared as large as ever, despite the scenes of victims lying closely packed together in the aftermath of the bombing.\n\nAround the world, newly arriving Afghan evacuees, many clutching babies and bare handfuls of belongings in plastic bags, stepped off evacuation flights in the United States, in Albania, in Belgium and beyond. In Kabul on Friday, Afghan families looked for loved ones among bodies, placed along a hospital sidewalk for identification, of bombing victims who died pleading for a seat on the U.S.-run airlifts.\n\nAfghans, American citizens and other foreigners were all acutely aware the window was closing to get out via the airlift.\n\nJamshad went to the airport Friday with his wife and three small children. He clutched an invitation to a Western country he didn\u2019t want to identify.\n\n\u201cAfter the explosion I decided I would try. Because I am afraid now there will be more attacks, and I think now I have to leave,\u201d said Jamshad, who like many Afghans uses only one name.\n\nThe Pentagon said Friday that there was just one suicide bomber \u2014 at the airport gate \u2014 not two, as U.S. officials initially said. A U.S. official said that the bomber carried a heavier-than-usual load of about 25 pounds of explosives, loaded with shrapnel.\n\nThe U.S. official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss preliminary assessments of the attack. The officials who gave the Afghan death toll also spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.\n\nThe Afghan victims ranged from a hard-working young journalist to an impoverished father, driven to to the airport by hopes of a better life.\n\nThe American dead were 11 Marines, a Navy sailor and an Army soldier. Many had been tiny children when U.S. forces first entered Afghanistan in 2001.\n\nOne, Marine Lance Cpl. Kareem Mae\u2019lee Grant Nikoui, sent a video to a family friend in the United States just hours before he was killed, showing himself smiling and greeting Afghan children.\n\n\u201cWant to take a video together, buddy?\u201d Nikoui asked young boy, leaning in to be in the picture with him. \u201cAll right, we\u2019re heroes now, man.\u201d\n\nBritish officials said two of the country\u2019s citizens and the child of another Briton were among those killed.\n\nOn the morning after the attack, the Taliban used a pickup truck full of fighters and three captured Humvees to set up a barrier 500 meters (1,600 feet) from the airport, holding the crowds farther back from the U.S. troops than before.\n\nU.S. military officials said that some gates were closed and other security measures put in place. They said there were tighter restrictions at Taliban checkpoints and fewer people around the gates.\n\nU.S. officials said evacuees with proper credentials still were being allowed through the gates. Inside, about 5,400 evacuees awaited flights.\n\nU.S. commanders had briefed Biden Friday on developing plans to strike back at the Islamic State and make good on the president\u2019s vow to the attackers to \u201chunt you down and make you pay.\u201d\n\nBiden pronounced the U.S. effort to evacuate Americans, Afghan allies and others most at risk from the Taliban a \u201cworthy mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we will complete the mission,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Taliban have wrested back control of Afghanistan two decades after they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion following the 9/11 attacks. Their return to power has terrified many Afghans, who have rushed to flee the country ahead of the American withdrawal.\n\nMore than 100,000 people have been safely evacuated through the Kabul airport, according to the U.S., but thousands more are struggling to leave.\n\nThe White House said Friday afternoon that U.S. military aircraft had flown out 2,100 evacuees in the previous 24 hours. Another 2,100 people left on other coalition flights.\n\nThe number was a fraction of the 12,700 people carried out by U.S. military aircraft during a brief period when the airlift reached maximum capacity.\n\nFrance ended its own evacuation effort and pulled up stakes on a temporary French embassy at the airport, leaving Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. U.S. allies and others have ended or are ending their airlifts, in part to give the U.S. time to wrap up its own operations.\n\nThe Taliban have said they will allow Afghans to leave via commercial flights after the U.S. withdrawal, but it is unclear which airlines would return to an airport controlled by the militants.",
          "summary": "The death toll in Thursday\u2019s suicide bombing rose to 169 Afghans, a number that could increase as authorities examine fragmented remains, and 13 U.S. service members.\nU.S. Central Command said American officials believed the militant killed in Saturday\u2019s drone strike had been involved in planning strikes against the United States in Kabul, and that there were no other known casualties.\nThe U.S. said it was the deadliest day for American forces in Afghanistan since 2011.\nAfghans, American citizens and other foreigners were all acutely aware the window was closing to get out via the airlift.\nTheir return to power has terrified many Afghans, who have rushed to flee the country ahead of the American withdrawal.",
