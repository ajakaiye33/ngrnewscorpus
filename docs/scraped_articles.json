          "text": "Elders of Ugbokun in Ovia North East Local Government area of Edo State, on Thursday appealed to Governor Godwin Obaseki and the Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, to allow for the completion of a health centre project sited in their community.\n\nThe elders of the community, in conjunction with Talakawa Parliament, a civil society group, led members of the community to the Oba\u2019s palace and also to the Government House to register their demand.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the people, Pa Francis Osawaru said that the health centre was built and donated to the community by one Dr. Osazee Woghiren who had reportedly acceded to their demands when they informed him that the community needed a health facility.\n\n\u201cThe facility was near completion and about to be inaugurated for use when we suddenly saw a board erected on the site with the inscription: \u2018Caveat Emptor, This is Edo State Government Forest Reserve, No Trespass.\u2019\n\n\u201cBased on the proximity of the health centre to the community and to the Benin-Lagos road, people with health emergency need can be taken there and be treated; but as it stands, such is about to be thwarted with the government allegedly taking over the land,\u201d Osawaru said.\n\nAnother community leader, Mrs. Osaretin Aigbidodo, said that the siting of the health centre in the community had helped to solve the problem that pregnant women go through before getting medical attention.\n\nShe lamented that their hopes were about to be dashed with the government laying claim to the land.\n\nAigbidodo appealed to the duo of the governor and the Oba of Benin to allow the completion of the facility for the benefit of the people of the community.\n\nOn his part, president of the Talakawa Parliament, Kola Edokpayi, appealed to Obaseki to allow Dr. Woghiren to complete the Ugbokun medical centre project, adding that the gesture would encourage others to invest in their communities.",

          "text": "By Chioma Obinna\n\nA study led by researchers from the University of Birmingham and Edinburgh, and their counterparts from the University of Lagos, as well as other leading universities in Nigeria, has been awarded the Guinness World Records.\n\nThe study which is the world\u2019s largest scientific collaboration involved over 140,000 patients in 116 countries.\n\nAlso, the record for \u2018Most authors on a single peer-reviewed academic paper is now held by the Universities of Birmingham and Edinburgh after 15,025 scientists around the globe including researchers from the University of Lagos, contributed to major research into the impact of COVID-19 on surgical patients.\n\nFunded by the NIHR, the researchers concluded that patients waiting for elective surgery should be treated as a vulnerable group and access COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the general population \u2013 potentially helping to avoid thousands of post-operative deaths linked to the virus.\n\nAccording to the researchers, it is particularly important for Low- and Middle-income Countries (LMICs) such as Nigeria, where access to vaccination remains limited and mitigation measures like nasal swab screening and COVID-free surgical pathways to reduce the risk of virus-related complications are not available for many patients.\n\nOverall, the scientists which included researchers from the University of Lagos coordinated by Professor Adesoji Ademuyiwa, Hub Director (NIHR Lagos Hub), and other researchers from Lagos State University, University of Ibadan, University of Ilorin, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, University of Abuja, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, University of Port Harcourt, Aminu Kano University, and others, estimated that global prioritisation of pre-operative vaccination for elective patients could prevent an additional 58,687 COVID-19-related deaths in one year.\n\nThe COVIDSurg Collaborative international team of researchers published its findings in BJS, Europe\u2019s leading surgical journal, after studying data from 1,667 hospitals in countries including Australia, Brazil, China, India, Nigeria, UAE, UK and USA.\n\nStudy co-lead author Mr Aneel Bhangu, a surgeon from the University of Birmingham, commented: \u201cBeing awarded the Guinness World Records title for the world\u2019s largest scientific collaboration highlights the scale of our global partnership, which aims to contribute to our understanding of COVID-19 and help to save as many lives as possible around the world.\n\n\u201cIt marks the commitment and hard work of thousands of medical colleagues around the world to understand the changes that are needed in how surgery must be delivered if we are to beat the virus and reduce its impact on surgical patients.\u201d\n\nSpeaking, the NIHR Global Surgery Unit Nigeria Lead, Prof. Adesoji Ademuyiwa of the University of Lagos said: \u201cThe age of building silos is over. We must break down the silos and build bridges. Collaboration in medical research is key and will help achieve within a short time what it will take years to achieve if one goes alone.\n\n\u201cThis award goes to support the proverb that says \u2018if you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go with others\u2019. This collaboration has achieved a tremendous impact by giving guidance to policy makers in care of surgical patients.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Deputy Lead for the Nigerian Hub and Hospital lead for Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, Adewale Adisa said: \u201cThe success of the Collaborative has been a great encouragement to clinical researchers in Nigeria as in many LMICs.\u201d\n\nAdisa believes that the collaborative enjoyed such a large buy-into among partners in LMICs because they are involved in all the stages of the research from design to write-up, unlike the previous models where most partners only contribute data to such studies.\n\nSpeaking, the Principal Investigator at Lagos State University, Dr.Omolara Williams, described the COVIDSurg collaborative award as a delightful surprise that has reinforced the case for strong collaborations and recognised the hard work of all the researchers from across the globe.\n\n\u201cThe spread and diversity of the source of data contribution make the results applicable by policymakers to different contexts and health systems in addressing the impact of COVID-19 on surgical care. \u201cStrong collaborations are essential in today\u2019s world to harness the strength of all stakeholders. Therefore, we must encourage mutually beneficial collaborations to build capacity in medical research, achieve results faster, address disparities and bridge gaps in health outcomes.\u201d\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, five billion people lacked access to surgical care and 143 million more operations per year were required globally. There was already a major global inequity in access to safe and affordable surgery across low and middle-income countries, with an urgent need to expand capacity. The pandemic has acutely worsened that situation.\n\nLaunched in March 2020, the COVIDSurgCollaborative has provided data needed to support changes to surgical delivery in the fastest time frame ever seen by a surgical research group. Research from this huge study group has also explored the timing of surgery after COVID infection, preoperative isolation, and risks of blood clots, all published in the field-leading journal Anaesthesia.\n\nCo-author Mr James Glasbey, also a surgical trainee from the University of Birmingham, stated that: \u201cOver 15,000 surgeons and anaesthetists from across 116 countries came together to contribute to this study making it the largest ever scientific collaboration, surpassing even ground-breaking research from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland. Every day we hear in the news that waiting lists are growing, and patients are unable to access the surgery that they need. This situation sadly is deteriorating in countries all over the world. Policymakers can use the data from this scientific collaboration to safely restart elective surgery.\u201d\n\nDuring the first wave of the pandemic, up to 70 per cent of elective surgeries were postponed, resulting in an estimated 28 million procedures being delayed or cancelled. Whilst surgery volumes have started to recover in many countries, ongoing disruption is likely to continue throughout 2021, particularly in the event of countries experiencing further waves of COVID-19. Vaccination is also likely to decrease postoperative pulmonary complications \u2013 reducing intensive care use and overall healthcare costs.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "As the country celebrates its 61st independence anniversary, some Nigerians have expressed mixed reactions over the current state of the nation since its freedom from colonial rule in 1960.\n\nSome believe that the country has recorded many developments since 1960 in spite of the many challenges the nation has gone through throughout the years.\n\nOthers believe that the country has done nothing compared to countries that got independence after Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC), James Audu, Nigeria succeeded to overcome the civil war that almost divided the country and today, the country is trying it\u2019s best to overcome certain challenges that are rearing their ugly heads to stand against the progress of the country.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOur leaders over the years have shown maturity in handling challenges confronting the country. I strongly believe that as a country, we are learning and very soon, we will overcome and move together as a nation.\n\n\u201cOur coming together as a nation and understanding ourselves will definitely be the beginning of our breakthrough in all spheres of life. When this is achieved, Nigeria will surely be the pride of Africa looking at the human and natural resources God Almighty has blessed the country with.\u201d\n\nHe explained that with all the challenges the country is going through, Nigerians will overcome someday and be a great nation that the world would admire.\n\n61st Independence: Let us rededicate ourselves to Nigeria \u2014- Gov Mohammed\n\nAnother chieftain of the APC, Suleiman Mohammed, argued that the country\u2019s leadership has failed to build on the gains of the country\u2019s founding fathers who fought all their lives to unite the country.\n\nHe noted, \u201cToday in this country we have leaders that care less about the challenges Nigerians are going through. Imagine the rate at which we are killing ourselves everyday that killing a person in this country is no longer news. We have all lost our senses as human beings that even animals do not treat each other the way we behave to each other in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is in Nigeria that you see the highest form of hatred, differences in religion, tribe and all forms of segregation that no any section sees another one with anything good. This way of life keeps drawing us backward everyday, as a divided country, we continue to witness all forms of atrocities in the country and today, everybody is seen as an enemy.\u201d\n\nHe added that today in the country, the leadership has no sense of direction, stressing that there is no definite plan that is guiding the country in the future.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou discover that in developed countries, they work on the plans they have set for themselves and they are working strictly to achieve such targets they have set for themselves and that is why you see them prospering every year. In Nigeria, our leaders rule by accident without any definite plan that they are working to achieve and that is why they could easily be distracted from doing other things that are not meaningful to the welfare of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe leadership is supposed to cater for the welfare of all Nigerians irrespective of where one comes from. The President should be the father of all Nigerians while the governors also be the father of their respective states. What one sees in this country is all forms of favouritism and such characters that simply tells you that we are not truly one in the country. You see development in some places while other places have nothing to show for it but the same country and state.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that the country truly needs leaders that fear God in all their dealings so that they would carry the people along in all spheres of life, adding that such type of leadership would ensure peace and sanity in the country without any form of acrimony.\n\nMrs Comfort Adamu, a businesswoman, lamented that the government of the day cares less about the welfare of those they govern but are interested about themselves, stressing, \u201cHow can we be secured in this country that everybody behaves the way he or she wants. No wonder you see all manner of things happening in the country.\n\n\u201cNigerians are suffering from insecurity, hardship and other things that make Nigerians think that our leaders do not have the fear of God in them looking at the way the very people that elected them into power are suffering. Many have been sent parking from their ancestral lands because of insecurity and no one seems to care for what they are going through. Many others have been killed and property of unimaginable magnitude have been destroyed by enemies in the name of religion or communal conflicts,\u201d she said.\n\nShe called on the leadership of the country to fear God and do the needful to avoid the wrath of God on the day of judgment, calling on Nigerians to be their brothers\u2019 keepers and unite against the enemy of progress in the country.",

Why can\u2019t we move from a situation where we don\u2019t have any indigenous Nigerians in the country but Nigerians?\n\n\u201cSome of you have been here since and even before the state (Katsina) was created. I wonder why you still refer to yourself as indigenous Nigerians. Is it because you refused to assimilate?\n\n\u201cI think I can understand some civil servants who came for one to three years and were posted out to another state. But for those of you who have been here for over thirty years and you are still looking at yourself as non indigene, We need to ask you why.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think if you go to the United States and you go to one of the states, they will start saying for instance indigenous Americans in California; people that are not Californians but living in California. Well, it is discriminatory whichever way you look at it because a Nigerian is a Nigerian and he should feel free wherever he finds himself.\u201d\n\nGovernor Masari made the remark when the recently elected executives of the indigenous Nigerians resident in the state led her members to pay him a courtesy visit on Thursday.\n\nThe recently-elected President of the Indigenous Nigerians Resident in Katsina State, Prince Kunle Awe, who led the delegation said they were in the government house to introduce the newly elected executive members of the association to the Governor as well as inform him of their planned activities and challenges.\n\nDuring the visit, the association also conferred on Governor Masari, an award as the Grand Patron of the Indigenous Nigerians Resident in Katsina State for the fatherly love he bestowed on them.\n\n\u201cWith your permission Sir, we are proposing to set aside a day for both Muslim and Christian members of our association to fast and pray for the peace and security of of the state and our nation Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency Sir, it is also in our agenda to organize an annual unity and cultural day, in which every community registered under this association will be\n\ngiven the opportunity to showcase their culture, food, dance, historical facts among others. I believe this would promote unity among us and make our children know more about our various cultures in Nigeria,\u201d Awe said.\n\nThe new Indigenous Nigerian President, while seeking the assistance of Governor Masari on some of the challenges concerning the association, requested for the reallocation of landed properties of her members affected by the proposed Airforce Training School in the state.\n\nOther requests of the association to the Governor include the provision of lands to build a permanent secretariat, provision of vehicles for the day to day runnings of the association, slots for Muslims and Christian pilgrimage, as well as provisions of employment to its members.\n\nWhile reacting to the request, Governor Masari said the government may not be able to meet all the requests but will certainly look into them, with particular emphasis on those whose lands were affected as a result of the proposed Airforce Training School.\n\nHe however, advised the association President to rise up to the responsibility of his office as the government is not into funding associations.\n\nWhy Nigeria policemen seem ineffective \u2013 Governor Masari",

There is hardly any part of this vastly endowed space that should not be self-sustaining. This land should not be a place where hunger, poverty and a general sense of lack predominate.\n\n\u201cWe must be bold enough to interrogate why these challenges appear perennial. We must not shy away from the reality of our diversity which should, ordinarily, be a source of strength but is gradually becoming an albatross.\n\n\u201cThe States of the Federal Republic of Nigeria appear independent nominally at present. Serious attempts must be made to return our country to the path of progress trodden by the founding fathers.\n\n\u201cThe security challenges bedeviling the country will become a thing of the past if proper devolution of powers is undertaken. The over centralization of the security architecture is a major impediment.\n\n\u201cHaving a police command structure in a country of over 200 million is not sustainable. The attempts by some states to complement the efforts of the security agencies are at best tokenistic. Let each State be in charge of internal security in its locality.\n\n\u201cAs a corollary to this submission, each region must be encouraged to take charge of the resources in its area. A system which permits strangers to take over the mineral resources in a place without any recourse to local authorities encourages dispossession and promotes misery and want. Development of any given space must be about the people.\n\n\u201cOur people must strive under a system which recognize their God-given talents and promotes unique initiatives. All federating units must be less dependent on the Federal Government for basic survival.\u201d",

          "text": "By Louis Ibah\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has restated his commitment to the unity of the country.\n\nIn his nationwide broadcast early this morning to mark Nigeria\u2019s 61st independent anniversary, he said the resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering warning that his \u201cgovernment was ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action.\u201d\n\nHe also said ongoing investigations on separatists agitators, Nnamdi Kalu and Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho), arrested recently, have revealed that a certain member of the National Assembly was among their financiers.\n\n\u201cNigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation. We shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n\u201cThe recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers, including one identified as a serving member of the National Assembly. This is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains. Instead of preaching unity, they are funding and misleading our youth to conduct criminal acts that sometimes lead to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\u201d\n\nBuhari also granted the conditional lifting of the ban on social media platform, Twitter, to allow citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements.\n\nWhile acknowledging the country\u2019s socio-economic and security challenges, the president said no government since 1999 could match what his administration had done in the last six years to put Nigeria back on track\n\nBelow are excerpts of the speech: \u201cIt is with full gratitude to God that today, we celebrate Nigeria\u2019s sixty first Independence Anniversary. For 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck. East, West, North all came together to celebrate freedom. Today should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions and regions. Today, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation. Fellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period. Our original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising our economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant we needed to shift gears and re-strategise. Nigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19. It is this attitude and by the special grace of God, we continue to survive the pandemic as a nation and indeed, provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\n\u201cThe doomsday scenario predicted for our country never came. Even as the Delta variant continues to spread, we have built the capacity we need to respond now and into the future. I will therefore appeal to Nigerians not to take COVID lightly, adhere to public health and social measures, put your mask on and get vaccinated. We can control this pandemic, but it requires effort on everybody\u2019s part. The investments we made in response to COVID-19 will also serve our country to tackle any future disease outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n\u201c I have directed the Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Health, Education and Science and Technology to work with Nigerian and International pharmaceutical companies and research organisations to enhance Nigeria\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical capacity. Already, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority is raising a $200 million fund for this initiative that will complement the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing N85 billion Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme to support local researchers in the development of vaccines and drugs to combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on our approach to food security, I am proud to announce Nigeria has commenced its journey to pharmaceutical independence.This journey, which will take years to achieve but will ultimately result in Nigerian based companies developing the Active Pharmaceutical substances and competence needed for us to make our own drugs and vaccines. As our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country.\n\n\u201cIn the last four months, the gallant men and women of the military and security agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing these new security challenges.\n\n\u201cWe are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning. In the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "Various reactions including knocks, applause, hope, cautious optimism and cynicms have tried Nigeria at 61.\n\nFor the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), there is nothing worth celebration as it carpeted the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration as the worst in the country\u2019s history.\n\nIts spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, at press briefing, in Abuja, yesterday, claimed the Progressives Congress (APC)-led government has reversed all elements of an independent state.\n\n\u201cIt is painful that all the gains made by our nation since independence in 1960 and especially during the 16 years of the PDP in office, including the entrenchment of national unity and cohesiveness, freedom and personal liberty of citizens, rule of law, credible elections, justice, equity, fairness and economic progress; the very elements of an independent state, have all been reversed by the APC and the Buhari Presidency.\n\n\u201cThe Buhari Presidency and the APC have on all fronts taken our nation back to the pre-independence days with associated bondage mentality and frustration resulting in many losing faith in the system and leaving our country in droves within the last six years.\n\n\u201cIs it not an irony that our nation is celebrating independence in the face of subverted elections, brazen crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices as well as other suppressive acts including the muzzling of free speech as witnessed in the ban on Twitter in Nigeria?\n\n\u201cIs it not also an irony that as we celebrate independence, thousands of our compatriots are falling victims to extra-judicial killings, arbitrary arrests and illegal detention in dehumanizing cells; which underscore the horrible situation under President Buhari and the APC, as even profiled by reputable international organizations including Amnesty International (AI) and US Department of State?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we celebrate when the APC has plunged our nation into economic slavery with over N33.1 trillion accumulated debt, a 33 percent unemployment rate, collapse of productive sectors and a weakened naira from the N167 to a dollar handed over to President Buhari in 2015 to a dismal N576 to a dollar today?\n\n\u201c\u2026How can we celebrate when President Buhari and the APC have in a space of six years, wreaked our once robust economy and turned Nigeria into the poverty capital of the world, where over 82.9 million Nigerians can no longer afford their daily meals. Indeed, this is not the way to go. The incontrovertible truth is that there is no hope in sight under the APC and that is why there are no drums on the streets to celebrate Nigeria at 61.\u201d\n\n\u2022Nigeria\u2019ll remain united, stronger nation \u2013CAN\n\nRegardless of its challenges, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), said Nigeria would remain indivisible and wax stronger.\n\nIts President, Rev. Samson Ayokunle, in a message of hope issued to Christians and Nigerians, Ayokunle also declared that \u201cNigeria shall experience Showers of Blessings.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said his prophesy was backed by the Book of Ezekiel 34:25-30, where Ezekiel prophesied to a people in captivity of the Babylonians that there shall be showers of blessings.\n\nAyokunle said the situation, humanly speaking, appeared bleak, but knowing that God is not man and with Him, all things are possible, this is the right time to believe that there shall be showers of blessings because some people are praying for this country.\n\n\u201cThere shall be showers of blessings because God shall judge the evil doers in the nation. There shall be showers of blessings because God rules in the affairs of humans. There shall be showers of blessings because the thoughts of God towards us are good and not evil.\u2019\u2019\n\nAyokunle, also Co-Chairman, Nigeria Inter-Religious Council, said the showers of blessings shall usher in peace to Nigeria and all agitations would cease.\n\nThe CAN president said the Lord would cause wild beasts and criminals operating with various names such as Boko Haram, bandits, kidnappers, murderous herdsmen, unknown gunmen to cease from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cViolence shall become a thing of the past in Nigeria and all Nigerians shall dwell in safety in the name of Jesus.\n\n\u201cOur economy shall flourish and there shall be prosperity in the nation and Nigerians who had run abroad will return home because Nigeria will be a desired nation by everybody in the name of Jesus,\u2019\u2019 he stressed.\n\nHe added that God shall turn Nigeria\u2019s dry land into swamps of food where Nigerians would have plenty to eat and the days of scarcity would be no more in the name of Jesus.\n\nHe prayed that at the forthcoming 2023 general elections, no wicked leader shall be voted into power no matter how wealthy and powerful he or she might be in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe CAN president commended the military for the current upper hand they were having over insurgents and criminals tagged bandits and wicked herdsmen murdering and sacking communities\n\n\u2022Lawmakers, CLO urge Buhari to tackle insecurity\n\nSome lawmakers in Lagos and Nasarawa states and the Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO) have urged President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle security challenges facing the country.\n\nThe lawmakers also called on the president to address poverty, unemployment and separatist agitations.\n\nWhile Speaker, Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Ibrahim Balarabe-Abdullahi, called on Nigerians to pray and support the president and other leaders to succeed in creating more democratic dividends, Chairman, Committee on Information and Strategies, Lagos State House of Assembly, Setonji David, urged the president to tackle poverty, unemployment, inflation and separatists agitations.\n\nChairman, Committee on Primary and Secondary Education, Sanni Okanlawon, also urged Nigerians to unite in the efforts to end insecurity.\n\n\u201cWe all have responsibilities to work towards the greatness of this country.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe CLO asked the political class and office holders to restore the nation to the ideals of its founding fathers.\n\nIts chairman in Anambra, Vincent Ezekwueme, said in spite of abundant human and natural resources bestowed on Nigeria, majority of its citizenry still live in abject poverty.\n\n\u201cThe best and greatest independent gift Nigerians expect from government at all levels includes but not limited to the eradication of poverty, inequality, unemployment, injustices, banditry, terrorism and all forms of insecurity in the land. It is only social justices that precipitate peaceful coexistence, unity, progress and prosperity,\u201d Ekwueme said.\n\n\u2022Lawan, Tinubu urge unity, faith\n\nSenate President, Ahmad Lawan, urged Nigerians to unite for the progress of the country and continue to keep faith with their fatherland.\n\n\u201cI find it remarkable that we are living in the longest era of democracy in our history as a nation. That may seem modest as an achievement but it is an additional cause for celebration in the light of our political experience,\u201d he said\n\nAccording to him, the challenges are numerous but not insurmountable.\n\n\u201cIf we face them like our founding fathers faced those of their time, the coming generations will also accord our memories their gratitude.\n\nLawan encouraged all Nigerians to take advantage of the ongoing process of constitutional review at the National Assembly.\n\nHe said the National Assembly was determined to facilitate a meaningful review of the Constitution by the people.\n\nIn her reaction, Senator Oluremi Tinubu emphasized that the things that bind the country together are stronger than those which threaten to divide it.\n\n\u201cWe must shun all attempts to cause disunity amongst us, and remain unflinching in spite of whatever challenges we may face.\u201d\n\nAccording to the senator representing Lagos Central, the nation\u2019s founding fathers have fought and played their part.\n\n\u201cNow, the responsibility rests on us, to safeguard, preserve, cherish and build a nation that future generations of Nigerians will be proud of.\u201d\n\n\u2022Kalu advocates sustenance of democratic virtues\n\nFormer fovernor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Kalu, applauded Nigerians for their perseverance, patriotism and commitment to nation building.\n\nDescribing Nigeria as a blessed country, he called on the political class to embrace democratic virtues at all levels of government, adding that people at the helm of affairs must live up to expectations by providing succour to the people.\n\nThe former governor noted that the tribal, cultural and religious diversity of Nigeria should not be a basis for disunity rather an opportunity for growth and progress.\n\n\u201c I join other Nigerians in celebrating the 61st independence anniversary of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the country is facing some challenges, nevertheless, there are remarkable and historic milestones that have been achieved since independence.\n\n\u201cNigeria is waxing strong despite unpatriotic and selfish calls for division in some quarters. The country is blessed with its heterogeneous nature.\n\n\u201cThe proponents of a divided Nigeria are selfish and unpatriotic. The country remains a united, indivisible and prosperous nation.\n\n\u201cAs the country marks it 61st independence anniversary, the government and its citizens, must uphold the tenets of democracy in a bid to build an ideal society anchored on justice, fairness and equity.\n\nWhile charging politicians not to heat the polity with provocative utterances, he urged Nigerians to be law-abiding, optimistic and peaceful.\n\n\u2022Jonathan charges citizens to be optimistic of the future\n\nFormer president, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, urged Nigerians to be optimistic about the future of the country.\n\nHe stressed that the nation holds abundant promises for the citizens, adding that Nigeria has what it takes to overcome its present threats and trials.\n\nHe encouraged the nation\u2019s leaders and the citizens to rededicate ourselves to the virtues of equity, justice and tolerance and strive to give their best for the good of the nation.\n\n\u201cWe may have hiccups along the way and challenging times that might be stretching our resolve and determination to forge ahead. But we should not relent nor succumb to fear, discouraging trials and threats of today. We will never lose hope in our country and in our indomitable spirit and capacity to overcome difficult times, seize the moment and conquer.\n\n\u201cThe journey of nationhood is a marathon, which requires patience, resilience, tolerance and determination. The uncertainties of this time cannot be compared to the limitless promises that this nation holds for us all.\n\n\u201cThis time offers us a new opportunity to renew our drive towards attaining greater heights and secure our shared dreams and common vision.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate, let us aggregate the successes, challenges and lessons of the last six decades and apply them towards a more prosperous future for us and upcoming generations.\u201d\n\n\u2022Abdulsalami: Be patriotic, disciplined\n\nFormer military head of state, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, said for the country to attain greatness, all citizens must work together and contribute their own quota in ensuring good democratic governance.\n\nHe said Nigerians must be carried along through the implementation of people oriented policies and programmes in all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to attain greatness, we must become a disciplined society, respect and obey the constitution. Every Nigerian is expected to do their best by tolerating one another irrespective of tribe religious, ethnic and political affiliations. Nigerians must desist from sabotage and assist the government in its efforts to improve the well-being of the governed.\u201d\n\nHe also called on governments at all levels to discharge their responsibilities by providing infrastructure, adequate power supply and assisting farmers with farm inputs in order to make life easier for the people.\n\n\u201cNigerians must assist the security personnel with credible information that will enable them to arrest criminal elements living among us so that the security agencies can arrest and deal with them decisively. We must imbibe the culture of providing intelligence information to security personnel deployed across the country in the ongoing fight against banditry, kidnapping and other criminal activities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Oyetola lauds Nigeria progress amidst challenges\n\nGovernor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun said Nigeria may not have achieved the desired development height but is progressively moving toward achieving greater heights.\n\n\u201cBy any standard, we have moved, we may not have achieved the level that we are thinking of as a nation but I think we are moving.\u201d\n\nThe governor said comparing Nigeria with other nations might not necessarily be good enough because one might not know what those nations had.\n\nHe expressed optimism that Nigeria could do better given the present level of its development, following efforts put into running the country\u2019s affairs by President Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nThe governor attributed the ability of his administration to pay salaries of civil servants to commitment and setting priorities right. He said there was no magic to it, stressing that it was a question of defining priorities and getting them right.\n\n\u2022Nigeria built on falsehood \u2013Gani Adams\n\nAare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams said Nigeria\u2019s federation was built on falsehood, adding that the country has the potentials to be great again if the regions are given the autonomy to develop at their own pace.\n\nHe said such would allow the states to build their security architectures to enhance the federal security architecture.\n\nHe said Nigeria\u2019s history and efforts of the founding fathers before and shortly after independence in 1960 were watershed, but added that the past and present crop of leaders had drifted along the line by initiating policies capable of destroying the federation.\n\nThe Yoruba generalissimo wondered how a nation birthed with lots of hope and aspirations suddenly turned into a shadow of itself.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

For instance, the spate of insecurity has reached an alarming state with bandits killing and maiming Nigerians everyday.\u201d",

I hope that the safety of all citizens in the country will always be guaranteed,\u201d the Pope said.\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to provide adequate security for Nigerians in every part of the country.\n\nVarious parts of Nigeria, especially the North have experienced several years of violence, with herders and farmers competing for natural resources, while sporadic violence by gunmen often lead to endless reprisals between communities.\n\nSunday\u2019s attack in Kaduna took place in the village of Madamai, in the Kaura district, where \u201cunidentified gunmen\u201d killed scores of people and injured others. A second attack was carried out by militants in an alleged retaliation in the village of Kacecere, where a further eight people were killed, six injured, and several houses destroyed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Catholic Bishops of Nigeria have appealed to Nigerians to respect human life, and strive for peace in a country based on justice and equity. They called on those in government to take sincere and positive steps to deliver the people from their tormentors.The bishops also appealed to Nigerians to pray against famine, killings and sufferings.\n\nThey stated this in a statement in Abuja by the National Director of Social Communications for the group, Fr. Mike Umoh.\n\nThe bishops added their voices to that of the Holy Father, Pope Francis, to appeal to those in government and those who have power, to desist from actions and policies that continue to plunge the nation into violence and crisis.\n\n\u201cIt is sad that Nigerians are still literally dying every day through very barbaric and senseless killings. To all victims of the violence and killings in the land, we send prayers and condolences. We call on all men and women of goodwill, irrespective of their religious affiliation, to pray ceaselessly for our nation.\u201d\n\nThe bishops dedicate Nigeria to the powerful intercession of the Blessed Mother Mary, the Queen of Nigeria.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "For the Record: Buhari\u2019s Independence Day Broadcast (Full Text)",
          "text": "Citizens of Nigeria.\n\nIt is with full gratitude to God that today, we celebrate Nigeria\u2019s sixty first Independence Anniversary.\n\n2. For 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck. East, West, North all came together to celebrate freedom. Today should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions and regions.\n\n3. Today, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation.\n\n4. Fellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period.\n\n5. Our original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising our economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant we needed to shift gears and re-strategise.\n\n6. Nigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19. It is this attitude and by the special grace of God, we continue to survive the pandemic as a nation and indeed, provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\n7. The doomsday scenario predicted for our country never came. Even as the Delta variant continues to spread, we have built the capacity we need to respond now and into the future.\n\n8. I will therefore appeal to Nigerians not to take COVID lightly, adhere to public health and social measures, put your mask on and get vaccinated. We can control this pandemic, but it requires effort on everybody\u2019s part. The investments we made in response to COVID-19 will also serve our country to tackle any future disease outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n9. Despite the global inequity in access to vaccines, the Government of Nigeria has continued to explore all available options to ensure Nigerians have free access to safe and effective vaccines.\n\n10. Some five million vaccine doses have been administered to Nigerians through efforts led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and we will continue to explore options for purchase or acquisition of vaccines such as through COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust.\n\n11. I will take this opportunity to remind the global community that the current state of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable. We cannot afford a situation where a handful of countries keep the global vaccine supply to themselves at the expense of other nations.\n\n12. We must act now to accelerate equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This is the message I conveyed to the international community in New York last week.\n\n13. As we push to source vaccines for our immediate needs, we shall invest more to support our pharmaceutical and research agencies to come up with ideas for locally developed vaccines. Should another pandemic arise in the future, Our question is simple; will Nigeria be ready?\n\n14. Accordingly, I have directed the Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Health, Education and Science and Technology to work with Nigerian and International pharmaceutical companies and research organisations to enhance Nigeria\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical capacity.\n\n15. Already, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority is raising a $200 million fund for this initiative that will complement the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing N85 billion Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme to support local researchers in the development of vaccines and drugs to combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\n\nFellow Nigerians, this is just the beginning.\n\n16. Similarly, on our approach to food security, I am proud to announce Nigeria has commenced its journey to pharmaceutical independence.\n\n17. This journey, which will take years to achieve but will ultimately result in Nigerian based companies developing the Active Pharmaceutical substances and competence needed for us to make our own drugs and vaccines.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n18. As our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country.\n\n19. In the last four months, the gallant men and women of the Military and Security Agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing these new security challenges. We are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning.\n\n20. Earlier this year, I launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, the Deep Blue Project, which is designed to secure Nigerian waters up to the Gulf of Guinea. I am happy to inform Nigerians that we have taken delivery of key assets for this project and very soon, its impact will be felt.\n\n21. In the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.\n\n22. To support our surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel across all ranks. Furthermore, I have also approved for the Nigerian Police Force to recruit 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years.\n\n23. I am also pleased to note that most of the Air Force platforms we acquired over the past three years have started to arrive in Nigeria. These will positively impact our security operations in all parts of the country.\n\n24. In line with section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the security and welfare of Nigerians continue to be the prime focus on which programmes and projects of our government revolves.\n\n25. Therefore, as a Government, we are ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action. Our resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering.\n\n26. That said, our hope is not to fight for peace. We can always settle our grievances peacefully without spilling any blood.\n\n27. I will therefore take this opportunity, on this special day that symbolises the unity and oneness of our great nation, to ask all Nigerians to embrace peace and dialogue, whatever your grievances.\n\n28. The seeds of violence are planted in people\u2019s heads through words. Reckless utterances of a few have led to losses of many innocent lives and destruction of properties.\n\n29. Such unfiltered and unsubstantiated lies and hate speeches by a few evil persons must be stopped. Our media houses and commentators must move away from just reporting irresponsible remarks to investigating the truth behind all statements and presenting the facts to readers.\n\n30. We must all come out and speak against the lies being peddled. At this point, I would want to sincerely appreciate the large number of our Traditional, Religious and Community leaders as well as other well-meaning Nigerians who, in their various fora are openly spreading the message of peaceful co-existence and conflict settlement through dialogue in their respective communities.\n\n31. Nigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation.\n\n32. We shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n33. The recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the national assembly.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n34. This is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains. Instead of preaching unity, they are funding and misleading our youth to conduct criminal acts that sometimes lead to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\n\n35. As the so-called leaders run abroad to hide, our innocent youths are misled and left in the streets to fight for their senseless and destructive causes.\n\n36. Government will continue, with greater level of peoples\u2019 participation and in collaboration with our international partners, to improve the security architecture, reduce enabling environment for criminality to thrive and eliminate opportunities for terrorism financing.\n\n37. Fellow Nigerians, our unrelenting effort at resolving an almost two-decade stalling on the management of our Petroleum resources and ensuring equitable consideration to our host communities has resulted in the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021.\n\n38. This Act not only overhauls the Institutional, regulatory and fiscal framework of the Petroleum Industry but also reduces the previous opacity associated with this sector.\n\n39. This is the first step to the reforms as the process is a continuous one. Already, to further improve the governance framework, I have sought for an amendment of sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b). We will also continue to review and amend as appropriate.\n\n40. At this juncture, it is very appropriate that I salute the leadership and members of the Ninth Assembly for their patriotism, dedication to duty, candour and most importantly the dispatch with which they have enacted legacy legislations for this nation. I do not take such level of cooperation for granted and hope it continues for the overall efficiency of the Federal machinery.\n\n41. Nigeria\u2019s Roadmap on Local Refining is on track with the Commissioning of a Modular refinery in Imo State.\n\n42. A second is scheduled for commissioning by the end of this year in Edo State and the third one in Bayelsa State by 2022.\n\n43. In addition to the modular projects, we also have the two mega refinery projects coming up in Lagos and Akwa Ibom States.\n\n44. As these refineries are commissioned, more employment opportunities are created and there would be increased petroleum products available for local consumption which will significantly reduce our reliance on importation.\n\n45. In further demonstrating our plan to reduce our dependence on oil and tapping from our enormous gas resources, this administration remains committed to the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d Initiative, which is aimed at bringing to focus the utilization of our huge gas resources.\n\n46. Already, we are supporting and promoting various gas-based projects including NLNG Train 7 and the mega urea and ammonia projects in the South-South region.\n\n47. As we continue to optimise and enhance our oil and gas sector, I am also proud and delighted to state that our economic diversification strategy remains on course with the persistent increase in Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP.\n\n48. We recovered from economic recession in quarter four of 2020 with a GDP growth rate of 0.11%, and grew by 0.51% and 5.01% in real terms in the first and second quarters of 2021.\n\n49. The Agricultural sector remains key to our economic diversification efforts as the sector has been a consistent driver of the non-oil sector contributing 22.35% and 23.78% to the overall GDP in the first and second quarter of 2021.\n\n50. We have seen significant private sector investments in almost all areas of the agricultural value chain. And these have continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n51. Unfortunately, as our food production capacity has increased, food prices have been going up due to artificial shortages created by middlemen who have been buying and hoarding these essential commodities for profiteering.\n\n52. To address this, I am hereby directing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to rehabilitate the National Food Reserve Agency and also work with security agencies, the Nigerian Commodity Exchange, and the National Assembly to find a lasting solution to these disruptive and unpatriotic hoarding activities.\n\n53. To further enhance food production, we have completed several new dams and are in the process of rehabilitating several River Basin Development Authorities to enhance ground water supply for rainfed agriculture as well as surface water for irrigation agriculture.\n\n54. The water projects we completed between 2015 to 2020 have improved Nigerian\u2019s access to potable water to 71% between 2015 and 2020. This means 12.5 million additional Nigerians now have direct access to potable water.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n55. This Government remains concerned by the significant transportation infrastructure deficit we have. Addressing the challenges our commuters and lorry drivers face on the motorways is still a high priority to us.\n\n56. To complement our budgetary allocations, the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund and the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme, we recently established a N15trillion Infrastructural Corporation of Nigeria Limited (INFRACO), which is expected to begin operation by the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n57. INFRACO will also focus on leveraging resources on a public-private sector basis for infrastructural development in Nigeria.\n\n58. We hope through these innovative programs, the additional cost burden on individuals and businesses because of inefficient logistics operations will be reduced and ultimately, eliminated.\n\n59. We currently have over 13,000 kilometres of roads and bridges under construction all over the country of which a fair percentage have been completed.\n\n60. As we fix our roads, we also continue to extend and upgrade Nigeria\u2019s railway network with the notable opening of the Warri- Itakpe standard gauge rail line.\n\n61. To increase capacity, we have introduced more locomotives, coaches and wagons including the establishment of a Wagon Assembly in Kajola, Ogun State.\n\n62. The sea ports however still remain problematic. The effect of our various interventions to reduce the gridlocks and inefficiencies have been slower than expected.\n\n63. However, the implementation of the Electronic Call-Up System as well as the conversion of the Lillypond Container Terminal to a Vehicle Transit Area will further enhance the ease of cargo evacuation.\n\n64. Our prioritisation of developing Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy has positively impacted the contribution of the ICT sector to our GDP.\n\n65. We hope our present efforts to ensure all Nigerians use a National Identification Number as well as our planned roll-out of the fifth generation (5G) network technology will ensure we stay in line with the global innovation curve as a Nation.\n\n66. As we embrace the digital economy in Nigeria, we are fully aware of the prospects and the perils. Our policies have been developed to enable Nigerians to take advantage of the prospects and avoid the perils of digital technologies.\n\n67. Social media is a very useful platform that has enabled millions of Nigerians to connect with loved ones, promote their businesses, socialise, and access news and other information.\n\n68. However, recent events have shown that the platform is not just an innocuous platform for information dissemination.\n\n69. Rather some users have misused the platform to organise, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\n70. To address these negative trends, the Federal Government of Nigeria suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria on June 5, 2021 to allow the Government put measures in place to address these challenges.\n\n71. Following the suspension of Twitter operations, Twitter Inc. reached out to the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the impasse. Subsequently, I constituted a Presidential Committee to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue.\n\n72. The Committee, along with its Technical Team, has engaged with Twitter and have addressed a number of key issues. These are:\n\na. National Security and Cohesion;\n\nb. Registration, Physical presence and Representation;\n\nc. Fair Taxation;\n\nd. Dispute Resolution; and\n\ne. Local Content.\n\n73. Following the extensive engagements, the issues are being addressed and I have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements.\n\n74. As a country, we are committed to ensuring that digital companies use their platform to enhance the lives of our citizens, respect Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, cultural values and promote online safety.\n\n75. Nigeria\u2019s progressive diplomacy continues to manifest through growing numbers of highly placed Nigerians in positions of regional and global influences. Very recently, Nigeria won election for the position of Commissioner for the expanded Political, Peace and Security Affairs of the African Union.\n\n76. Our persistent calls for a reorganized and reformed ECOWAS, to make the organization citizens-sensitive, paid off with the acceptance by the Authority of Heads of State and Governments of ECOWAS to commence the agreed reforms in the organization ahead of the next elections of the organization\u2019s principal officers in December this year.\n\n77. At the African Development Bank, World Trade Organization and indeed, the United Nations, footprints of Nigeria\u2019s Diplomacy are clearly evident.\n\n78. We remain confident that our goal of lifting 100million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is achievable.\n\n79. Considering the positive impact of our Social Investment Programs, I recently approved an increase in the number of N-Power program beneficiaries from 500,000 to 1,000,000.\n\n80. Out of this, 510,000 have started the programme while the competitive selection process for onboarding the outstanding 490,000 beneficiaries is in progress.\n\n81. The National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme is currently being implemented in 35 States of the Federation and the FCT. Over 103,000 women have been engaged and empowered as cooks under the programme, while about 10 million pupils are being fed across public primary schools in the country.\n\n82. To grant increased access to credit to the most poor and vulnerable, I have directed an increase in the disbursement of Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme loans to an additional one million beneficiaries laying more emphasis on the smallholding farmers through the farmers Moni program.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n83. For far too long we have neglected the centrality of the civil service as the engine of governance and this has manifested in ineffective service delivery.\n\n84. There is widespread discontent and disillusion about the efficiency and probity of our civil service.\n\n85. It is for this reason that we are refocusing the Nigerian Civil Service to provide World class service to run our country.\n\n86. The youths of this great country remain propellants for our today and provide guarantees that we would have a secure tomorrow.\n\n87. It is for this reason that I remain focused on expanding opportunities for their participation in politics and governance.\n\n88. Recent appointments of young people into positions of authority and their track record so far, gives me confidence that we need to bring more of them into governance and this I promise to do.\n\n89. More specifically, to encourage Girl-Child Education, female scholarship schemes, life skills and digital literacy skills to boost girl\u2019s enrolment, retention and completion of schooling, are all initiatives put in place to ensure gender balance in appropriately positioning our youths for positions of leadership.\n\n90. The commitment of this Administration to the well-being of people living with disabilities remains unwavering.\n\n91. Government recognises their contributions to development and I have, in this regard, directed that all relevant Government Agencies pay special attention to the peculiarities of different abilities in the implementation of policies and programmes.\n\n92. Rape and Gender Based Violence remains a sore point in our Nation as in many countries worldwide and this was worsened during and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n93. We are currently engaging Heads of Courts to establish Specialised Courts for the speedy and seamless trial of Rape/Gender-Based offences especially to ensure that justice is done for child victims of sexual violence.\n\n94. On the other hand, work has advanced in the reformation, reintegration and reunification of Minors involved in one crime or the other.\n\n95. The reformation in our Correctional Services has manifested in an increase in modernised custodial centres and a transformation from strictly punitive to attitudinal changes so that criminals do not relapse into their previous lifestyle.\n\n96. As we begin to celebrate our sixty one years as a Nation, we need to be conscious that Nigeria does not start and end with the Federal Government. This country is a great collective where Government at all arms and levels as well as the private sector, and more importantly individuals, have a role to play.\n\n97. In particular, security is a bottom to top undertaking. Joining hands and hearts together would enable us to secure ourselves and our country.\n\n98. I fully understand the anxiety of many Nigerians on the inability of this country to go beyond a never-ending potential for becoming a great nation to an actually great one.\n\n99. A lot has been achieved in the last six years on many fronts: in infrastructure, social care, governance, Nigeria\u2019s image and influence in Africa and the international community.\n\n100. But critics misdiagnose incremental progress as stagnation. Since coming to power, this Administration has tackled our problems head-on in spite of the meagre resources. No government since 1999 has done what we have done in six years to put Nigeria back on track.\n\n101. We shall continue to serve the country: listen to all and protect our democracy and country.\n\nThank you all and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n*Being the full text of the of the 61st Independence Day Address by President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday 1st October, 2021.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says reckless utterances responsible for violence, loss of lives\n\n*Insists nation\u2019s unity not negotiable\n\n*Charges media on responsible reporting\n\n*Hints security closing in on sponsors of separatist agitators, fingers N\u2019Assembly member\n\n*Orders conditional lifting of twitter suspension\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nIn a tone heavily reflective of the mood of the nation and a seeming renewal of spirit, President Muhammadu Buhari, this morning, during a nationwide address marking Nigeria\u2019s 61st independence anniversary celebration, appealed to all Nigerians with legitimate grievances to embrace amicable settlement without spilling anyone\u2019s blood.\n\nThe president, who identified the reckless utterances of some people as the trigger for the increasing violence and loss of lives, insisted that the unity of the country was not negotiable, regardless of the misgivings of secessionists.\n\nBuhari\u2019s whose independence broadcast was hinged on unity and peace, however, charged the media to be responsible in their reportage and be mindful of the kind of people they give voice.\n\nBut in a sense, which showed the president was not taking any prisoners as far as separatist agitations were concerned, Buhari revealed that security operatives were already closing in on some of the sponsors of secessionist agitators, including a current member of the National Assembly, whom he claimed security has identified as funding Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nRelatedly, the president has ordered a conditional lifting of the suspension of Twitter, a micro-blogging giant, banned some months ago after it deleted a tweet by the president under circumstances considered impudent to the person and office of the president.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs a Government, we are ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action. Our resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering. That said, our hope is not to fight for peace. We can always settle our grievances peacefully without spilling any blood.\n\n\u201cI will therefore take this opportunity, on this special day that symbolises the unity and oneness of our great nation, to ask all Nigerians to embrace peace and dialogue, whatever your grievances. The seeds of violence are planted in people\u2019s heads through words. Reckless utterances of a few have led to losses of many innocent lives and destruction of properties.\u201d\n\nThe president further appealed to Nigerians across the country to maintain a positive outlook, unified front and embrace peace and dialogue, to express legitimate grievances in the spirit of the nation\u2019s independence celebrations.\n\nIn the lengthy anniversary speech, Buhari, who spoke on several issues bordering on insecurity, economy and COVID-19, among others, expressed his government\u2019s readiness to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors, who threaten national security.\n\nHe described the discoveries by security as a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains, saying, instead of preaching unity, they were funding and misleading the youth to conduct criminal acts that sometime led to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\n\nAccording to him, the seeds of violence were planted in people\u2019s heads through words and reckless utterances, leading to loss of many innocent lives and destruction of properties, adding that the so-called leaders run abroad to hide, while the innocent youths were misled and left in the streets to fight for their senseless and destructive causes.\n\n\u201cSuch unfiltered and unsubstantiated lies and hate speeches by a few evil persons must be stopped. Our media houses and commentators must move away from just reporting irresponsible remarks to investigating the truth behind all statements and presenting the facts to readers.\n\n\u201cWe must all come out and speak against the lies being peddled. At this point, I would want to sincerely appreciate the large number of our Traditional, Religious and Community leaders as well as other well-meaning Nigerians, who in their various for a, are openly spreading the message of peaceful co-existence and conflict settlement through dialogue in their respective communities.\n\n\u201cNigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation. We shall continue to work on dialogue-based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors, who threaten our national security.\n\n\u201cThe recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the National Assembly,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari claimed his administration was gradually winning the war against insecurity, had noted that in the North East region alone, over 8,000 Boko Haram terrorists had laid down their arms.\n\nHe expressed optimism that acquired fighter jets, which have started to arrive in Nigeria, would positively impact the security operations in all parts of the country, stressing that his government would continue, in collaboration with international partners, to improve the security architecture, reduce enabling environment for criminality to thrive and eliminate opportunities for terrorism financing.\n\n\u201cAs our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country. In the last four months, the gallant men and women of the military and security agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing these new security challenges. We are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning. In the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.\n\n\u201cTo support our surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel across all ranks. Furthermore, I have also approved for the Nigerian Police Force to recruit 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years. I am also pleased to note that most of the Air Force platforms we acquired over the past three years have started to arrive in Nigeria. These will positively impact our security operations in all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThat said, our hope is not to fight for peace. We can always settle our grievances peacefully without spilling any blood. We must all come out and speak against the lies being peddled. At this point, I would want to sincerely appreciate the large number of our Traditional, Religious and Community leaders as well as other well-meaning Nigerians who, in their various fora are openly spreading the message of peaceful co-existence and conflict settlement through dialogue in their respective communities.\n\n\u201cNigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the controversial ban of Twitter, the President disclosed that he has directed that the ban be conditionally lifted.\n\nHe said following the suspension of Twitter operations, Twitter Inc. had reached out to the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the impasse.\n\nBuhari explained that the presidential committee set up to interface with Twitter had addressed a number of key issues, including National Security and Cohesion, Registration, Physical presence and Representation; Fair Taxation, Dispute Resolution; and Local Content.\n\nHe further said, \u201cAs we embrace the digital economy in Nigeria, we are fully aware of the prospects and the perils. Our policies have been developed to enable Nigerians to take advantage of the prospects and avoid the perils of digital technologies. Social media is a very useful platform that has enabled millions of Nigerians to connect with loved ones, promote their businesses, socialise, and access news and other information.\n\n\u201cHowever, recent events have shown that the platform is not just an innocuous platform for information dissemination. Rather, some users have misused the platform to organise, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\n\u201cTo address these negative trends, the Federal Government of Nigeria suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria on June 5, 2021 to allow the government put measures in place to address these challenges.

For 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck. East, West, North \u2013 all came together to celebrate freedom. Today, should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions and regions.\n\n\u201cToday, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation.\n\n\u201cFellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period. As we begin to celebrate our sixty one years as a nation, we need to be conscious that Nigeria does not start and end with the federal government.\n\n\u201cThis country is a great collective, where government at all arms and levels as well as the private sector, and more importantly individuals, have a role to play. In particular, security is a bottom to top undertaking. Joining hands and hearts together would enable us to secure ourselves and our country.\n\n\u201cI fully understand the anxiety of many Nigerians on the inability of this country to go beyond a never-ending potential for becoming a great nation to an actually great one.

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Buhari Bows To Chief Of Staff, Gambari, Attorney-General Malami, Re-approves Payment Of $418million Suspicious Paris Club Debts",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has re-approved the payment of a controversial $418million in Paris Club refund-related judgment debts to six creditors after being manipulated by his Chief of Staff, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nMultiple presidential sources told SaharaReporters that the Debt Management Office (DMO) has issued promissory notes to the creditors, the means of payment approved by Buhari on Thursday.\n\nThe development is against the Nigerian Governors Forum\u2019s protest and calls for a forensic audit into the suspicious claims of the creditors.\n\nThe governors had recently queried the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, for issuing promissory notes in favour of the creditors.\n\nThe governors claimed that President Buhari approved the payment of the $418million Paris Club judgment debt despite pending court cases.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE Buhari\u2019s Chief Of Staff, Gambari, Attorney-General Malami Fume At Finance Minister, Plot Sack For Stopping $418million Paris Club Payment To Consultants\n\nBuhari, however, in early September directed the Finance Ministry to ask the DMO which was supposed to pay in form of promissory notes, to stay action \u201cuntil all the cases are exhausted\u201d.\n\nSources told SaharaReporters that the promissory notes were issued to the creditors on Thursday in-spite of the fraudulent claims by the creditors.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the clear evidence of fraud being perpetrated against the Nigerian nation, President Buhari has released a $418million promissory note for jobs not done. This is a government of integrity indeed. God help Nigeria,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cHe was manipulated by his Chief of Staff, Gambari, and the Attorney-General who were both promised 40 percent of the money by these creditors. Everything was done during the UN General Assembly in New York, it\u2019s so sad that we have a president who can be easily manipulated.\n\n\u201cEven the Director-General of the DMO, Patience Oniha, was reluctant to issue the promissory notes to them. She was sad about the development.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed exposed wide-ranging legitimacy issues, including non-execution of agreed contracts and backdoor deals raised against the indebtedness from various quarters.\n\nSee Also Corruption REVEALED: How Chief Of Staff, Gambari, Attorney-General Malami Tricked Buhari To Fraudulently Pay N90.6billion To Controversial Paris Club Lawyer\n\nOne of the beneficiaries is one Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards who was indicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters showed that Edwards did not represent Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) as claimed.\n\nA letter dated August 1, 2018 by former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, to the Ministry of Justice/Attorney General Office indicted him of an attempt to defraud the Nigerian government.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe suspects had filed applications in court to be joined as one of the judgement creditors during the garnishee proceedings and the applications were refused by the Federal High Court. The judge in a ruling delivered on the 27th of June 2016 frowned at Dr Ted Edward for brandishing a judgment purportedly delivered by the Federal Capital Territory on 30th October, 2015 and in fact took a swipe at it.\n\n\u201cBy the Motion Ex parte filed on the 30th of March, 2015, the judgement creditors applied for a Garnishee Order Nisi which was granted on 1st April, 2015 and fixed the return date for 16th April for the Garnishee to show cause why the Order Nisi should not be made absolute.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Honorable Judge in his ruling stated unequivocally that \u201clet me state right away that the substantive matter was commenced by me until I entered judgement on the 3rd of December, 2013. I have searched my records up to the date of I entered judgement. I could not find the name of Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards as representing the judgement creditors even for one day nor did I find any process filed by his law firm. How then was that judgement prosecuted.\n\n\u201cAnother point to highlight is the fact that according to the purported letter of engagement being bandied by Dr Ted Edwards, he was engaged on September 15, 2011 long before the matter was filed in court quoting the exact judgment sum.\n\n\u201cWhat this throws up is the fact that the said letter of engagement was done after 3rd December, 2013 and backdated to make it look as if the suspect had been engaged before the case started. There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above.\n\n\u201cTracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami and Gambari persuaded Buhari to approve $159million as legal fees to Edward.\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\u201cEdward was the Secretary General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and Gambari also established that TED EDWARD did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edward in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\u201cYet, Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edward be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and The Nigerian Governor Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418million including that of Edward through promissory notes.\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\u201cAll needed to be done is to allow an independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, took statements and established that none of the contacts were executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by Magu-led EFCC suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edward and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000. ALGON had written several letters to him and Fayemi, who is the Chairman of Nigerian Governor Forum that all the jobs executed by Edward and others were fake, not executed.

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Buhari Bows To Chief Of Staff, Gambari, Attorney-General Malami, Re-approves Payment Of $418million Suspicious Paris Club Debts",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has re-approved the payment of a controversial $418million in Paris Club refund-related judgment debts to six creditors after being manipulated by his Chief of Staff, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nMultiple presidential sources told SaharaReporters that the Debt Management Office (DMO) has issued promissory notes to the creditors, the means of payment approved by Buhari on Thursday.\n\nThe development is against the Nigerian Governors Forum\u2019s protest and calls for a forensic audit into the suspicious claims of the creditors.\n\nThe governors had recently queried the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, for issuing promissory notes in favour of the creditors.\n\nThe governors claimed that President Buhari approved the payment of the $418million Paris Club judgment debt despite pending court cases.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE Buhari\u2019s Chief Of Staff, Gambari, Attorney-General Malami Fume At Finance Minister, Plot Sack For Stopping $418million Paris Club Payment To Consultants\n\nBuhari, however, in early September directed the Finance Ministry to ask the DMO which was supposed to pay in form of promissory notes, to stay action \u201cuntil all the cases are exhausted\u201d.\n\nSources told SaharaReporters that the promissory notes were issued to the creditors on Thursday in-spite of the fraudulent claims by the creditors.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the clear evidence of fraud being perpetrated against the Nigerian nation, President Buhari has released a $418million promissory note for jobs not done. This is a government of integrity indeed. God help Nigeria,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cHe was manipulated by his Chief of Staff, Gambari, and the Attorney-General who were both promised 40 percent of the money by these creditors. Everything was done during the UN General Assembly in New York, it\u2019s so sad that we have a president who can be easily manipulated.\n\n\u201cEven the Director-General of the DMO, Patience Oniha, was reluctant to issue the promissory notes to them. She was sad about the development.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed exposed wide-ranging legitimacy issues, including non-execution of agreed contracts and backdoor deals raised against the indebtedness from various quarters.\n\nSee Also Corruption REVEALED: How Chief Of Staff, Gambari, Attorney-General Malami Tricked Buhari To Fraudulently Pay N90.6billion To Controversial Paris Club Lawyer\n\nOne of the beneficiaries is one Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards who was indicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters showed that Edwards did not represent Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) as claimed.\n\nA letter dated August 1, 2018 by former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, to the Ministry of Justice/Attorney General Office indicted him of an attempt to defraud the Nigerian government.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe suspects had filed applications in court to be joined as one of the judgement creditors during the garnishee proceedings and the applications were refused by the Federal High Court. The judge in a ruling delivered on the 27th of June 2016 frowned at Dr Ted Edward for brandishing a judgment purportedly delivered by the Federal Capital Territory on 30th October, 2015 and in fact took a swipe at it.\n\n\u201cBy the Motion Ex parte filed on the 30th of March, 2015, the judgement creditors applied for a Garnishee Order Nisi which was granted on 1st April, 2015 and fixed the return date for 16th April for the Garnishee to show cause why the Order Nisi should not be made absolute.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Honorable Judge in his ruling stated unequivocally that \u201clet me state right away that the substantive matter was commenced by me until I entered judgement on the 3rd of December, 2013. I have searched my records up to the date of I entered judgement. I could not find the name of Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards as representing the judgement creditors even for one day nor did I find any process filed by his law firm. How then was that judgement prosecuted.\n\n\u201cAnother point to highlight is the fact that according to the purported letter of engagement being bandied by Dr Ted Edwards, he was engaged on September 15, 2011 long before the matter was filed in court quoting the exact judgment sum.\n\n\u201cWhat this throws up is the fact that the said letter of engagement was done after 3rd December, 2013 and backdated to make it look as if the suspect had been engaged before the case started. There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above.\n\n\u201cTracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami and Gambari persuaded Buhari to approve $159million as legal fees to Edward.\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\u201cEdward was the Secretary General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and Gambari also established that TED EDWARD did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edward in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\u201cYet, Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edward be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and The Nigerian Governor Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418million including that of Edward through promissory notes.\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\u201cAll needed to be done is to allow an independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, took statements and established that none of the contacts were executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by Magu-led EFCC suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edward and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000. ALGON had written several letters to him and Fayemi, who is the Chairman of Nigerian Governor Forum that all the jobs executed by Edward and others were fake, not executed. Yet Malami in the face of this clear case of fraud tricked the President in a memo and said judgement was given against them.\n\n\u201cHe also negotiated the debt to 50 percent and convinced the President to pay to avoid more damages. It\u2019s high time President Buhari save his anti-corruption war by causing a thorough investigation of his appointees involved in this massive fraud.\u201d\n\nOther beneficiaries include a former member of the House of Representatives, Ned Nwoko, who is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\nThree beneficiaries laying claim to $143,463,577.76 via a judgment of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/2129/2014 are: Riok Nigeria Ltd, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello.\n\nFrom the total money, Riok Nigeria Limited has a share of $142,028,941.95 (about N54 billion), Mr Nwafor is entitled to $1,219,440.45 and Mr Bello has a share of $215,159.36.\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920 based on another \u201cconsent judgment\u201d it obtained in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2018, which was filed as recently as 2018.",

          "text": "A French court Thursday imposed a one-year sentence on former president Nicolas Sarkozy after finding him guilty of illegal campaign financing for massive overspending on his 2012 re-election campaign. The verdict came six months after he was found guilty of corruption in a separate trial.\n\nThe court will allow the ex-president to serve the sentence at home by wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet, FRANCE24 reports.\n\nFormer French President, Sarkozy\n\nSarkozy, who spent nearly twice the legal limit on his failed bid for a second term in office, wasn't present at the Paris court for the announcement of the verdict.\n\nMoments after the sentence was announced, Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog said he would appeal.\n\nThe 66-year-old right-winger pulled out all the stops in 2012 to try fend off the ultimately victorious Socialist candidate, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\nA series of lavish US-style election rallies caused his costs to spiral, with the final bill coming to at least 42.8 million euros $49.7 million), nearly double the legal limit of 22.5 million euros.\n\nThe case is known as the Bygmalion affair, after the name of the public relations firm that set up a system of fake invoices to mask the real cost of the events.\n\nProsecutors had sought a one-year prison sentence, half of it suspended, for the former president. The verdict is not the same as a suspended sentence, as it goes down in his record as a full prison term.\n\nIt was the second guilty verdict this year for Sarkozy, who led France from 2007 to 2012 and retains influence among conservatives despite falling from grace over his legal woes.\n\nThe court stated that Sarkozy \u201cknew\u201d weeks before the 2012 election that the legal limit was at stake and \u201cvoluntarily\u201d failed to supervise additional expenses, with prosecutors accusing him of having ignored two notes from his accountants warning about the money issue.\n\nProsecutors argued Sarkozy is \u201cthe only person responsible for his campaign financing\u201d and that he chose to exceed the limit by organising many rallies, including giant ones.\n\nDuring his hearing in June, Sarkozy told the court the extra money didn't go into his campaign, but instead helped make other people richer.\n\nHe denied any \u201cfraudulent intent.\u201d He also insisted he didn't handle the logistics of his campaign for a second term as a president nor did he oversee how money was spent, because he had a team to do that.\n\n\"Can you imagine me going into a meeting to discuss the cost of flags?\" he told the court in June. \"I had too much to do.\" \"From the moment I was told things were in order, I had no reason to give it more thought,\" he added.\n\nThis conviction comes six months after he was given a jail term for corruption and influence peddling in a separate trial, when he tried to a judge in order to obtain confidential information on a judicial inquiry. He also denied any wrongdoing in that case.\n\nThe former president was sentenced to three years in jail in that trial - two of which were suspended. Like with Thursday\u2019s sentence, he will probably avoid jail, with the judge saying she would consider letting him serve the remaining year of his sentence at home, if he wore an electronic ankle bracelet. His appeal is also pending.\n\nHe became nevertheless France's first post-war president to be handed a custodial sentence. Before him, the only former leader to be sentenced at trial was Sarkozy's predecessor Jacques Chirac, who received a two-year suspended sentence in 2011 for corruption over a fake jobs scandal relating to his time as Paris mayor.\n\nSarkozy, who has accused the judiciary of hounding him since he lost his presidential immunity, appealed that verdict.\n\nIn addition to the former president, 13 other people went on trial, including members of his conservative R\u00e9publicans party, accountants and heads of the communication group in charge of organising the rallies, Bygmalion.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari has said the suspension of the operations of Twitter in the country will end only if the company meets certain conditions, such as the setting up of a local unit and payment of taxes.\n\nBuhari listed these conditions during a broadcast to mark Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence anniversary on Friday, October 1.\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nAccording to the president, a committee constituted to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue that led to the suspension of its activities in Nigeria had successfully addressed a number of key issues, including \u201cnational security and cohesion; registration of physical presence and representation; fair taxation; dispute resolution; and local content.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements,\u201d he said.\n\nThe committee, which was set up in July, is led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who revealed in August that the ban would be lifted in \u201ca matter of days\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe ban on Twitter will soon be lifted as we are getting close to reaching full agreement,\u201d the minister said. \u201cWe have agreed on some areas, hopefully in the next few days or weeks, we will conclude.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.

          "text": "The Lagos Angel Network (LAN) has appointed a new Board of Governors (BoG) to oversee its affairs, effective from today October 1, 2021.\n\nAccording to a LAN statement, the new board, chaired by Kola Aina, General Partner at Ventures Platform, has the mandate to reposition the organisation with a focus on recruiting and educating local angel investors and championing advocacy for early-stage investing in Nigeria.\n\nOther members of the BoG are Biola Alabi, founder, Biola Alabi Media, who will sit as Deputy Chair of the BoG; Yemi Keri, co-founder, Rising Tide Africa; Olumide Soyombo, co-founder, Voltron Capital; Iyin Aboyeji, founder, Future Africa; and Gerrad Olisa-Ashar, co-founder, Diaspora Angel Network.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLAN was created to facilitate the development and emergence of an active early-stage investment community in Nigeria. Its mission is to facilitate investment in Lagos-based entrepreneurs and their early-stage businesses and give them access to networks and mentoring.\n\nSince its launch in 2012, the LAN community of Angels claims to have mentored, advised, and invested in over a hundred Nigerian startups.\n\nLAN has also birthed several Angel groups such as Rising Tide Africa (RTA), South South-East Angels Network (SSEAN), Abuja Angels Network (AAN), and the Diaspora Angels Network (DAN).\n\n\u201cAngel investors are very important to any thriving ecosystem and LAN can play a pivotal role in that regard to drive policy and education,\u201d the new Chair, Aina tells TechCabal. \u201cUnder our dispensation, we will focus on ensuring LAN is even more relevant and perceived as the desired source of capital and advocacy.\u201d\n\nAina adds that the new BoG will prioritise angel investor recruitment and education, policy advocacy, and deal pipeline and matching.\n\n\u201cAs the founding velocity in our market has ballooned, we will work to ensure that the LAN membership and various syndicates within LAN play a leading role in providing the earliest and most hassle-free risk capital in Nigeria and Africa at large over the next decade.\u201d\n\nThe new board will be taking over from the leadership of co-founders, Tomi Davies and Dotun Sulaiman, and the current Board of Directors, Collins Onuegbu, Segun Olukoya, Yemi Keri, Dipo Adebo, David Richards, and Bunmi Lawson.\n\n\u201cDuring this our first decade as Lagos Angels, we\u2019ve seen the good, the bad, and the unexpected in the Nigerian early-stage entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it\u2019s been an incredibly worthwhile journey,\u201d Davies says in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the Lagos startup ecosystem grow significantly bigger than when we started LAN 10 years ago and need to do more. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s possible, and now it\u2019s time to take Angel investing in Nigeria to the next level,\u201d Sulaiman adds.\n\nWhile other directors of the old Board will be stepping down, Davies, Sulaiman, and Keri will remain as guarantors of LAN, a company limited by guarantee under the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the founding LAN Board whose achievements cannot be overstated, and their legacy is visible for all to see,\u201d Aina says. \u201cOur appointment to serve the LAN community in this capacity is humbling.

          "title": "iOS 15 review: new features make iPhone a more powerful device",
          "text": "Apple released the iOS 15 on September 20, 2021, and it\u2019s a super-smart operating system.\n\nWe think Apple is taking a minimalist approach to building a more effective operating system. Unlike the flashy update that happened from iOS 6 to iOS 7, iOS 15 debuts with subtle updates that form a more significant upgrade of iOS 14. iOS 15 is the perfect example of being loud without screaming: the new operating system improves your overall experience without altering your phone visually.\n\niOS 15 has a lot of hidden updates that are easy to miss and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve compiled some of our favourite features below:\n\nFocus mode in iOS 15 is a gift to humanity\n\nHow setting Focus on iOS 15 looks like\n\nThis has to come first because it is transformative and will make the human race more productive. Sounds dramatic, but you can quote us on that.\n\niOS 15 Focus mode lets you filter notifications based on your current engagement. It arranges apps and widget pages on your home screen to align with your activity.\n\nSetting up or editing a Focus can be done in your iPhone\u2019s Settings. You can edit your Focus to be anything \u2013 work, exercise, study, or game night. You can also schedule a Focus for a particular time of the day or when you enter a location. For instance, you can set Work Focus mode to start by 10 a.m., or when you enter your office.\n\nOnce you enable Focus mode, it automatically displays your status for friends to see so they know not to disturb or interrupt you. Deep work just got better. You can also set your Focus not to notify anybody like you\u2019d turn off a new job update on LinkedIn.\n\nIn iOS 15, third-party apps like WhatsApp and Slack can integrate Focus status in their messaging apps if they choose. So when your boss scolds you for not meeting deadlines, you can just tell them to provide you with an iOS 15-enabled iPhone.\n\nYour iPhone\u2019s camera can now copy text off images\n\nHow many times have you wished your camera could scan letters off an image and turn them into editable text? Well, iOS 15 says, \u201cWish no more!\u201d\n\niOS 15 allows you to point your camera at an image or piece of paper and have its text automatically identified and copied into an email or a document.\n\nHow to use the new Scan Text tool:\n\nLong-press inside a text field as though you want to copy and paste. You\u2019ll see a Scan Text button. You may also see a button that uses just the scan icon, which looks like a piece of paper with brackets around it. Tap the button, which will replace your keyboard with your iPhone camera\u2019s viewfinder. Point your camera at the material you want to scan, and then follow the prompts on the screen. Wait for the best part. If you\u2019re moving the camera too fast, you\u2019ll see a Slow Down message flash on the screen. Cool? As you try to fit the camera and text, a live preview of the text your iPhone is identifying will be displayed. Tap the Insert button when you\u2019re ready.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNotification Summary removes constant beeping noise\n\nManaging notifications is almost impossible; you either receive them or you don\u2019t. But iOS 15 gives you control by gathering your notifications in one place where you can view them at your own convenience.\n\nInstead of constantly being distracted by beeps or pop-ups, Notification Summary collects notifications from apps or websites you\u2019re interested in and delivers them to you at a time you\u2019ve chosen.\n\nPortrait mode for FaceTime is a beauty\n\niOS 15 is taking portrait mode monopoly away from pictures. It then lets you turn on the mode for your FaceTime calls, bringing with it the ability to place an artistic blurry background behind you.\n\nSay bye to annoying backgrounds! Your pictures can now appear as though you\u2019ve just had them taken with a professional mirrorless camera and fast lens.\n\nSafari\u2019s address bar can be at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nYour Safari\u2019s address bar can live at the bottom or top of the screen\n\nSince 2007, Safari\u2019s address bar has stayed up there on the screen. But that\u2019s changed now because, why only up? Why not down, too? The whole idea of freedom is to have options and Apple is giving us that.\n\niOS 15 now allows the Safari address bar to be moved to the bottom of your phone\u2019s screen to make it easier for your thumbs to reach. If you want that tab bar back at the top, you can tap the AA button and select Show Top Address Bar.\n\nYou can now add a background image to Safari\n\nAdding background image to Safari\n\nSafari has gotten a really nice facelift in this new iOS 15, and one of them is the ability to add backgrounds to the Safari app on your iPhone. This feature was first added to macOS Big Sur but was limited to only the macOS. Not anymore.\n\nNot only can you customise the Start page, you can also select a background image to use as well as choose new sections to display on the Start page.\n\nHow to use this feature\n\nLaunch Safari on your iPhone. Open a new tab in Safari. Scroll down and tap Edit. Tap the toggle for Background Image to ON. Select one of the preset images or tap the large plus (+) button to choose an image from your Photo Library.\n\nChange the size of text used in specific apps\n\nCurrently, you can set the preferred font size to be used across your iPhone. With iOS 15, there\u2019s a tool that lets you have different font sizes for different apps on your phone. That means you can have your WhatsApp and TikTok in different font sizes.\n\nTo use this new feature:\n\nOpen your iPhone Settings Go to Control Centre Scroll down until you find the option labelled Text Size. Tap on the green plus sign before it.\n\nIf you want to adjust the size from the app:\n\nOpen Control Centre (swipe down from the top right corner of the screen, on an iPhone with Face ID; or up from the bottom of the screen, on an iPhone with Touch ID). Tap the Text Size button. Slide the button at the bottom of the screen to the left side of the toggle to indicate that you only want your changes applied to the app you\u2019re currently using, and then adjust the font size up or down.\n\nThere are a few features that weren\u2019t launched with the new operating system but will be added later. One example is SharePlay, a feature that lets you listen to music or watch a video in sync with your friends on FaceTime calls. You could say movie night just got better as it allows you to broadcast SharePlay media from your phone to a TV equipped with an AppleTV device.\n\nThough it\u2019s only the newly launched iPhone 13 series that comes with the new operating system, iPhone users with models starting from iPhone 6S can upgrade to iOS 15 by downloading the software.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "The website of Nigeria\u2019s official digital currency, eNaira, went live on Monday, four days before its planned launch on October 1, as disclosed by Central Bank governor, Godwin Emefiele.\n\nDeveloped by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the apex bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria.\n\nA welcome note on the website describes the eNaira as a \u201cCentral Bank of Nigeria-issued digital currency that provides a unique form of money denominated in Naira.\u201d\n\nThe website is a central repository where users can find comprehensive information about the official digital currency, but it offers much more than just details of the eNaira. TechCabal reviewed the website and here are at least five other things Nigerians can do on the platform.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n1. Download the eNaira application\n\nThe eNaira app (termed \u201cSpeed\u201d) can be downloaded from either the Google PlayStore, Apple App Store, or by scanning a QR code on the website. The app is expected to be available for download from October 1, 2021, and will serve as the official wallet for smartphone users.\n\n2. Manage your wallet\n\neNaira users will be able to fund and manage funds in their wallets on the website once the digital currency is officially rolled out on October 1. According to information on the platform, the wallet offers a \u201cgreat way of making purchases with retailers on-site, transferring or sending money\u201d. The e-wallet can also be linked to bank accounts and used for pay-as-you-go services.\n\n3. Join the eNaira community\n\nThe community is a social hub where, according to a note on the website, eNaira users across the globe can connect with one another, share their experiences using the digital currency, offer as well as request help.\n\nThere are four community rooms, each designed to host conversations about eNaira regulations, merchants, wallet, and registrations. Nigerians who are interested in joining the community can sign up using their email addresses.\n\n4.

Being an eNaira user naturally transports you to the world of CBDCs and this space is your guide to that world,\u201d a note on the website reads.\n\n5. Read and share eNaira insights and experiences\n\nNigerians who choose to put their experiences with the eNaira in writing or want to share important insights can reach out to the authorities and have their feedback published on the Insights/Users Speak page of the website.\n\nThe eNaira website is loaded with very important information and instructions as well as answers to potential questions in the FAQ section.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They are purchased and sold online \u2014 usually using cryptocurrency \u2014 and are typically encoded with the same software as many cryptos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough they have been around since 2014, NFTs are gaining popularity as a popular way to buy and sell digital artwork.\n\nI know you\u2019re curious about NFTs, and our Reporter, Joy, has got you covered. She addressed three critical NFT questions that you might have.\n\nCheck them out here: 3 crucial questions about NFTs answered\n\nYou may also want to take a look at this: From designing album covers for Adekunle Gold and Blaqbonez, Anthony Azekwoh took a chance on NFTs and made a killing\n\nMIT to test 3D-printing for prosthetic limbs in Sierra Leone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Moininah Sengeh working on prostheses\n\nResearchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s (MIT) new bionics centre \u2014 K.

The population of people with amputated limbs in Sierra Leone grows each year, with less than 10% currently benefiting from functional prostheses, according to MIT.\n\nHow will this be done? According to a statement by MIT, researchers will field-test a system that uses a mobile clinic to 3D-print and deliver customised prosthetics to disabled people.\n\nThe project, which aims to provide patients in medically underserved communities with access to prostheses, is one of four priorities for the research centre, established with $24 million in funding from philanthropist, Lisa Yang.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2Africa Cable to connect 3 billion people to a faster Internet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, September 28th, 2021, Facebook announced that its 2Africa Cable, one of the world\u2019s largest subsea projects, would connect three continents \u2014 Africa, Europe, and Asia \u2014 with the addition of nine landings labelled the \u201c2Africa Pearls,\u201d allowing more people to connect to faster Internet.\n\nAccording to Facebook, when they are completed, the extension will make 2Africa the world\u2019s longest subsea cable system. It will break the current record of 39,000 kilometres set by the SEA-ME-WE 3 line, which connects 33 countries in South East Asia, the Middle East, and Western Europe.\n\nThe 2Africa Pearls branch now includes new terrestrial connections via Egypt, Bahrain, India, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nPer the social media giant, with the addition of the Pearls extension, the system aims to connect an additional 1.8 billion people, bringing the total to 3 billion people spread across 33 countries, accounting for 36% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nIn May 2020, Facebook announced plans to build a $1 billion undersea Internet cable for faster Internet access in Africa.\n\nAnd in August 2021, 2Africa extended the cable\u2019s connectivity to Seychelles, Angola, the Comoro Islands, and a new landing in South-East Nigeria.\n\nFor context on Subsea Internet Cables in Africa, please, read: Subsea Internet cables and the race to connect Africa to the Internet\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nGoogle Maps is making it easier to see wildfires and tree coverage.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on who you follow and your close circle on the Internet, you\u2019re probably sick of hearing blockchain enthusiasts throw jargon like \u201cNFT,\u201d \u201cmining,\u201d \u201cngmi,\u201d \u201cburning,\u201d \u201cdestroying,\u201d trading,\u201d et cetera all around.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not code for soldiers to communicate in World War III. They\u2019re actual terms understood by blockchain enthusiasts, one of the most popular being NFT. But, what\u2019s an NFT?\n\nNFT is an acronym for Non-fungible token. Non-fungible implies one-of-a-kind, unique, or irreplaceable.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had someone tell you that you\u2019re one of a kind and irreplaceable, congratulations, you\u2019ve been called Non-fungible before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut think about it, human beings are Non-fungible. I mean, we might look alike in our respective physical makeups, but we each have unique genes and experiences that make us the only kind of ourselves.\n\nWhere were we? Yes, NFTs. An NFT can be anything, for the most part. Just as you\u2019re one of your kind and consist of flesh, blood, and bones, NFTs are mostly digitally converted or digitally generated pieces (or even real-world items, although this is less common) of anything that exists as the only copy of its kind and cannot be replaced.\n\nThey can be artworks, memes, music, videos, sounds, and even tweets. After all, Twitter Founder Jack Dorsey sold his first tweet as an NFT for $2.9 million.\n\nIt could be a video of Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s first goal or digitally converted manuscripts of Maya Angelou\u2019s works.\n\nPicture Leonardo da Vinci drawing the Mona Lisa in 2021, and it\u2019s a digital painting minted on an NFT platform; whoever he sells the painting to becomes the original owner.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nAs a creator or original owner, you sell the ownership of the item you NFTed, and the buyer becomes the owner of the original.\n\nPayments can be made with cryptocurrency or a fiat currency equivalent. And it\u2019s important to note that the artist/creator can still hold the right to reproduce.\n\nThink of it as owning the original Mona Lisa. There are several fakes everywhere, but there\u2019s one original.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom a digital stance, someone might as well download the same copy of the art, but most NFTs run on the Ethereum Blockchain. And the uniqueness of an NFT is based on complex lines of nodes \u2014 a kind of code \u2014 on this blockchain that signify ownership, originality, and irreplaceability.\n\nEthereum is a blockchain network on which you can record and verify transactions without a third party, among other things. It has its native cryptocurrency called Ether.\n\nAre NFTs cryptocurrencies?\n\nWell, yes and no. Remember we\u2019ve agreed that it\u2019s only an NFT if there\u2019s one of its kind? If you have 0.003 BTC and I have 0.003 BTC, we have the same thing. But when you have an NFT, it\u2019s unique. No one else has anything like it.\n\nThink of them as crypto assets. Just as there are real-life assets like land or artefacts, specific data written in a line of complex code represents the value and worth of these digital assets.\n\nCan the average Joe buy and sell NFTs?\n\nYes. Whether you\u2019re an artist, a collector, an art enthusiast, or just someone looking to own a viable asset, you can join the moving train.\n\nFor artists, once you can prove that you\u2019re the creator/original owner of that token, then you can sell on an NFT platform. And whenever the NFT is traded, you receive a payment.\n\nAs a buyer or collector, you can buy on a reputable NFT platform for keepsake, and later on, mint them for their money\u2019s worth.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that being a relatively novel idea, the market is quite volatile and unpredictable, and as with decisions involving finances, it\u2019s important to educate yourself.\n\nSince most NFTs run on the Ethereum Blockchain, you\u2019d need to set up a wallet \u2014 the most common being MetaMask \u2014 and have some Ethereum in it to start minting your NFT. Each platform has its unique requirements.\n\nNFTs date back to crypto art, a craze that began in 2013, one of which was the now almost obsolete coloured coins \u2014 a bitcoin-issued token used to verify transactions \u2014 used as proof of ownership for real-world assets, from equities to bonds to real estate. This was in an attempt to expand the use of the blockchain to the real world.\n\nAn artist couple, Kevin McCoy and Jennifer McCoy, minted Quantum, the first NFT. It was a pixelated image of an octagon filled with various shapes at the centre. At the time of writing, it costs $7 million to get an original of this art piece.\n\nThis idea has spread widely for varying reasons. Not only does it allow direct control and a more transparent way to track assets, but it also helps artists monetise their works and helps art enthusiasts support them.\n\nAnd because the blockchain records transactions in an unchangeable way, NFTs serve as trustable proof of ownership and originality.\n\nA few weeks ago, we covered the story of a Nigerian artist, Anthony Azekwoh, who made more than he ever had in his career when he first minted his art as an NFT, making Six Eth (equivalent to $11,046 when the article was published) in the process.\n\nThere have been many speculations about whether this is the future of buying, selling, and collecting art. While the future is not set in stone, it looks like NFTs are here to stay and change the narrative of the art business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world. Language, books, and aspiring tech enthusiast. Keep in touch\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

A leader that can deliver is what the country needs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInstitutions have failed. National Assemblies are not doing their jobs as required; that is the problem,\u201d Sanusi stated.\n\nSanusi said that progressive countries like the United States of America do not worry about where the president comes from. All they ask for is the track record of the competency of the candidate presented.\n\nRead Also: 2023: Who wants to be Nigeria\u2019s next president?\n\nHe wondered why Nigerians were locked in debates over where the next president should come from, instead of demanding the character.\n\n\u201cObasanjo from the South-west was a president for 8years, did the northerners die?\u201d he asked.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim from the north of Africa\u2019s most populous nation, is due to step down after elections in early 2023. Before selecting their candidates next year, Nigeria\u2019s two main political parties have to decide where they should come from. Nigerian state governors are divided over whether to uphold a convention of rotating the presidency between the north and south of the country.\n\nWith 18 months to go, the governors of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states are adopting public positions along regional rather than party political lines: the southern leaders say it\u2019s their turn to field the next president, while their northern counterparts argue they shouldn\u2019t be excluded from the contest.\n\nSanusi urged Nigerians to insist on character and competence and not the region the next president comes from. However, he sounded a warning that if the country should continue to rely on numbers of votes to determine its president, then Nigeria will end up having unqualified leaders.\n\nThe one-time CBN governor also said that the failure of the country in the last 61 years can be traced to the fact that the institutions set for the smooth running of the country\u2019s affairs have failed in their responsibilities. He pointed out that most of the people in authority are merely pursuing personal agendas.",

          "text": "Flawed elections overseen by 12 electoral chiefs remain a stubborn stain on the democratic history of Nigeria since Independence in 1960, denying the country quality leadership it desperately needs, political experts have said.\n\nMoshood Salvador, a former member of the House of Representatives and chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC); Martins Onovo, a US-trained petroleum engineer, and former presidential candidate of the National Conscience Party (NCP), and Kunle Okunade, political scientist and analyst, are on the same page in this belief.\n\nAccording to them, Nigeria has not made progress in the enthronement of the two pillars of democracy \u2013 the rule of law and the integrity of the ballot.\n\nMoshood, Onovo and Okunade, who spoke in separate interviews with BusinessDay, note that faulty electoral process has helped to perpetuate wrong persons in power, and this has become an impediment to achieving democratic gains.\n\nSalvador says the fraudulent electoral process in Nigeria\u2019s electoral history had continued over the decades because it was benefiting some people, adding that electronic transmission of results was the way forward.\n\nRead Also: EFCC says it intervened in Nigeria\u2019s elections to tackle vote-buying\n\n\u201cThe controversy that has trailed elections in Nigeria even from the First Republic is man-made, and is for selfish interest; go and check history, and I don\u2019t think it will stop soon,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBut it is a matter of choice. Kaduna State is now showing them the way out with the successful use of e-transmission of results in its LG elections. The National Assembly is kicking against it because they are benefiting from the faulty system of ballot box snatching and all the manipulations,\u201d Salvador further notes.\n\nMartin Onovo laments the failure of the nation\u2019s electoral process to positively affect its democracy.\n\nAccording to Onovo, \u201cThe rule of law is corrupted; the integrity of the ballot is corrupted because votes have never counted in Nigeria since independence. Nigeria was founded on election rigging. We have the confession of our colonial officer, Harold Smith, who said the colonial authorities rigged the first election. So, Nigeria was founded on rigging.\u201d\n\nKunle Okunade blames politicians for their refusal to play politics by the rules, adding that lack of punitive measures for political offenders had also contributed to the trend.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s electoral process is still at the infancy stage because of the abnormalities displayed by the electoral actors. Smooth conduct of elections in any democratic state can only be achieved if all stakeholders, including the electorate, abide by the rules and regulations guiding the process of elections.\n\n\u201cThe poor state of the economy has strongly affected the electoral process such that members of the political elite are currently exploiting it to their advantage by engaging in a new sharp electoral malpractice called \u2018vote buying.\u2019 This new twist would continue to desecrate the electoral temple, which will not do the country any good.\n\n\u201cAs it is, the electoral process in this system still lacks transparency, fairness, and credibility. Once an electoral process lacks these three ingredients, it remains a charade in its totality,\u201d Okunade states further.\n\nNigeria has had 12 chairmen of electoral commissions since 1960, but the quality of the elections continues to grow worse. Several attempts at electoral reform have also not yielded the desired result.\n\nIn the First Republic, serious dispute among the political parties and political leaders about the conduct and result of the federal elections of December 30, 1964, which were described as neither free nor fair, and serious malpractices were reported from many parts of the country, contributing to the reasons for the bloody 1966-1970 civil war.\n\nSimilar disagreement resurfaced in the Second Republic, 1979-1983. The victory of Shehu Shagari of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN) for a second term was disputed by most of the major parties, and serious questions were raised on the astronomical increase in the voters\u2019 register occurring in NPN strongholds by the Victor Ovie-Whiskey-led Federal Electoral Commission (FEDECO).\n\nAlthough Ovie-Whiskey was openly condemned across the country, the NPN hailed the election, praising him for his competence.\n\nElection dispute again resurfaced in the aborted Third Republic, where there was an attempt at democratic transition between 1985 and 1993, under the regime of Ibrahim Babangida, who was ill-fated with the annulment of June 12, 1993, presidential election.\n\nThe election conducted by the Humphrey Nwosu-led Commission, was won by the late Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola (MKO). It was considered the freest and fairest in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nSince the birth of the Fourth Republic in 1999, election results have continued to be controversial, while violence and other electoral malpractices have also been on the increase.\n\nThe 2007 general election, conducted by Maurice Iwu, was adjudged to be one of the worst in the history of Nigeria. The late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, who was elected in that election, confessed that the election that brought him to power was flawed.\n\nExperts say the current process does not satisfy the quest for democratic governance in the country.\n\nIn its final report on the conduct of the 2019 general election in Nigeria, the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM) concluded that there was a need for serious electoral reforms due to the systemic failings and low level of voter participation recorded during the polls.\n\nThe mission observed that the 2019 general election was marked by severe operational and transparency deficiencies, including electoral security problems, low turnout and abuse of incumbency power.\n\nOn the implication of incremental deterioration of the electoral process\u2014voter apathy and rising loss of confidence in the judicial process that deliver jaundiced justice that throw up pseudo-leaders who only contribute to the underdevelopment of the country, Onovo says it has destroyed the very fabrics of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe increasing level of apathy being exhibited by voters shows that things are only getting worse. Over the years, elections have been flagrantly rigged and wrong people, who do not have anything to offer to Nigeria, are put in government. It is garbage in; garbage out; that has been our leadership story,\u201d he further states.\n\n\u201cNigerians believe it is a sheer waste of time to go vote when their votes will not count. This is not about the All Progressives Congress (APC); it was the same story during the dispensation of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP). It would still be the same if any other party is in power today. The problem is systemic. The earlier it is permanently addressed, the better for Nigeria,\u201d Onovo adds.\n\nAmid the current electoral crisis, part of the reforms canvassed by stakeholders was that the INEC should transmit election results electronically to check manipulation and fraud.\n\nBut the suggestion did not get a favourable response from the National Assembly in the recent amendment of the 2010 Electoral Act.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives passed Clause 52, allowing INEC the discretion to decide whether to transmit election results electronically, the Senate said the clause was amended to allow the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to decide on where and when electronic voting and electronic transmission of results should take place.\n\nWith the country inching toward another general election, stakeholders have expressed fear that the decision of the federal legislature may have erased any hope of a free and fair election in 2023.\n\nSalvador says: \u201cThis sort of voting for electronic transmission of results should have been unanimous, but look at what happened. The issue would have been a thing of the past if that amendment was done. It is because these people, the incumbent, know they have failed and people are not happy with them.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria stagnant as world races towards knowledge-based economy",
          "text": "As Nigeria marks its 61st independence anniversary, 23.2 million of its people are unemployed of which 41 percent are youths; another 13 million children are out of school leaving many with little to cheer.\n\nDisillusioned, many of Nigeria\u2019s young people are fleeing the country in search of a better future elsewhere, with current trends on social media being a loud celebration of their departure outside the country\u2019s borders.\n\nA broken educational system and dearth of opportunities abound in a global race for the skills that would make them competitive in a knowledge-based economy.\n\nExperts say a knowledge-based economy relies more on intellectual capabilities than natural resources to enhance economic growth and development.\n\nSome of the jobs of the future are in software engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, payment solutions, creative designs and digital applications, among others, form the foundation of a knowledge-based economy.\n\nIn the current digital age, knowledge is a key factor in economic growth, creation of wealth, globalisation, job creation and entrepreneurship development.\n\nRead Also: Fixing Nigeria\u2019s economy from a policy angle\n\n\u201cBut Nigeria is not ready for the future of jobs and it is not due to intellectual capacity. The issue is that the government and structure that creates opportunities for these people are not there,\u201d Jennifer Oyelade, director of Transquisite Consulting, a UK and Nigerian registered recruitment and training consultancy, says.\n\nShe also notes that the government is not bringing in enough incentives to encourage Nigerians to stay, saying, \u201cPeople are using the country as a stepping stone to gather what they can in terms of education and taking it abroad, thereby fuelling the economy of other countries.\u201d\n\nAccording to the US government census data, the Nigerian diaspora is overall the best-educated and its members are more than twice as likely to have secured an advanced degree.\n\nSimilarly, Muhammad Sanusi, the former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, noted at the closing ceremony of the Kaduna Investment Summit held last week that the whole idea of a knowledge-based economy was to train people \u2013 value creators -and not just consumers.\n\n\u201cDigitisation provides an opportunity to level the playing ground, if we are deliberate and shift from consumption to value creation. But part of the problem that we have is that even if we have the solution at hand, we don\u2019t take it,\u201d Sanusi said.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, knowledge economies are defined by four pillars, which are: institutional structures that provide incentives for entrepreneurship and the use of knowledge, skilled labour availability and good education systems, ICT infrastructure and access, and a vibrant innovation landscape that includes academia, the private sector and civil society.\n\nSome countries, especially oil producing ones, have identified these pillars and by leveraging them, have witnessed high per capita incomes, low unemployment rates and strong economic growth.\n\nThe Global Innovation Index (GII), which ranks world economies according to their innovation capabilities, shows these countries in the 132 countries surveyed, United Arab Emirates (UAE) ranks 33rd, Saudi Arabia ranked 66th, and Qatar ranked 68th. These countries have also reported high GDP per capita with $32,686, $20,742 and $55,517, respectively, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nFor example, Qatar\u2019s investment in education is commensurate with its National Vision 2030, which advocates finding an optimum balance between the current oil-based economy and a knowledge economy characterised by innovation and entrepreneurship, excellence in education and the efficient delivery of public services.\n\nThe government has also begun offering investors tax breaks and other incentives to support entrepreneurship and promote Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).\n\nQatar\u2019s Science and Technology Park focuses on the four priority areas identified by the Qatar National Research Strategy of 2012, namely energy, environment, health sciences and information and communication technologies (ICTs).\n\nTo achieve the UAE vision of developing a diverse and flexible knowledge-based economy, it developed its Vision 2021 plan in 2010. The plan is linked to a national strategic plan for higher education and scientific research to set up programmes for tackling problems facing the higher education sector.\n\nThe science and technology university education programme is updated to match global standards as well as strengthen scientific expertise in line with private sector requirements and national development needs.\n\nSaudi Arabia is advancing towards a diversified knowledge-driven economy. The country is focused on technology transfer in order to compensate for paucity of various indigenous technological capacities.\n\nIn 2016, the country launched Vision 2030, a strategic framework to reduce its dependence on oil, diversify its economy, and develop public service sectors such as health, education, infrastructure, recreation and tourism.\n\nHowever, Nigeria has made very little progress in innovation towards its transition to a knowledge-based economy. The country ranks 118th out of 132 countries and its per capita GDP is $2,209.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government has not really seen the importance of having a knowledge-based economy. In fact, I don\u2019t see us transiting to that type of economy in the next decade,\u201d Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, says.\n\nNigeria\u2019s performance in human capital development has not been impressive. According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the country dropped three positions, ranking 161 in 2019 from 158 in 2018 among 189 countries in Human Development.\n\nAlso, over the past few years, budgetary allocation to education has not been more than 7 percent of its total budget. It is no wonder that the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) said the country had the highest out of school children in the world.\n\n\u201cThe completion rate between entry into primary one and completing university is 8 percent. Out of every 100 children who go into primary one, only eight end up coming out of the university. And out of these, 9 percent will get a job. So, this is the reality,\u201d Sanusi emphasised.\n\nA report by International Finance Corporation (IFC) highlights the existence of a skills gap, out-dated curriculum in engineering programmes and lack of opportunities for students to apply skills learned in the classroom in most African countries, including Nigeria.\n\nAyodele Akinwunmi, senior relationship manager, Corporate Banking Group, FSDH Merchant Bank, says innovation cannot happen without investment in human capital.\n\n\u201cOnce you don\u2019t develop your human capacity and you have your natural resources, you will not be able to utilise them effectively to turn them to what is productive. But if you develop human capacity, it will bring income generation, tax for the government and then employment generation,\u201d Akinwunmi states.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nINDEPENDENCE DAY ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF NIGERIA\u2019S SIXTY FIRST INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY, FRIDAY 1ST OCTOBER, 2021.\n\nCitizens of Nigeria.\n\nIt is with full gratitude to God that today, we celebrate Nigeria\u2019s sixty first Independence Anniversary.\n\n2. For 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck. East, West, North all came together to celebrate freedom. Today should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions and regions.\n\n3. Today, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation.\n\n4. Fellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period.\n\n5. Our original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising our economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant we needed to shift gears and re-strategise.\n\n6. Nigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19. It is this attitude and by the special grace of God, we continue to survive the pandemic as a nation and indeed, provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\n7. The doomsday scenario predicted for our country never came. Even as the Delta variant continues to spread, we have built the capacity we need to respond now and into the future.\n\n8. I will therefore appeal to Nigerians not to take COVID lightly, adhere to public health and social measures, put your mask on and get vaccinated. We can control this pandemic, but it requires effort on everybody\u2019s part. The investments we made in response to COVID-19 will also serve our country to tackle any future disease outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n9. Despite the global inequity in access to vaccines, the Government of Nigeria has continued to explore all available options to ensure Nigerians have free access to safe and effective vaccines.\n\n10. Some five million vaccine doses have been administered to Nigerians through efforts led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and we will continue to explore options for purchase or acquisition of vaccines such as through COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust.\n\n11. I will take this opportunity to remind the global community that the current state of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable. We cannot afford a situation where a handful of countries keep the global vaccine supply to themselves at the expense of other nations.\n\n12. We must act now to accelerate equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This is the message I conveyed to the international community in New York last week.\n\n13. As we push to source vaccines for our immediate needs, we shall invest more to support our pharmaceutical and research agencies to come up with ideas for locally developed vaccines. Should another pandemic arise in the future, Our question is simple; will Nigeria be ready?\n\n14. Accordingly, I have directed the Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Health, Education and Science and Technology to work with Nigerian and International pharmaceutical companies and research organisations to enhance Nigeria\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical capacity.\n\n15. Already, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority is raising a $200 million fund for this initiative that will complement the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing N85 billion Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme to support local researchers in the development of vaccines and drugs to combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\n\nFellow Nigerians, this is just the beginning.\n\n16. Similarly, on our approach to food security, I am proud to announce Nigeria has commenced its journey to pharmaceutical independence.\n\n17. This journey, which will take years to achieve but will ultimately result in Nigerian based companies developing the Active Pharmaceutical substances and competence needed for us to make our own drugs and vaccines.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n18. As our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country.\n\n19. In the last four months, the gallant men and women of the Military and Security Agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing these new security challenges. We are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning.\n\n20. Earlier this year, I launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, the Deep Blue Project, which is designed to secure Nigerian waters up to the Gulf of Guinea. I am happy to inform Nigerians that we have taken delivery of key assets for this project and very soon, its impact will be felt.\n\n21. In the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.\n\n22. To support our surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel across all ranks. Furthermore, I have also approved for the Nigerian Police Force to recruit 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years.\n\n23. I am also pleased to note that most of the Air Force platforms we acquired over the past three years have started to arrive in Nigeria. These will positively impact our security operations in all parts of the country.\n\n24. In line with section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the security and welfare of Nigerians continue to be the prime focus on which programmes and projects of our government revolves.\n\n25. Therefore, as a Government, we are ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action. Our resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering.\n\n26. That said, our hope is not to fight for peace. We can always settle our grievances peacefully without spilling any blood.\n\n27. I will therefore take this opportunity, on this special day that symbolises the unity and oneness of our great nation, to ask all Nigerians to embrace peace and dialogue, whatever your grievances.\n\n28. The seeds of violence are planted in people\u2019s heads through words. Reckless utterances of a few have led to losses of many innocent lives and destruction of properties.\n\n29. Such unfiltered and unsubstantiated lies and hate speeches by a few evil persons must be stopped. Our media houses and commentators must move away from just reporting irresponsible remarks to investigating the truth behind all statements and presenting the facts to readers.\n\n30. We must all come out and speak against the lies being peddled. At this point, I would want to sincerely appreciate the large number of our Traditional, Religious and Community leaders as well as other well-meaning Nigerians who, in their various fora are openly spreading the message of peaceful co-existence and conflict settlement through dialogue in their respective communities.\n\n31. Nigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation.\n\n32. We shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n33. The recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the national assembly.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n34. This is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains. Instead of preaching unity, they are funding and misleading our youth to conduct criminal acts that sometimes lead to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\n\n35. As the so-called leaders run abroad to hide, our innocent youths are misled and left in the streets to fight for their senseless and destructive causes.\n\n36. Government will continue, with greater level of peoples\u2019 participation and in collaboration with our international partners, to improve the security architecture, reduce enabling environment for criminality to thrive and eliminate opportunities for terrorism financing.\n\n37. Fellow Nigerians, our unrelenting effort at resolving an almost two-decade stalling on the management of our Petroleum resources and ensuring equitable consideration to our host communities has resulted in the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021.\n\n38. This Act not only overhauls the Institutional, regulatory and fiscal framework of the Petroleum Industry but also reduces the previous opacity associated with this sector.\n\n39. This is the first step to the reforms as the process is a continuous one. Already, to further improve the governance framework, I have sought for an amendment of sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b). We will also continue to review and amend as appropriate.\n\n40. At this juncture, it is very appropriate that I salute the leadership and members of the Ninth Assembly for their patriotism, dedication to duty, candour and most importantly the dispatch with which they have enacted legacy legislations for this nation. I do not take such level of cooperation for granted and hope it continues for the overall efficiency of the Federal machinery.\n\n41. Nigeria\u2019s Roadmap on Local Refining is on track with the Commissioning of a Modular refinery in Imo State.\n\n42. A second is scheduled for commissioning by the end of this year in Edo State and the third one in Bayelsa State by 2022.\n\n43. In addition to the modular projects, we also have the two mega refinery projects coming up in Lagos and Akwa Ibom States.\n\n44. As these refineries are commissioned, more employment opportunities are created and there would be increased petroleum products available for local consumption which will significantly reduce our reliance on importation.\n\n45. In further demonstrating our plan to reduce our dependence on oil and tapping from our enormous gas resources, this administration remains committed to the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d Initiative, which is aimed at bringing to focus the utilization of our huge gas resources.\n\n46. Already, we are supporting and promoting various gas-based projects including NLNG Train 7 and the mega urea and ammonia projects in the South-South region.\n\n47. As we continue to optimise and enhance our oil and gas sector, I am also proud and delighted to state that our economic diversification strategy remains on course with the persistent increase in Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP.\n\n48. We recovered from economic recession in quarter four of 2020 with a GDP growth rate of 0.11%, and grew by 0.51% and 5.01% in real terms in the first and second quarters of 2021.\n\n49. The Agricultural sector remains key to our economic diversification efforts as the sector has been a consistent driver of the non-oil sector contributing 22.35% and 23.78% to the overall GDP in the first and second quarter of 2021.\n\n50. We have seen significant private sector investments in almost all areas of the agricultural value chain. And these have continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n51. Unfortunately, as our food production capacity has increased, food prices have been going up due to artificial shortages created by middlemen who have been buying and hoarding these essential commodities for profiteering.\n\n52. To address this, I am hereby directing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to rehabilitate the National Food Reserve Agency and also work with security agencies, the Nigerian Commodity Exchange, and the National Assembly to find a lasting solution to these disruptive and unpatriotic hoarding activities.\n\n53. To further enhance food production, we have completed several new dams and are in the process of rehabilitating several River Basin Development Authorities to enhance ground water supply for rainfed agriculture as well as surface water for irrigation agriculture.\n\n54. The water projects we completed between 2015 to 2020 have improved Nigerian\u2019s access to potable water to 71% between 2015 and 2020. This means 12.5 million additional Nigerians now have direct access to potable water.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n55. This Government remains concerned by the significant transportation infrastructure deficit we have. Addressing the challenges our commuters and lorry drivers face on the motorways is still a high priority to us.\n\n56. To complement our budgetary allocations, the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund and the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme, we recently established a N15trillion Infrastructural Corporation of Nigeria Limited (INFRACO), which is expected to begin operation by the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n57. INFRACO will also focus on leveraging resources on a public-private sector basis for infrastructural development in Nigeria.\n\n58. We hope through these innovative programs, the additional cost burden on individuals and businesses because of inefficient logistics operations will be reduced and ultimately, eliminated.\n\n59. We currently have over 13,000 kilometres of roads and bridges under construction all over the country of which a fair percentage have been completed.\n\n60. As we fix our roads, we also continue to extend and upgrade Nigeria\u2019s railway network with the notable opening of the Warri- Itakpe standard gauge rail line.\n\n61. To increase capacity, we have introduced more locomotives, coaches and wagons including the establishment of a Wagon Assembly in Kajola, Ogun State.\n\n62. The sea ports however still remain problematic. The effect of our various interventions to reduce the gridlocks and inefficiencies have been slower than expected.\n\n63. However, the implementation of the Electronic Call-Up System as well as the conversion of the Lillypond Container Terminal to a Vehicle Transit Area will further enhance the ease of cargo evacuation.\n\n64. Our prioritisation of developing Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy has positively impacted the contribution of the ICT sector to our GDP.\n\n65. We hope our present efforts to ensure all Nigerians use a National Identification Number as well as our planned roll-out of the fifth generation (5G) network technology will ensure we stay in line with the global innovation curve as a Nation.\n\n66. As we embrace the digital economy in Nigeria, we are fully aware of the prospects and the perils. Our policies have been developed to enable Nigerians to take advantage of the prospects and avoid the perils of digital technologies.\n\n67. Social media is a very useful platform that has enabled millions of Nigerians to connect with loved ones, promote their businesses, socialise, and access news and other information.\n\n68. However, recent events have shown that the platform is not just an innocuous platform for information dissemination.\n\n69. Rather some users have misused the platform to organise, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\n70. To address these negative trends, the Federal Government of Nigeria suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria on June 5, 2021 to allow the Government put measures in place to address these challenges.\n\n71. Following the suspension of Twitter operations, Twitter Inc. reached out to the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the impasse. Subsequently, I constituted a Presidential Committee to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue.\n\n72. The Committee, along with its Technical Team, has engaged with Twitter and have addressed a number of key issues. These are:\n\na. National Security and Cohesion;\n\nb. Registration, Physical presence and Representation;\n\nc. Fair Taxation;\n\nd. Dispute Resolution; and\n\ne. Local Content.\n\n73. Following the extensive engagements, the issues are being addressed and I have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements.\n\n74. As a country, we are committed to ensuring that digital companies use their platform to enhance the lives of our citizens, respect Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, cultural values and promote online safety.\n\n75. Nigeria\u2019s progressive diplomacy continues to manifest through growing numbers of highly placed Nigerians in positions of regional and global influences. Very recently, Nigeria won election for the position of Commissioner for the expanded Political, Peace and Security Affairs of the African Union.\n\n76. Our persistent calls for a reorganized and reformed ECOWAS, to make the organization citizens-sensitive, paid off with the acceptance by the Authority of Heads of State and Governments of ECOWAS to commence the agreed reforms in the organization ahead of the next elections of the organization\u2019s principal officers in December this year.\n\n77. At the African Development Bank, World Trade Organization and indeed, the United Nations, footprints of Nigeria\u2019s Diplomacy are clearly evident.\n\n78. We remain confident that our goal of lifting 100million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is achievable.\n\n79. Considering the positive impact of our Social Investment Programs, I recently approved an increase in the number of N-Power program beneficiaries from 500,000 to 1,000,000.\n\n80. Out of this, 510,000 have started the programme while the competitive selection process for onboarding the outstanding 490,000 beneficiaries is in progress.\n\n81. The National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme is currently being implemented in 35 States of the Federation and the FCT. Over 103,000 women have been engaged and empowered as cooks under the programme, while about 10 million pupils are being fed across public primary schools in the country.\n\n82. To grant increased access to credit to the most poor and vulnerable, I have directed an increase in the disbursement of Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme loans to an additional one million beneficiaries laying more emphasis on the smallholding farmers through the farmers Moni program.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n83. For far too long we have neglected the centrality of the civil service as the engine of governance and this has manifested in ineffective service delivery.\n\n84. There is widespread discontent and disillusion about the efficiency and probity of our civil service.\n\n85. It is for this reason that we are refocusing the Nigerian Civil Service to provide World class service to run our country.\n\n86. The youths of this great country remain propellants for our today and provide guarantees that we would have a secure tomorrow.\n\n87. It is for this reason that I remain focused on expanding opportunities for their participation in politics and governance.\n\n88. Recent appointments of young people into positions of authority and their track record so far, gives me confidence that we need to bring more of them into governance and this I promise to do.\n\n89. More specifically, to encourage Girl-Child Education, female scholarship schemes, life skills and digital literacy skills to boost girl\u2019s enrolment, retention and completion of schooling, are all initiatives put in place to ensure gender balance in appropriately positioning our youths for positions of leadership.\n\n90. The commitment of this Administration to the well-being of people living with disabilities remains unwavering.\n\n91. Government recognises their contributions to development and I have, in this regard, directed that all relevant Government Agencies pay special attention to the peculiarities of different abilities in the implementation of policies and programmes.\n\n92. Rape and Gender Based Violence remains a sore point in our Nation as in many countries worldwide and this was worsened during and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n93. We are currently engaging Heads of Courts to establish Specialised Courts for the speedy and seamless trial of Rape/Gender-Based offences especially to ensure that justice is done for child victims of sexual violence.\n\n94. On the other hand, work has advanced in the reformation, reintegration and reunification of Minors involved in one crime or the other.\n\n95. The reformation in our Correctional Services has manifested in an increase in modernised custodial centres and a transformation from strictly punitive to attitudinal changes so that criminals do not relapse into their previous lifestyle.\n\n96. As we begin to celebrate our sixty one years as a Nation, we need to be conscious that Nigeria does not start and end with the Federal Government. This country is a great collective where Government at all arms and levels as well as the private sector, and more importantly individuals, have a role to play.\n\n97. In particular, security is a bottom to top undertaking. Joining hands and hearts together would enable us to secure ourselves and our country.\n\n98. I fully understand the anxiety of many Nigerians on the inability of this country to go beyond a never-ending potential for becoming a great nation to an actually great one.\n\n99. A lot has been achieved in the last six years on many fronts: in infrastructure, social care, governance, Nigeria\u2019s image and influence in Africa and the international community.\n\n100. But critics misdiagnose incremental progress as stagnation. Since coming to power, this Administration has tackled our problems head-on in spite of the meagre resources. No government since 1999 has done what we have done in six years to put Nigeria back on track.\n\n101. We shall continue to serve the country: listen to all and protect our democracy and country.\n\nThank you all and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nHarcourt Port \u2013 Rivers State governor, Nyeson Ezenwo Wike says Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) elected governors are working in unison to ensure that the party wins the presidential election in 2023.\n\nHe stated that contrary to the expectation of those who do not wish the party well, all the PDP governors are working hard to ensure the party regains the realm of power in 2023.\n\nThe governor gave this assurance at a reception for chieftains of the All Progressives Congress, including its former spokesperson, Mr. Ogbonna Nwuke; all the 23 local government chairmen of African Action Congress (AAC) who dumped their parties to join the PDP at the Isaac Boro Park, Port Harcourt on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting hard and God willing, PDP will takeover Nigeria in 2023. It is not a question of wishful thinking. It is a question of being committed and we are going to do it. All the governors of (PDP) have agreed, we will do it. PDP will never be divided. All the people who are thinking that PDP will be divided, they have all failed. All those who were trying to sabotage Rivers state, they have all been knocked out.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike explained that he was not surprised that Nwuke and others have decided to dump the APC. According to him, those who decamped have merely come to the realisation that cannot continue to be misguided and listen to illusive stories, particularly of the APC.\n\nHe said the people of Rivers state have seen that the PDP means well for them, hence, they have decided to put their fate in the hands of Almighty God first, and then the PDP.\n\nThe governor stated that PDP in the State has never been owned by an individual as is the case with the APC. He assured those who just decamped to the party and others who will join them in the future, that when decision to pick his successor will be made, they will not be excluded.\n\n\u201cEverybody must participate, and then we will take decision. It can be those who are coming now, you never can tell. Nobody can say because you came in yesterday, or because you came in today, you are not entitled. Everybody is entitled as far as PDP is concern.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike reiterated that Nigerians have since realised that APC led government has failed in all sectors. And he challenged the remnants of the APC to mention what Federal government has done for Rivers state in the last six years.\n\nThe governor expressed optimism that the sterling performance of his administration, particularly as it concerns infrastructural and human capacity development, has continued to endear the party to voters in the State.\n\n\u201cNo one project awarded by this administration will remain abandoned before we leave on the 29 May 2023. And then, another PDP government will come and take over from us. Let me assure you, God has already sealed it. Let nobody bother himself, PDP will take over Rivers State again because it is very obvious. Why will PDP take over? We will take over because we have made promises to you and we have fulfilled the promises.\u201d\n\nThe governor further charged all the PDP local government chairmen to ensure that those who just decamped to the party are not alienated.\n\nFormer Rivers State APC spokesperson, Ogbonna Nwuke, said in the last six years they have been in the wilderness.\n\n\u201cWe were promised change, but I will say we did not find change in Etche. All politics is local and I couldn\u2019t stand by, do the fighting and watch those who superintended over the affairs of the APC act in a manner that appeared callous. Accordingly, we have found our way out of wilderness. We have stumbled into light and we have found development partner and that development partner is the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the good road that you built. First, you gave us the Igwuruta-Chokocho dual carriage road. Then you gave us the Udofor-Akpoku-Umuoye Road. And the other day you returned and then you gave us the announcement of the Chokocho-Igbodo Road. Your Excellency, there is jubilation in Etche. I am jubilant myself.\n\n\u201cI am excited. And to tell you the candid truth, there could have been no better news. Today your Excellency, I have come back home . Honestly, there can be nothing better than home. Etche has 205 oil wells, Etche has over 80 percent of gas deposit south of River Niger and Your Excellency, you have already identified our need. the Etche need is access.\u201d\n\nA former member of the House of Representatives, Emma Deeyah, who also dumped the APC, said they were endeared to Governor Wike because of his bold and courageous leadership in the State.\n\nChairman of the PDP in Rivers State, Ambassador Desmond Akawor said all the former APC chieftains and AAC members that decamped to the PDP, were lured to join opposition by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi.\n\nHe remarked that having realised that the APC has nothing to offer the people of the State and Nigerians, they decided to dump the party and all that it represents to join the PDP.\n\nSome members of the APC that decamped to the PDP are former member of House of Representatives, Daemi Akpanah; former member of House of Assembly, Ibiso Nwuche; former Speaker, Rivers State House of Assembly, Stephen Ezekwem; former Commissioner of Works, Levy Braide; former member of House of Assembly, Emmanuel Okata; former chairman, Rivers State Civil Service Commission, Ngo Martins-Yellowe; Goodlife Nmekini, former Special Adviser to Governor Chibuike Amaechi; Dr. Barinedum Nwibere, former Director General, Cole/Giadom campaign organisation among others.\n\n...",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: How Aliyu Gusau\u2019s man was arrested in London over $1.4Million Malabu largesse",
          "text": "Details have emerged of how Umar Bature, a former member of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives, was arrested in London while distributing suspicious funds suspected to have been meant for a former Nigerian National Security Adviser (NSA), Aliyu Mohammed Gusau.\n\nMr Bature, an ally of Mr Gusau, was arrested after he met Jeffrey Tesler, a British businessman previously involved in the case of international corruption known as the \u201cBonny Island\u201d Halliburton scandal. Mr Tesler also doubles as a friend and ally of Mr Gusau.\n\nThe money is suspected to be among the slush funds distributed in connection with the Malabu scandal.\n\nThe new details are found in documents obtained exclusively by PREMIUM TIMES from exhibits submitted in a case filed in the United States by oil giant, ENI.\n\nMr Tesler is a British citizen already implicated in the Halliburton-Bonny Island scandal regarding the bribery of Nigerian public officials, which also involved SAIPEM, a company that was until 2016 a subsidiary of ENI.\n\nMr Gusau, easily one of the most influential figures in Nigeria\u2019s military intelligence circles, was head of the secret military service in Nigeria between 1988 and 1989. He later became director of national security for former presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan. He also served briefly as Minister of Defence under Mr Jonathan.\n\nMr Bature was a member of the House of Representatives, where he represented Sokoto North/South Federal Constituency. He had earlier served in the Nigerian Armed Forces until he retired in 2003 and joined partisan politics. He is said to have become a \u201cprotegee\u201d of Mr Gusau during his days in the Armed Forces. He is currently serving as Commissioner for Water Resources in Sokoto State.\n\nThe Malabu Backstory\n\nThe Malabu scandal involved the transfer of about $1.1 billion by Shell and ENI through the Nigerian government to accounts controlled by Dan Etete, a former Nigerian oil minister.\n\nFrom the former minister\u2019s accounts, prosecutors say about half the money went to accounts of companies controlled by Aliyu Abubakar, a middleman popularly known in Nigeria as the owner of AA oil. Anti-corruption investigators and activists suspect he fronted for top officials of the Goodluck Jonathan administration as well of officials of Shell and ENI. He denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe Malabu transaction was authorised in 2011 by former President Goodluck Jonathan through some of his cabinet ministers and the money was payment for OPL 245, one of Nigeria\u2019s richest oil blocks.\n\nThe oil resources of the OPL 245 license have remained undeveloped since the controversies began. ENI initiated international arbitration proceedings against Nigeria last September, alleging the government had breached its obligations by refusing to let the firm develop the license.\n\nFresh Details\n\nFresh details seen in documents reviewed by PREMIUM TIMES have provided insights into the roles of other Nigerians in the long-running Malabu scandal.\n\nIn one of the exhibits submitted by Eni, Mr Tesler explained the role of Mr Bature in the scandal. Until now, Mr Bature\u2019s name and alleged roles have never been reported in the controversial deal.\n\nOn January 9, 2014, details showed that Mr Tesler went into a police station in London, handed over a bag containing the sum of \u00a3378,670 in cash, and made statements about the circumstances under which he came into possession of the money.\n\nIn summary, Mr Tesler reported that he had entered into a cooperation agreement with the government of the United States, ostensibly regarding investigations on the Halliburton scandal, thus obtaining a type of immunity in exchange for his activities as an informant.\n\nFor this reason, through his lawyers in New York, he advised the US government of his meeting, on November 15, 2013, with a man of Nigerian nationality, who introduced himself as \u201cUmar Bature\u201d, who had informed him that Dan Etete, former Nigerian oil minister, intended to transfer to him the sum of $2 million at a foreign exchange office in Abuja.\n\nMr Bature had, therefore, asked him to provide bank details so as to credit the money to him. In response to his answer of not having an account that could be used for such purpose, Mr Bature said that the money, net of commissions for the transfer, could be collected by him in London in several tranches.\n\n\u201cAccording to Tesler, at that first meeting, he had not been told the origin of the money, nor the reason for which he was the beneficiary,\u201d the document said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn the performance of the agreement entered into with the Department of Justice of the United States, he had drafted a memo summarising the content of the meeting with Bature, and had sent it to his lawyers, so that they could inform the United States legal authorities.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further in his account to the British police officers, Mr Tesler stated that he had not had further news of Mr Etete and the money until the evening of January 8, 2014, when he received a phone call from General Mohammed Aliyu Gusau, who informed him that within a few minutes he would receive another phone call.\n\n\u201cIndeed, at 7:15 p.m., Umar Bature phoned him, presenting himself as the person he met on a previous occasion and asked if they could meet so that he could give him something,\u201d the document said.\n\n\u201cThey made an appointment to meet at 8:00 p.m. at the Cavendish Hotel on German Street in Piccadilly, where Bature stated he was staying. He immediately informed his lawyer, who told him the instructions received from the United States to collect the money and not spend it.\n\n\u201cTherefore, he went to the appointment, meeting with Bature in his room, and there received a very heavy suitcase, extracted from a case, inside which, according to Bature, there was the sum of GBP 378,000 in small bills. Bature asked him to return the following day to receive another suitcase and to discuss the commissions to be paid.\n\n\u201cAfter the meeting was finished, he immediately informed his lawyer of the events, who told him a few hours later that he would be contacted by an FBI agent. Indeed, the day after, at noon, he received a phone call from a certain John Coushad, who told him that he had already informed the police authorities of the United Kingdom and to not go to the next appointment with Bature.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on how he met Mr Gusau, Mr Tesler explained that he had had a long relationship of continuous visits with him, meeting him whenever he came to London, which normally happened once every 4- 6 weeks, and speaking on these occasions of the political-economic events of Nigeria.\n\nHe added that he met Mr Bature in November 2013 and January 8, 2014, adding that he had not asked questions on the origin of the money and the reasons for which Mr Etete had sent it to him so as to not place himself in danger.\n\nWhen asked by the English police agent whether he knew the reason why Mr Etete had sent him the money, he said, according to details of the exhibit: \u201c\u2026two million is a drop in the ocean compared to the amount of money which he collected from Shell and Agip \u2026\u201d The document added that Mr Tesler, therefore, \u201clinks the sum of money in cash given to him by Umar Bature on behalf of Dan Etete to the price received by the latter from ENI and Shell for OPL 245.\u201d\n\nThe documents further explained that Mr Bature had had a role in the negotiation for the sale of OPL 245 because, since 2009, he has participated in meetings between Messrs Etete, Agaev, and employees of Shell. He was also serially identified as \u201cGusau man\u201d.\n\nThe next day, the document showed, Mr Bature was arrested and interrogated by an agent of the anti-money laundering team of New Scotland Yard.\n\nDuring interrogation, the document said, Mr Bature admitted to having been commissioned to take the amount of $1.4 million to Mr Tesler, a friend of his \u201cboss\u201d.\n\nHe also reportedly admitted to having gone along with his \u201cboss\u201d to currency exchange offices that were legally recognised in Nigeria to check how to transfer this sum of money to the United Kingdom and, indeed, agreed on the transfer to the United Kingdom in exchange for a commission of 7.8 per cent.\n\nThe document said that Mr Bature also confirmed that his \u201cboss\u201d, from whom he received the assignment, is General Aliyu Mohammed Gusau, a Nigerian minister at the time. He also added that he flew to London from Dubai at the request of the General to deliver the money to Mr Tesler.\n\nMr Bature also claimed, according to the documents, to have handed over to Mr Tesler, who he had already met previously several times, the sum of GBP 374,000, as the first tranche of a total sum of 1.3 million allocated to him. He added that he received the money, in turn, from a Nigerian citizen, who was also arrested, named Gabriel Oziegbe.\n\n\u201cIn actual fact, the money given by Tesler and seized by the British authorities amounted to GBP 378,670. Also, Gabriel Oziegbe was interrogated by the English police and confirmed Bature\u2019s story. A considerable further amount of money in cash, for a total amount of $50,000 and GBP 82,173, was seized from him,\u201d the document reads in part.\n\n\u201cThe general Aliyu Mohammed, to whom Bature refers, is certainly the General Aliyu Mohamed Gusau, given that he held a variety of positions in the Nigerian Armed Forces up to the highest levels of the secret services of that country, and was then national security adviser to two presidents of the republic.\n\n\u201cGusau has been a friend of Tesler for years, as stated by the latter; it was Gusau who told Tesler in advance, on the same day, about Bature\u2019s telephone call pre-announcing the delivery of the money. Bature was already indicated in 2009 as \u201ca man of Gusau\u201d by Copleston, who, by collecting information on the field in Nigeria on behalf of Shell on the strength of his previous experience as an MI6 agent, probably came to know about the relationship between the two, dating back to their common past of belonging to the Nigerian Armed Forces.\u201d\n\nThe document claimed that the revelation reflects the statements of Ednan Agaev, an ex-Russian diplomat, regarding the fact that in relation to the deal of OPL 245, \u201cGusau was expecting a commission from Etete\u201d. The revelation also finds confirmation in the statements made to the investigators by Jonathan Benton, the former head of the Corruption Unit of the Metropolitan Police of London, which had investigated the OPL 245 Malabu saga, it added.\n\nMessrs Etete and Gusau are believed to be close allies. In one of his disclosures in 2019, Mr Agaev claimed that he was introduced to Mr Etete by Mr Gusau in 2008.\n\nWhen contacted Thursday night, Mr Bature told PREMIUM TIMES he had nothing to say about the matter.\n\nMr Gusau, on his part, did not return telephone calls and text messages seeking comments from him.\n\nIn March, PREMIUM TIMES reported how an Italian court in Milan acquitted Shell, Eni and their managers in the long-drawn Malabu trial. But prosecutors reportedly lodged appeals against the verdict. An Italian newspaper quoted a Milan prosecutor as describing the acquittal judgment as \u201cthin and illogical\u201d.\n\nAnti-corruption groups monitoring the case in Nigeria and across Europe, including the Human and Environmental Development Agenda, (HEDA), Corner House and Re: Common, also criticised the acquittal judgement which they said distorted and ignored vital evidence.\n\n\u201cOur own analysis suggests that the Milan judgment was deeply flawed,\u201d Lanre Suraj, chair of HEDA, was quoted as saying in a joint statement in August.",

          "title": "Why The Buhari Bribery Train Crashed At the United Nations",
          "text": "By SKC Ogbonnia\n\nIt was not surprising that the Nigerian Diaspora community would gather in New York City at the 76th session of the UN General Assembly to protest the reign of terror under President Muhammadu Buhari. What is deeply surprising is that the agents of the Nigerian government from the homeland would attempt to counter the truth by storming the same venue to launder millions of dollars on foreign imposters who were recruited to create the false impression that all is well with the African country. This shameless approach by the emissaries of Nigerian government only goes to show that President Muhammadu Buhari is an irredeemable zombie.\n\nAgreed, sense is no more common these days, but recent events ought to have been able to alert the president that his government no longer has credibility at the international scene. Even a dumbo could have reasoned that the backhand banning of Buhari by Twitter has a ring to it. One must also not be a genius to discern the timing of the recent outright refusal by the U.S. government to sell arms to Nigeria. Follow these facts with the freefall of naira against major world currencies. Even a buffoon could recognize there and then that Buhari\u2019s ongoing war against the Nigerian people is not being decided at the Aso Rock.\n\nThe gist, if it is not already palpable, is that while the Buhari Bribery train is designed to massage his montage of propaganda in Nigeria, it would always crash abroad. The days are gone when the Nigerian government can preach justice abroad, while promoting injustice at home. The days are gone when a clique could assume power in Nigeria, dictate as it pleases, and assume the world would follow. The days are far gone when the world relied solely on the official mouthpiece of the Nigerian government or the false testimonies of its corrupt agents. While fronting Nigeria\u2019s foreign delegations with deep cocktail of Igbo and Yoruba colors can be superficially strategic, these government toadies can only talk and go back home.\n\nThe inconvenient truth is that Nigeria now boasts of millions of independent and trustworthy Nigerians in the Diaspora who function as a Shadow Government. The members are strategically entrenched in all the nooks and crannies of the world, and who are bound to tell it as it is. The members are formidable and have earned the trust of foreign governments. They are profoundly influential at every seat of world power and every seat of state and city governments. Ironically, most of them are the direct victims of the injustice in the homeland. They belong to the community of highly qualified Nigerian citizens who are deemed unworthy at home but have found grace in the foreign land. They have become the Nigerian Biblical Josephs.\n\nToday, these Nigerian Josephs have come to dictate the content and character of the nation\u2019s foreign exchange, foreign trade, foreign investment, the media, as well as other socio-economic relationships. Common sense dictates that the same Josephs are the leading block contributors to the yearly amount of foreign money remitted to Nigeria, which is interestingly more than the national budget. Common sense dictates that as they go, so goes the national image and much more.\n\nNothing highlights the impact of these Nigerian Josephs more than their role in the current wave of Nigerian secessionist movements on the international scene. Recall that rather than exploring dialogue, as Buhari has always advocated in the case of similar situation in Palestine, his regime chooses brute force on the Biafran and Yoruba Nation activists. The regime even goes further to launder millions of dollars worldwide in a futile attempt to brand the Biafran activists as terrorists. But the Nigerian Josephs know better. And the world knows to follow.\n\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that the Nigerian group, besides Boko Haram, that came to be recognised worldwide as terrorists are the \u201cforeign\u201d Fulani herdsmen, the very group that President Buhari curdles. What is more? There were more flags belonging to the Yoruba Nation agitators and the Biafran \u201cterrorists\u201d than the national flags of Nigeria at the just concluded 76th session of the UN General Assembly. Thus, if propaganda and draconian threats\u2014like his 2021 independence speech\u2014must remain the solution to the Nigerian leadership crisis, someone ought to tell General Buhari that he is fighting a losing battle.\n\nThe true solution is common sense. Nigeria must not remain a fool at 61! There are open wounds that must be addressed and dressed. As the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, stated at the earlier stage of the secessionist crisis, \u201cA lot of things were done in the past by some people with impunity and nothing was done.\u201d The Sultan appealed that statesmen across Nigeria \u201cshould help the country by championing the dialogue.\u201d This goes without saying that Muhammadu Buhari should lead by example. He needs to embody what he has always preaches at the United Nations in case of the people of Palestine. This \u201cis the question of justice, fairness, and equity in respect of the\u201d Nigerian people. Anything else is being busy doing something close to nothing.\n\nDr. SKC Ogbonnia, a 2019 APC Presidential Aspirant, writes from Houston, Texas.",

And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation.\n\n\u201cWe shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n\u201cThe recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the national assembly.\n\n\u201cThis is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains. Instead of preaching unity, they are funding and misleading our youth to conduct criminal acts that sometimes lead to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\n\n\u201cAs the so-called leaders run abroad to hide, our innocent youths are misled and left in the streets to fight for their senseless and destructive causes.\n\n\u201cGovernment will continue, with greater level of peoples\u2019 participation and in collaboration with our international partners, to improve the security architecture, reduce enabling environment for criminality to thrive and eliminate opportunities for terrorism financing.\n\n\u201cWe shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n\u201cThe recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the national assembly. \u201cFellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period.\n\n\u201cToday, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation.\n\n\u201cOur original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising our economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant we needed to shift gears and re-strategise.\n\n\u201cNigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19. It is this attitude and by the special grace of God, we continue to survive the pandemic as a nation and indeed, provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\n\u201cThe doomsday scenario predicted for our country never came. Even as the Delta variant continues to spread, we have built the capacity we need to respond now and into the future.\n\n\u201cI will therefore appeal to Nigerians not to take COVID lightly, adhere to public health and social measures, put your mask on and get vaccinated. We can control this pandemic, but it requires effort on everybody\u2019s part. The investments we made in response to COVID-19 will also serve our country to tackle any future disease outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n\u201cDespite the global inequity in access to vaccines, the Government of Nigeria has continued to explore all available options to ensure Nigerians have free access to safe and effective vaccines.\n\n\u201cSome five million vaccine doses have been administered to Nigerians through efforts led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and we will continue to explore options for purchase or acquisition of vaccines such as through COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust.\n\n\u201cI will take this opportunity to remind the global community that the current state of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable. We cannot afford a situation where a handful of countries keep the global vaccine supply to themselves at the expense of other nations.\n\n\u201cWe must act now to accelerate equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This is the message I conveyed to the international community in New York last week.\n\n\u201cAs we push to source vaccines for our immediate needs, we shall invest more to support our pharmaceutical and research agencies to come up with ideas for locally developed vaccines. Should another pandemic arise in the future, Our question is simple; will Nigeria be ready?\n\n\u201cAccordingly, I have directed the Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Health, Education and Science and Technology to work with Nigerian and International pharmaceutical companies and research organisations to enhance Nigeria\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical capacity.\n\n\u201cAlready, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority is raising a $200 million fund for this initiative that will complement the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing N85 billion Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme to support local researchers in the development of vaccines and drugs to combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI am proud to announce Nigeria has commenced its journey to pharmaceutical independence. This journey, which will take years to achieve but will ultimately result in Nigerian based companies developing the Active Pharmaceutical substances and competence needed for us to make our own drugs and vaccines.\n\n\u201cAs our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country.\n\nPresident Buhari said in the last four months, the gallant men and women of the Military and Security Agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing new security challenges, adding, \u201cWe are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, I launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, the Deep Blue Project, which is designed to secure Nigerian waters up to the Gulf of Guinea. I am happy to inform Nigerians that we have taken delivery of key assets for this project and very soon, its impact will be felt.\n\n\u201cIn the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered. To support our surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel across all ranks. Furthermore, I have also approved for the Nigerian Police Force to recruit 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years.\n\n\u201cI am also pleased to note that most of the Air Force platforms we acquired over the past three years have started to arrive in Nigeria. These will positively impact our security operations in all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cIn line with section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the security and welfare of Nigerians continue to be the prime focus on which programmes and projects of our government revolves.\n\n\u201cTherefore, as a Government, we are ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action. Our resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering.\n\n\u201cThat said, our hope is not to fight for peace. We can always settle our grievances peacefully without spilling any blood.\u201d\n\nHe said that the country\u2019s unrelenting effort at resolving an almost two-decade stalling on the management of Petroleum resources and ensuring equitable consideration to our the communities has resulted in the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021\n\n\u201cThis Act not only overhauls the Institutional, regulatory and fiscal framework of the Petroleum Industry but also reduces the previous opacity associated with this sector. This is the first step to the reforms as the process is a continuous one. Already, to further improve the governance framework, I have sought for an amendment of sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b). We will also continue to review and amend as appropriate.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, it is very appropriate that I salute the leadership and members of the Ninth Assembly for their patriotism, dedication to duty, candour and most importantly the dispatch with which they have enacted legacy legislations for this nation. I do not take such level of cooperation for granted and hope it continues for the overall efficiency of the Federal machinery.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s Roadmap on Local Refining is on track with the Commissioning of a Modular refinery in Imo State.\n\n\u201cA second is scheduled for commissioning by the end of this year in Edo State and the third one in Bayelsa State by 2022. In addition to the modular projects, we also have the two mega refinery projects coming up in Lagos and Akwa Ibom States.\n\n\u201cAs these refineries are commissioned, more employment opportunities are created and there would be increased petroleum products available for local consumption which will significantly reduce our reliance on importation.\n\n\u201cIn further demonstrating our plan to reduce our dependence on oil and tapping from our enormous gas resources, this administration remains committed to the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d Initiative, which is aimed at bringing to focus the utilization of our huge gas resources.\n\n\u201cAlready, we are supporting and promoting various gas-based projects including NLNG Train 7 and the mega urea and ammonia projects in the South-South region.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to optimise and enhance our oil and gas sector, I am also proud and delighted to state that our economic diversification strategy remains on course with the persistent increase in Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP.\n\n\u201cWe recovered from economic recession in quarter four of 2020 with a GDP growth rate of 0.11%, and grew by 0.51% and 5.01% in real terms in the first and second quarters of 2021.\n\n\u201cThe Agricultural sector remains key to our economic diversification efforts as the sector has been a consistent driver of the non-oil sector contributing 22.35% and 23.78% to the overall GDP in the first and second quarter of 2021.\n\n\u201cWe have seen significant private sector investments in almost all areas of the agricultural value chain. And these have continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, as our food production capacity has increased, food prices have been going up due to artificial shortages created by middlemen who have been buying and hoarding these essential commodities for profiteering.\n\n\u201cTo address this, I am hereby directing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to rehabilitate the National Food Reserve Agency and also work with security agencies, the Nigerian Commodity Exchange, and the National Assembly to find a lasting solution to these disruptive and unpatriotic hoarding activities.\n\n\u201cTo further enhance food production, we have completed several new dams and are in the process of rehabilitating several River Basin Development Authorities to enhance ground water supply for rainfed agriculture as well as surface water for irrigation agriculture.\u201d\n\nBuhari who also addressed the Twitter ban his government imposed in June, said he had directed a conditional lifting of the ban.\n\nHe described the social media as a very useful platform but regretted that some users have misused the platform to organise, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\n\u201cSocial media is a very useful platform that has enabled millions of Nigerians to connect with loved ones, promote their businesses, socialise, and access news and other information,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n\u201cHowever, recent events have shown that the platform is not just an innocuous platform for information dissemination.\n\n\u201cRather some users have misused the platform to organise, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\n\u201cTo address these negative trends, the Federal Government of Nigeria suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria on June 5, 2021 to allow the Government put measures in place to address these challenges.\n\n\u201cFollowing the suspension of Twitter operations, Twitter Inc. reached out to the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the impasse. Subsequently, I constituted a Presidential Committee to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue.\n\n\u201cThe Committee, along with its Technical Team, has engaged with Twitter and have addressed a number of key issues. These are National Security and Cohesion; Registration, Physical presence and Representation; Fair Taxation; Dispute Resolution; and Local Content.\n\n\u201cFollowing the extensive engagements, the issues are being addressed and I have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements.\n\n\u201cAs a country, we are committed to ensuring that digital companies use their platform to enhance the lives of our citizens, respect Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, cultural values and promote online safety\n\n\u201cAs we embrace the digital economy in Nigeria, we are fully aware of the prospects and the perils. Our policies have been developed to enable Nigerians to take advantage of the prospects and avoid the perils of digital technologies.\u201d",

          "title": "Dear Nigerian youth, if you are planning to \u2018japa\u2019 you must read this",
          "text": "On Tuesday, I came across a trending hashtag #GoodbyeNigeria while scouring the internet. It was about young Nigerians who had emigrated from Nigeria and were sharing airport selfies taken on their way out as well as selfies of them landing in their new location.\n\nScrolling through goofy pictures with even goofier captions was funny to me. However, there was a residue of sadness because, despite the air of frivolity, there was something deeper, an acute sense of loss. After all, the other name for emigration is brain drain.\n\nNews reports from a week or so ago informed us that 353 Nigerian doctors moved over to the NHS this year, enriching Britain\u2019s health care industry.\n\nThe story is the same in other sectors, especially ICT and Fintech. Nigeria is constantly losing its best and brightest and now young too, to other countries who place a much higher premium on human life and dignity of labour.\n\nBut it is not all gloom and doom. While we may lose our young and able physically they are not completely lost to us. Many are still contributing to Nigeria\u2019s economy via remittances.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, diaspora remittances for the past three years came to $24.31 billion in 2018; they dropped to $23.81 billion in 2019 before falling to $17.21 billion in 2020. To put it in context, remittance inflow made up four per cent of Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2020.\n\nThat is huge because this year, oil, Nigeria\u2019s mainstay, has contributed 9 per cent of GDP. In Africa, Nigeria is only second to Egypt in terms of diaspora remittances. Egypt notched up $30bn in 2020.\n\nA recent article in Vanguard noted that \u201cthere is an estimated population of 1.24 million Nigerians living abroad, many of them highly skilled professionals. It is a well-known fact that Nigerians are the single most educated emigrant group in the United States. They have a median income of $68,658, which is well above the national median of $61,937.\u201d\n\nSo, we may laugh and make fun of Nigeria while we look at those who have made the transition from the Global South to the Global North but like the flautist who must pause to blow his nose, we must pause to reflect on why young people are leaving and what the future holds.\n\nYoung people are leaving because they are disenchanted with the country where they are not guaranteed jobs after graduation and where if they get jobs, they will earn a pittance. They are frustrated by a country where insecurity is the order of the day and life has become brutish, short, and cheap. They have lost hope in a country where the youth leader is 65 years old and those in leadership have been recycled since 1966.\n\nThe young are tired of living in a country where a Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) operative can stop you, arrest you, and throw you in jail just because you look a certain way. They have abandoned all hope in a country where Economic and Financial Crimes (EFCC) operatives can barge into your hotel room and drag you away in the nude because they are \u201clooking for yahoo boys\u201d.\n\nBut as you, Dear Young Nigerian, begin to plan your escape, thorns and hurdles are sprouting in your path.

          "text": "On Tuesday, I came across a trending hashtag #GoodbyeNigeria while scouring the internet. It was about young Nigerians who had emigrated from Nigeria and were sharing airport selfies taken on their way out as well as selfies of them landing in their new location.\n\nScrolling through goofy pictures with even goofier captions was funny to me. However, there was a residue of sadness because, despite the air of frivolity, there was something deeper, an acute sense of loss. After all, the other name for emigration is brain drain.\n\nNews reports from a week or so ago informed us that 353 Nigerian doctors moved over to the NHS this year, enriching Britain\u2019s health care industry.\n\nThe story is the same in other sectors, especially ICT and Fintech. Nigeria is constantly losing its best and brightest and now young too, to other countries who place a much higher premium on human life and dignity of labour.\n\nBut it is not all gloom and doom. While we may lose our young and able physically they are not completely lost to us. Many are still contributing to Nigeria\u2019s economy via remittances.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, diaspora remittances for the past three years came to $24.31 billion in 2018; they dropped to $23.81 billion in 2019 before falling to $17.21 billion in 2020. To put it in context, remittance inflow made up four per cent of Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2020.\n\nThat is huge because this year, oil, Nigeria\u2019s mainstay, has contributed 9 per cent of GDP. In Africa, Nigeria is only second to Egypt in terms of diaspora remittances. Egypt notched up $30bn in 2020.\n\nA recent article in Vanguard noted that \u201cthere is an estimated population of 1.24 million Nigerians living abroad, many of them highly skilled professionals. It is a well-known fact that Nigerians are the single most educated emigrant group in the United States. They have a median income of $68,658, which is well above the national median of $61,937.\u201d\n\nSo, we may laugh and make fun of Nigeria while we look at those who have made the transition from the Global South to the Global North but like the flautist who must pause to blow his nose, we must pause to reflect on why young people are leaving and what the future holds.\n\nYoung people are leaving because they are disenchanted with the country where they are not guaranteed jobs after graduation and where if they get jobs, they will earn a pittance. They are frustrated by a country where insecurity is the order of the day and life has become brutish, short, and cheap. They have lost hope in a country where the youth leader is 65 years old and those in leadership have been recycled since 1966.\n\nThe young are tired of living in a country where a Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) operative can stop you, arrest you, and throw you in jail just because you look a certain way. They have abandoned all hope in a country where Economic and Financial Crimes (EFCC) operatives can barge into your hotel room and drag you away in the nude because they are \u201clooking for yahoo boys\u201d.\n\nBut as you, Dear Young Nigerian, begin to plan your escape, thorns and hurdles are sprouting in your path. The government, it seems, does not want you to japa. The government does not want you to take selfies in Canada. They want you to stay here with us and deal with SARS and EFCC as well as bandits and kidnappers.\n\nHow do they plan to do this? Well, let us look at a recent article by an online journalist who published what he called an expose on the reasons behind the acute scarcity of international passports.\n\nSome of the reasons he adduces should be cause for concern for every young Nigerian with aspirations to seek the Golden Fleece abroad.

          "text": "Following the outrage that greeted the gruesome murder of Dr Chike Akunyili, husband of Late Professor Dora Akunyili, the Indigenous People of Biafra, IpoB, yesterday, vowed to stop the ongoing dastardly killings and other mayhem being unleashed on the people of the southeast, warning those behind the killings, particularly in Anambra State to stop, otherwise it will send Eastern Security Network, ESN, after them.\n\nIPOB also said that it has asked all residents of the southeast to be at red alert over alleged plots by the enemies to unleash mayhem on innocent citizens under the guise of enforcing the sit-at-home order.\n\nIPOB spoke as the former governor of Enugu State, Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo yesterday, urged the group to stop unleashing mayhem on the people, saying the group is gradually fetching ant-infested firewood for itself.\n\nA statement by IPOB\u2019s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, entitled: \u201cWe will order ESN, to go after the masterminds of the senseless killings in Biafra land if they don\u2019t stop now\u201d urged its volunteers and security operatives to be on the watch out, that some hoodlums working for its enemies have planned to unleash terror on Biafrans.\n\nIPOB\u2019s statement read in part: \u201cFollowing the sit at home order on October 1st 2021, we the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, ably led by our great leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu wish to place every resident of Biafra on red alert over plots by the enemies to unleash mayhem on innocent citizens under the guise of enforcing the sit-at-home order.\n\n\u201cOur volunteers and security operatives should be on alert in every part of Biafra land. We realize that some hoodlums working for our enemies would want to capitalize on this order and attack people and turn around and blame it on IPOB.\n\n\u201cIPOB through its intelligence units has discovered that the Nigerian estblishment working in cohort with the Fulani oligarchy has activated the second phase of their plan to take over indigenous peoples ancestral lands.\n\n\u201cThe revelation is that the Fulani will start targeted killings of prominent southerners which has commenced in earnest with the gruesome murder of Dr. Chike Akunyili.\n\n\u201cThey will commit these murders and hide under the name of unkown gunmen to attack more innocent and prominent people during the sit-at-home.\n\n\u201cWe are raising this alarm so that Biafrans and residents of Biafra will beware of this evil plot by these blood suckers. They want to go on killing spree in Biafra land and blame it on IPOB. Everybody will have to be cautious because the enemies are here with their agents of death.\n\n\u201cThese vampires who murdered Dr. Chike Akunyili two days ago still want to sustain their murderous campaign in Biafra land but they will meet their waterloo.\n\n\u201cOur intelligence has revealed that they want to commit more atrocities on October 1st and blame it on IPOB. According to the intelligence, these blood suckers want to also attack children in Biafra land to create the impression that IPOB is now attacking school children. Killing is never part of our mandate.\n\n\u201cContrary to campaign of calumny sponsored by our enemies to demonize us, IPOB has no hands in the orgy of attacks in Biafra land. We have no pleasure in attacking or killing our people.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate intension of the masterminds of this barbarity is to make Biafra land especially South East as insecure and porous as the terrorists-infested Northern region.\n\n\u201cWe therefore want to place our people on red alert over the plot by our enemies to destabilise our region. This has become necessary following the recent revelation by a South West governor that a Northern governor is exporting bandits from the north to other parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBandits have taken over the whole North and they are now trying to replicate such in our land but we must resist them. It\u2019s now obvious that terrorists are everywhere and perfecting the war of jihad in our land.\n\n\u201cThis season calls for more vigilance among our people. We must all synergize as a people to provide security for every resident of Biafra land. We won\u2019t allow our enemies to create the atmosphere of fear and terror in our land.\n\n\u201cWe are holding the Nigerian state and some politicians from the Northern part of the country and their fellow politicians in Biafran land using DSS and sacked SARS officers accountable for the festering insecurity in our land. They are responsible for the senseless killings going on in Biafra land particularly in Anambra and Imo States.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that Gov. Akeredolu of Ondo State warned everyone in Nigeria especially the south about the evil plans of some elements from the North exporting terrorists and bandits to the South but it fell on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cWhy have the DSS, Army, Police, NIA and other security agents failed to investigate the revelation? They pretend as if nothing is happening because they are all involved in the evil plan to kill and slaughter Biafrans and southerners at will in the name of gunmen.\n\n\u201cWhile bandits are wiping out Christian communities in the North as being currently witnessed in Southern Kaduna and Jos, the terrorists in security uniforms are carrying out genocide in Biafra land.\n\n\u201cWe are making it clear to all and sundry that if nothing is done to stop this senseless killings in our land by the enemies of Biafra, we will have no other option than to order ESN to leave the bushes and forests to towns and villages to flush out the Northern exported killer terrorists who are bent on killing and slaughtering our people in the name of unkown gunmen while mischievously blaming their atrocities on IPOB and ESN operatives.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on everybody in Biafra land to join hands and support IPOB and ESN to flush these murderous killers ravaging our land particularly Imo and Anambra States. Enough of this madness.\u201d\n\nStop unleashing mayhem on your people, Nwodo urges IPOB\n\nSpeaking yesterday in Nsukka, Chief Nwodo, who was also a former national chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP, told IPoB to seek better ways of engaging the Federal Government to release Nnamdi Kanu, rather than fetching ant-infested firewood which is already having devastating effects on the people of the zone.\n\nHe made the statement while condemning the gruesome murder of Dr. Chike Akunyili, by men suspected to be members of IPoB at Anambra State on Tuesday.\n\nHe also enjoined all the local security architecture in the zone to team up with federal security agencies to ensure that South East does not become another theatre of violence in Nigeria.\n\nHe said \u201cThe level of atrocities which took place in Anambra State within a space of one week which Governor Willie Obiano mentioned during his broadcast on Tuesday was frightening.\n\n\u201cHow would IPoB declare \u2018No Biafra, no election\u2019 in Anambra State? The group is trying to fetch ant-infested firewood for itself. The frequent declaration of sit-at-home order by the group has brought economic devastation to the zone. How would you stop someone who survives through his daily handwork from going out on Mondays?\n\n\u201cHow would you kill and burn the properties of your people who refuse to comply with the order? Federal Government is not touched by this self-inflicting approach of IPoB on South East. We are only introducing hardship on ourselves. The FG doesn\u2019t care and would not care how we undo ourselves here.\n\n\u201cNow, the situation has de-genarated to broad daylight killings with guns. This is really terrible and must stop.\n\n\u201cI have always advised them that there are better ways of putting pressure on governments. Look at the Muslim Shiites, they come out and demonstrate. They continued with this approach until their leader was released. In our case, we are inflicting injury on ourselves. How do you expect Federal Government to release our son, Kanu by unleashing mayhem on the people of the South East?\n\n\u201cIf people are enjoying what Boko Haram is doing in the North East, or the activities of bandits in North West and Middle-belt, or perhaps, what armed Hausa/Fulani herdsmen are doing, then we too should begin to enjoy this kind of violence. However, if we condemn such violence in the North, why should we allow it to happen in our domain?\n\n\u201cI want the Forest Guards, Ebubeagu, Vigilante Groups to mobilize and team up with other federal security agencies in the zone to ensure that this ugly development is nipped in the bud. We don\u2019t need it in South East. Our people too should be security conscious to report suspicious movements in our surroundings to relevant security agencies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described the late Dr Akunyili as a jolly good fellow and a large-hearted Nigerian who doesn\u2019t deserve to die tragically the way he was killed.\n\nAkunyili\u2019s murder, act of wickedness \u2014 Uzodimma\n\nMeantime, Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has condemned in the strongest terms the gruesome murder of Dr. Chike Akunyili, husband of the late former Director General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Prof. Dora Akunyili, describing it as an act of wickedness in the highest order which must be condemned in all ramifications.\n\nGovernor Uzodimma not only condemned the murder of the medical doctor but harped on the need to ensure that the perpetrators are unmasked and brought to book.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cI, on behalf of the government and good people of Imo State, commiserate with the Akunyili Family, the Government and good people of Anambra State over this inhumane act.\n\n\u201cAs we pray for the repose of his soul, I believe the government at the state, region and federal would continue to improve our security architecture against these elements and ensure the perpetrators are brought to book.\n\n\u201cAs a peaceful and loving race, we are known for our hospitality and unison with the ideology of \u2018Onuru ube nwanne agbala oso.\u2019 Let\u2019s eschew violence and embrace peace to pave way for the development of our region.

Enough of this madness.\u201d\n\nStop unleashing mayhem on your people, Nwodo urges IPOB\n\nSpeaking yesterday in Nsukka, Chief Nwodo, who was also a former national chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP, told IPoB to seek better ways of engaging the Federal Government to release Nnamdi Kanu, rather than fetching ant-infested firewood which is already having devastating effects on the people of the zone.\n\nHe made the statement while condemning the gruesome murder of Dr. Chike Akunyili, by men suspected to be members of IPoB at Anambra State on Tuesday.\n\nHe also enjoined all the local security architecture in the zone to team up with federal security agencies to ensure that South East does not become another theatre of violence in Nigeria.\n\nHe said \u201cThe level of atrocities which took place in Anambra State within a space of one week which Governor Willie Obiano mentioned during his broadcast on Tuesday was frightening.\n\n\u201cHow would IPoB declare \u2018No Biafra, no election\u2019 in Anambra State? The group is trying to fetch ant-infested firewood for itself. The frequent declaration of sit-at-home order by the group has brought economic devastation to the zone. How would you stop someone who survives through his daily handwork from going out on Mondays?\n\n\u201cHow would you kill and burn the properties of your people who refuse to comply with the order? Federal Government is not touched by this self-inflicting approach of IPoB on South East. We are only introducing hardship on ourselves. The FG doesn\u2019t care and would not care how we undo ourselves here.\n\n\u201cNow, the situation has de-genarated to broad daylight killings with guns. This is really terrible and must stop.\n\n\u201cI have always advised them that there are better ways of putting pressure on governments. Look at the Muslim Shiites, they come out and demonstrate. They continued with this approach until their leader was released. In our case, we are inflicting injury on ourselves. How do you expect Federal Government to release our son, Kanu by unleashing mayhem on the people of the South East?\n\n\u201cIf people are enjoying what Boko Haram is doing in the North East, or the activities of bandits in North West and Middle-belt, or perhaps, what armed Hausa/Fulani herdsmen are doing, then we too should begin to enjoy this kind of violence. However, if we condemn such violence in the North, why should we allow it to happen in our domain?\n\n\u201cI want the Forest Guards, Ebubeagu, Vigilante Groups to mobilize and team up with other federal security agencies in the zone to ensure that this ugly development is nipped in the bud. We don\u2019t need it in South East. Our people too should be security conscious to report suspicious movements in our surroundings to relevant security agencies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described the late Dr Akunyili as a jolly good fellow and a large-hearted Nigerian who doesn\u2019t deserve to die tragically the way he was killed.\n\nAkunyili\u2019s murder, act of wickedness \u2014 Uzodimma\n\nMeantime, Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has condemned in the strongest terms the gruesome murder of Dr. Chike Akunyili, husband of the late former Director General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Prof. Dora Akunyili, describing it as an act of wickedness in the highest order which must be condemned in all ramifications.\n\nGovernor Uzodimma not only condemned the murder of the medical doctor but harped on the need to ensure that the perpetrators are unmasked and brought to book.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cI, on behalf of the government and good people of Imo State, commiserate with the Akunyili Family, the Government and good people of Anambra State over this inhumane act.\n\n\u201cAs we pray for the repose of his soul, I believe the government at the state, region and federal would continue to improve our security architecture against these elements and ensure the perpetrators are brought to book.\n\n\u201cAs a peaceful and loving race, we are known for our hospitality and unison with the ideology of \u2018Onuru ube nwanne agbala oso.\u2019 Let\u2019s eschew violence and embrace peace to pave way for the development of our region.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered a conditional lifting of ban on micro-blogging site, Twitter.\n\nBuhari who disclosed this during his broadcast on Nigeria\u2019s 61st Independence anniversary on Friday.\n\nThe President also spoke on other crucial National issues.\n\nRead his full speech\u2026\n\nINDEPENDENCE DAY ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF NIGERIA\u2019S SIXTY FIRST INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY, FRIDAY 1ST OCTOBER, 2021.\n\nCitizens of Nigeria.\n\nIt is with full gratitude to God that today, we celebrate Nigeria\u2019s sixty first Independence Anniversary.2. For 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck. East, West, North all came together to celebrate freedom. Today should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions and regions.\n\n3. Today, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation.\n\n4. Fellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period.\n\n5. Our original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising our economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant we needed to shift gears and re-strategise.\n\n6. Nigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19. It is this attitude and by the special grace of God, we continue to survive the pandemic as a nation and indeed, provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\n7. The doomsday scenario predicted for our country never came. Even as the Delta variant continues to spread, we have built the capacity we need to respond now and into the future.\n\n8. I will therefore appeal to Nigerians not to take COVID lightly, adhere to public health and social measures, put your mask on and get vaccinated. We can control this pandemic, but it requires effort on everybody\u2019s part. The investments we made in response to COVID-19 will also serve our country to tackle any future disease outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n9. Despite the global inequity in access to vaccines, the Government of Nigeria has continued to explore all available options to ensure Nigerians have free access to safe and effective vaccines.\n\n10. Some five million vaccine doses have been administered to Nigerians through efforts led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and we will continue to explore options for purchase or acquisition of vaccines such as through COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust.\n\n11. I will take this opportunity to remind the global community that the current state of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable. We cannot afford a situation where a handful of countries keep the global vaccine supply to themselves at the expense of other nations.\n\n12. We must act now to accelerate equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This is the message I conveyed to the international community in New York last week.\n\n13. As we push to source vaccines for our immediate needs, we shall invest more to support our pharmaceutical and research agencies to come up with ideas for locally developed vaccines. Should another pandemic arise in the future, Our question is simple; will Nigeria be ready?\n\n\n\n14. Accordingly, I have directed the Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Health, Education and Science and Technology to work with Nigerian and International pharmaceutical companies and research organisations to enhance Nigeria\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical capacity.\n\n\n\n15. Already, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority is raising a $200 million fund for this initiative that will complement the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing N85 billion Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme to support local researchers in the development of vaccines and drugs to combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\n\n\n\nFellow Nigerians, this is just the beginning.\n\n16. Similarly, on our approach to food security, I am proud to announce Nigeria has commenced its journey to pharmaceutical independence.\n\n17. This journey, which will take years to achieve but will ultimately result in Nigerian based companies developing the Active Pharmaceutical substances and competence needed for us to make our own drugs and vaccines.\n\n\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n\n\n18. As our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country.\n\n\n\n19. In the last four months, the gallant men and women of the Military and Security Agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing these new security challenges. We are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning.\n\n\n\n20. Earlier this year, I launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, the Deep Blue Project, which is designed to secure Nigerian waters up to the Gulf of Guinea. I am happy to inform Nigerians that we have taken delivery of key assets for this project and very soon, its impact will be felt.\n\n\n\n21. In the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.\n\n\n\n22. To support our surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel across all ranks. Furthermore, I have also approved for the Nigerian Police Force to recruit 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years.\n\n\n\n23. I am also pleased to note that most of the Air Force platforms we acquired over the past three years have started to arrive in Nigeria. These will positively impact our security operations in all parts of the country.\n\n\n\n24. In line with section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the security and welfare of Nigerians continue to be the prime focus on which programmes and projects of our government revolves.\n\n\n\n25. Therefore, as a Government, we are ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action. Our resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering.\n\n\n\n26. That said, our hope is not to fight for peace. We can always settle our grievances peacefully without spilling any blood.\n\n\n\n27. I will therefore take this opportunity, on this special day that symbolises the unity and oneness of our great nation, to ask all Nigerians to embrace peace and dialogue, whatever your grievances.\n\n\n\n28. The seeds of violence are planted in people\u2019s heads through words. Reckless utterances of a few have led to losses of many innocent lives and destruction of properties.\n\n\n\n29. Such unfiltered and unsubstantiated lies and hate speeches by a few evil persons must be stopped. Our media houses and commentators must move away from just reporting irresponsible remarks to investigating the truth behind all statements and presenting the facts to readers.\n\n\n\n30. We must all come out and speak against the lies being peddled. At this point, I would want to sincerely appreciate the large number of our Traditional, Religious and Community leaders as well as other well-meaning Nigerians who, in their various fora are openly spreading the message of peaceful co-existence and conflict settlement through dialogue in their respective communities.\n\n\n\n31. Nigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation.\n\n\n\n32. We shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n\n\n33. The recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the national assembly.\n\n\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n34. This is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains. Instead of preaching unity, they are funding and misleading our youth to conduct criminal acts that sometimes lead to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\n\n\n\n35. As the so-called leaders run abroad to hide, our innocent youths are misled and left in the streets to fight for their senseless and destructive causes.\n\n\n\n36. Government will continue, with greater level of peoples\u2019 participation and in collaboration with our international partners, to improve the security architecture, reduce enabling environment for criminality to thrive and eliminate opportunities for terrorism financing.\n\n\n\n37. Fellow Nigerians, our unrelenting effort at resolving an almost two-decade stalling on the management of our Petroleum resources and ensuring equitable consideration to our host communities has resulted in the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021.\n\n\n\n38. This Act not only overhauls the Institutional, regulatory and fiscal framework of the Petroleum Industry but also reduces the previous opacity associated with this sector.\n\n\n\n39. This is the first step to the reforms as the process is a continuous one. Already, to further improve the governance framework, I have sought for an amendment of sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b). We will also continue to review and amend as appropriate.\n\n\n\n40. At this juncture, it is very appropriate that I salute the leadership and members of the Ninth Assembly for their patriotism, dedication to duty, candour and most importantly the dispatch with which they have enacted legacy legislations for this nation. I do not take such level of cooperation for granted and hope it continues for the overall efficiency of the Federal machinery.\n\n\n\n41. Nigeria\u2019s Roadmap on Local Refining is on track with the Commissioning of a Modular refinery in Imo State.\n\n\n\n42. A second is scheduled for commissioning by the end of this year in Edo State and the third one in Bayelsa State by 2022.\n\n\n\n43. In addition to the modular projects, we also have the two mega refinery projects coming up in Lagos and Akwa Ibom States.\n\n\n\n44. As these refineries are commissioned, more employment opportunities are created and there would be increased petroleum products available for local consumption which will significantly reduce our reliance on importation.\n\n\n\n45. In further demonstrating our plan to reduce our dependence on oil and tapping from our enormous gas resources, this administration remains committed to the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d Initiative, which is aimed at bringing to focus the utilization of our huge gas resources.\n\n\n\n46. Already, we are supporting and promoting various gas-based projects including NLNG Train 7 and the mega urea and ammonia projects in the South-South region.\n\n\n\n47. As we continue to optimise and enhance our oil and gas sector, I am also proud and delighted to state that our economic diversification strategy remains on course with the persistent increase in Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP.\n\n\n\n48. We recovered from economic recession in quarter four of 2020 with a GDP growth rate of 0.11%, and grew by 0.51% and 5.01% in real terms in the first and second quarters of 2021.\n\n\n\n49. The Agricultural sector remains key to our economic diversification efforts as the sector has been a consistent driver of the non-oil sector contributing 22.35% and 23.78% to the overall GDP in the first and second quarter of 2021.\n\n\n\n50. We have seen significant private sector investments in almost all areas of the agricultural value chain. And these have continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n51. Unfortunately, as our food production capacity has increased, food prices have been going up due to artificial shortages created by middlemen who have been buying and hoarding these essential commodities for profiteering.\n\n\n\n52. To address this, I am hereby directing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to rehabilitate the National Food Reserve Agency and also work with security agencies, the Nigerian Commodity Exchange, and the National Assembly to find a lasting solution to these disruptive and unpatriotic hoarding activities.\n\n\n\n53. To further enhance food production, we have completed several new dams and are in the process of rehabilitating several River Basin Development Authorities to enhance ground water supply for rainfed agriculture as well as surface water for irrigation agriculture.\n\n\n\n54. The water projects we completed between 2015 to 2020 have improved Nigerian\u2019s access to potable water to 71% between 2015 and 2020. This means 12.5 million additional Nigerians now have direct access to potable water.\n\n\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n55. This Government remains concerned by the significant transportation infrastructure deficit we have. Addressing the challenges our commuters and lorry drivers face on the motorways is still a high priority to us.\n\n\n\n56. To complement our budgetary allocations, the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund and the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme, we recently established a N15trillion Infrastructural Corporation of Nigeria Limited (INFRACO), which is expected to begin operation by the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n\n\n57. INFRACO will also focus on leveraging resources on a public-private sector basis for infrastructural development in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n58. We hope through these innovative programs, the additional cost burden on individuals and businesses because of inefficient logistics operations will be reduced and ultimately, eliminated.\n\n\n\n59. We currently have over 13,000 kilometres of roads and bridges under construction all over the country of which a fair percentage have been completed.\n\n\n\n60. As we fix our roads, we also continue to extend and upgrade Nigeria\u2019s railway network with the notable opening of the Warri- Itakpe standard gauge rail line.\n\n\n\n61. To increase capacity, we have introduced more locomotives, coaches and wagons including the establishment of a Wagon Assembly in Kajola, Ogun State.\n\n\n\n62. The sea ports however still remain problematic. The effect of our various interventions to reduce the gridlocks and inefficiencies have been slower than expected.\n\n\n\n63. However, the implementation of the Electronic Call-Up System as well as the conversion of the Lillypond Container Terminal to a Vehicle Transit Area will further enhance the ease of cargo evacuation.\n\n\n\n64. Our prioritisation of developing Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy has positively impacted the contribution of the ICT sector to our GDP.\n\n\n\n65. We hope our present efforts to ensure all Nigerians use a National Identification Number as well as our planned roll-out of the fifth generation (5G) network technology will ensure we stay in line with the global innovation curve as a Nation.\n\n\n\n66. As we embrace the digital economy in Nigeria, we are fully aware of the prospects and the perils. Our policies have been developed to enable Nigerians to take advantage of the prospects and avoid the perils of digital technologies.\n\n\n\n67. Social media is a very useful platform that has enabled millions of Nigerians to connect with loved ones, promote their businesses, socialise, and access news and other information.\n\n\n\n68. However, recent events have shown that the platform is not just an innocuous platform for information dissemination.\n\n\n\n69. Rather some users have misused the platform to organise, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\n\n\n70. To address these negative trends, the Federal Government of Nigeria suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria on June 5, 2021 to allow the Government put measures in place to address these challenges.\n\n\n\n71. Following the suspension of Twitter operations, Twitter Inc. reached out to the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the impasse. Subsequently, I constituted a Presidential Committee to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue.\n\n\n\n72. The Committee, along with its Technical Team, has engaged with Twitter and have addressed a number of key issues. These are:\n\n\n\na. National Security and Cohesion;\n\nb. Registration, Physical presence and Representation;\n\nc. Fair Taxation;\n\nd. Dispute Resolution; and\n\ne. Local Content.\n\n\n\n73. Following the extensive engagements, the issues are being addressed and I have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements.\n\n\n\n74. As a country, we are committed to ensuring that digital companies use their platform to enhance the lives of our citizens, respect Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, cultural values and promote online safety.\n\n\n\n75. Nigeria\u2019s progressive diplomacy continues to manifest through growing numbers of highly placed Nigerians in positions of regional and global influences. Very recently, Nigeria won election for the position of Commissioner for the expanded Political, Peace and Security Affairs of the African Union.\n\n\n\n76. Our persistent calls for a reorganized and reformed ECOWAS, to make the organization citizens-sensitive, paid off with the acceptance by the Authority of Heads of State and Governments of ECOWAS to commence the agreed reforms in the organization ahead of the next elections of the organization\u2019s principal officers in December this year.\n\n\n\n77. At the African Development Bank, World Trade Organization and indeed, the United Nations, footprints of Nigeria\u2019s Diplomacy are clearly evident.\n\n\n\n78. We remain confident that our goal of lifting 100million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is achievable.\n\n\n\n79. Considering the positive impact of our Social Investment Programs, I recently approved an increase in the number of N-Power program beneficiaries from 500,000 to 1,000,000.\n\n\n\n80. Out of this, 510,000 have started the programme while the competitive selection process for onboarding the outstanding 490,000 beneficiaries is in progress.\n\n\n\n81. The National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme is currently being implemented in 35 States of the Federation and the FCT. Over 103,000 women have been engaged and empowered as cooks under the programme, while about 10 million pupils are being fed across public primary schools in the country.\n\n\n\n82. To grant increased access to credit to the most poor and vulnerable, I have directed an increase in the disbursement of Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme loans to an additional one million beneficiaries laying more emphasis on the smallholding farmers through the farmers Moni program.\n\n\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n83. For far too long we have neglected the centrality of the civil service as the engine of governance and this has manifested in ineffective service delivery.\n\n\n\n84. There is widespread discontent and disillusion about the efficiency and probity of our civil service.\n\n\n\n85. It is for this reason that we are refocusing the Nigerian Civil Service to provide World class service to run our country.\n\n\n\n86. The youths of this great country remain propellants for our today and provide guarantees that we would have a secure tomorrow.\n\n\n\n87. It is for this reason that I remain focused on expanding opportunities for their participation in politics and governance.\n\n\n\n88. Recent appointments of young people into positions of authority and their track record so far, gives me confidence that we need to bring more of them into governance and this I promise to do.\n\n\n\n89. More specifically, to encourage Girl-Child Education, female scholarship schemes, life skills and digital literacy skills to boost girl\u2019s enrolment, retention and completion of schooling, are all initiatives put in place to ensure gender balance in appropriately positioning our youths for positions of leadership.\n\n\n\n90. The commitment of this Administration to the well-being of people living with disabilities remains unwavering.\n\n\n\n91. Government recognises their contributions to development and I have, in this regard, directed that all relevant Government Agencies pay special attention to the peculiarities of different abilities in the implementation of policies and programmes.\n\n\n\n92. Rape and Gender Based Violence remains a sore point in our Nation as in many countries worldwide and this was worsened during and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n93. We are currently engaging Heads of Courts to establish Specialised Courts for the speedy and seamless trial of Rape/Gender-Based offences especially to ensure that justice is done for child victims of sexual violence.\n\n\n\n94. On the other hand, work has advanced in the reformation, reintegration and reunification of Minors involved in one crime or the other.\n\n\n\n95. The reformation in our Correctional Services has manifested in an increase in modernised custodial centres and a transformation from strictly punitive to attitudinal changes so that criminals do not relapse into their previous lifestyle.\n\n\n\n96. As we begin to celebrate our sixty one years as a Nation, we need to be conscious that Nigeria does not start and end with the Federal Government. This country is a great collective where Government at all arms and levels as well as the private sector, and more importantly individuals, have a role to play.\n\n\n\n97. In particular, security is a bottom to top undertaking. Joining hands and hearts together would enable us to secure ourselves and our country.\n\n\n\n98. I fully understand the anxiety of many Nigerians on the inability of this country to go beyond a never-ending potential for becoming a great nation to an actually great one.\n\n\n\n99. A lot has been achieved in the last six years on many fronts: in infrastructure, social care, governance, Nigeria\u2019s image and influence in Africa and the international community.\n\n\n\n100. But critics misdiagnose incremental progress as stagnation. Since coming to power, this Administration has tackled our problems head-on in spite of the meagre resources. No government since 1999 has done what we have done in six years to put Nigeria back on track.\n\n\n\n101. We shall continue to serve the country: listen to all and protect our democracy and country.\n\n\n\nThank you all and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

          "text": "The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) Thursday said troops of Operation HADIN KAI in the North-east and Operation HADARIN DAJI in the North-west killed 378 terrorists and bandits in separate military offensives in the last one month.\n\nA breakdown of the figure showed 85 insurgents were neutralised while 293 bandits were also killed.\n\nThe military also said over 90 terrorists and bandits, including their collaborators and logistics suppliers, were arrested in the course of the various operations.\n\nDirector Defence Media Operations (DMO) Brig-Gen Benard Onyeuko stated this while briefing journalists in Abuja on various military operations across the country between 2 and 30 September, 2021. He said a total of 121 assorted weapons including SMG, HK21 guns, AK-47 and locally-made rifles with magazines, 3,372 rounds of 7.62mm NATO/Special ammunition, locally made pistols and smooth body grenades, RPG-7 bombs as well as 12,250 bags of fertilisers and 178 rustled livestock among several other items were recovered from the terrorists.\n\nAccording to him, a total of 2,783 terrorists and their families surrendered to troops within the period under review.\n\nHe said: \u201cTroops had several encounters with terrorists at different locations.

          "text": "The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) , on Thursday, denied the trending report that the air bombardment of the air component of Operations Hadin Kai on terrorist location killed 20 fishermen in Borno State.\n\nIt noted that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed.\n\nActing Director Defence Media Operations, Brigadier General Benard Onyeuko who made this denial in a statement also explained that the military bombed the location after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to media reports making rounds in social media alleging that; the \u201cAir Component of Operation HADIN KAI on Sunday 26 September 2021, killed 20 Fishermen in air strikes at Kwatan Daban Masara general area in the fringes of the Lake Tchad. It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday recounted how the nation has fared so far, explaining that the last 18 months have been some of the \u201cmost difficult periods in the history of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nIn his Independence Day anniversary broadcast to the nation, the President noted that since the civil war, the country has not seen a period of more heightened challenges than what has been witnessed in the months under review.\n\nHe said, \u201cFellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Zamfara Governor Directs Restoration Of Telecom Services In Gusau\n\nAccording to President Buhari, his government\u2019s original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising the economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges.\n\nHe, however, stated that the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant that his government \u201cneeded to shift gears and re-strategise\u201d.\n\nThe President while speaking on the impact of the pandemic, said Nigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19, adding that their attitude and the special grace of God kept the nation and allowed it to provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\nThe Commander-In-Chief asserted that for 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck, adding that Independence Day should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions, and regions.\n\nAccording to him, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of October 1st despite the challenges the country faces at the moment, and this is a positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation.\n\nAccording to him, it is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation.\n\nPresident Buhari further stated that a lot has been achieved in the last six years on many fronts: \u201cin infrastructure, social care, governance, Nigeria\u2019s image and influence in Africa and the international community.\u201d\n\nThe President reiterated that no government since 1999 has done what his administration has done in six years to put Nigeria back on track, he assured that his government will continue to serve the country; listening to all and protecting her democracy and unity.\n\nRead the full speech of the President below:\n\nINDEPENDENCE DAY ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF NIGERIA\u2019S SIXTY-FIRST INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY, FRIDAY 1ST OCTOBER, 2021.\n\nCitizens of Nigeria.\n\nIt is with full gratitude to God that today, we celebrate Nigeria\u2019s sixty-first Independence Anniversary.\n\n2. For 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck. East, West, North all came together to celebrate freedom. Today should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions, and regions.\n\n3. Today, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation.\n\n4. Fellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period.\n\n5. Our original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising our economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant we needed to shift gears and re-strategise.\n\n6. Nigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19. It is this attitude and by the special grace of God, we continue to survive the pandemic as a nation and indeed, provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\n7. The doomsday scenario predicted for our country never came. Even as the Delta variant continues to spread, we have built the capacity we need to respond now and into the future.\n\n8. I will therefore appeal to Nigerians not to take COVID lightly, adhere to public health and social measures, put your mask on and get vaccinated. We can control this pandemic, but it requires effort on everybody\u2019s part. The investments we made in response to COVID-19 will also serve our country to tackle any future disease outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n9. Despite the global inequity in access to vaccines, the Government of Nigeria has continued to explore all available options to ensure Nigerians have free access to safe and effective vaccines.\n\n10. Some five million vaccine doses have been administered to Nigerians through efforts led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and we will continue to explore options for purchase or acquisition of vaccines such as through COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust.\n\n11. I will take this opportunity to remind the global community that the current state of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable. We cannot afford a situation where a handful of countries keep the global vaccine supply to themselves at the expense of other nations.\n\n12. We must act now to accelerate equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This is the message I conveyed to the international community in New York last week.\n\n13. As we push to source vaccines for our immediate needs, we shall invest more to support our pharmaceutical and research agencies to come up with ideas for locally developed vaccines. Should another pandemic arise in the future, Our question is simple; will Nigeria be ready?\n\n14. Accordingly, I have directed the Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Health, Education, and Science and Technology to work with Nigerian and International pharmaceutical companies and research organisations to enhance Nigeria\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical capacity.\n\n15. Already, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority is raising a $200 million fund for this initiative that will complement the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing N85 billion Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme to support local researchers in the development of vaccines and drugs to combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\n\nFellow Nigerians, this is just the beginning.\n\n16. Similarly, on our approach to food security, I am proud to announce Nigeria has commenced its journey to pharmaceutical independence.\n\n17. This journey, which will take years to achieve but will ultimately result in Nigerian-based companies developing the Active Pharmaceutical substances and competence needed for us to make our own drugs and vaccines.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n18. As our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country.\n\n19. In the last four months, the gallant men and women of the Military and Security Agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing these new security challenges. We are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning.\n\n20. Earlier this year, I launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, the Deep Blue Project, which is designed to secure Nigerian waters up to the Gulf of Guinea. I am happy to inform Nigerians that we have taken delivery of key assets for this project and very soon, its impact will be felt.\n\n21. In the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.\n\n22. To support our surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel across all ranks. Furthermore, I have also approved for the Nigerian Police Force to recruit 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years.\n\n23. I am also pleased to note that most of the Air Force platforms we acquired over the past three years have started to arrive in Nigeria. These will positively impact our security operations in all parts of the country.\n\n24. In line with section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the security and welfare of Nigerians continue to be the prime focus on which programmes and projects of our government revolves.\n\n25. Therefore, as a Government, we are ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action. Our resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering.\n\n26. That said, our hope is not to fight for peace. We can always settle our grievances peacefully without spilling any blood.\n\n27. I will therefore take this opportunity, on this special day that symbolises the unity and oneness of our great nation, to ask all Nigerians to embrace peace and dialogue, whatever your grievances.\n\n28. The seeds of violence are planted in people\u2019s heads through words. Reckless utterances of a few have led to losses of many innocent lives and destruction of properties.\n\n29. Such unfiltered and unsubstantiated lies and hate speeches by a few evil persons must be stopped. Our media houses and commentators must move away from just reporting irresponsible remarks to investigating the truth behind all statements and presenting the facts to readers.\n\n30. We must all come out and speak against the lies being peddled. At this point, I would want to sincerely appreciate the large number of our Traditional, Religious and Community leaders as well as other well-meaning Nigerians who, in their various fora are openly spreading the message of peaceful co-existence and conflict settlement through dialogue in their respective communities.\n\n31. Nigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation.\n\n32. We shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n33. The recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the national assembly.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n34. This is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains. Instead of preaching unity, they are funding and misleading our youth to conduct criminal acts that sometimes lead to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\n\n35. As the so-called leaders run abroad to hide, our innocent youths are misled and left in the streets to fight for their senseless and destructive causes.\n\n36. Government will continue, with greater level of peoples\u2019 participation and in collaboration with our international partners, to improve the security architecture, reduce enabling environment for criminality to thrive and eliminate opportunities for terrorism financing.\n\n37. Fellow Nigerians, our unrelenting effort at resolving an almost two-decade stalling on the management of our Petroleum resources and ensuring equitable consideration to our host communities has resulted in the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021.\n\n38. This Act not only overhauls the Institutional, regulatory and fiscal framework of the Petroleum Industry but also reduces the previous opacity associated with this sector.\n\n39. This is the first step to the reforms as the process is a continuous one. Already, to further improve the governance framework, I have sought for an amendment of sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b). We will also continue to review and amend as appropriate.\n\n40. At this juncture, it is very appropriate that I salute the leadership and members of the Ninth Assembly for their patriotism, dedication to duty, candour and most importantly the dispatch with which they have enacted legacy legislations for this nation. I do not take such level of cooperation for granted and hope it continues for the overall efficiency of the Federal machinery.\n\n41. Nigeria\u2019s Roadmap on Local Refining is on track with the Commissioning of a Modular refinery in Imo State.\n\n42. A second is scheduled for commissioning by the end of this year in Edo State and the third one in Bayelsa State by 2022.\n\n43. In addition to the modular projects, we also have the two mega refinery projects coming up in Lagos and Akwa Ibom States.\n\n44. As these refineries are commissioned, more employment opportunities are created and there would be increased petroleum products available for local consumption which will significantly reduce our reliance on importation.\n\n45. In further demonstrating our plan to reduce our dependence on oil and tapping from our enormous gas resources, this administration remains committed to the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d Initiative, which is aimed at bringing to focus the utilization of our huge gas resources.\n\n46. Already, we are supporting and promoting various gas-based projects including NLNG Train 7 and the mega urea and ammonia projects in the South-South region.\n\n47. As we continue to optimise and enhance our oil and gas sector, I am also proud and delighted to state that our economic diversification strategy remains on course with the persistent increase in Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP.\n\n48. We recovered from economic recession in quarter four of 2020 with a GDP growth rate of 0.11%, and grew by 0.51% and 5.01% in real terms in the first and second quarters of 2021.\n\n49. The Agricultural sector remains key to our economic diversification efforts as the sector has been a consistent driver of the non-oil sector contributing 22.35% and 23.78% to the overall GDP in the first and second quarter of 2021.\n\n50. We have seen significant private sector investments in almost all areas of the agricultural value chain. And these have continued even during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n51. Unfortunately, as our food production capacity has increased, food prices have been going up due to artificial shortages created by middlemen who have been buying and hoarding these essential commodities for profiteering.\n\n52. To address this, I am hereby directing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to rehabilitate the National Food Reserve Agency and also work with security agencies, the Nigerian Commodity Exchange, and the National Assembly to find a lasting solution to these disruptive and unpatriotic hoarding activities.\n\n53. To further enhance food production, we have completed several new dams and are in the process of rehabilitating several River Basin Development Authorities to enhance groundwater supply for rainfed agriculture as well as surface water for irrigation agriculture.\n\n54. The water projects we completed between 2015 to 2020 have improved Nigerian\u2019s access to potable water to 71%, between 2015 and 2020. This means 12.5 million additional Nigerians now have direct access to potable water.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n55. This Government remains concerned by the significant transportation infrastructure deficit we have. Addressing the challenges our commuters and lorry drivers face on the motorways is still a high priority to us.\n\n56. To complement our budgetary allocations, the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund and the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme, we recently established a N15 trillion Infrastructural Corporation of Nigeria Limited (INFRACO), which is expected to begin operation by the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n57. INFRACO will also focus on leveraging resources on a public-private sector basis for infrastructural development in Nigeria.\n\n58. We hope through these innovative programs, the additional cost burden on individuals and businesses because of inefficient logistics operations will be reduced and ultimately, eliminated.\n\n59. We currently have over 13,000 kilometres of roads and bridges under construction all over the country of which a fair percentage have been completed.\n\n60. As we fix our roads, we also continue to extend and upgrade Nigeria\u2019s railway network with the notable opening of the Warri- Itakpe standard gauge rail line.\n\n61. To increase capacity, we have introduced more locomotives, coaches, and wagons including the establishment of a Wagon Assembly in Kajola, Ogun State.\n\n62. The seaports however still remain problematic. The effect of our various interventions to reduce the gridlocks and inefficiencies has been slower than expected.\n\n63. However, the implementation of the Electronic Call-Up System, as well as the conversion of the Lilypond Container Terminal to a Vehicle Transit Area, will further enhance the ease of cargo evacuation.\n\n64. Our prioritisation of developing Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy has positively impacted the contribution of the ICT sector to our GDP.\n\n65. We hope our present efforts to ensure all Nigerians use a National Identification Number, as well as our planned roll-out of the fifth generation (5G) network technology, will ensure we stay in line with the global innovation curve as a Nation.\n\n66. As we embrace the digital economy in Nigeria, we are fully aware of the prospects and the perils. Our policies have been developed to enable Nigerians to take advantage of the prospects and avoid the perils of digital technologies.\n\n67. Social media is a very useful platform that has enabled millions of Nigerians to connect with loved ones, promote their businesses, socialise, and access news and other information.\n\n68. However, recent events have shown that the platform is not just an innocuous platform for information dissemination.\n\n69. Rather some users have misused the platform to organise, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\n70. To address these negative trends, the Federal Government of Nigeria suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria on June 5, 2021 to allow the Government put measures in place to address these challenges.\n\n71. Following the suspension of Twitter operations, Twitter Inc. reached out to the Federal Government of Nigeria to resolve the impasse. Subsequently, I constituted a Presidential Committee to engage Twitter to explore the possibility of resolving the issue.\n\n72. The Committee, along with its Technical Team, has engaged with Twitter and have addressed a number of key issues. These are:\n\na. National Security and Cohesion;\n\nb. Registration, Physical presence and Representation;\n\nc. Fair Taxation;\n\nd. Dispute Resolution; and\n\ne. Local Content.\n\n73. Following the extensive engagements, the issues are being addressed and I have directed that the suspension be lifted but only if the conditions are met to allow our citizens continue the use of the platform for business and positive engagements.\n\n74. As a country, we are committed to ensuring that digital companies use their platform to enhance the lives of our citizens, respect Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, cultural values and promote online safety.\n\n75. Nigeria\u2019s progressive diplomacy continues to manifest through growing numbers of highly placed Nigerians in positions of regional and global influences. Very recently, Nigeria won election for the position of Commissioner for the expanded Political, Peace and Security Affairs of the African Union.\n\n76. Our persistent calls for a reorganized and reformed ECOWAS, to make the organization citizens-sensitive, paid off with the acceptance by the Authority of Heads of State and Governments of ECOWAS to commence the agreed reforms in the organization ahead of the next elections of the organization\u2019s principal officers in December this year.\n\n77. At the African Development Bank, World Trade Organization and indeed, the United Nations, footprints of Nigeria\u2019s Diplomacy are clearly evident.\n\n78. We remain confident that our goal of lifting 100million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is achievable.\n\n79. Considering the positive impact of our Social Investment Programs, I recently approved an increase in the number of N-Power program beneficiaries from 500,000 to 1,000,000.\n\n80. Out of this, 510,000 have started the programme while the competitive selection process for onboarding the outstanding 490,000 beneficiaries is in progress.\n\n81. The National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme is currently being implemented in 35 States of the Federation and the FCT. Over 103,000 women have been engaged and empowered as cooks under the programme, while about 10 million pupils are being fed across public primary schools in the country.\n\n82. To grant increased access to credit to the poorest and vulnerable, I have directed an increase in the disbursement of Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme loans to an additional one million beneficiaries laying more emphasis on the smallholding farmers through the farmers Moni program.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n83. For far too long we have neglected the centrality of the civil service as the engine of governance and this has manifested in ineffective service delivery.\n\n84. There is widespread discontent and disillusion about the efficiency and probity of our civil service.\n\n85. It is for this reason that we are refocusing the Nigerian Civil Service to provide World-class service to run our country.\n\n86. The youths of this great country remain propellants for our today and provide guarantees that we would have a secure tomorrow.\n\n87. It is for this reason that I remain focused on expanding opportunities for their participation in politics and governance.\n\n88. Recent appointments of young people into positions of authority and their track record so far, give me confidence that we need to bring more of them into governance and this I promise to do.\n\n89. More specifically, to encourage Girl-Child Education, female scholarship schemes, life skills, and digital literacy skills to boost girl\u2019s enrolment, retention, and completion of schooling, are all initiatives put in place to ensure gender balance in appropriately positioning our youths for positions of leadership.\n\n90. The commitment of this Administration to the well-being of people living with disabilities remains unwavering.\n\n91. Government recognises their contributions to development and I have, in this regard, directed that all relevant Government Agencies pay special attention to the peculiarities of different abilities in the implementation of policies and programmes.\n\n92. Rape and Gender-Based Violence remains a sore point in our Nation as in many countries worldwide and this was worsened during and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n93. We are currently engaging Heads of Courts to establish Specialised Courts for the speedy and seamless trial of Rape/Gender-Based offences especially to ensure that justice is done for child victims of sexual violence.\n\n94. On the other hand, work has advanced in the reformation, reintegration, and reunification of minors involved in one crime or the other.\n\n95. The reformation in our Correctional Services has manifested in an increase in modernised custodial centres and a transformation from strictly punitive to attitudinal changes so that criminals do not relapse into their previous lifestyle.\n\n96. As we begin to celebrate our sixty-one years as a Nation, we need to be conscious that Nigeria does not start and end with the Federal Government. This country is a great collective where Government at all arms and levels as well as the private sector, and more importantly individuals, have a role to play.\n\n97. In particular, security is a bottom-to-top undertaking. Joining hands and hearts together would enable us to secure ourselves and our country.\n\n98. I fully understand the anxiety of many Nigerians on the inability of this country to go beyond a never-ending potential for becoming a great nation to an actually great one.\n\n99. A lot has been achieved in the last six years on many fronts: in infrastructure, social care, governance, Nigeria\u2019s image, and influence in Africa and the international community.\n\n100. But critics misdiagnose incremental progress as stagnation. Since coming to power, this Administration has tackled our problems head-on in spite of the meagre resources. No government since 1999 has done what we have done in six years to put Nigeria back on track.\n\n101. We shall continue to serve the country: listen to all and protect our democracy and country.\n\nThank you all and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

          "text": "INDEPENDENCE DAY ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE OCCASION OF NIGERIA\u2019S SIXTY-FIRST INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY, FRIDAY 1ST OCTOBER, 2021.\n\nCitizens of Nigeria.\n\nIt is with full gratitude to God that today, we celebrate Nigeria\u2019s sixty-first Independence Anniversary.\n\n2. For 1st of October 1960 to happen, all hands were on deck. East, West, North all came together to celebrate freedom. Today should not only serve as a reminder of the day the British handed over the reins of power to Nigerians, but also unified Nigerians from all ethnic groups, religions, and regions.\n\n3. Today, despite the challenges we face, most Nigerians still maintain the spirit of 1st October. That positive outlook and determination to make Nigeria a peaceful and prosperous nation. It is due to this collective attitude that Nigeria doggedly continues to remain a united and indivisible nation.\n\n4. Fellow Nigerians, the past eighteen months have been some of the most difficult periods in the history of Nigeria. Since the civil war, I doubt whether we have seen a period of more heightened challenges than what we have witnessed in this period.\n\n5. Our original priorities for 2020 were to continue stabilising our economy following the deep recession while restoring peace in areas confronted with security challenges. But the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impact on all nations meant we needed to shift gears and re-strategise.\n\n6. Nigerians came together as one to fight against COVID-19. It is this attitude and by the special grace of God, we continue to survive the pandemic as a nation and indeed, provide leadership and example at regional and international levels.\n\n7. The doomsday scenario predicted for our country never came. Even as the Delta variant continues to spread, we have built the capacity we need to respond now and into the future.\n\n8. I will therefore appeal to Nigerians not to take COVID lightly, adhere to public health and social measures, put your mask on and get vaccinated. We can control this pandemic, but it requires effort on everybody\u2019s part. The investments we made in response to COVID-19 will also serve our country to tackle any future disease outbreaks or pandemics.\n\n9. Despite the global inequity in access to vaccines, the Government of Nigeria has continued to explore all available options to ensure Nigerians have free access to safe and effective vaccines.\n\n10. Some five million vaccine doses have been administered to Nigerians through efforts led by the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and we will continue to explore options for purchase or acquisition of vaccines such as through COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust.\n\n11. I will take this opportunity to remind the global community that the current state of access to COVID-19 vaccines is unacceptable. We cannot afford a situation where a handful of countries keep the global vaccine supply to themselves at the expense of other nations.\n\n12. We must act now to accelerate equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. This is the message I conveyed to the international community in New York last week.\n\n13. As we push to source vaccines for our immediate needs, we shall invest more to support our pharmaceutical and research agencies to come up with ideas for locally developed vaccines. Should another pandemic arise in the future, Our question is simple; will Nigeria be ready?\n\n14. Accordingly, I have directed the Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Health, Education, and Science and Technology to work with Nigerian and International pharmaceutical companies and research organisations to enhance Nigeria\u2019s domestic pharmaceutical capacity.\n\n15. Already, the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority is raising a $200 million fund for this initiative that will complement the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing N85 billion Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme to support local researchers in the development of vaccines and drugs to combat communicable and non-communicable diseases, including COVID-19.\n\nFellow Nigerians, this is just the beginning.\n\n16. Similarly, on our approach to food security, I am proud to announce Nigeria has commenced its journey to pharmaceutical independence.\n\n17. This journey, which will take years to achieve but will ultimately result in Nigerian based companies developing the Active Pharmaceutical substances and competence needed for us to make our own drugs and vaccines.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n18. As our economy continues to open after the COVID-19 related lockdowns, we have also seen the resurgence of insecurity in certain parts of the country.\n\n19. In the last four months, the gallant men and women of the Military and Security Agencies have made tremendous progress in addressing these new security challenges. We are taking the fight to our enemies from all angles and we are winning.\n\n20. Earlier this year, I launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, the Deep Blue Project, which is designed to secure Nigerian waters up to the Gulf of Guinea. I am happy to inform Nigerians that we have taken delivery of key assets for this project and very soon, its impact will be felt.\n\n21. In the North East region alone, over eight thousand Boko Haram terrorists have surrendered.\n\n22. To support our surge approach to fighting banditry, the Nigerian Armed Forces have recruited over 17,000 personnel across all ranks. Furthermore, I have also approved for the Nigerian Police Force to recruit 10,000 police officers annually over the next six years.\n\n23. I am also pleased to note that most of the Air Force platforms we acquired over the past three years have started to arrive in Nigeria. These will positively impact our security operations in all parts of the country.\n\n24. In line with section 14(2)(b) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the security and welfare of Nigerians continue to be the prime focus on which programmes and projects of our government revolves.\n\n25. Therefore, as a Government, we are ready to arrest and prosecute all persons inciting violence through words or action. Our resolve for a peaceful, united and one Nigeria remains resolute and unwavering.\n\n26. That said, our hope is not to fight for peace. We can always settle our grievances peacefully without spilling any blood.\n\n27. I will therefore take this opportunity, on this special day that symbolises the unity and oneness of our great nation, to ask all Nigerians to embrace peace and dialogue, whatever your grievances.\n\n28. The seeds of violence are planted in people\u2019s heads through words. Reckless utterances of a few have led to losses of many innocent lives and destruction of properties.\n\n29. Such unfiltered and unsubstantiated lies and hate speeches by a few evil persons must be stopped. Our media houses and commentators must move away from just reporting irresponsible remarks to investigating the truth behind all statements and presenting the facts to readers.\n\n30. We must all come out and speak against the lies being peddled. At this point, I would want to sincerely appreciate the large number of our Traditional, Religious and Community leaders as well as other well-meaning Nigerians who, in their various fora are openly spreading the message of peaceful co-existence and conflict settlement through dialogue in their respective communities.\n\n31. Nigeria is for all of us. Its unity is not negotiable. And its ultimate success can only be achieved if we all come together with a common goal of having peace and prosperity for our nation.\n\n32. We shall continue to work on dialogue based solutions to address legitimate grievances. But we remain ready to take decisive actions against secessionist agitators and their sponsors who threaten our national security.\n\n33. The recent arrests of Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Adeyemo, and the ongoing investigations being conducted have revealed certain high-profile financiers behind these individuals. We are vigorously pursuing these financiers including one identified as a serving member of the national assembly.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n34. This is a clear example of how people abandon their national leadership positions for their selfish gains. Instead of preaching unity, they are funding and misleading our youth to conduct criminal acts that sometimes lead to unfortunate and unnecessary loss of lives and property.\n\n35. As the so-called leaders run abroad to hide, our innocent youths are misled and left in the streets to fight for their senseless and destructive causes.\n\n36. Government will continue, with greater level of peoples\u2019 participation and in collaboration with our international partners, to improve the security architecture, reduce enabling environment for criminality to thrive and eliminate opportunities for terrorism financing.\n\n37. Fellow Nigerians, our unrelenting effort at resolving an almost two-decade stalling on the management of our Petroleum resources and ensuring equitable consideration to our host communities has resulted in the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021.\n\n38. This Act not only overhauls the Institutional, regulatory and fiscal framework of the Petroleum Industry but also reduces the previous opacity associated with this sector.\n\n39. This is the first step to the reforms as the process is a continuous one. Already, to further improve the governance framework, I have sought for an amendment of sections 11(2)(b) and 34(2)(b). We will also continue to review and amend as appropriate.\n\n40. At this juncture, it is very appropriate that I salute the leadership and members of the Ninth Assembly for their patriotism, dedication to duty, candour and most importantly the dispatch with which they have enacted legacy legislations for this nation. I do not take such level of cooperation for granted and hope it continues for the overall efficiency of the Federal machinery.\n\n41. Nigeria\u2019s Roadmap on Local Refining is on track with the Commissioning of a Modular refinery in Imo State.\n\n42. A second is scheduled for commissioning by the end of this year in Edo State and the third one in Bayelsa State by 2022.\n\n43. In addition to the modular projects, we also have the two mega refinery projects coming up in Lagos and Akwa Ibom States.\n\n44. As these refineries are commissioned, more employment opportunities are created and there would be increased petroleum products available for local consumption which will significantly reduce our reliance on importation.\n\n45. In further demonstrating our plan to reduce our dependence on oil and tapping from our enormous gas resources, this administration remains committed to the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d Initiative, which is aimed at bringing to focus the utilization of our huge gas resources.\n\n46. Already, we are supporting and promoting various gas-based projects including NLNG Train 7 and the mega urea and ammonia projects in the South-South region.\n\n47. As we continue to optimise and enhance our oil and gas sector, I am also proud and delighted to state that our economic diversification strategy remains on course with the persistent increase in Non-Oil Sector contribution to GDP.\n\n48. We recovered from economic recession in quarter four of 2020 with a GDP growth rate of 0.11%, and grew by 0.51% and 5.01% in real terms in the first and second quarters of 2021.\n\n49.

To address this, I am hereby directing the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to rehabilitate the National Food Reserve Agency and also work with security agencies, the Nigerian Commodity Exchange, and the National Assembly to find a lasting solution to these disruptive and unpatriotic hoarding activities.\n\n53. To further enhance food production, we have completed several new dams and are in the process of rehabilitating several River Basin Development Authorities to enhance groundwater supply for rainfed agriculture as well as surface water for irrigation agriculture.\n\n54. The water projects we completed between 2015 to 2020 have improved Nigerian\u2019s access to potable water to 71% between 2015 and 2020. This means 12.5 million additional Nigerians now have direct access to potable water.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n55. This Government remains concerned by the significant transportation infrastructure deficit we have. Addressing the challenges our commuters and lorry drivers face on the motorways is still a high priority to us.\n\n56. To complement our budgetary allocations, the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund and the Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme, we recently established a N15trillion Infrastructural Corporation of Nigeria Limited (INFRACO), which is expected to begin operation by the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n57. INFRACO will also focus on leveraging resources on a public-private sector basis for infrastructural development in Nigeria.\n\n58. We hope through these innovative programs, the additional cost burden on individuals and businesses because of inefficient logistics operations will be reduced and ultimately, eliminated.\n\n59. We currently have over 13,000 kilometres of roads and bridges under construction all over the country of which a fair percentage have been completed.\n\n60. As we fix our roads, we also continue to extend and upgrade Nigeria\u2019s railway network with the notable opening of the Warri- Itakpe standard gauge rail line.\n\n61. To increase capacity, we have introduced more locomotives, coaches and wagons including the establishment of a Wagon Assembly in Kajola, Ogun State.\n\n62. The sea ports however still remain problematic. The effect of our various interventions to reduce the gridlocks and inefficiencies have been slower than expected.\n\n63. However, the implementation of the Electronic Call-Up System as well as the conversion of the Lillypond Container Terminal to a Vehicle Transit Area will further enhance the ease of cargo evacuation.\n\n64. Our prioritisation of developing Nigeria\u2019s Digital Economy has positively impacted the contribution of the ICT sector to our GDP.\n\n65.

At the African Development Bank, World Trade Organization and indeed, the United Nations, footprints of Nigeria\u2019s Diplomacy are clearly evident.\n\n78. We remain confident that our goal of lifting 100million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years is achievable.\n\n79.

The National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme is currently being implemented in 35 States of the Federation and the FCT. Over 103,000 women have been engaged and empowered as cooks under the programme, while about 10 million pupils are being fed across public primary schools in the country.\n\n82. To grant increased access to credit to the most poor and vulnerable, I have directed an increase in the disbursement of Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme loans to an additional one million beneficiaries laying more emphasis on the smallholding farmers through the farmers Moni program.\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\n83. For far too long we have neglected the centrality of the civil service as the engine of governance and this has manifested in ineffective service delivery.\n\n84.

In particular, security is a bottom-to-top undertaking. Joining hands and hearts together would enable us to secure ourselves and our country.\n\n98. I fully understand the anxiety of many Nigerians on the inability of this country to go beyond a never-ending potential for becoming a great nation to an actually great one.\n\n99. A lot has been achieved in the last six years on many fronts: in infrastructure, social care, governance, Nigeria\u2019s image and influence in Africa and the international community.\n\n100. But critics misdiagnose incremental progress as stagnation. Since coming to power, this Administration has tackled our problems head-on in spite of the meagre resources. No government since 1999 has done what we have done in six years to put Nigeria back on track.\n\n101. We shall continue to serve the country: listen to all and protect our democracy and country.\n\nThank you all and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

Many attributed the action to the decision of Twitter to delete a tweet by the President, but the Federal Government insisted that the move had nothing to do with that and was in the interest of the nation.\n\nIn the President\u2019s Independence anniversary speech, he explained the decision, insisting that although social media had many benefits, there were dangers that the government had to address.\n\n\u201cSocial media is a very useful platform that has enabled millions of Nigerians to connect with loved ones, promote their businesses, socialise, and access news and other information,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHowever, recent events have shown that the platform is not just an innocuous platform for information dissemination.\n\n\u201cRather some users have misused the platform to organise, coordinate, and execute criminal activities, propagate fake news, and promote ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\n\u201cTo address these negative trends, the Federal Government of Nigeria suspended the operations of Twitter in Nigeria on June 5, 2021, to allow the Government put measures in place to address these challenges.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: President Buhari\u2019s Full 61st Independence Anniversary Speech\n\nAfter the suspension, a Technical Team set up by the Nigerian government commenced talks with Twitter and, in August, the Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed said that progress had been made in the talks and the suspension will soon be lifted, but that has yet to happen.\n\nPresident Buhari explained on Friday that the engagement between Nigeria and Twitter was to address \u201ckey issues\u201d related to national security and cohesion, registration, physical presence and representation (of Twitter in the country), fair taxation, dispute resolution, and local content.\n\n\u201cAs a country, we are committed to ensuring that digital companies use their platform to enhance the lives of our citizens, respect Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, cultural values and promote online safety,\u201d he said of his directive that the suspension should be lifted but only if conditions are met.\n\nWatch the President\u2019s full speech below:\n\n",

          "text": "SPEECH BY HIS EXCELLENCY, PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI DELIVERED AT THE CLOSING EDITION OF NIGERIA@60 ACTIVITIES HELD AT THE BANQUET HALL, PRESIDENTIAL VILLA, ASO ROCK, ABUJA ON THURSDAY, 30TH SEPTEMBER, 2021\n\nProtocols\n\nI am very delighted to be addressing you today as we conclude the activities marking our sixtieth anniversary celebration as a Nation. Looking at the activities lined up for today\u2019s event gives me a great deal of comfort that no matter the challenges we face as we go through the Nation building process, we would always come out better.\n\n2. Nigeria is undoubtedly a blessed nation with abundant human and natural resources underpinned by a very rich socio \u2013 cultural diversity which needs to be positively harnessed to forge a greater Nigeria.\n\n3. For this diversity to translate into positive gains that would ensure an inclusive, equitable and sustainable growth requires that we Nigerians consistently embrace the ethics and values that unite us in spite of our diversity, appreciate our individual and collective role in nation \u2013 building and forging ahead as a people with a common vision as a strong and indivisible nation.\n\n4. For me, this is the key message of today\u2019s activities. Today\u2019s event is anchored on the importance of our discovering our great Nation TOGETHER and not discovering it in our individual spaces as we are wont to do. I am sure some of us have gone through the various stands at this venue and as we went through the Discover Nigeria pavilion, we must have been struck with not only the beauty but also the intensity of the common strands running through our culture.\n\n5. As we all march towards building the Nigeria of our dreams, Government will continue to provide the enabling environment for citizens to achieve their dreams while we count on their support to make Nigeria a better place for all.\n\n6. We must all come together to propagate a new and positive narrative that Nigeria is ready to harness her own resources to become a global player in commerce, governance, arts, sports and other fields of endeavour.\n\n7. Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to emphasize that, for the attainment of any sustainable development, unity is important. Let us unite as a nation and be irrevocably committed to one indivisible Nigeria.\n\n8. I am, therefore, very excited to be unveiling the book \u201cDiscover Nigeria\u201d because it broadly makes the case why we should always be positive about our country.\n\n9. As I look round this hall and marvel at the scenery, I feel the more challenged to keep my word in my 2021 Democracy Day speech \u201cMy commitment to bequeathing a sustainable democratic culture remains resolute, my pursuit of a fair society remains unshaken and my desire to see that Nigeria remains a country for each and every one of us has never been stronger\u201d\n\n10. I will like to also congratulate the Inter-Ministerial Committee of Nigeria at 60 that have put all these wonderful displays together.\n\n11. Finally, I wish to congratulate all the awardees of today\u2019s event and to encourage Nigerians to work hard in our respective callings to make sure that we bequeath a better country for those coming after us.\n\n12. This award is unique, not only to the recipients but to the Nation as it marks a significant epoch in our Nation\u2019s history, just like the Centenary awards. Being different from the Nigerian National Merit Award, it has given us another opportunity to encourage Nigerians that individual achievements would always be rewarded.\n\n13. As we close the sixtieth anniversary celebrations today and look forward to the beginning of a better, brighter and greater Nigeria come tomorrow, when we begin our sixty first year as a Nation, it is my hope that our march to unity and greatness gathers momentum.\n\n14. Thank you and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

          "title": "Australian Border to Reopen for First Time in Pandemic",
          "text": "Australia will reopen its international border from November, giving long-awaited freedoms to vaccinated citizens and their relatives.\n\nSince March 2020, Australia has had some of the world\u2019s strictest border rules \u2013 even banning its own people from leaving the country.\n\nThe policy has been praised for helping to suppress Covid, but it has also controversially separated families.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to give Australians their lives back,\u201d PM Scott Morrison said.\n\nPeople would be eligible to travel when their state\u2019s vaccination rate hit 80%, he told a press briefing on Friday.\n\nTravel would not immediately be open to foreigners, but the government said it was working \u201ctowards welcoming tourists back to our shores\u201d.\n\nAt present, people can leave Australia only for exceptional reasons such as essential work or visiting a dying relative.\n\nEntry is permitted for citizens and others with exemptions, but there are tight caps on arrival numbers. This has left tens of thousands stranded overseas.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Morrison said Australia\u2019s mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine \u2013 which costs each traveller A$3,000 (\u00a31,600; $2,100) \u2013 would be phased out.\n\nIt will be replaced by seven days of home quarantine for vaccinated travellers. When unvaccinated travellers are later given permission to enter, they must do 14 days.\n\nDemand for flights is expected to be high and airlines have already warned of delays in resuming services.\n\nSydney, Melbourne and Canberra are currently in lockdown due to outbreaks of the virus.\n\nThat has helped prompt a surge in the vaccine uptake in recent months.\n\nNew South Wales \u2013 which includes Sydney \u2013 is on track to be first state to cross the 80% threshold, in a few weeks. Victoria \u2013 containing Melbourne \u2013 is not far behind.\n\nBut states such as Queensland and Western Australia have threatened to keep their borders closed until vaccine rates are even higher.\n\nThese states have managed to maintain Covid rates at or near zero, after shutting their borders to states with infections.\n\nThis is a hugely anticipated announcement for thousands of Australians both here and overseas. No doubt it\u2019s an emotional moment for many, after nearly two years of isolation.\n\nAustralia\u2019s strict border policy has been credited for its success especially early in the pandemic, but the Delta variant has changed everything.\n\nWestern Australia and Queensland are still going for an elimination policy, meaning they have been quickest to close their borders to other parts of Australia.\n\nIt\u2019s a very different picture in NSW, the most populous state, where the policy has changed from elimination to vaccination.\n\nAll of that is going to make the practicalities of reopening international borders quite tricky.\n\nAirlines have already said they\u2019re not ready for the ramping up of services this reopening will require. And with so many details still vague in terms of restrictions and proof of vaccination, this could be a potential headache for border authorities too.\n\nNSW or Victoria may allow their fully vaccinated residents to travel abroad and come back to home quarantine but Western Australia, for example, will most likely be reticent to do that and take on increased risk.\n\nSo you could have a scenario where it could be easier for people in some states to travel to London for a vacation than it is to go to Perth!\n\nKey vaccination thresholds are also part of Australia\u2019s broader plan to emerge from lockdowns and \u201clive with the virus\u201d.\n\nSydney \u2013 site of Australia\u2019s largest airport \u2013 is due to come out of a 13-week lockdown on 11 October.",
          "summary": "Australia will reopen its international border from November, giving long-awaited freedoms to vaccinated citizens and their relatives.\nSince March 2020, Australia has had some of the world\u2019s strictest border rules \u2013 even banning its own people from leaving the country.\nPeople would be eligible to travel when their state\u2019s vaccination rate hit 80%, he told a press briefing on Friday.\nThese states have managed to maintain Covid rates at or near zero, after shutting their borders to states with infections.\nAustralia\u2019s strict border policy has been credited for its success especially early in the pandemic, but the Delta variant has changed everything.",

          "text": "Japan fully came out of a coronavirus state of emergency for the first time in more than six months as the country starts to gradually ease virus measures to help rejuvenate the pandemic-hit economy as the infections slowed.\n\nAt Tokyo\u2019s busy Shinagawa train station, a sea of mask-wearing commuters rushed to their work despite an approaching typhoon, with some returning to their offices after months of remote work.\n\nThe emergency measures, in place for more than half of the country including Tokyo, ended Thursday following a steady fall in new caseloads over the past few weeks, helping to ease pressure on Japanese health care systems.\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga thanked the people for their patience and cooperation, and asked them to stick to their basic anti-virus measures.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I seek your cooperation so that we can return to our daily lives feeling safe,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lifting of the emergency marked a fresh start for some people.\n\nOffice worker Akifumi Sugihara, 46, said he is back to the train station for the first time in about a year. \u201cI had been working from home for more than a year, and I came to the office in Tokyo as (the emergency) was lifted today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really been a while. I feel it\u2019s a new start.\u201d\n\nAnother office worker, Kaori Hayashi, 37, said it was an ordinary Friday. \u201cIn my mind nothing really has changed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still need to be careful. I will stay vigilant and carry on my life as usual.\u201d\n\nJapan is eager to expand social and economic activities while balancing the need to prevent another wave of infections as the weather turns cooler. Officials say the government still needs time to create more temporary COVID-19 treatment facilities and continue vaccinations to prepare for any future resurgence.\n\nThe emergency measures have mainly involved requests for eateries to curb alcohol and hours. They can now serve alcohol and operate an hour longer but still have to close at 9 p.m.\n\nDaily reported cases have fallen to below 1,600 as of Wednesday nationwide \u2014 less than one-tenth of the mid-August peak of around 25,000. Experts attributed the declining numbers to the progress of vaccinations and to people increased their social distancing efforts after being alarmed by the collapse of medical systems during the summer.\n\nNearly more than 59% of Japanese people have been fully vaccinated. Japan has had about 1.69 million cases and 17,641 deaths from COVID-19.",

          "text": "After eight years of planning and billions of dollars in spending, the Middle East\u2019s first ever World Fair opened on Friday in Dubai, with hopes the months-long extravaganza draws both visitors and global attention to this desert-turned-dreamscape.\n\nNamed Expo 2020, the event was postponed by a year due to the outbreak of the coronavirus last year. While that could have an impact on how many people flock to the United Arab Emirates, the six-month-long exhibition offers Dubai a momentous opportunity to showcase its unique East-meets-West appeal as a place where all are welcome for business.\n\nNot long ago, the site of the 1,080 acre (438 hectare) expo was barren desert. Less than a decade later, it is a buzzing futuristic landscape with robots, a new metro station, multi-million dollar pavilions and so-called districts with names like \u201csustainability\u201d and \u201copportunity\u201d \u2014 all built, like much of the Gulf, by low-paid migrant workers.\n\nOrganizers say 192 nations are represented at the expo. The U.S. pavilion will showcase a replica of the Space X Falcon 9 rocket. Italy\u2019s pavilion houses a 3-D replica of Michelangelo\u2019s biblical hero, David, that is 17 feet high (5.2 meters). Other attractions include an African food hall, a royal Egyptian mummy, concerts and performances from around the world, and the option to dine on a $500 three-course meal with glow-in-the-dark cuisine.\n\nSince first making a splash in London in 1851, world fairs have long been an opportunity for nations to meet, exchange ideas, showcase inventions, promote culture and build business ties.\n\nFor more than a century, these global exhibitions have captured the imagination and showcased some of humanity\u2019s most important innovations. The first World Fair held in the United States in 1876 debuted Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s telephone, the typewriter, a mechanical calculator and Heinz Ketchup. Held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that fair attracted nearly 10 million people at a time when the entire U.S. population was estimated to be just 40 million. One of its main buildings, Memorial Hall, is now a museum.\n\nOther fairs showcased inventions like the sewing machine, the elevator, carbonated soda, the Ferris wheel and, in 1939 in New York, the television. People journeyed far for the chance at a glimpse of the world in ways they couldn\u2019t otherwise access.\n\nThis year\u2019s expo is happening amid a global pandemic, when untold numbers are still working and studying remotely \u2014 and connecting to the world virtually. It\u2019s unclear how many visitors Dubai can attract, and how much the expo will stimulate its tourism-driven economy.\n\nTo enter the expo site, visitors will need to show a negative PCR test or proof of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nDubai\u2019s ruler and the force behind the emirate\u2019s transformation, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, says Expo 2020 is a chance to showcase the best of human excellence.\n\n\u201cIt offers a platform to forge a united worldwide effort to build a more sustainable and prosperous future for all of mankind,\u201d he told guests at the expo\u2019s opening ceremony Thursday night.\n\nSheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, crown prince and de-facto ruler of the UAE\u2019s seat of power, Abu Dhabi, used his speech to emphasize \u201cthe ethos of this land\u201d as a meeting point for cultures and tolerance.\n\nWhether Iran or Israel, every nation is welcome at Dubai\u2019s expo.\n\nHuman Rights Watch, however, says organizers are promoting an inaccurate image of the UAE as an \u201copen and tolerant country\u201d for public relations purposes. Instead, it said in a scathing report that \u201cabusive authorities forcefully bar all peaceful criticism and dissent\u201d in the country, jailing activists and carrying out pervasive domestic surveillance programs.\n\n\u201cThe UAE has embarked on a decades-long effort to whitewash its reputation on the international stage,\u201d the rights group said.\n\nThe expo site will attempt to dazzle visitors with a centerpiece dome, marketed as the world\u2019s largest 360-degree projection screen. Its construction required 8.5 miles (13.6 kilometers) of steel.\n\nSome World Fair structures remain iconic markers of the human journey and our industrial evolution. None more so than the Eiffel Tower, which was constructed in Paris, not only to be the tallest structure in the world at the time, but to serve as the entrance to the 1889 World Fair. Millions are still drawn to this marvel of wrought-iron lattice work whose image today floods social media feeds.\n\nThe Space Needle in Seattle, Washington, built for the 1962 World Fair, is another structure with continued prominence and allure.\n\nWhile most fairs were held in Europe and the United States, none have been hosted in the Middle East until now.",

I look forward to continuing our collaboration.\u201d\n\nAlan Bergman, chairman of Disney Studios Content, said he is \u201cpleased that we have been able to come to a mutual agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate her contributions to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and look forward to working together on a number of upcoming projects,\u201d Bergman said.\n\nThe lawsuit said Johansson\u2019s contract guaranteed an exclusive theatrical release, with her potential earnings tied to the box office performance of the film.\n\nBut as it has with other recent releases since the coronavirus pandemic began, Disney released the film simultaneously in theaters and through its streaming service Disney+ for a $30 rental.\n\nThe rhetoric of the lawsuit and Disney\u2019s response suggested a long and ugly battle was ahead.\n\n\u201cIn the months leading up to this lawsuit, Ms. Johansson gave Disney and Marvel every opportunity to right their wrong and make good on Marvel\u2019s promise,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cDisney intentionally induced Marvel\u2019s breach of the Agreement, without justification, in order to prevent Ms. Johansson from realizing the full benefit of her bargain with Marvel.\u201d\n\nDisney at the time said the lawsuit had \u201cno merit whatsoever,\u201d adding that it was \u201cespecially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nDisney said the changed release plan \u201csignificantly enhanced her ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20M she has received to date.\u201d\n\nDelayed more than a year because of COVID-19, \u201cBlack Widow\u201d debuted to a what was then a pandemic-best of $80 million in North America and $78 million from international theaters on July 9. But theatrical grosses declined sharply after that. In its second weekend in release, the National Association of Theater Owners issued a rare statement criticizing the strategy.\n\nRevised hybrid release strategies have occasionally led to public spats between stars, filmmakers and financiers who are unhappy with potential lost revenues and their lack of say in such strategies.\n\nBut none were as big or as public as Johansson\u2019s lawsuit.",
