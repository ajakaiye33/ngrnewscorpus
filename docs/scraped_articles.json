          "text": "By Marie-Therese Nanlong\n\nA Plateau State High Court sitting in Jos has refused to grant an application seeking to return the case file of a former Governor of Plateau state, Jonah Jang, to the State Chief Judge for a reassignment to a new judge.\n\nThe Court, presided over by Justice Christine Dabup turned down the request by the Lead Counsel to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Rotimi Jacobs, SAN.\n\nIt would be recalled that Jang is standing trial alongside Yusuf Pam, a former cashier in the Office of the Secretary to the Plateau State Government on alleged misappropriation of N6.3bn and the EFCC first arraigned the duo on March, 2018 before Justice Daniel Longji.\n\nBut Justice Longji retired from service in December, 2019 , after which, the State Chief Judge, Justice Yakubu Dakwak reassigned the case to Justice Dabup who started a fresh hearing on the matter.\n\nOn Thursday, when the Lead Prosecution Counsel, Rotimi Jacobs,SAN sought the order of the court for a new Judge to take over the case.\n\nIn moving the application for the reassignment of the case, the EFCC counsel told the court that the national lockdown occasioned by COVID-19 as well as the recent national strike by Judiciary workers had prevented the case from being heard expeditiously and argued that given the fresh commencement of the case due to the retirement of the former judge handling the matter there was the need to avoid time wastage, especially as the current trial judge may not be able to conclude the case before her own retirement .\n\nJacobs said, \u201cWe have not gone far with the case as we still have about nine witnesses to present. The time is not so much on the side of the trial judge. The case may suffer the same fate due to time limit. It will be difficult for us to start recalling the witnesses for the third time and that is what I\u2019m trying to avert.\n\nIn order to avoid wastage as in the first trial so as to mitigate possible loss to the state and even to the defendant let the matter be transferred to the State Chief Judge for reassignment.\u201d\n\nBut Counsel to Jang, Edward Pwajok SAN, opposed the EFCC\u2019s application arguing that the antigraft agency is only a party to the case and therefore cannot determine how the court manages its affairs, insisting that the court would be able to dispose the rest of the case in good time if the EFCC is serious with the prosecution.\n\nHe argued, \u201cThe request by the prosecution for the reassignment of the case is simply overbearing. The application is entirely speculative and the court cannot act on speculation. He cannot determine for the court. The court knows how to manage its calendar for it\u2019s proceedings and this is determined by criminal justice administration of Plateau state which also prescribes sitting day by day. Besides, the court has already taken four witnesses from the prosecution and only has eight more to present. We are ready for the case and if the prosecution are ready with their witnesses, the case won\u2019t last long to conclude.\u201d\n\nCounsel to Yusuf Pam, the second defendant, S. O. Oyewale also opposed the EFCC\u2019s application and urged the court to continue with the case or strike it out for lack of diligent prosecution.\n\nHowever, Justice Dabup, in her ruling agreed with the submissions made by the Defense counsels noting that the court has never forestalled proceedings since she took over the case, and since there is no other court designated yet to handle such criminal matters, it will be absurd for her to excuse herself from the case and therefore ordered the EFCC to go ahead with the presentation of more witnesses to enable the court make progress in the case.\n\nEarlier ,two witnesses who were recalled by the EFCC, Emmanuel Kpanja and T Yakubu ,both bankers with the Zenith Bank, had narrated how money running into billions of naira were withdrawn towards the end of the tenure of the former Governor but maintained that no money was transferred into the personal account of the former Governor .\n\nA former Permanent Secretary ,Habila Dung also testified during Thursday hearing of the case but could not be cross examined by the Defense Counsel due to fatigue Justice Dabup adjourned the case till Friday, November, 26 for continuation of hearing.",

Don Adinuba said Obiano is currently out of the country and that he travelled through one of the country\u2019s international airports.\n\nThe statement said the governor still has four months in office, adding that nobody in Nigeria could circumscribe his immunity.\n\nIt stressed that the controversy involving the governor was masterminded by those in high places who \u201cunsuccessfully canvassed for emergency rule\u201d in the state during the build-up to the November 6 governorship election.\n\nThe state government said the anti-graft agency should not allow itself to be used by \u201cpoliticians who are mere birds of passage\u201d.\n\nIt added that the EFCC did not invite the governor for questioning or serve him a notice before announcing that he had been placed on a watch list.\n\n\u201cEverything that can be wrong with politically motivated statements like this one is obviously wrong with this statement. The EFCC knows well that it is acting inelegantly in this instance, and so has tried as much as possible not to make an official public statement on the alleged placing of Chief Obiano on the watch list.\n\n\u201cIt furtively gave a section of the media the news report it wrote based on, ostensibly, its letter to the NIS on November 15.\n\n\u201cGovernor Obiano is out of the country currently. And he travelled through one of the country\u2019s international airports. He did not disguise himself, but rather left the country with his identity fully disclosed at the necessary immigration point.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC sounded more inelegant when it claimed in the sponsored press report that it received intelligence that the governor plans to \u2018flee\u2019 from Nigeria once he hands over power on March 17 to the newly elected Anambra State governor, Professor Charles Chukwuma Soludo.\n\n\u201cChief Obiano has never left any persons in doubt that he will relocate to his base in the United States once he finishes his tenure.\n\n\u201cGovernor Obiano has a whole four months to remain in office as the Anambra State Chief Executive. Nobody in Nigeria can circumscribe his constitutionally conferred immunity, which shields him from both criminal and civil prosecution.\n\n\u201cThe EFCC went too far to announce in November that it is observing him. We are not aware of any state governor who had up to four months to be in office and the EFCC went on to sponsor media reports that he was being investigated,\u201d the statement said.",

Although a few setbacks were experienced in the course of these operations within the last 2 weeks, however, troops remained undaunted and determined in their quest to attain sustainable peace in the Country through kinetic and non-kinetic operations, which yielded attendant results in the past 2 weeks.

          "title": "Nigeria Will Survive Its Challenges, Despite Escalating Grievances, Says Fitch",
          "text": "\u2022Predicts 2.8% GDP Growth for Next Year\n\n\u2022Insists rising population, high unemployment, competition for diminishing resources exacerbating grievances\n\nObinna Chima\n\nNotwithstanding threats posed by the Islamist insurgency in the north, clashes between Fulani herdsmen and pastoralists in the Middle Belt region as well as growing unrest in the South which have continued to threaten the country\u2019s existence, Nigeria will survive its challenges over the next decade even though they would weigh on its economic growth by deterring investment and impeding private consumption, the Fitch Solutions Group, an affiliate of global ratings agency, Fitch, has stated.\n\nThe UK-based organisation stated this in a report titled, \u201cNigeria Country Risk Report \u2013 Q1- 2022,\u201d which also included a 10-year forecast to 2030, obtained yesterday.\n\n\u201cRising population levels, high unemployment and competition for diminishing resources in a period of slower economic growth will exacerbate ethnic and religious grievances in Nigeria over the next decade, and the country will continue to face security challenges on three major fronts.\n\n\u201cOur core view is that the Nigerian state will survive these interlocking challenges, although they will weigh on growth by deterring investment and impeding private consumption.\n\nThere is a downside risk, however, that ethno-religious divides will eventually lead to the break-up of the state. The next several years will be a major test for Nigeria, as the slow recovery following the Covid-19 pandemic deepens poverty and further erodes the government\u2019s ability to provide public goods. A weakened state may struggle to unite the diverse country, which has Africa\u2019s largest population.\n\n\u201cNigeria already faces three clear security threats: the Islamist insurgency in the north, clashes between Fulani herdsmen and pastoralists in the Middle Belt region, and growing unrest in the south. Even so, our core view remains that the federal republic will still exist at the end of the decade. Democracy will become increasingly entrenched, and social unrest, while likely to increase, will remain contained to the sub-regional level,\u201d it predicted.\n\nThe report predicted that Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would grow by a modest 2.1 per cent in 2021, after contracting by an estimated 1.9 per cent; and accelerate to 2.8 per cent in 2022 on the back of stronger household spending, and increases in fixed investment and oil exports.\n\nIn addition, Fitch, in the report, disclosed that it had revised its forecast for Nigeria\u2019s 2021 budget deficit to 4.8 per cent of GDP, from 4.2 per cent, following the publication of official data indicating weaker federal government revenue than it had previously anticipated. It anticipated that the country\u2019s current account deficit would narrow slightly to 1.9 per cent of GDP in 2022, largely as a result of a further narrowing of the trade deficit.\n\nFurthermore, the research firm predicted that in 2022, strengthening economic growth would provide the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) room to shift its focus to containing inflation and hiking the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 100 basis points to 12.50 per cent.\n\nIt expressed doubt over the ability of the Nigerian government to implement major economic reforms ahead of the 2023 general election, saying campaigns ahead of political parties\u2019 election primaries would be the focus of attention between now and 2022.\n\nThe federal government had disclosed a plan to remove subsidy on petrol, which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy, by May next year. The Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) recommended the removal of the controversial fuel subsidy, even as the World Bank and some other institutions had warned about the dire consequence of retaining the policy.\n\nBut Fitch, in the report, pointed out that, \u201cCampaigning ahead of party primaries will shift political attention away from reforms in fourth quarter of 2021 and 2022.\u201d\n\nIt noted that although the President Muhammadu Buhari administration had made notable progress in 2021, particularly as regards simplifying the exchange rate regime and passing landmark oil sector reforms, further significant progress was unlikely this quarter and in 2022.\n\nThis is because politicians from the two major political parties \u2013 the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 would focus on campaigning and mobilising support ahead of their primary elections, likely to be held in the second half of 2022, the report said.\n\nThe Fitch report stated, \u201cIn this context, progress on politically unpopular reforms, such the reduction of fuel and electricity subsidies, is unlikely in the coming quarters, and the resulting continued pressure on public finances will contribute to Nigeria posting large fiscal deficits in 2021 and 2022 (we forecast deficits of 4.8% and 4.5% of GDP respectively).\n\n\u201cReflecting this, we have lowered the \u2018policy-making process\u2019 component score in our Short-Term Political Risk Index from 56.7 to 53.3 (scores out of 100; lower score indicates higher risk).\u201d\n\nFitch Solutions further anticipated that campaigning ahead of Nigeria\u2019s presidential election in 2023 would dominate the political agenda in 2022.\n\nBuhari would step down in 2023, as required by the Nigerian constitution, which limits presidents to two terms in office.\n\nFitch stated in the report, \u201cIn the coming quarters, we expect potential candidates from the two main parties \u2013 the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 and their supporters to ramp up preparations to secure their party\u2019s respective nominations for president and vice-president.\n\n\u201cSeveral major figures are already actively campaigning, although most have not officially declared their intention to run.\n\n\u201cFor the APC, these include former Lagos State governor Bola Tinubu and current Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, while front-runners for the PDP include former president of the senate Bukola Saraki, and former vice president Atiku Abubakar.\u201d\n\nFitch also predicted that sub-national tensions would grow as political leaders seek to champion the interests of their core supporters with a view to strengthening their political positions. It noted that under Nigeria\u2019s long-standing custom of alternating between presidents from the predominantly Muslim North and the largely Christian South, a practice known locally as \u201czoning\u201d, the candidates both parties would choose to contest the presidency ought to come from one of Nigeria\u2019s southern states given that Buhari is a Muslim northerner. However, in late September an association of governors of northern states rejected the practice, claiming (according to media reports) that it contradicts the constitution.\n\nThe Fitch report said this position by the northern governors would likely exacerbate rifts with southern political leaders from both parties who believe that it would be their turn to control the presidency.\n\nAdding to these tensions is a growing row over the rights of states to collect and retain funds from Value Added Tax (VAT), the report noted.\n\nIt said, \u201cWhile wealthier southern states, notably Lagos and Rivers states, have introduced legislation to enable state-level agencies to collect and manage VAT revenue rather than the Federal Inland Revenue Service, this move has been fiercely opposed by the federal government and several northern states.\n\n\u201cThe latter generally are poorer and would potentially see a fall in their VAT revenue, which under the current system effectively leads to southern states cross-subsidising northern ones.\n\n\u201cThe stand-off has resulted in a lengthy legal dispute, and we expect that deteriorating relations between northern and southern political leaders will hamper coordination on key programmes, including rolling out the next phases of Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Activates 30-year development plan\n\nSegun James\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State presented a N1.388 trillion Appropriation Bill for 2022 to the House of Assembly yesterday, earmarking a whopping 59 per cent of the budget to capital expenditure in order to service key growth areas, consolidate the recovery of the state\u2019s economy, and positively transform livelihoods.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the state would be spending N325 billion to deliver vital infrastructure projects in key sectors to energise and expand the growth of the state\u2019s economy.\n\nThe budget proposal, christened, \u201cBudget of Consolidation,\u201d would be the last full-year fiscal plan of the state before the next general election.\n\nThe key areas of growth identified by the governor included works and infrastructure, waterfront infrastructure development, agriculture, transportation, energy and mineral resources, tourism, entertainment and creative industry, commerce and industry, and wealth creation and employment.\n\nThe human capital development drive of the Sanwo-Olu administration was projected to take a leap in 2022, with a combined allocation of 21.24 per cent in the total expenditure to education and health.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the coming year presented an opportunity for the state government to consolidate on progress recorded by his administration, while leveraging investment in-flow, partnership, and business-friendly policies to maximally translate his achievements into noticeable positive impact in the lives of residents.\n\nAbout N823.4 billion, representing 59 per cent of the 2022 budget, was earmarked for capital expenditure.\n\nRecurrent expenditure, representing 41 per cent, was proposed at N565 billion, which included personnel cost, overhead, and debt servicing.\n\nThe governor noted that his administration had clearly articulated its vision in governance through the T.H.E.M.E.S agenda in the last two years, adding that the state is now looking towards the future with the activation of the implementation of a 30-year development plan (2021-2051), which replaced the 13-year growth plan developed in 2012.\n\nHe said, \u201cYear 2022 budget is the next step on our journey to true and sustainable greatness in Lagos. The challenging environment requires that we focus our interventions on areas of greatest social impact and achieving the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest possible time. Next year is an excellent opportunity for us to consolidate on what we have done so far, and ensure that every effort, investment inflow, partnership, business policy is translating maximally into noticeable positive impact in the lives of our people.\n\n\u201cIt is in this light that we are presenting the Year 2022 Budget of Consolidation with a size of N1,388,285,459,990.51. This financial proposal is presented with a sense of duty and absolute commitment to the transformation of Lagos to a preferred global destination for residence, commerce, and investment.\n\n\u201cThe budget projects to see a continuing but gradual recovery to growth in economic activity as the global economy cautiously recovers from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\n\nOf the total proposed expenditure, N1.135 trillion would accrue from Internally Generated Revenues (IGRs) and federal transfers, while deficit financing of N253 billion would be sourced from external and domestic loans, and bonds projected to be within the state\u2019s fiscal sustainability parameters.\n\nThe state also earmarked an aggregate of N137.64 billion, representing 9.92 per cent of the 2022 budget, for the funding of green investment in environment, social protection, housing and community amenities.\n\nOn security, the governor explained that the state\u2019s continued investment in the sector had produced positive results, stressing that more allocation would be channelled into security in 2022 to make Lagos safer for living, working, and investment.\n\nDespite the global economic downturn, Sanwo-Olu said Lagos had seen more construction machinery deployed to deliver new infrastructure in the areas of roads, rail, housing, health, education, and waterways.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere has been significant progress on the Lagos Rail Mass Transit projects, which include both the 27-kilometre Blue line that will run from Okokomaiko to Marina, and the 32-kilometre Red line that will run from Agbado to Oyigbo and eventually to Marina.\n\n\u201cThese rails, when completed, will deliver a combined 32.5 million people every month on their respective routes, reducing travel time by over 250 per cent, increasing the productivity and quality of life of our people.\n\n\u201cThe Red line will come with eight new modern train stations, 10 new overpasses and 13 pedestrian bridges. These ambitious projects are expected to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2022.\u201d\n\nThe outgoing year\u2019s budget, Sanwo-Olu said, performed \u201cremarkably well\u201d, despite the challenges encountered by the state. He stated that the expenditure performance at the third quarter of 2021 rose to 80 per cent.\n\nThe governor said the need to stabilise the state\u2019s economy led to the adoption of far-reaching cost saving measures, including restructuring of local borrowings to reduce overall debt service obligations on Lagos.\n\nSanwo-Olu said, \u201cThe state government has successfully restructured all existing loan facilities, translating into a reduction in interest rates from an average of 18 per cent to about 12.75 per cent. This year, Fitch, a reputable international rating agency, upgraded the rating of Lagos from AA+ to AAA, reflecting Lagos\u2019 capacity to service its financial obligations, compared with national and international peers, as well as its resilient operating performance during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe governor thanked Lagosians for supporting and standing by his administration in the past two years. He said there were more challenges ahead, and urged residents to join hands with him in delivering his programmes for the common good. He assured that the pace of governance would be amplified in the coming years.\n\nSpeaker, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, praised the governor for the \u201coutstanding performance\u201d of the 2021 budget, especially in infrastructural renewal and wealth creation among others. Obasa promised a speedy and meticulous vetting of the 2022 budget proposal. He said the progress under the Sanwo-Olu administration was commendable, but urged the executive arm to look inward and devise other methods of improving the state\u2019s IGR beyond the current sources.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022FG, Nigerians own 51 equity shares, to generate 70,000 jobs\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe national carrier, Nigeria Air, is set to begin flight operations by April 2022. The new official airline would have 51 per cent of its equity shares owned by the Nigerian government and people, with foreign partners having the remaining 49 per cent.\n\nThe venture is expected to generate 70,000 jobs.\n\nThese were disclosed to newsmen yesterday by Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, at the end of the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja.\n\nSirika explained that in the new national carrier, the federal government will have five percent equity shares, Nigerian entrepreneurs 46 per cent equity shares, while the expected international strategic partners would have 49 equity shares.\n\nSirika stressed that FEC had given approval for the new national carrier. He said over 400,000 Nigerians participated in choosing the name, which was launched in 2018.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cToday (Wednesday) in Council, civil aviation presented two memoranda. One of the memos is approval of the outline business case for the establishment of the national carrier and this is the sixth time the memorandum appeared before Council. The sixth time, we got lucky to be passed by Council.\n\n\u201cThe structure of the proposed airline: government will be owning not more than five per cent. So five per cent is the maximum equity that government will take, then 46 per cent will be owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs. So, if you add that, it\u2019s 51 per cent.\n\n\u201cIt is 51 per cent majority shareholding by Nigerians and then 49 per cent will be held by strategic equity partner or partners that will be sourced during the procurement phase, which is the next phase.\n\n\u201cThis airline, if started, and within the first few years will generate about 70,000 jobs. These 70,000 jobs are higher than the total number of civil servants that we have in the country. Its importance had been well discussed so, I\u2019ll not go back to it. You had discussed it separately also on various fora as to the need for it.\u201d\n\nSirika noted African Union\u2019s agenda 2063 on the integration of the continent in terms of trade, and another flagship project, the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM).\n\n\u201cNow, the only way, the quickest way that you can integrate Africa is by air, because if you want to interconnect all the 54 nations of Africa, via rail or road, or waterways, which is even impossible, the quantum of money that you need to do all of these, the time it will take to develop this infrastructure, as well as the maintenance cost, is almost prohibitive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further said, \u201cThe name is Nigerian Air, which, of course, if you remember back in time, this was subject to national debate and 400,000 people participated, chose the name, the colour, the logo, everything and it was produced that time. It was launched also in Farnborough as far back as 2018.\n\n\u201cSo, the business case is a public document. It will be on our website, you can download it and we can give you copies. This airline will pick up and start, by God\u2019s grace, in or before April 2022.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that FEC also approved another memo for the award of contract for the provision of Automated Civil Aviation Regulatory Equipment, including software support and training, which will be located at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIn summary, this is a software that will allow all of the activities of civil aviation regulation to be done electronically on one platform, including payments, follow ups on personnel licensing, the medicals, the economic regulation of airlines, safety regulation of airlines and all other businesses within the envelope of civil aviation will be monitored by this single software.\n\n\u201cIt is called \u2018the truth machine\u2019 in quotation in Europe, because all of the truth of regulation of civilisation will appear on this platform, it\u2019s an extremely important software that the world has now come to terms with.\n\n\u201cThe contract was given to Messrs Arif Investment Nigeria Limited, who are representatives of Empik GmbH. This Empik are the creators of this software, one of its kind in the world, at the sum of N1,492,520,325, which will be including 7.5 per cent VAT and completion period of six months.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Sharon Ikeazor, minister of environment, says oil spillage in the Niger Delta region caused \u201cmassive\u201d devastation to the communities, describing it as a Hiroshima site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHiroshima is a city in Japan\u2019s Honshu Island destroyed by an atomic bomb during World War II.\n\nIkeazor said this at the weekly ministerial press briefing organised by the presidential media team at the presidential villa, Abuja, on Thursday.\n\nThree weeks ago, a pipeline explosion in Nembe, Bayelsa state, led to oil spillage across 45 communities \u2014 spewing oil into the water bodies for many days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Santa Barbara South field is jointly owned by Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO) and Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nThe minister said clean-up has started but small compared to the level of devastation the oil spill caused the communities.\n\n\u201cI got briefings through the director of NOSDRA, and what I saw in terms of the pollution either through oil refining or illegal oil refining and otherwise \u2014 the devastation of the Niger Delta is massive. As we are cleaning up, what we are cleaning up is minute compared to the devastation going on,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, it is something that government needs to tackle headlong. I hope they would have put the picture on, it was like a Hiroshima site. So, this is something we must tackle headlong. We are beyond talking and having a workshop.\u201d\n\nIkeazor also said Santa Barbara spillage had been brought under control with necessary personnel and equipment deployed to begin recovery and remediation efforts.\n\n\u201cOn the Santa Babara ITO oil spills, you remember the ministry of environment issued a statement stating what happened and the action being taken. It\u2019s a collection action between the ministry of petroleum resources, the ministry of environment, and the oil company involved,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cIt goes beyond the oil companies giving out palliatives, they must put measures in place to prevent such accidents from happening. They are also claiming that the spill was due to sabotage by the local communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are going to have a targeted approach to illegal bunkering, tampering with oil installation, and artisanal mining in the Niger Delta to get an alternative livelihood for the young people of the Niger Delta so that they would desist from this because it is further polluting the environment.\n\n\u201cThe situation has been brought under control. I got a brief from the DG of NOSDRA who was out on the field. So, now, work has to start on the proper clean-up.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, the ministry is engaging other relevant government agencies to institute stiffer punishments for companies involved in oil spillage in the country.\n\nIkeazor explained that there is a bill amending the law establishing the National Oil Spillage Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) to build its capacity and give it \u201cthe needed teeth to bite.\u201d",

As we are cleaning up, what we are cleaning up is minute compared to the devastation going on,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, it is something that government needs to tackle headlong. I hope they would have put the picture on, it was like a Hiroshima site. So, this is something we must tackle headlong. We are beyond talking and having a workshop.\u201d\n\nIkeazor also said Santa Barbara spillage had been brought under control with necessary personnel and equipment deployed to begin recovery and remediation efforts.\n\n\u201cOn the Santa Babara ITO oil spills, you remember the ministry of environment issued a statement stating what happened and the action being taken. It\u2019s a collection action between the ministry of petroleum resources, the ministry of environment, and the oil company involved,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cIt goes beyond the oil companies giving out palliatives, they must put measures in place to prevent such accidents from happening. They are also claiming that the spill was due to sabotage by the local communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are going to have a targeted approach to illegal bunkering, tampering with oil installation, and artisanal mining in the Niger Delta to get an alternative livelihood for the young people of the Niger Delta so that they would desist from this because it is further polluting the environment.\n\n\u201cThe situation has been brought under control. I got a brief from the DG of NOSDRA who was out on the field. So, now, work has to start on the proper clean-up.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, the ministry is engaging other relevant government agencies to institute stiffer punishments for companies involved in oil spillage in the country.\n\nIkeazor explained that there is a bill amending the law establishing the National Oil Spillage Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) to build its capacity and give it \u201cthe needed teeth to bite.\u201d",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nembe oil leak: Local incapacity worsens spills",
          "text": "The oil spill at the Santa Barbara oil field, OML 29, located in Nembe Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, has gone uncontained after three weeks because Nigeria lacks the capacity, the head of the government agency combating oil leaks has said.\n\nIdris Musa, director-general, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), said this lack of capacity had seen oil companies invite foreign experts to assist in containing spills, a situation that leads to delay and worsens the spill.\n\nIn an interview with Arise TV on Wednesday, Idris said the 2011 Bonga spill could only be contained because international help came quickly due to Shell\u2019s subscription to a service that cleans oil spills worldwide. In this case, Aiteo, who owns the facility from which the leaks emanated, did not subscribe to the service.\n\n\u201cNow, to get a foreign company to render this service, you have to sign contracts, negotiate terms and that will take some time,\u201d Musa said.\n\nThe Bonga oil spill in 2011 reportedly sent over 40,000 barrels of oil into 20 riverine communities across Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa and Delta states in Nigeria. It was only contained with the invitation of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), the largest international industry-funded cooperative that exists to respond to oil spills wherever in the world.\n\nOSRL, which provides preparedness, response and intervention services, is wholly owned by most of the environmentally responsible oil and gas companies, with membership representing the majority of global oil production. It currently employs 275 people across 12 locations around the world.\n\nAiteo issued a recent release saying it has engaged experts to assist in managing the spill. So far, the company\u2019s spill response team as well as support from the NOSDRA, has managed to contain the spill from entering neighbouring communities but the main leaks are yet to be stopped.\n\nThe international team Aiteo is seeking to engage has since visited the site and conducted an aerial survey, but the main task of stopping the leaks has not started.\n\nRead also: President Buhari laments oil spill in Bayelsa\n\nHowever, the task of containing the spill is a bit complicated. According to Musa, the Nembe spill is unusual because it emanated from a non-operational well. The leaks, he said, are coming from the wellhead and so far, the response team has been unable to reach it.\n\n\u201cNobody has gotten to the wellhead, the best you could do is to get close enough until the spill is stopped and nothing is coming out of the wellhead, then you can take a look and know the reason for the leak,\u201d he said.\n\nThis renders void assumptions about how many barrels of oil may have been spilled.\n\nGiving an insight into volumes of oil that may have leaked into the rivers, he said within eight hours, his team was able to recover 4,105 barrels of oil that had leaked. Over the course of three weeks, it is conceivable that thousands of oil barrels may have leaked from the facility.\n\nOML 29 is predominantly a gas field with less than 20 percent oil hence posing even greater risks, as leaking methane is hazardous.\n\n\u201cIt is time we start having the local capacity to contain this kind of spills,\u201d said Musa.\n\nThis poor capacity has worsened oil leaks in recent times. Between 2010 and 2020, Nigeria lost 489,520.301 barrels of oil to leaks, according to data from NOSDRA. This is about 40 percent of Nigeria\u2019s estimated current daily production.\n\nIn Ondo State, several oil wells were on fire for weeks in 2019, with the country lacking the capacity to put them out.\n\nThe danger to the mangroves, aquatic lives and the livelihoods of the host communities are usually enormous. Musa said it would take between 25 and 30 years for some of the trees to grow and the mangrove to regenerate and provide cover. Communities that depend on fishing will see a significant loss of income as the oil will kill the fishes.\n\nHowever, some of the leaks have occurred due to the negligence of oil companies. The Trans Niger Pipeline (TNP), which belongs to the SPDC JV that carries crude oil from various companies, had over 56 illegal connections by smugglers that were removed last year.\n\nThere are still 42 illegal connections remaining that the company knows of and is battling to remove. Since 2017, SPDC has removed more than 689 illegal theft points. Illegal theft points are identified by daily inspections from the air and on the ground, according to Shell\u2019s briefing notes for 2021.\n\nAccording to the Federal Government, the NNPC spends over N60 billion yearly maintaining pipelines and other oil infrastructure destroyed by sabotage.\n\nIn the dizzying maze of delta creeks, oil thieves tap pipelines and siphon off crude through rubber hoses that are up to 2 kilometres long into barrels on small vessels. They sail alongside larger vessels and pump the stolen crude into oil tankers bound for exports mostly in Asia.",

          "title": "Oil firms ignore Nigeria, pump fresh dollars into Libya",
          "text": "Nigeria is struggling to attract investment into its energy sector, while Libya, a country that recently emerged from a decade of conflict, is getting serious attention from some of the biggest international oil companies to assist in the gradual revival of its energy space.\n\nFrance\u2019s TotalEnergies SE and Italy\u2019s Eni SpA are making plans to invest $2 billion into Libya\u2019s Waha oil project, which will boost its production by about 100,000 barrels a day.\n\nThe fresh investment is also expected to raise output at Libya\u2019s Mabruk field and help build 500 megawatts of solar power to feed the local grid.\n\n\u201cI want to contribute to Libya\u2019s comeback,\u201d Patrick Pouyanne, TotalEnergies\u2019 CEO, said at this week Libya\u2019s Energy & Economic Summit 2021, the country\u2019s first prominent energy forum in over 10 years.\n\nPouyanne said, \u201cSome may see more boldness than wisdom in TotalEnergies\u2019 decision to partner with Libya. I don\u2019t. Where they see risks, I see the opportunities.\u201d\n\nLibya holds Africa\u2019s biggest oil reserves estimated at 43 billion barrels and 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, but has been mired in fighting for much of the period since 2011, when leader Moammar Qaddafi was toppled in an uprising.\n\nWarring sides struck a truce in mid-2020, leading to more stability and enabling crude output to rise from barely anything to around 1.2 million barrels a day, a tenfold increase from a 121,000bpd average in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nUnlike Libya, Nigeria is punching below its weight in terms of attracting the right kind of investments in its energy sector as foreign investment now accounts for just a fraction of Africa\u2019s biggest economy, with policy uncertainties and security issues also weighing on the mind of overseas investors.\n\n\u201cNigeria may drop further in status as Africa\u2019s biggest producer if the government does not urgently address the situation,\u201d Abiodun Adesanya, the CEO of Lagos-based oil consultancy Degeconek, told S&P Global Platts, noting, \u201cAlready the country has fallen behind Libya in terms of output.\u201d\n\nRead also: Nembe oil spill: FG asks AITEO to halt operation in Bayelsa\n\nNigeria has the capacity to pump around 2.2 million bpd of crude and condensate but in recent months, its output has been languishing below 1.55 million bpd. The country only pumped 1.23 million bpd of crude and 300,000bpd of condensate last month, according to Platts Analytics.\n\nGail Anderson, research director for sub-Saharan Africa at Upstream, believes there are \u201cnot many\u201d takers for the \u201chigh-cost, emissions-intensive assets\u201d that are being disposed of by large oil producers in the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cThe impact of this on the country\u2019s foreign direct investment (FDI) will likely persist beyond 2021,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nInternational oil companies have been \u201cselling assets mostly in shallow waters\u201d under a process \u201csupported by the Federal Government to support local producers that were perceived as better able to deal with insecurity issues, in particular in the Niger Delta\u201d, Aur\u00e9lien Mali, lead analyst for Africa at ratings agency Moody\u2019s, said.\n\nGlobal oil producer, Shell, is among the big producers that recently kick-started a disinvestment drive from its oil assets in the Niger Delta.\n\nHard hit by the oil spills that have resulted in lawsuits from affected communities in and around the Niger Delta, and insecurity that has culminated in pipeline sabotages, Shell is currently in talks with the government to divest all of its operated joint venture (JV) licences held by its subsidiary Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), including a 30 percent interest in 19 oil and mining leases (OMLs).\n\nOther large international oil companies disinvesting from Nigeria include Total, which said in January 2021 that it had completed the divestment of its interest in onshore Oil Mining Lease (OML) 17 to the Nigerian company TNOG Oil & Gas. Total operated under a joint venture partnership with Shell and Italian firm Agip Oil Company in the OML 17 \u2014 both of which are also disinvesting from the project.\n\nBeyond lack of investments, a new wave of security threats in Nigeria has emerged that could further dent Nigeria\u2019s production.\n\n\u201cLately, there have been groups in communities in the Niger Delta, who while seeking for cash and attention, have been vandalising oil pipelines,\u201d a Nigeria-based official at a Western oil company said. \u201cDisruption to operations of oil companies in the Niger Delta is rising by the day due to the activities of these vandals.\u201d\n\nThree days ago, a militant group in the Niger Delta region code-named Bayan-Men blew up an oil facility producing about 5,000bpd of condensates operated by the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) in Ogba-Egbema-Andoni Local Government Area, Rivers State.\n\nThe angry militants, who destroyed oil well, OB5 (Obiavu-5) in the area, accused the oil firm of failing to deal directly with the host communities, insisting that they were fighting for justice for their people.\n\nThe commander of the Bayan-Men said the company refused to allow the people to benefit from their operations in the area, adding that the firm was neck-deep in divide and rule.\n\n\u201cThe action was because Agip has refused to allow the people to benefit from their operation in the area,\u201d the group said, saying, \u201cMore are still coming if Agip does not engage directly with the communities of Omoku and give them what is due them.\u201d\n\nEni was not immediately available for comment on the incident.",

          "text": "New jobs created in the small-scale retail and trade sectors following COVID-19 pandemic have not been as productive with only a few yielding secure earnings, a recent World Bank report notes.\n\nThe report, titled \u2018COVID-19 in Nigeria: Frontline Data and Pathways for Policy,\u2019 notes that in February 2021, around 26 percent of the working-age population (15 \u2013 64 years) were engaged in retail and trade activities, an apparent increase from 17 percent in January-February 2019.\n\n\u201cThis shift marks a key difference with previous crises in Nigeria, such as the 2016 recession that followed collapsing global oil prices, where agriculture was the sector that expanded as households tried to cope,\u201d the report states.\n\nIt also notes that the general shift towards retail and trade is unlikely to represent an acceleration of structural transformation or a true shift towards more productive work outside of agriculture.\n\nStructural transformation is the transition of an economy from low productivity and labour-intensive economic activities to higher productivity and skill-intensive activities.\n\nIt helps to ensure adequate quantity and quality of employment, equitable distribution of income and wealth, access to quality public services, and protection of the environment.\n\nDeveloped economies like Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, also known as Asian Tigers, are fuelled by exports and rapid industrialisation, thanks to structural transformation.\n\nThese countries have consistently maintained high levels of economic growth since the 1960s, and have collectively joined the ranks of the world\u2019s wealthiest and competitive nations.\n\nBut Africa\u2019s biggest economy is yet to achieve structural transformation as it is still over dependent on oil despite its diversification efforts to non-oil. About 65 percent of Nigerian government revenue still comes from oil, unemployment is at an all-time high of 33 percent and about 90 million Nigerians live in deteriorating poverty.\n\nRead also: How COVID-19 shaped Nigeria\u2019s unemployment crisis in 5 numbers\n\nAn Abuja-based economic analyst, who wished to be identified as Nosa, said a lot of people lost their jobs and incomes due to the pandemic, and thus in order to survive, they had to go into small-scale retail businesses.\n\n\u201cThe problem with these jobs is that they are not value adding ones because they can\u2019t transform or develop the economy. So, it is highly unlikely for structural transformation to take place,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria to develop there is a need to restructure the economy from oil into a productive and manufacturing economy,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe report also highlights that the shift towards retail and trade activities is particularly stark among women who rose by 34 percent in February 2021 from 19 percent between January and February 2019, while for men it rose modestly from 14 percent to 17 percent.\n\nAlthough small-scale retail and trade activities are not lucrative, they are easy to start quickly in order to try and supplement household incomes and cope with the economic shock caused by the COVID.\n\nOn types of policies for boosting livelihoods, the bank recommends macroeconomic reforms that spur job creation and structural transformation through exchange rate policies, trade policies, and fiscal policies.\n\nAmong the key priorities to support job creation will be promoting diversification of the economy away from oil, which has represented more than 80 percent of Nigeria\u2019s total exports every year since the 1970s, the report states.\n\nThe report also adds that structural transformation will take decades, so alleviating constraints on small enterprises will be crucial in the short and medium run: for farms.\n\n\u201cThis means developing more resilient crop and livestock varieties and public investment in storage, transport, and market access for non-farm enterprises, alleviating credit constraints could support firm survival, profitability, and growth complementing investment in infrastructure and markets,\u201d the report advises.",

The challenging environment requires that we focus our interventions on areas of greatest social impact and achieving the greatest good for the greatest number in the shortest possible time. Next year is an excellent opportunity for us to consolidate on what we have done so far, and ensure that every effort, investment inflow, partnership, business policy is translating maximally into noticeable positive impact in the lives of our people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is in this light that we are presenting the Year 2022 Budget of Consolidation with a size of N1,388,285,459,990.51. This financial proposal is presented with a sense of duty and absolute commitment to the transformation of Lagos to a preferred global destination for residence, commerce, and investment. The budget projects to see a continuing but gradual recovery to growth in economic activity as the global economy cautiously recovers from the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\n\nOf the total proposed expenditure, N1.135 trillion would accrue from Internally Generated Revenues (IGRs) and federal transfers, while deficit financing of N253 billion would be sourced from external and domestic loans, and bonds projected to be within the State\u2019s fiscal sustainability parameters.\n\nThe State would be earmarking an aggregate of N137.64 billion, representing 9.92% of the 2022 budget, for the funding of green investment in Environment, Social Protection, Housing and Community Amenities.\n\nThe Governor explained that the state\u2019s continued investment in security had yielded positive results with more allocations to be channelled to the sector in 2022 to make Lagos safer for living, working and investment.\n\n\u201cThere has been significant progress on the Lagos Rail Mass Transit projects, which include both the 27-kilometre Blue line that will run from Okokomaiko to Marina and the 32-kilometre Red line that will run from Agbado to Oyigbo and eventually to Marina,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.\n\n\u201cThese rails, when completed, will deliver a combined 32.5 million people every month on their respective routes, reducing travel time by over 250 per cent, increasing the productivity and quality of life of our people.\n\n\u201cThe Red line will come with eight new modern train stations, 10 new overpasses and 13 pedestrian bridges. These ambitious projects are expected to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2022.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the state\u2019s 2021 budget performed remarkably well despite the challenges encountered by the state, noting that the expenditure performance at the third quarter of 2021 rose to 80%\n\n\u201cThe State Government has successfully restructured all existing loan facilities, translating into a reduction in interest rates from an average of 18 per cent to about 12.75 per cent. This year, Fitch, a reputable international rating agency, upgraded the rating of Lagos from AA+ to AAA, reflecting Lagos\u2019 capacity to service its financial obligations, compared with national and international peers, as well as its resilient operating performance during the pandemic,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Energy Transition: PUTTRU\u2019s Discussion Paper posits proper financing for Africa",
          "text": "Africa\u2019s foremost energy business facilitation platform, PUTTRU, has issued a Discussion Paper, targeting the deliberations at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow, Scotland, which lasted between October 30 and November 12, 2021.\n\nTitled, \u2018Africa\u2019s Sustainable Energy Transition: Assessing the True Costs\u2026Reflections for COP26, the paper is currently available for free downloads at www.puttru.com and aims at stimulating robust discourse that would proffer feasible solutions to the issue of energy transition in Africa, considering the constraints and realities in the global energy system.\n\nAuthored and reviewed by a team of energy experts, the paper is divided into four sections. Section One is the Introduction and presents the objectives of the paper. Section Two, defines and discusses the inherent constraints of energy systems, namely technical feasibility and stability of the grid, environmental concerns, security of energy supply, and energy costs. In Section Three, the paper presents the implications of these inherent constraints on Africa\u2019s evolving energy system, while Section Four offers recommendations and conditions for a decarbonised energy system pathway for the African continent.\n\nFormer Managing Director of Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas, NLNG, Godswill Ihetu in the paper\u2019s foreword writes: \u201cThe Discussion Paper is comprehensive and well-written. It captures elements of the tangible and intangible costs to Africa in joining the net zero emissions targets proposed mainly by the G20 and other wealthy countries. To be sure, those who have been responsible for pollution must clean up, especially given the fact that the developed world has burned vast amounts of fossils fuels since the last one hundred years as it powered the industrial revolution that has led to its socioeconomic development.\n\n\u201cWith Africa having largely been left out of this industrialisation process, the continent must insist on Climate Justice. Africa must be allowed to generate its own electricity with fossil fuels; hence the embargo on funding new fossil fuel development should apply to only the wealthy, developed countries. It should be noted, however, that certain Western countries have been discouraging foreign investors from investing in oil and gas assets in Africa, claiming that they might end up with stranded assets in the future. This mindset must be addressed robustly by African countries. While I agree that Africa should not ignore renewables, the continent must not pursue development of alternative energy sources to the detriment of its fossil fuel assets. In any case, immediate cessation of fossil fuel usage is not possible for Africa at this point, as countries\u2019 needs differ in many ways. Therefore, adaptation and mitigation must be a continuous process, especially for Africa\u2019s vulnerable economies.\u201d\n\nPUTTRU, founded by energy specialist, Monica Maduekwe is at the forefront of bridging energy gaps in Africa by leveraging technology which enables African energy businesses and financiers connect within Africa and beyond.",

          "text": "In spite of the gains made by security forces against criminal elements in parts of the country, bandits wreaked havoc on Nigerians, killing 454 victims and kidnapping 1,239 others from their homes, on the roads, schools, churches and farms in the last five months.\n\nThe latest notable incident was the attack and killing of former Zamfara State governorship aspirant, Sagir Hamid, a former director with the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and the kidnapping of an unspecified number of travellers by bandits on Kaduna-Abuja highway on Sunday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi suspended construction work on the Effium axis of the Abakaliki ring road for one week following the kidnap of five of the workers on the road by unknown gunmen last month in Effium Community of Ohaukwu Local Government Area of the State.\n\nLEADERSHIP investigations show that between the months of July and November, about 935 victims were abducted in Kaduna State alone while other states across the country recorded pockets of kidnappings, too.\n\nOur investigations also showed that over 454 innocent lives were lost in the period under review while about 91 bandits and kidnappers were also killed.\n\nHowever, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) yesterday revealed that 996 Boko Haram /Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists surrendered to troops while 258 terrorists operating in the North-East and North-West geopolitical zones were neutralised by Nigerian forces, in the last two weeks.\n\nThe Kaduna State commissioner for internal security and home affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said at least 830 persons were kidnapped and 343 killed by bandits in Kaduna between July and September, 2021, while our investigations showed that, in October, 105 persons were abducted, bringing the total number of abducted victims to 935 persons. Aruwan said 69 bandits were killed by troops of the Nigerian Army within the period in the state.\n\nAlso, bandits who kidnapped about 66 worshippers at the Emmanuel Baptist Church, Kakau Daji in Chikun local government area of Kaduna State on October 31, have killed two of the captors.\n\nThe worshippers were kidnapped when the bandits who came in large numbers invaded the church on October 31, 2021, during a religious service.\n\nThe chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria in Kaduna State, Rev. Joseph Hayab, confirmed the killing of two of the abducted 66 worshippers on Sunday. He also said three other victims were seriously injured by the bandits.\n\nSome of the major kidnap incidents within the period include about 150 students who went missing after armed men in July raided their school in Kaduna State in July.\n\nIn September, news broke of the abduction of the Emir of Bungudu, Zamfara state, Alhaji Hassan Atto, and an unspecified number of commuters, along the Kaduna-Abuja highway.\n\nThe Kaduna State police command confirmed the incident through the Command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Mohammed Jalige, who had reported that \u201con September 14, at about 3:10 pm, the Kaduna Police Command received a tragic report of an attack and kidnapping incident around Dutse village along the Kaduna-Abuja Road.\n\n\u201cAn unspecified number of people were suspected to have been kidnapped, while two others sustained varying degrees of injuries and are currently receiving medical treatment.\n\n\u201cEqually, available information indicated that the Emir of Bungudu, Zamfara State, His Royal Highness (HRH) Alhaji Hassan Atto, is among the people abducted to an unknown destination.\u201d\n\nAlso on September 29, at least 32 people were killed in a week in northern Nigeria after armed groups attacked remote communities in two states.\n\nResidents said the killings and the abduction of 24 people in Niger and Sokoto states were carried out by marauding gunmen operating across the northwest and central parts of Nigeria who are notorious for abducting hundreds of school children and travellers for ransom.\n\nThe attacks happened barely 48 hours after about 40 people were killed in North too.\n\nIn Niger State, assailants attacked Muya local government area on September 28, killing 14 people and abducting seven women, according to Garba Mohammed, the council chairman.\n\n\u201cThese bandits invaded one of the communities around 2am, set the houses ablaze, burnt the people in their rooms while some of them [the attackers] were standing outside; those trying to escape were caught and slaughtered,\u201d said Mohammed.\n\nAfter the raid in Kachiwe village, the assailants went to two more communities nearby, killing two people they saw on their way, before killing 16 more residents, he added.\n\nAccording to Amina al-Mustapha, a state lawmaker, during a similar attack in Sokoto state, 17 people were abducted from their homes in Sabon Birni local government area.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWe are under bandits now; we are suffering now, At least 60 per cent of about 500,000 residents in Sabon Birni have fled the community, some taking refuge in neighbouring Niger Republic which is just about 160km (100 miles) away.\n\nTimeline of /Abductions\n\nJuly 3, 2021: Bandits abduct 7 women, 4 children along Birnin Gwari Road\n\nJuly 5, 2021: Boko Haram abducts Rev.

Joseph Hayab, confirmed the killing of two of the abducted 66 worshippers on Sunday.

          "text": "Governors of the 36 states of the federation have said for Nigeria to overcome challenges that would come with African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) , it needs to maintain its leading position in Africa\u2019s integration by bringing down ideological limitations and artificial trade barriers.\n\nChairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi, made the governors\u2019 position known at the opening of a three-day subnational strategy workshop on AfCFTA organised by the National Action Committee in conjunction with the NGF in Abuja.\n\nThe NGF chairman said regulatory agencies of government like the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) must change their revenue sharing mindset and adopt trade facilitation.\n\nHe noted: \u201cWe have Customs, I don\u2019t want to go into the details of the mentality of our Customs which focuses more on revenue generation than trade facilitation, and trade facilitation is what will make AfCFTA work better in our environment.\n\n\u201cYes, we all say under the Buhari\u2019s administration as part of the ease of doing business competitive framework, we now allow visa at the point of entry, but those who have gone through that experience will also tell you that trying to bring people in on the visa at point of entry is an experience you will rather not have because is not as smooth will claim it to be,\u201d.\n\nFayemi also observed that Nigeria has a tradition and history of being involved in regional integration both at the African Union level as well as being a foundation member of ECOWAS, adding that the basis was already there for trade facilitation, job creation, and expanding economic opportunities of businesses in the country.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we will be the beneficiaries if we focus on this and look at the opportunities and challenges, and block the leakages that may make it difficult for us to be a full part in the AfCFTA,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said with AfCFTA, Nigeria is well on its way to becoming a multi-sector giant as a benefactor from benefits such as regional supply chain and job creation.\n\nHe however argued that to fully harness this growth, states in the country must incorporate components of the AfCFTA agreement into their development plans.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis, he said, would enable the country to competitively participate in the continental free trade.\n\n\u201cNigeria is already utilising regional trade opportunities, contributing approximately 76 per cent of total trading volume in the ECOWAS region. AfCFTA will only further enhance this trade, creating new economic opportunities and spurring economic and trade growth.\n\n\u201cWe believe AfCFTA has created a significant opportunity for Nigeria to drive job creation and capacity building with the creation of a single libralised market for trade and services for the continent. The AfCTA enables both the trade in products and services as well as the human capital,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governors also canvassed the need for the country to avail itself of the opportunities enshrined within the AfCFTA, with new and improved trade opportunities, creating enhanced regional supply network, domestic job opportunities and capacity building.",

          "text": "By GBENGA ADEOLA\n\nEstate named after late ex-NBA President B.O. Benson\n\nGovernor lays foundation for project\u2019s scheme II\n\nDetermined to bridge the housing deficit and create affordable accommodation for residents, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Thursday delivered and commissioned a 480-unit housing project in Ikorodu division.\n\nSanwo-Olu named the LagosHOMS project built in Ibeshe after the late former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and Asiwaju of Ikorodu, Chief Babatunde Olusola Benson, SAN.\n\nThe Governor described the project as \u201ca modern style\u201d accommodation initiated to improve the residents\u2019 comfort and wellbeing.\n\nThe project comprises 40 blocks of one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three bedrooms apartments, with fully fitted kitchen, store and guest toilets. The estate also has ample space for parking, a water treatment plant, overhead water tanks, borehole, central sewage system, seven transformers, one injection station and two dumpsites, as well as buildings for generator house and central hall.\n\nSanwo-Olu reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to prioritising development of housing projects that would enhance comfort and strengthen the aesthetic of the environment. The event, he said, was a testimony to the fulfillment of his electoral promises.\n\nThe Governor, who also performed groundbreaking of Ibeshe Scheme II, said that his administration had created 17,000 direct jobs and 18,000 indirect jobs through the construction of various housing schemes. He said the State\u2019s housing projects had direct engagement of consultants, contractors and artisans in the State.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the past two and half years, we have been earnestly addressing the huge housing deficit in Lagos. There is no doubt that this administration is passionate about building decent and durable homes for our people. Actually, the provision of more housing facilities is a major aspect in our transformational agenda tagged THEMES.\n\n\u201cThrough our development blueprint, the State is focusing on the Built sector as a driving factor for economic development, social inclusion and job creation. In deepening our activities in this sector, the economy of the State has been greatly revitalised. This is because building homes is a capital-intensive activity that positively affects every sector of the economy.\n\n\u201cWe are here because every responsive government knows about the impact of good and decent homes on the welfare of the people. This has a ripple effect on other areas of life by adding meaning and essence to living. It is in acknowledgment of this fact that this administration considers housing development to be a priority on its agenda.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu, while reiterating his administration commitment to affordable housing for Lagosians, said private sector involvement in housing development is vital to robust housing delivery.\n\nThe Governor said by the time of his administration\u2019s third anniversary, a total of 7,000 homes would have been delivered by the State under his leadership, adding that the Government was embarking on a partnership with the private sector to provide more housing needs for the people.\n\n\u201cAbout five weeks ago, we commissioned an estate of 100 homes constructed through a joint venture in Lekki. Today, we are here again to release another set of 480 homes delivered through direct budgetary allocation. In utilising these two strategies of partnership with the private sector and budgetary allocation, we have been able to deliver 13 major housing schemes all over the State.\n\n\u201cWe are still counting because we are still at work in a number of housing construction sites all over the State. Apart from the one being commissioned today, three schemes are virtually ready and awaiting commissioning at Sangotedo, Odo-Onosa Ayandelu, and Agbowa. It is our expectation that by the time this administration is marking the third anniversary, a total of 7,000 homes would have been delivered to the people\n\n\u201cWithin this location, there is also a joint venture housing scheme which is being constructed in collaboration with a private investor. This is just one of the partnership efforts of this administration. There are still other joint venture schemes at Ijora-Badia, Tolu-Ajegunle, Lekki and Ajah to mention a few. By involving the private sector, the State is widening the home provision net and opening the door wider for more homeownership opportunities.\n\n\u201cThe private sector involvement in housing development is vital to a robust housing delivery policy. In creating opportunities for private investors through various reforms, the State Government is aiding vibrancy in the economy. Together both government and private investors are meeting a basic human need while galvanizing the economy at the same time,\u201d the governor said.\n\nOn the development of Ibeshe Phase II, Sanwo-Olu said the scheme would yield a total of 192 flats with supporting infrastructure, which will include a network of roads, drainage system, car park, electricity and water reticulation system.\n\nCommissioner for Housing, Hon. Moruf Akinderu-Fatai said the ceremony demonstrated the readiness of the Sanwo-Olu administration to improve the wellbeing of residents through the supply of affordable housing units across the State.\n\nHe said the location of the project, developed through budgetary allocation, would give the allottees a level of environmental protection and comfort, as the scheme was developed close to a shoreline thereby making it a good choice.\n\nThe project, he said, has also improved socio-economic indices of the area.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of mention that housing development comes under the pillar of making Lagos a 21st Century economy in line with the T.H.E.M.E.S. Agenda. Based on this policy thrust, the State Government has been working on the completion of all the housing schemes initiated but left unfinished by previous administrations in the State,\u201d the Commissioner said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

If adults or your parents abuse drugs in your presence, you may not see anything wrong with doing the same thing yourself.\u201d\n\nAmong other prayers, the House called for a Marshall plan to fight drug abuse, the raiding of the local manufacturing plants by a combined team of the NDLEA and other security agencies as well as increasing the budget of the NDLEA to enable the agency to function more efficiently.\n\nThe motion was passed in a unanimous voice vote.\n\nHouse Deputy Speaker, Rep. Ahmed Idris Wase, presided over the proceedings in the absence of the Speaker, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila. Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

But he commended all of them for the progress we are recording on all fronts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further stated that the president ordered the armed forces and other security agencies, intelligence organisations, not to rest on their oars, notwithstanding the progress and efforts being made to eliminate insurgency, banditry, kidnapping for ransom, and all the other criminalities.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe president said that we are not yet where we should be. That Nigerians deserve to live in peace. And that until we achieved that we will not rest.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said the president was particularly pleased with the outcome of the November 6 governorship elections that produced former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) Professor Charles Soludo, as the Anambra governor-elect.\n\n\u201cThe President was particularly happy with the fact that a free and fair election was made possible by the INEC and our security agencies.\n\n\u201cAnd that that is a good assurance to all Nigerians, that we are committed to promoting democracy, that is in respect of Anambra election.\n\n\u201cAnd he was quite happy that the combination of INEC and the security agencies, from the military to the police and all the other agencies made that possible with the support of the people and the government of Anambra.\n\n\u201cWe all saw the outcome. With that there is no doubt as to the commitment of our administration to promoting democracy, and ensuring that 2023 is not in any way threatened,\u201d Aregbesola said.\n\nINTERPOL\n\nHe said Buhari was also particularly happy with the news that the Head of INTERPOL National Central Bureau, Assistant Inspector General of Police, Garba Umar, has been elected Vice President (Africa) and Executive Committee Member of the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL).\n\nAsked if the resurgence of criminal activities along Abuja-Kaduna highways was discussed at the meeting, Aregbesola said: \u201cOh, yes. The police and other security agencies had been mobilised to intensify surveillance, patrol in pursuit of the criminals.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not only about Abuja-Kaduna. Yes, Abuja-Kaduna belt was discussed specifically, but we appreciated the fact that we are in the season of festivity.\n\n\u201cSo, all agencies committed to providing security for Nigeria and the maintenance of law and order, have been ordered to improve on their activities, intensify surveillance and minimize, if not eliminate totally any threat to law and order anywhere in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAsked if the military or the police will be taking the lead, he said: \u201cPolice, as I said, is the lead agency on internal security.\n\n\u201cSo whatever I\u2019ve said about maintenance of law and order will start with the police and then extend to all the other security agencies, certainly.\u201d\n\nAlso asked if the issue or bandits collecting ransom, taking over and administering some areas in the country was discussed, he said: \u201cSpecific orders have been given to all our security agencies.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll see an improved response to all those challenging the sovereignty of Nigeria in whatever form and creating insecurity in whatever form anywhere.\n\n\u201cThe council, today, took firm decision on what to be done and I can assure Nigerians that with the charge from the President and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces today (Thursday), there will be an improved response to all forms of criminality in any part of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn whether there were new strategies to that effect, especially as it was not the first time such charge would be given by President Buhari, the minister said: \u201cBut what I know is that for as long as there is life, we must not rest until our objective of making Nigeria safe for Nigerians is made possible.\n\n\u201cSo, I am convinced that with the renewed charge to our security agencies, from the military, to the police, intelligence organisations and all other security forces, certainly Nigerians will feel and live better going forward.\u201d\n\nRoll call\n\nPresent at the meeting were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Chief of Staff to the President Professor Ibrahim Gambari; National Security Adviser (NSA) -ajor General Babagana Monguno (retd) and Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General LEO Irabor.\n\nAlso in attendance were Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Naval Staff and the Chief of Air Staff as well as the Inspector General of Police Usman Baba Alkali.\n\nBefore the commencement of the meeting, President Buhari, with the assistance of Vice President Osinbajo, had decorated his Aide De Camp (ADC) Lt.-Col Yusuf Mukhtar Dodo with his new red neck rank of Colonel.\n\nTroops kill 30 terrorists\n\nMeanwhile, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) Thursday said troops of Operation HADIN KAI in the North-east have killed over 90 Boko Haram/ Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP) terrorists and arrested 21 others.\n\nThe military also said a total of 996 terrorists and their families comprising 203 males, 302 females and 491 children surrendered to troops at different locations in Borno state.\n\nDirector Defence Media Operations (DMO) Brigadier-General Bernard Onyeuko stated this while briefing journalists on update of military operations across the country from 11 to 25.\n\nHe said troops also arrested a notorious terrorist named Mr Haladu Saleh, who had been on wanted list since 2018.\n\nHe said \u201cIn the course of these operations, no fewer than 90 terrorists were neutralized and 21 of them arrested.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, although a few setbacks were experienced in the course of these operations within the last 2 weeks, however, troops remained undaunted and determined in their quest to attain sustainable peace in the country through kinetic and non-kinetic operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cTroops of Operation HADIN KAI within the period under review carried out extensive land and air operations across the theatre.\n\n\u201cNotably, on 12 November, 2021, the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI decimated BHT/ISWAP terrorist elements in offensive air strikes in a location within Baga near the Lake Chad.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on 13 November, 2021, own troops in a coordinated ground and air attacks, repelled terrorists\u2019 attack on troops at Askira Uba in Borno state. During the counter-offensive operation, over 50 of the terrorists were neutralized and several of their combat equipment, including gun trucks and other weapons were destroyed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said troops arrested Boko Haram logistics supplies and two drug peddlers named Mr Ezekiel Karson and Galadima Bako with large quantities of cannabis sativa.\n\nHe added that many kidnapped victims were freed and assorted weapons were seized from the terrorists.\n\n\u201cAlso, 98 assorted weapons, including AK-47 rifles and 2,589 rounds of ammunitions were recovered within the period. Additionally, seven kidnapped civilians were rescued.\n\n\u201cTheir fighting vehicles as well as large caches of arms and ammunition were recovered during the encounter. However, some of our gallant officers and soldiers paid the supreme prize,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Minister of Aviation Hadi Sirika has said the country\u2019s national air carrier, Air Nigeria, is expected to take off April 2022.\n\nThe minister said this while briefing State House correspondents at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said the national airliner would be run by a company in which the Nigerian government would hold a five percent stake, Nigerian entrepreneurs 46 percent and the remaining 49 percent for yet to be assigned strategic equity partners, including foreign investors.\n\nSitrika said, when it becomes operational, the national carrier would create about 70,000 jobs for Nigerians.\n\nThe minister said over 400,000 Nigerians participated in choosing the name unveiled 2018.\n\n\u201cToday in Council, civil aviation presented two memoranda. The first one is approval for the award of contract for the provision of Automated Civil Aviation Regulatory Equipment, including software support and training, which will be located in Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport.\n\n\u201cIn summary, this is a software that will allow all of the activities of civil aviation regulation to be done electronically on one platform, including payments, including follow-ups on personnel licensing, the medicals, the economic regulation of airlines, safety regulation of airlines and all other businesses within the envelope of civil aviation will be monitored by this single software.\n\n\u201cIt is called \u2018the truth machine\u2019 in Europe because all of the truth of regulation of civilization will appear on this platform. It\u2019s extremely important software that the world has now come to terms with.\n\n\u201cThe contract was given to Messrs. Arif Investment Nigeria Limited, who are representatives of Empik GmbH. This Empik is the creator of this software, one of its kind in the world, at the sum of N1, 492,520,325, which will be including 7.5% VAT and a completion period of six months. So that\u2019s the first memoranda,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe further said: \u201cThe next one also is approval of the outline business case for the establishment of the national carrier and this is the sixth time the memorandum appeared before Council. The sixth time, we got lucky to be passed by Council.\n\n\u201cThe structure of the proposed airline; the government will be owning not more than 5%. So, 5 per cent is the maximum equity that government will take, then 46% will be owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs. So, if you add that, it\u2019s 51%.\u201d\n\nSirika added that with a 51 per cent share, Nigerians will own the majority while 49% will be held by strategic equity partners that will be sourced during the procurement phase.\n\n\u201cThis airline, if started, and within the first few years, will generate about 70,000 jobs. These 70,000 jobs are higher than the total number of civil servants that we have in the country. Its importance had been well discussed so; I\u2019ll not go back to it. You had discussed it separately also on various fora as to the need for it.\n\n\u201cBut one important item is the AU agenda 2063, which speaks to the integration of Africa, which speaks to the cause and trade within Africa that is intra-Africa and to which also another flagship project of AU agenda 2063 called the Single African Air Transport Market.\n\n\u201cNow, the only way, the quickest way that you can integrate Africa is by air because if you want to interconnect all the 54 nations of Africa, via rail or road, or waterways, which is even impossible, the quantum of money that you need to do all of these, the time it will take to develop this infrastructure, as well as the maintenance cost, is almost prohibitive,\u201d Sirika explained.\n\nThe minister expressed the confidence that the target is \u201cdoable, it\u2019s time-taking, but with aviation, within a year, once the right policy is in place, like SAATM, you can connect Africa and then, of course, the needed integration will happen. Part of AU agenda 2063 so, these are the two memoranda that were submitted, and gladly they were passed by Council.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe name is Nigerian Air which of course, if you remember back in time, this was subject to the national debate and 400,000 people participated, choose the name, the colour, the logo, everything and it was produced that time. It was launched also in Farnborough as far back as 2018.\n\n\u201cSo, the business case is a public document. It will be on our website; you can download it and we can give you copies. This airline will pick up and start, by God\u2019s grace, on or before April 2022.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "title": "2022: Minister reveals full fuel deregulation plans as FG removes subsidy provision from budget",
          "text": "Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Hajiya Zainab Ahmed has said the federal government cannot sustain the current N250 billion monthly petroleum subsidy.\n\nThe minister stated this while briefing State House correspondents Wednesday in Abuja at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nShe said the costly monthly subsidy was making the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC)\u2019s remittance almost zero to the federation.\n\nThe minister\u2019s position came 24 hours after the Group Managing Director Mele Kyari said legally the fuel subsidy regime would come to an end February next year.\n\nMinister speaks\n\nAnd speaking along same line Wednesday, Minister Ahmed said: \u201cThe Petroleum Industry Act has a provision that all petroleum products must be deregulated. And in the 2020 budget, we made a provision to assume that at the maximum by the end of June, we must exit subsidy. So this last FAAC, the subsidy cost to the Federation was N243 billion.\n\n\u201cIf we look at a cost of about 250 billion per month, and it has been increasing consistently. So we\u2019re expecting something around N120 billion per month from NNPC. And now we\u2019re getting to a point where NNPC is remitting near zero. And if we don\u2019t stop we will get to a point where they will tell you pay me this for managing the fuel provision in the country.\n\n\u201cSo if you take N250 billion times 12 months, that is about N3 trillion. If we don\u2019t remove that, that is what it is costing us. This is money that we can use to apply to health and to education.\n\n\u201cThe intervention we want to provide is for between 20 to 40 million people and there is still a lot of work going on. We have a committee that is chaired by His Excellency the Vice President, state governors and a few of us-ministers as members. So we have to have a landing as to the exact number between 20 to 40 million.\n\n\u201cWe already agreed it will be N5, 000 and we have also agreed that the remittances have to be done digitally. So the e-naira will help, but also are the various payment platforms that are currently available. What we will not do is paying people in cash.\n\n\u201cThe transfers that people will receive through one kind of electronic money or the other and it\u2019s meant to be for a period of six, nine or 12 months. So these are things that we are still in negotiation because it\u2019s still money that would have to come from the Federation account. So, everybody that is a member of FAAC will have to agree on the numbers. The maximum will be 12 months, the minimum will be six months,\u201d she said.\n\nGDP report\n\nShe said the third quarter GDP report for 2021 which was released Thursday last week by the National Bureau of Statistics shows an improvement from the contraction that was witnessed in 2020.\n\nAsked why the growth does not impact on Nigerians, she said: \u201cLet me say that, again, the Nigeria economy is growing. And right now, we witnessed four consecutive quarters of GDP growth. We also said that we aspire to continue to push this growth to the point where the growth supersedes the growth in our population, because that\u2019s the time that people will actually feel the benefits.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re pushing the bar at the third quarter of 2021. The average annual growth is now 3.3%. Our population growth is roughly about 3.2%. So, we still need to do a lot more for people to feel this. But the fact that the service sector is not in positive territory, it also means that people will actually begin to feel the difference, because it is the service sector that has the first direct impact on people.\n\n\u201cWe entered into a recession technically and then exited recession by the fourth quarter of 2020. This report shows that we now have four consistent quarters of growth from Q4 2020 to Q3 2021. The GDP third quarter report shows a growth of 4.03% in the third quarter 2021 compared to a contraction of minus 3.62% in the third quarter of last year.\n\n\u201cPart of the economic activities that were the major drivers of growth within this reporting period is services which grew by 8.41%. Growth in the service sector was largely driven by better performance in the rail transport sector, pipeline sector, air transport, financial institutions, road transport sector, water transport as well as crude.\n\n\u201cAgriculture also grew by 1.22%. This is a slight dip compared to the 1.3% in the second quarter of 2021. And the reason for the dip has to do with a slight slowdown in agricultural activities in some parts of the country due to security.\n\n\u201cThe growth in agriculture that is reported in this quarter is largely driven by crop production. The growth in industry has been consistent, but we have seen a slight slowdown compared to the last quarter 2021 and the contraction of the industry is driven by the poor performance of the crude oil and natural gas sectors, coal mining, quarrying, minerals as well as oil refinery.\n\n\u201cThe Q3 GDP report indicates that the oil sector\u2019s contribution to the GDP today stands at 7.49% while the non oil sector contribution to the GDP stands at 2.51%. This indicates that the Nigerian economy is truly very diversified with the oil sector contributing just 7.49%.\n\n\u201cSo, factors that are responsible for this growth include the commitment of the government to continued containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the implementation of fiscal and monetary measures to support businesses contained in the Economic Sustainability Plan.\n\n\u201cIt includes the improvement that we\u2019ve witnessed in the rail transport sector, pipelines, air transport, road transport, as well as water transport. It includes improvement in the transportation and the free movement of people as well as goods as the containment measures have been really improved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen also improvement in the financial services sector with higher supplementary incomes compared to 2020. There\u2019s been improvement in electricity generation and distribution during this quarter as well as improvement in water supply, sewage and waste management and remediation activities.\n\n\u201cThere is also indication of higher trade activities which have significantly improved compared to 2020 because of the containment measures that slowed down trade significantly. Also reported is the inflation numbers for the month of October 2021 at 15.99%.\n\n\u201cThis is consistent with the decline that we have seen in inflation from April 2021 to date. We expect this decline to continue through the rest of the year and also throughout the year 2022. On the other hand, we have seen an adjustment that has been done in the inflation largely caused by the improvement in the food basket in the inflation mix. And this is largely due to the agricultural harvest which constitutes 50% of the basket and inflation,\u201d she said.\n\nProvision not in budget \u2013Senate\n\nBut, Chairman Senate Committee on Finance Olamilekan Adeola (APC Lagos West) has said no provision was made for N5, 000 monthly stipend for 40 million Nigerians as transportation allowance in the 2022 budget.\n\nPut together, he said this would amount to N2.4trillion.\n\nHowever, the lawmaker also disclosed that there was provision for subsidy in the Appropriation Bill.\n\nHe spoke to journalists Wednesday shortly after submitting the committee\u2019s report on the Bill.\n\nAdeola explained that before the Executive can embark on such intervention, the proposal must come to National Assembly because it is going to cost N2.4 trillion, even as he wondered what criteria would be used to determine the beneficiaries of the transportation allowance.\n\nThe proposal according to him, is still a rumour since the required documents on that is not before the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into details, if there is something like that, a document needs to come to National Assembly. And how do they want to identify the identities of the beneficiaries? This is not provided for in 2022 budget proposal which is N2.4 trillion\n\n\u201cFor us, we still believe it is news because this budget we are considering contains subsidy and if we are passing a budget with subsidy in the fiscal document, we can\u2019t speak because that is the document that is currently before us.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Finance, budget and National Planning was quoted as saying that 40 million Nigerians will be paid N5000 as transportation allowance, in lieu of the fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into details for now. I believe that if such proposal is to come to pass, a document to that effect must be sent to National Assembly for us to see how feasible it is and how do we identify the 40 million Nigerians that are going to benefit from this process.\n\n\u201cThere are still a lot of issues to be deliberated upon and looked into if eventually this will come to pass. And how do we raise this money to pay these 40 million Nigerians because I know that even the revenue being raised and monies that are coming in from this so-called oil and other sources of revenue to the Federal government cannot guarantee that?.\n\n\u201cSo, this is not provided for already in the 2022 budget. We don\u2019t have anywhere in the budget where 40 million Nigerians will collect N5000 monthly as transportation allowance totalling N2.4 trillion.\n\n\u201cI know that there must be a budgetary provision for this for us (National Assembly) to consider. That is why I said it is still a news out there until it formally comes to the National Assembly for either a virement to the budget or reordering of the budget. For now, I still want to take it as a rumour and as a news until, it is formally presented before the National Assembly,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s proposed national carrier, Nigeria Air, is set to begin flight operations by April 2022. The new official airline would have 51 per cent of its equity shares owned by the Nigerian government and people, with foreign partners having the remaining 49 per cent.\n\nThe venture is expected to generate 70,000 jobs.\n\nThese were disclosed to newsmen yesterday by Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, at the end of the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja.\n\nSirika explained that in the new national carrier, the federal government will have five percent equity shares, Nigerian entrepreneurs 46 per cent equity shares, while the expected international strategic partners would have 49 equity shares.\n\nSirika stressed that FEC had given approval for the new national carrier. He said over 400,000 Nigerians participated in choosing the name, which was launched in 2018.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cToday (Wednesday) in Council, civil aviation presented two memoranda. One of the memos is approval of the outline business case for the establishment of the national carrier and this is the sixth time the memorandum appeared before Council. The sixth time, we got lucky to be passed by Council.\n\n\u201cThe structure of the proposed airline: government will be owning not more than five per cent. So five per cent is the maximum equity that government will take, then 46 per cent will be owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs. So, if you add that, it\u2019s 51 per cent.\n\n\u201cIt is 51 per cent majority shareholding by Nigerians and then 49 per cent will be held by strategic equity partner or partners that will be sourced during the procurement phase, which is the next phase.\n\n\u201cThis airline, if started, and within the first few years will generate about 70,000 jobs. These 70,000 jobs are higher than the total number of civil servants that we have in the country. Its importance had been well discussed so, I\u2019ll not go back to it. You had discussed it separately also on various fora as to the need for it.\u201d\n\nSirika noted African Union\u2019s agenda 2063 on the integration of the continent in terms of trade, and another flagship project, the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM).\n\n\u201cNow, the only way, the quickest way that you can integrate Africa is by air, because if you want to interconnect all the 54 nations of Africa, via rail or road, or waterways, which is even impossible, the quantum of money that you need to do all of these, the time it will take to develop this infrastructure, as well as the maintenance cost, is almost prohibitive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further said, \u201cThe name is Nigerian Air, which, of course, if you remember back in time, this was subject to national debate and 400,000 people participated, chose the name, the colour, the logo, everything and it was produced that time. It was launched also in Farnborough as far back as 2018.\n\n\u201cSo, the business case is a public document. It will be on our website, you can download it and we can give you copies. This airline will pick up and start, by God\u2019s grace, in or before April 2022.\u201d\n\nThe minister added that FEC also approved another memo for the award of contract for the provision of Automated Civil Aviation Regulatory Equipment, including software support and training, which will be located at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIn summary, this is a software that will allow all of the activities of civil aviation regulation to be done electronically on one platform, including payments, follow ups on personnel licensing, the medicals, the economic regulation of airlines, safety regulation of airlines and all other businesses within the envelope of civil aviation will be monitored by this single software.\n\n\u201cIt is called \u2018the truth machine\u2019 in quotation in Europe, because all of the truth of regulation of civilisation will appear on this platform, it\u2019s an extremely important software that the world has now come to terms with.\n\n\u201cThe contract was given to Messrs Arif Investment Nigeria Limited, who are representatives of Empik GmbH. This Empik are the creators of this software, one of its kind in the world, at the sum of N1,492,520,325, which will be including 7.5 per cent VAT and completion period of six months.\u201d\n\nEmma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
          "summary": "Nigeria\u2019s proposed national carrier, Nigeria Air, is set to begin flight operations by April 2022.\nSirika explained that in the new national carrier, the federal government will have five percent equity shares, Nigerian entrepreneurs 46 per cent equity shares, while the expected international strategic partners would have 49 equity shares.\nSirika stressed that FEC had given approval for the new national carrier.\nAccording to him, \u201cToday (Wednesday) in Council, civil aviation presented two memoranda.\nOne of the memos is approval of the outline business case for the establishment of the national carrier and this is the sixth time the memorandum appeared before Council.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Labour Rejects Proposed Fuel Price Hike",
          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has expressed dissatisfaction with the alleged comment by the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari that the price of petrol could jump as high as N320 and N340 from February 2022.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesay by NLC President Ayuba Wabba, the congress said the proposal by Kyari which he said was consequent on the plans by the federal government to remove subsidy on petrol was rejected.\n\nWabba said the union would maintain its rejection of deregulation so long as it was based on an import-driven model.\n\n\u201cThe response of the Nigeria Labour Congress is that what we are hearing is the conversation of the federal government with neo-liberal international monetary institutions. The conversation between the government and the people of Nigeria especially workers under the auspices of the trade union movement on the matter of fuel subsidy was adjourned sine die so many months ago.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our persuasion that the only benefit of deregulation based on import driven model is that Nigerian consumers will infinitely continue to pay high prices for refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cGiven the nationwide panic that has trailed the disclosure of the monologue within the corridors of government and foreign interests, the Nigeria Labour Congress wishes to posit that it continues to maintain its rejection of deregulation based on import driven model,\u201d he said.\n\nWabba said that the situation would definitely be compounded by the astronomical devaluation of the naira.\n\nHe said the NLC believes that it would be difficult to convince Nigerian workers why the country was the only country among the OPEC member countries that cannot produce its own refined petroleum products and was thus adopting the neo-liberal import production model of refined petroleum products.\n\nWabba also said that any attempt to compare the price of petrol in Nigeria to other countries would be set on a faulty premise as it would be akin to comparing apples to mangoes.\n\n\u201cThe contemplation by government to increase the price of petrol by more than 200 per cent is a perfect recipe for an aggravated pile of hyper-inflation and astronomical increase in the price of goods and services.\n\n\u201cThis will open a wide door to unintended social consequences such as degeneration of the current insecurity crises and possibly citizens\u2019 revolt. This is not an outcome that any sane Nigeria wishes for,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that federal government should consider some of the viable options which NLC feels can help.\n\nThe options suggested by NLC includes; insulating the domestic consumers from the market pressure brought about by the free fall of the Naira by making arrangement with contiguous refineries not far from Nigeria to swap crude oil with refined petroleum products; accelerating work on the rehabilitation of Nigeria\u2019s four major refineries which are all currently operating at near zero installed capacity; and establishing empirical data on the quantity of refined petroleum products consumed daily by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that this record remains a myth and a huge crater for all manner of official sleaze and leakages in the downstream petroleum sub-sector of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition, the NLC president said the argument that the complete surrender of the price of petrol to market forces would normalize the curve of demand and supply was wrong, given the current market realities with cooking gas, diesel and kerosene.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that these commodities which Nigeria can easily produce have been priced out of the reach of most Nigerian families with majority of our people resorting to tree felling and charcoal for their energy needs.\n\n\u201cFinally, we wish to warn that the bait by government to pay 40 million Nigerians N5000 as palliative to cushion the effect of astronomical increase in the price of petrol is comical, to say the least.\n\n\u201cThe total amount involved in this queer initiative is far more than the money government claims to spend currently on fuel subsidy. Apart from our concerns on the transparency of the disbursement given previous experiences with such schemes, we are wondering if government is not trying to rob Nigerians to pay Nigerians? Why pay me N5000 and then subject me to perpetual suffering?\n\n\u201cClearly, government thoughts on the so-called removal of fuel subsidy is cloudy and appears to be a \u201cpenny wise-pound foolish\u201d gamble.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the palliative offered by government will not cure the cancer that will befall the mass of our people who suffer the double jeopardy of hype-inflation while their salaries remain fixed.\n\n\u201cAs we had done several times, we call on the federal government to consider various options that can help Nigeria navigate out of the quagmire constructed by the failure of successive governments to embrace developmental governance and accountable leadership.\u201d\n\nEmma Okonji and Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
