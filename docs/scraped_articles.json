          "text": "Oluwatobiloba Jaiyeola\n\nA health expert at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, Dr. Olalekan Bonire, has cautioned Nigerians against urinating in swimming pools.\n\nUrinating in the swimming pool, he said, may not only be a bad habit but could be an act that put the health of others at risk.\n\nAccording to Dr. Bonire, urinating in the swimming pool could cause harmful effects on the lungs and eyes of those using the pool.\n\nThe surgical resident at the NOHI stated that if chlorine, a disinfectant agent added to pool water mixes with uric acid produced from the urine or sweat of swimmers, it could cause a chemical reaction that can lead to the production of harmful compounds.\n\nThese harmful substances created, he said include Trichloroamine and Cyanogen Chloride.\n\nDr. Bonire stated further that while the chemical compounds created are gaseous and could escape from the pool into the atmosphere before they are lost into the atmosphere, some of them can be inhaled by the swimmers inside the pool, and could cause lung diseases.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, Dr. Bonire said, \u201cChlorine is an agent that has anti-microbial properties and it is usually added to pool water to act as a disinfectant.\n\nHowever, uric acid is usually gotten from both the urine and sweat of human beings when they swim in the pool.\n\n\u201cThere is usually a chemical reaction that takes place between the chlorine introduced into the water with the uric acid in urine or sweat, when that happens; a chemical compound is formed inside the pool.\n\n\u201cThese two chemical compounds, trichloramine, and cyanogen chloride are inhalable and can be inhaled through the nostrils, causing lung diseases in the swimmers.

          "title": "Managing water retention by the body",
          "text": "Dr. Sylvester Ikhisemojie\n\nLast week, we talked at length about water retention around the heart. This week, we shall be discussing the malady of having water retained around the body. Water retention is a part of the whole complex of fluid retention.\n\nThis is a problem that takes place when the body\u2019s regulatory mechanisms for maintaining fluid levels within a certain range become disrupted or impaired so that the entire process is thrown out of order.\n\nTherefore, the circulatory system, the kidneys, hormones, and other smaller systems around the body help in ensuring this tight, important process. And if a problem arises from any of these systems mentioned above, fluid begins to accumulate around the body leading to body swelling and discomfort arising from them.\n\nSometimes, such swelling occurs only in a certain part of the body and is described thereby as a local affair. At other times, it is a more generalised affair pointing towards a more serious problem. When this happens, healthcare experts call the situation oedema.\n\nOedema (spelt edema by the Americans) can affect any part of the body for any combination of the reasons above. More often, people would have noticed this problem around their ankles apparently as a result of prolonged sitting or standing. In other situations, it is not so innocent and can therefore be an indication of something far more serious.\n\nWhen this situation arises in the hands and feet, the typical features that are obvious to everyone are the swelling, of course, the changes in the colour of the skin and the puffy nature that the tissues around those parts of the body assume. There may be aches around those parts as well and when a finger is pushed into them, the points of contact remain indented for a long time afterward.\n\nThe joints also progressively become stiff and pain can intervene. As the fluid accumulates, so it gets progressively reflected in the person\u2019s weight. Fluid can also accumulate in the brain causing cerebral oedema as a result of retaining too much of it or producing too much.\n\nCerebral oedema can occur when there has been an injury to the head also, in addition to a situation of having taken too much water. This can lead to headaches, blurring of the vision and loss of balance. Vomiting can occur as well. The person can have a convulsion or even go into a coma.\n\nToo much production of water in the brain can cause hydrocephalus, which is commonly seen in children. It can cause any of the above-mentioned features and compress the brain so badly that it is unable to grow in size as expected. This can be life-threatening.\n\nWater can also be retained in the lungs in a situation known as pulmonary oedema. Ditto for the sac around the heart as discussed last week causing problems like difficulty with breathing to develop, associated chest pain, inability to perform any meaningful physical tasks such as climbing a flight of stairs, cough and weakness can all occur mainly because the ability of the lungs to supply oxygen to the body is compromised.\n\nThe causes of these problems are quite diverse but it also begins at the level in the body where the most intricate exchange of materials between the cells and tissues takes place. That area is known as the micro-circulation where you have the capillaries which deliver fluids, nutrients and oxygen to the tissues.\n\nThe spent carbon dioxide, lactic acid and other waste products also return to the capillaries from where they go to the venules and then the veins. Most people believe that when something is wrong with their limbs, the veins are to blame but this is far from the truth because the problem lies with the capillaries which actually regulate the fluid balance. If these capillaries suffer physical damage, fluid leaks out of them into the surrounding tissues and cause oedema.\n\nAnother common cause of such an incident is when certain blood pressure medicines are used. They can cause damage to the wall of the capillaries because of changes in their pressure. Leakage of fluid as described above can then occur.\n\nMostly, the pumping actions of the heart help to maintain normal pressure within the blood vessels. If somebody\u2019s heart were to stop working effectively, the flow of blood around the body would slow down so that it becomes stagnant within the system. As this happens, it generates local increases in the pressure within the tissues and water can leak out from the blood into those tissues. Swelling then results.\n\nAnother closed system within the body that works in tandem with the vascular system is the lymphatic system which is a low-pressure system that carries white blood cells that constitute the first line of defence of the body against infections. However, problems like those same infections can block this system and render it ineffective as a drainage mechanism.\n\nCancer can similarly block its ability to carry the peculiar fluid known as lymph. As a result, the white fluid begins to accumulate in the area above the blockage. Over time, this can cause hideous swelling of the abdomen, legs, feet and even thighs.\n\nWhen the kidneys become unable to filter the blood of its waste products, such wastes will remain in the body and hold to ransom an obligatory amount of fluid to accompany them. They will, therefore, remain in the body and the person who has entered this stage of kidney failure would then realise that the legs, abdomen and face often become swollen as they wake up from sleep. Therefore, such swellings become an evident confirmation of kidney disease.\n\nThe same is true of pregnancy when as a result of hormone action and the increasing weight of the growing baby in the abdomen, there is an accumulation of fluids in the legs and the front aspect of the tummy.\n\nThe baby itself could reduce the amount of blood returning to the mother\u2019s heart through the legs because those vessels pass across the groin where the baby\u2019s head exerts pressure on them. This leads to the scenario described above. The other aspect is due to the effect of hormones causing the body to retain water. Usually, this is not a disease condition and often resolves after delivery.\n\nInadequate physical activity, obesity and laziness are other conditions that often lead to the situation of fluid accumulation around the body. Mostly, it is because the muscles of the calf are not recruited into the necessary pumping action that helps to return blood to the heart thus allowing fluid to accumulate.\n\nA key protein, called albumin, helps the body to maintain a certain pressure that keeps fluids within the vessels. When the body does not have enough of this protein as seen in chronic liver disease or in kwashiorkor, fluids begin to build up around the body. This is also the situation when persons go into disease states in which the protein stores are broken down and a deficiency state develops.\n\nLack of sufficient protein stores in the body causes the mobilisation of protein stores in the muscles and skin thereby causing a steady loss of weight and a shiny skin appearance as described in the second paragraph. Often, the recognition of what has led to such a situation makes it possible to treat those people who present with these features in the hospital.\n\nQuestions and answers\n\nDear doctor, thank you for the good work you\u2019re doing for humanity. May the Almighty Lord bless you and your family. Amen. I would like to seek your advice regarding the result of the investigation carried out at one of the diagnostic centres. The result/report is attached below. Thank you. Yours sincerely. [email protected]\n\nThank you very much for your words of appreciation and prayers. Good morning to you as well. The key things to know about haemorrhoids, also called piles, are as follows;\n\n.Does it bleed? The endoscopy you did says there\u2019s evidence of recent bleeding.\n\n. Does it come out of the anus?\n\n. If it comes out, does it go back by itself or do you have to push it back in?\n\nIf the answer to these questions is NO, then it can be managed with dietary changes and medications. If the answers are YES, then you will have to see a general surgeon for further examination and advice on available treatment options. Furthermore, this particular haemorrhoid is staged as a second degree. The endoscope could also have been used to \u201cburn\u201d the bleeding vessel and the matter would have ended for good. Since that\u2019s not the case, you may have to make do with changes in your diet plus the use of Daflon, a medication that helps to limit bleeding from piles.\n\nDear doctor, to God, be all the glory. Thanks so much for your column in the Sunday PUNCH. Your advice of July 10 on stammering wasn\u2019t fully expatiated as you spoke ONLY as a professional and did not include the faith angle which I understand, as science does not have regard for faith healing even though there are hundreds of testimonies to buttress this. Yes, doctor, there\u2019s no medical cure for stammering but faith does and speech therapists will also do to reduce the degree of missed words. Advise the stammerer to learn how to speak slowly. Never should he or she be in a hurry to pronounce words. In fact, years ago while I was in the UK, GPs often recommended a \u201chand pace\u201d which the patient holds and clicks on as he speaks. That slows him down and over time most of them improve and others are \u201ccured.\u201d Thanks once again and enjoy your week. God bless [email protected]\n\nThank you very much for your comments. Thank you also for your prayers. Your question was about treatment and cure and it was important to make it clear that none was available. But that\u2019s different from faith healing with which I have no training and with behavioural therapy which does not have consistent results. In teaching stammerers to slow down their speed of speaking, things might initially look good until they suffer some emotional challenge or a fit of anger, and everything they previously learnt unravels.\n\nDear doctor, thanks for the good work you are doing for the public. Recently, I have been finding it difficult to sign any document before I gain consciousness. I am 55 years old and I want to know what can cause it. Is there any drug sir? 0805xxxxxxx\n\nThank you very much for your kind words. If you are the one who typed this message by yourself, then you can definitely sign your documents. However, your reference to your state of consciousness is not at all clear. You could be suffering from some kind of craft palsy but you will need to be examined properly by a doctor to confirm or exclude this diagnosis. Once you have done so and the diagnosis is clear, there will be treatment available to treat you and you can then get to use the drug you have asked about.\n\nDear doctor, my left eye is closed and the left side of my mouth is stiff. So I mean that my left eye is not as wide open as my right eye and my mouth on the left side is not functioning well. What can I do? 0802xxxxxxx\n\nAll of these depend on how long you\u2019ve had this problem. Did you recently observe it? Are you on treatment for hypertension? How old are you? And what is your sex? The answers to the above questions will help us determine what might have happened to you and why you now have these observations. You could have had a stroke in which case you are probably on anti-hypertensive medications but will benefit additionally from physiotherapy. If on the other hand, this problem has been there from an early age, it may have resulted from an accident or a viral infection. Either way, you will need some physiotherapy rather than drugs.\n\nDear doctor, thank you so much for providing solutions to people\u2019s problems. Please, sir, my mother is 80 years old and a week ago she fell down at home and had a fracture in her wrist. She is with plaster of Paris now. She has had hypertension for more than 25 years and is presently on Busoprolol 2.5mg daily and Coveram plus 10mg/2.5mg/10mg daily also. She has recently been vomiting too even though she says she does not feel sick. The blood pressure now is 230/105 mmHg. I know that my blood pressure is too high. What should we do now? And what is the normal blood pressure for her age? 0802xxxxxxx\n\nThank you very much for your kind words. First, she must be reviewed as a matter of urgency by her doctors to increase the dose of those medications or change them completely. Second, she must be monitored closely to ensure she actually takes those medicines as they ought to be used. The vomiting she now experiences may be due to pressure changes within the brain caused essentially by blood pressure that has gone out of control and that\u2019s another reason for an urgent visit to her doctors. At her age, the blood pressure should be a minimum of 70-90 mmHg for the diastolic (lower reading) and a maximum of 95-145 mmHg systolic (upper one), so it is a wide range on either side.\n\nDear doctor, I woke up two days ago and found that I have serious pain in my throat. I think that is what is called sore throat. I cannot swallow anything at all and though I have been using Strepsils and Loratadine, there has been no improvement. The pain is serious. What should I do please? 0802xxxxxxx\n\nThese are the features of an upper respiratory tract infection and are probably due to tonsillitis. However, while you would most likely benefit from the use of an antibiotic and pain relief, it is wise for you to have your throat examined by a doctor for confirmation before you choose an antibiotic to use. Not all of them are good for an infection of this nature and not all will be suitable for your use either.\n\nDear doctor, I am the one who told you about the swelling and pain in my wife\u2019s thigh who also has a pregnancy of 11 weeks presently. We eventually went to a teaching hospital at Ilishan where she was admitted when a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was made and she was started on heparin and other drugs. All specialist doctors attending to her are physicians, obstetricians and cardiothoracic surgeons as I was informed. We are told that the treatment will take some time, maybe months. I just want to thank you for your prompt advice because we were told that if the thing had broken off from the leg, it could have been fatal. God bless you, sir. 0812xxxxxxx\n\nThank you for your feedback and for not delaying. Yes, typically, because of her current status it was necessary to involve all those experts you mentioned. This kind of treatment is called a multi-disciplinary approach to treatment and it gives you the best perspective. God bless you too and I wish you both well.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Dr. Sylvester Ikhisemojie\n\nLast week, we talked at length about water retention around the heart. This week, we shall be discussing the malady of having water retained around the body. Water retention is a part of the whole complex of fluid retention.\n\nThis is a problem that takes place when the body\u2019s regulatory mechanisms for maintaining fluid levels within a certain range become disrupted or impaired so that the entire process is thrown out of order.\n\nTherefore, the circulatory system, the kidneys, hormones, and other smaller systems around the body help in ensuring this tight, important process. And if a problem arises from any of these systems mentioned above, fluid begins to accumulate around the body leading to body swelling and discomfort arising from them.\n\nSometimes, such swelling occurs only in a certain part of the body and is described thereby as a local affair. At other times, it is a more generalised affair pointing towards a more serious problem. When this happens, healthcare experts call the situation oedema.\n\nOedema (spelt edema by the Americans) can affect any part of the body for any combination of the reasons above. More often, people would have noticed this problem around their ankles apparently as a result of prolonged sitting or standing. In other situations, it is not so innocent and can therefore be an indication of something far more serious.\n\nWhen this situation arises in the hands and feet, the typical features that are obvious to everyone are the swelling, of course, the changes in the colour of the skin and the puffy nature that the tissues around those parts of the body assume. There may be aches around those parts as well and when a finger is pushed into them, the points of contact remain indented for a long time afterward.\n\nThe joints also progressively become stiff and pain can intervene. As the fluid accumulates, so it gets progressively reflected in the person\u2019s weight. Fluid can also accumulate in the brain causing cerebral oedema as a result of retaining too much of it or producing too much.\n\nCerebral oedema can occur when there has been an injury to the head also, in addition to a situation of having taken too much water. This can lead to headaches, blurring of the vision and loss of balance. Vomiting can occur as well. The person can have a convulsion or even go into a coma.\n\nToo much production of water in the brain can cause hydrocephalus, which is commonly seen in children. It can cause any of the above-mentioned features and compress the brain so badly that it is unable to grow in size as expected. This can be life-threatening.\n\nWater can also be retained in the lungs in a situation known as pulmonary oedema. Ditto for the sac around the heart as discussed last week causing problems like difficulty with breathing to develop, associated chest pain, inability to perform any meaningful physical tasks such as climbing a flight of stairs, cough and weakness can all occur mainly because the ability of the lungs to supply oxygen to the body is compromised.\n\nThe causes of these problems are quite diverse but it also begins at the level in the body where the most intricate exchange of materials between the cells and tissues takes place. That area is known as the micro-circulation where you have the capillaries which deliver fluids, nutrients and oxygen to the tissues.\n\nThe spent carbon dioxide, lactic acid and other waste products also return to the capillaries from where they go to the venules and then the veins. Most people believe that when something is wrong with their limbs, the veins are to blame but this is far from the truth because the problem lies with the capillaries which actually regulate the fluid balance. If these capillaries suffer physical damage, fluid leaks out of them into the surrounding tissues and cause oedema.\n\nAnother common cause of such an incident is when certain blood pressure medicines are used. They can cause damage to the wall of the capillaries because of changes in their pressure. Leakage of fluid as described above can then occur.\n\nMostly, the pumping actions of the heart help to maintain normal pressure within the blood vessels. If somebody\u2019s heart were to stop working effectively, the flow of blood around the body would slow down so that it becomes stagnant within the system. As this happens, it generates local increases in the pressure within the tissues and water can leak out from the blood into those tissues. Swelling then results.\n\nAnother closed system within the body that works in tandem with the vascular system is the lymphatic system which is a low-pressure system that carries white blood cells that constitute the first line of defence of the body against infections. However, problems like those same infections can block this system and render it ineffective as a drainage mechanism.\n\nCancer can similarly block its ability to carry the peculiar fluid known as lymph. As a result, the white fluid begins to accumulate in the area above the blockage. Over time, this can cause hideous swelling of the abdomen, legs, feet and even thighs.\n\nWhen the kidneys become unable to filter the blood of its waste products, such wastes will remain in the body and hold to ransom an obligatory amount of fluid to accompany them. They will, therefore, remain in the body and the person who has entered this stage of kidney failure would then realise that the legs, abdomen and face often become swollen as they wake up from sleep. Therefore, such swellings become an evident confirmation of kidney disease.\n\nThe same is true of pregnancy when as a result of hormone action and the increasing weight of the growing baby in the abdomen, there is an accumulation of fluids in the legs and the front aspect of the tummy.\n\nThe baby itself could reduce the amount of blood returning to the mother\u2019s heart through the legs because those vessels pass across the groin where the baby\u2019s head exerts pressure on them. This leads to the scenario described above. The other aspect is due to the effect of hormones causing the body to retain water. Usually, this is not a disease condition and often resolves after delivery.\n\nInadequate physical activity, obesity and laziness are other conditions that often lead to the situation of fluid accumulation around the body. Mostly, it is because the muscles of the calf are not recruited into the necessary pumping action that helps to return blood to the heart thus allowing fluid to accumulate.\n\nA key protein, called albumin, helps the body to maintain a certain pressure that keeps fluids within the vessels. When the body does not have enough of this protein as seen in chronic liver disease or in kwashiorkor, fluids begin to build up around the body. This is also the situation when persons go into disease states in which the protein stores are broken down and a deficiency state develops.\n\nLack of sufficient protein stores in the body causes the mobilisation of protein stores in the muscles and skin thereby causing a steady loss of weight and a shiny skin appearance as described in the second paragraph. Often, the recognition of what has led to such a situation makes it possible to treat those people who present with these features in the hospital.\n\nQuestions and answers\n\nDear doctor, thank you for the good work you\u2019re doing for humanity. May the Almighty Lord bless you and your family. Amen. I would like to seek your advice regarding the result of the investigation carried out at one of the diagnostic centres. The result/report is attached below. Thank you. Yours sincerely. [email protected]\n\nThank you very much for your words of appreciation and prayers. Good morning to you as well. The key things to know about haemorrhoids, also called piles, are as follows;\n\n.Does it bleed? The endoscopy you did says there\u2019s evidence of recent bleeding.\n\n. Does it come out of the anus?\n\n. If it comes out, does it go back by itself or do you have to push it back in?\n\nIf the answer to these questions is NO, then it can be managed with dietary changes and medications. If the answers are YES, then you will have to see a general surgeon for further examination and advice on available treatment options. Furthermore, this particular haemorrhoid is staged as a second degree. The endoscope could also have been used to \u201cburn\u201d the bleeding vessel and the matter would have ended for good. Since that\u2019s not the case, you may have to make do with changes in your diet plus the use of Daflon, a medication that helps to limit bleeding from piles.\n\nDear doctor, to God, be all the glory. Thanks so much for your column in the Sunday PUNCH. Your advice of July 10 on stammering wasn\u2019t fully expatiated as you spoke ONLY as a professional and did not include the faith angle which I understand, as science does not have regard for faith healing even though there are hundreds of testimonies to buttress this. Yes, doctor, there\u2019s no medical cure for stammering but faith does and speech therapists will also do to reduce the degree of missed words. Advise the stammerer to learn how to speak slowly. Never should he or she be in a hurry to pronounce words. In fact, years ago while I was in the UK, GPs often recommended a \u201chand pace\u201d which the patient holds and clicks on as he speaks. That slows him down and over time most of them improve and others are \u201ccured.\u201d Thanks once again and enjoy your week. God bless [email protected]\n\nThank you very much for your comments. Thank you also for your prayers. Your question was about treatment and cure and it was important to make it clear that none was available. But that\u2019s different from faith healing with which I have no training and with behavioural therapy which does not have consistent results. In teaching stammerers to slow down their speed of speaking, things might initially look good until they suffer some emotional challenge or a fit of anger, and everything they previously learnt unravels.\n\nDear doctor, thanks for the good work you are doing for the public. Recently, I have been finding it difficult to sign any document before I gain consciousness. I am 55 years old and I want to know what can cause it. Is there any drug sir? 0805xxxxxxx\n\nThank you very much for your kind words. If you are the one who typed this message by yourself, then you can definitely sign your documents. However, your reference to your state of consciousness is not at all clear. You could be suffering from some kind of craft palsy but you will need to be examined properly by a doctor to confirm or exclude this diagnosis. Once you have done so and the diagnosis is clear, there will be treatment available to treat you and you can then get to use the drug you have asked about.\n\nDear doctor, my left eye is closed and the left side of my mouth is stiff. So I mean that my left eye is not as wide open as my right eye and my mouth on the left side is not functioning well. What can I do? 0802xxxxxxx\n\nAll of these depend on how long you\u2019ve had this problem. Did you recently observe it? Are you on treatment for hypertension? How old are you? And what is your sex? The answers to the above questions will help us determine what might have happened to you and why you now have these observations. You could have had a stroke in which case you are probably on anti-hypertensive medications but will benefit additionally from physiotherapy. If on the other hand, this problem has been there from an early age, it may have resulted from an accident or a viral infection. Either way, you will need some physiotherapy rather than drugs.\n\nDear doctor, thank you so much for providing solutions to people\u2019s problems. Please, sir, my mother is 80 years old and a week ago she fell down at home and had a fracture in her wrist. She is with plaster of Paris now. She has had hypertension for more than 25 years and is presently on Busoprolol 2.5mg daily and Coveram plus 10mg/2.5mg/10mg daily also. She has recently been vomiting too even though she says she does not feel sick. The blood pressure now is 230/105 mmHg. I know that my blood pressure is too high. What should we do now? And what is the normal blood pressure for her age? 0802xxxxxxx\n\nThank you very much for your kind words. First, she must be reviewed as a matter of urgency by her doctors to increase the dose of those medications or change them completely. Second, she must be monitored closely to ensure she actually takes those medicines as they ought to be used. The vomiting she now experiences may be due to pressure changes within the brain caused essentially by blood pressure that has gone out of control and that\u2019s another reason for an urgent visit to her doctors. At her age, the blood pressure should be a minimum of 70-90 mmHg for the diastolic (lower reading) and a maximum of 95-145 mmHg systolic (upper one), so it is a wide range on either side.\n\nDear doctor, I woke up two days ago and found that I have serious pain in my throat. I think that is what is called sore throat. I cannot swallow anything at all and though I have been using Strepsils and Loratadine, there has been no improvement. The pain is serious. What should I do please? 0802xxxxxxx\n\nThese are the features of an upper respiratory tract infection and are probably due to tonsillitis. However, while you would most likely benefit from the use of an antibiotic and pain relief, it is wise for you to have your throat examined by a doctor for confirmation before you choose an antibiotic to use. Not all of them are good for an infection of this nature and not all will be suitable for your use either.\n\nDear doctor, I am the one who told you about the swelling and pain in my wife\u2019s thigh who also has a pregnancy of 11 weeks presently. We eventually went to a teaching hospital at Ilishan where she was admitted when a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis was made and she was started on heparin and other drugs. All specialist doctors attending to her are physicians, obstetricians and cardiothoracic surgeons as I was informed. We are told that the treatment will take some time, maybe months. I just want to thank you for your prompt advice because we were told that if the thing had broken off from the leg, it could have been fatal. God bless you, sir. 0812xxxxxxx\n\nThank you for your feedback and for not delaying. Yes, typically, because of her current status it was necessary to involve all those experts you mentioned. This kind of treatment is called a multi-disciplinary approach to treatment and it gives you the best perspective. God bless you too and I wish you both well.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "How govt officials sabotaged power project over bribe \u2013 Adebayo, SDP presidential candidate",
          "text": "Prince Adebayo\n\nThe Social Democratic Party, SDP, standard flagbearer, Prince Adewole Adebayo, disclosed at the weekend that he brought in beneficial projects to the country at no cost, but that the current government\u2019s officials turned it down because it was not serving the personal interest of the officials.\n\nAdebayo, a successful lawyer and businessman, said he wanted to help with the power problems of the country, leading him to bringing the business initiative that would not only increase power generation in the country, but also provide about two million jobs at no cost to the federal government, but that government officials, rather than support and give all the necessary assistance, were asking for bribe.\n\nRead Also: Osun poll: Voice of slain Ige resounded from beyond the grave \u2014 Soyinka\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not saying this to embarrass anybody. Do you know that for three years I have been talking to the current government to help generate electricity and create about two million jobs with no kobo fro the government.\n\n\u201cIt costs absolutely nothing to the government. I have held meetings with them. I have met a minister countless times. I have even taken it to the highest level. They just won\u2019t let it be done. I am not faking it.\n\n\u201cI am just talking out of respect, but if they react to it and ask me to come and say it, I will mention the name, date and everything.\n\n\u201cI showed them the amount money the Europeans are coming in to invest. I told them that I am their lawyer. They were sending people to go and negotiate with them(what is in it for me?).\n\n\u201cThose ones got mad and were asking if my people were mental? They said we are coming to your country to help you generate electricity, we are not collecting any money from you, rather we are using our money,\u201d he stated.\n\nAdebayo said for the past 15 years, he has not experienced power outage from his Abuja office because.\n\n\u201cI got the office off the national grid. And that\u2019s 15 years back. I am not talking theory. These are things I have done and still doing.\n\n\u201cThat is why I said examine people\u2019s lives before giving your votes. These kind of solutions don\u2019t and won\u2019t make minister rich.\n\n\u201cA minister who signs an agreement with a foreign investment to come and do electricity in Nigeria gains nothing personally, it is only the country that gains and these people are not in government to gain.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong with our country. We are the problems to ourselves.\u2019\n\nAdebayo, while asking questions on Twitter platform conversation with hashtag #TalkingJobson,#GettingitrightNig with Prince Adewole Adebayo, anchored by human rights activist, Segun Awosanya popularly known as Sega, said if elected into office, he was going to provide 30 million jobs, at the first instance.\n\nHe added that he secured the agreement to provide jobs with 2,000 American companies who are willing and ready to come over to Nigeria to establish and provide employment.\n\n\u201cI am already preparing what to be done when I get elected, not looking for what to do when you get into office. I am employer of labour. Kaftan Television, the pharmaceutical company, the farm are there with people working there.\n\n\u201cCurrently, I am training about 500 random people in green energy. They are being trained by four companies. These are people who have never seen solar panel before.\n\n\u201cThey are getting physical and remote training from the manufacturers. By the time they are done, they can become trainers trainers, and before you know it, you will see how the sector would boom. Imagine if I was training 500,000, you can see that the jobs are already being created.\u201d\n\nRegarding the perennial insecurity in the country and what he would do if elected, Adebayo said the Commander in Chief can never be innocent any time security is implicated, because according to him, the president and indeed, every president has the ability to reach his troop anywhere it is located in the country.\n\nSaid he: \u201cA soldier who is at the check point takes his final order from the president. When I was going g to Ekiti State during the governorship election, I was not allowed to enter Ekiti because the soldiers stopped me from entering which was a shock to me.\n\n\u201cNone of us, including my convoy, was allowed into Ekiti. My security called the captain who said sir, we have order that you should not enter. So if you contact the governor\u2026\n\n\u201cI said I must contact Fayemi(Governor of Ekiti state) before I enter Ekiti, God forbid. He said that is our order. Luckily enough, I had the contact of the Chief of Defence Staff, called his office, somebody in his office answered.\n\n\u201cI said I am the presidential candidate of my party. I am going to Ekiti for a rally and I have been held here for more than an hour. He asked by who? I said soldiers. He said it is not possible. I gave the phone to the captain.\n\n\u201cHe told him, have you lost your mind; what concerns army with elections? Let the man go. He gave me a salute and I went my way. The Chief of Defence Staff is one step away from Buhari. It means the Commander in Chief has effective control. \u201cSo he cannot be innocent when security is implicated, because all the information at his disposal.\u201d",

          "text": "The Social Democratic Party, SDP, standard bearer, Prince Adewole Adebayo, has advised the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and its flagbearer, Ashiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, to be careful in the choices made and would make so that unnecessary tension is not created in the country.\n\nAdebayo said the choice of Tinubu\u2019s vice presidential candidate portrayed him as insensitive.\n\nHe said a leader must be sensitive to the sensibilities of his people even if he is looking for competence to give him results, but knowing how diverse the country is, that sensibility must be taken into account.\n\nRead Also: Osun poll: Voice of slain Ige resounded from beyond the grave \u2014 Soyinka\n\n\u201cI am not working either secretly or openly for the APC. But let us have politics of reasoning. I have never believed ethnicity and religion should be basis for politics.\n\n\u201cI know leadership is about accommodation and because the president of Nigeria is not like the Prime Minister of Britain, you must be sensitive to the sensibilities of the people, even if you are looking for competence to give you results, you must still remember the sensibilities of rhe people, especially knowing how diverse the country is.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me about the person who made a Muslim/Muslim ticket choice, I will say he is not a sensitive leader and if he keeps making subsequent appointments like that, he will put the country under tension,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe, however, said having the two religions as one ticket isn\u2019t a guarantee of good government.\n\n\u201cSo Nigerians should not congratulate those who have the Christain/Muslim or Muslim/Chriatin ticket because a lot of Nigerians are neither chriatains nor Muslims.\n\n\u201cIf Nigerians have 100 Muslim\u2019s and 100 Christains, why is the country like this? None of those who bear christain or Muslim\u2019s names have ruled according to the dictate of their religions because there is no where in the two religions where it is stated that you steal your people blind, kill people indiscriminately,\u201d he said.\n\nAdebayo who was on the Twitter platform conversation with hashtag #TalkingJobson,#GettingitrightNig with Prince Adewole Adebayo, anchored by human rights activist, Segun Awosanya, popularly known as Sega, advised the youths to be circumspect in the choice of who to be their president come 2023.\n\nHe said the trend currently on social media was not different from the euphoria that heralded the Muhammadu Buhari administration in 2015, which is regrettable.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSome of my friends who are in the third force today, were backing Buhari even though I warned them, nobody listened. They said anything but Jonathan.\n\n\u201cI told them that I won\u2019t support Jonathan neither would I vote for Buhari. I have been laughing at them since then. PDP has committed sacrilege. APC is an abomination to the nation.\n\n\u201cAnybody can start campaign online and create anything to trend or even pay firms to have thousands mentions. A man of principle won\u2019t be persuaded by that. As we go down the line, a lot of people will know better,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the touted third force which he is spareheading, is a total break from the past.\n\nThe third force is a coalition of many parties outside the two major parties. That third force, Adebayo said he doesn\u2019t see Peter Obi, the Labour Party presidential candidate, in it.\n\n\u201cWe, the third force, are open to coalition, working together, because it is the right thing to do. The Labour candidate, of course, isnt a third force. That is why I am not joining in any jamboree.\n\n\u201cThe policies of the candidate was anti-labour when he was governor. Labour was on strike for more than one year when he was governor. He was one of the governors who refused to pay minimum wage.\n\n\u201cHe is not a bad guy, because he has good qualities. He is PDP. He was national coordinator of the Jonathan campaign for the South in 2011. He was vice presidential candidate of the same party in 2015. He was also vying for the same party\u2019s ticket, until four days to its primaries. He was in PDP until six weeks ago.\n\n\u201cYou cannot say he is a third force. Would you say if Tinubu didn\u2019t get the APC ticket and he crossed over to SDP as was being speculated, he automatically becomes third force? If Wike decides to leave PDP and join SDP, he is a third force?\n\n\u201cThe armed forces cannot be holding meeting now and the fire service joins. They will tell them, no you are not a member. Yes, they all wear uniforms but it cannot be a member.\n\n\u201cIf my mother is holding a meeting women Catholic meeting, I cannot join because I am not a woman,\u201d Prince Adebayo said.\n\nVanguard News",

You need to be patient. Since you got the result, wait for me too to receive it. You can get back to me and I will be willing to talk about it.\n\n\u201cUntil I hear from INEC formally or my people in the control room confirm that it is the result, of course, I will abide by it.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Lateef Dada, Osogbo, Ndubuisi Orji, Paul Osuyi, Asaba,Okwe Obi, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja, Rose Ejembi, Makurdi\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate and former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, have bragged that the victory of Senator Ademola Adeleke, the party\u2019s candidate in the Osun State election, was a reflection of the outcome of 2023 general poll.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, officially declared Adeleke winner of Saturday\u2019s keenly contested governorship poll in Osun State\n\nReturning officer for the election, Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, who is the Vice Chancellor, University of Lagos, said the PDP candidate polled a total of 403,371 votes to defeat the sitting governor, Gboyega Oyetola, of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who scored a total of 375,027 votes. Adeleke won with a margin of 28,344 votes. He swept 17 of the 30 local government areas of the state, while Oyetola topped in 13 local governments. But the duo had narrow winning margins in majority of the local government areas they won, respectively.\n\nThe candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), Kehinde Atanda, who scored 10,104 votes came a distant third, while the Accord candidate, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi came fourth with 4,515 votes. A former deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, Yussuf Lasun, of Labour Party (LP) came fifth with 2,729 votes. A total of 15 political parties fielded candidates for the election.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP), in its reaction, said the victory of its candidate in the Osun governorship poll, was a referendum on the APC.\n\nPDP\u2019s national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, in a statement, yesterday, said the people of Osun has spoken through the governorship poll.\n\nAyu expressed confidence that the rest of the country would also reject the APC in the 2023 polls.\n\nThe PDP leader said with the Osun victory, the party\u2019s next move is to regain the presidency in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cThis election was a referendum on the disastrous APC stewardship, and proves conclusively that Nigerians want PDP back. And, indeed, PDP is coming!\u201d\n\nAyu alleged that the Osun State government did everything it could to frustrate the opposition party, prior to last weekend\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cThis included denying us the use of any public facility in the state capital for our mega-rally. We had to use the party\u2019s state secretariat. As it were, we couldn\u2019t have access to the stadium, but we had access to the people\u2019s hearts, loyalty and votes. The convincing win of 403, 371 against governor Oyetola\u2019s 375, 027 is ample proof of that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku in his congratulatory message to the governor-elect titled, \u2018The ship of hope is already at the harbour\u2019, said the referendum on the administration of the APC had commenced with the verdict of the people of Osun State in electing Senator Adeleke.\n\nThe former vice president added that the ship of hope was at the harbour under the umbrella of the PDP, adding that the party would intensify the work to ensure the uproot of vestiges of bad governance and false hopes towards the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable that Nigerians will reward the APC for the failings of the last seven years. And in a state like Osun, for example, its been a long time since the people last felt the effect of good governance\u2026The Imole (light) that has started to shine from Osun shall soon have a national coverage. One more good thing about the victory in Osun is that it has provided a catalyst for the PDP to see the opportunity when the party works together in unity,\u201d the former VP said.\n\nDelta State Governor and vice presidential candidate of the PDP, Ifeanyi Okowa, said the victory of Senator Ademola Adeleke in Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Osun State was a signpost of the determination of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) to rescue Nigeria in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nOkowa said Adeleke\u2019s victory was the beginning of the rescue mission of Nigeria by his party.\n\nThe governor, in a congratulatory statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Olisa Ifeajika, described the election of Adeleke as \u201cthe affirmation of Osun people\u2019s will\u201d and called on Nigerians to always stand for good leaders with the interest of the people at heart.",

          "text": "By Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nStrong indications that fuel markets may have settled for an unofficial deregulation with majority of filling stations selling Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly called petrol above the officially approved pump price of N165 per litre. Their decision may not be unconnected with what they termed Nigeria\u2019s harsh economic realities which have made sale of petrol at the official retail price of N165 per litre unrealistic.\n\nFindings by Daily Sun across some filling stations in Lagos showed that majority of the filling stations have now adopted different price models.\n\nWhile some filling stations have changed the price on their meters to reflect the current selling prices, others have left theirs to show the approved retail price of N165 per litre only to dispense at above the displayed price.\n\nFor instance, the Mobil filling station on Agidingbi sold a litre of petrol at N170 per litre on Friday and that was evidently displayed on their meters.\n\nThe development was also the same at Enyo filling station at Chisco bus stop, in Lekki, which now sells for N170 per litre, with Eterna filling station at Jankade bus stop Lekki, selling at N180per litre. Also Mobil Filing station, by Osapa London, Lekki sold at selling at N170 per litre.\n\nAll the above three filling stations in Lekki have had the new prices reflected on their meters while the big board which normally have their prices displayed for motorists to see have equally been changed.\n\nAs at yesterday morning (Sunday), the Mobil filling station before Otedola bridge sold at N170 per litre. This was boldly written on their overhead board for everyone to see and equally displayed on their meters. Also, the Petrocam filling station in Ejigbo, Lagos sold at N177 per litre last Thursday.\n\nAs at last Friday, the Mobil filling station on Charity road in Abule-Egba, sold a litre of petrol at N180 per litre but displayed N165 on its meters, Conoil on Dayo Adeniji street is selling at N170 per litre , Northwest Filling station in Anthony is also selling at N170 per litre while Seabird Vivid on Barracks-Command road in Ipaja sold at N195 per litre.\n\nHowever, the situation was different at the Oando filling station in Omole Estate at Saturday as it sold a litre of petrol at the approved retail price of N165 per litre. The unofficial deregulation stand of fuel retailers confirms the posture of the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria(MOMAN) which last week, said the regulated N165 pump price for petrol, was no longer realistic.\n\nChairman, MOMAN, Mr. Olumide Adeosun, who spoke Wednesday during a virtual consumer protection workshop for Oil Marketers by the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) had said the current retail price was no longer realistic.\n\nAdeosun, who was reacting to the lingering fuel scarcity across the country, blamed the situation on the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine which had disrupted global energy supply distribution.\n\nThe MOMAN chairman likened the current situation to the COVID-19 pandemic era with some countries moving to halt exportation of petrol in favour of their own national energy securities.\n\nHe maintained that it would be difficult to enforce any kind of price control mechanism on marketers who had to slightly adjust their prices based on how much they bought products from the depots.\n\nThe MOMAN chairman said the way forward was a phased deregulation of PMS by the Federal Government to reduce the shock on consumers.\n\nAdeosun said the gradual price deregulation should be followed with targeted palliatives in the areas of transportation and agricultural subsidies to the public to ease implementation.\n\nHe said the huge amount spent on petrol subsidy over the years would have been deployed to other critical areas that could have reduced the impact of the current energy crisis on Nigerians.\n\nAdeosun empathised with Nigerians and the Federal Government who had been bearing the huge subsidy cost, adding that the government was working assiduously to mitigate the effects of the situation on the economy.\n\nHe said as the nation was moving towards full deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector, MOMAN would continue to collaborate with the FCCPC to ensure the protection of the rights of consumers.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested a 27-year-old drug queen, Mrs. Opoola Mujidat, for planting drugs concealed in fetish bowls, containing scary native black soap and sponge on two Oman-bound male passengers, at the departure hall of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nThe passengers: Raji Babatunde Kazeem and Akinbobola Omoniyi, were travelling together to Oman, Middle East, on Ethiopian Airlines flight, on Monday, July 11, when they were intercepted by NDLEA operatives at the airport.\n\nIn other operations, the agency intercepted 1, 029.5kg shunk in a natural gas tank; 524, 720 tabs of opioids in Nasarawa, Adamawa and Kaduna states.\n\nThe Director, Media and Advocacy, NDLEA, Mr. Femi Babafemi, in a statement, in Abuja, yesterday, said a search of their luggages revealed wraps of cannabis sativa hidden in bowls of native black soap and sponge, packed into a bag containing food items, which Kazeem was carrying.\n\nBoth Kazeem and Omoniyi immediately alerted the anti-narcotic officers that Mujidat, who was still within the vicinity, gave the bag containing the illicit substance to them at the airport. She was promptly arrested by operatives of the anti- narcotics agency. The lady accepted responsibility and stated that she brought the luggage for the two passengers to give to her husband in Oman.\n\nMujidat, who hails from Oyo East LGA in Oyo State, confessed during preliminary interview that the bag containing the food items were packed by her with different items, including the black soap used to conceal the illicit substance.\n\nElsewhere, NDLEA operatives have intercepted over 91 jumbo bags of cannabis, in Nasarawa State, weighing 1,029.5kg concealed in a truck mounted natural gas tank by Doma road, around 500 Housing Estate, Lafia. A 52-year-old suspect, Ernest Ojieh, was arrested in connection with the seizure on Saturday, July 9.\n\nThis was barely four days after operatives at Agwan Doka, Lafia, seized 38 big bags of the same substance with a total weight of 367kg. Two suspects: Abdullahi Iliyasu, 30, and Bashir Mohammed, 29, were arrested over the seizure.\n\nIn Kaduna and Adamawa, over half a million pills of pharmaceutical opioids were seized and suspects arrested in raid operations across the two states. In Kaduna alone, 294,400 pills of tramadol and diazepam were seized from Shaban Nasir, Aminu Usman and Shamsudeen Hussaini, along Abuja-Kaduna express road, as well as Sa\u2019idu Yahaya and Umar Abubakar, during a follow up operation in Kano, all on Friday, July 15.\n\nIn the same vein, over 227,000 different grades of tramadol tablets were seized during the raid of a patent medicine store, at Sabon Layi, close to Mubi main market, Mubi North LGA, Adamawa State, on Sunday, July 3.\n\nRecovered from the store where a suspect, Nasiru Abubakar, 27, was arrested include tramadol 250mg (aka Boko Haram); Royal tramadol 225mg (aka Vectra); Tramaking tramadol 225mg (aka Jan Dara); tramadol 200mg (aka Dogari); and tramadol 100mg (aka Green), among others. Another suspect, Idris Adamu, 25, was also arrested in a shoe shop in the same Sabon Layi, where over 5,000 tablets of tramadol 225mg were recovered from him.\n\nWhile commending the officers and men of the MMIA, Nasarawa, Kaduna and Adamawa commands for the arrests, seizures and their dexterity, Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (retd) warned the drug cartels that no matter the ingenuity of their modes of concealment, the dedicated workforce of the agency will always expose them and their tricks.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nBarring any last minute change, the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) may institute court cases against defecting National Assembly members, and those threatening to ditch the party.\n\nThis is as the party may have concluded plans to carry out a major purge which may see the suspension of erring members.\n\nThe National Assembly is resuming on Tuesday with lawmakers, predominantly from the APC, likely to announce their defection to opposition platforms.\n\nThe lawmakers had expressed displeasure over the outcome of the party\u2019s primaries in which most of them lost out with some alleging they were schemed out by their governors.\n\nBuhari had persuaded the aggrieved members not to leave the party, assuring that their grievances would be addressed.\n\nFollowing the meeting with Buhari, APC NWC, however, threatened that the defecting lawmakers would forfeit their seats.\n\nSince the conclusion of the primaries, over eight APC senators have defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Labour Party (LP) and other political parties.\n\nSpeaking on a television programme, APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, claimed that he was unaware of plans by National Assembly members to defect.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of the defection. In fact, it is fake news. This is a political season and not all politicians will accept the outcome of everything,\u201d he said.\n\nOn insecurity, he said the ruling party had not achieved much, adding that the government would not give up, but would continue to devise means to solve them.\n\nTo justify his position, he argued that even the United States of America, still grapples with insecurity.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the APC would win next year\u2019s presidential elections. He denied working against the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, during the primary.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that the move to get rid of some members is being proposed by the leadership of the party following the counsel of some stakeholders, especially governors, who are worried that the crack in the party if not cemented could lead to its defeat in the 2023 poll.\n\nSources who disclosed this to Daily Sun, said the proposal must be backed by President Muhammadu Buhari before it could be implemented.\n\n\u201cThe plan may, however, hit the rocks, if President Buhari, who is the leader of the party, doesn\u2019t approve the move,\u201d said the source.\n\nHe explained that the move was to enable the National Working Committee (NWC), purge the party and remove some bad eggs before the powers conferred on it by the National Executive Committee (NEC) expires later this month.\n\nIn April, few days after his election, National Chairman of APC, Abdullahi Adamu, had suspended top bureaucrats in APC. No cogent reasons were given by the party for taking the action. The same month, APC ceded its powers to the party\u2019s NWC. The action was taken to curb the excesses of ex-governors and leaders bent on ego trips in their respective domains.\n\nThe party had said it was vesting the power of the NEC in the NWC for 90 days, during which it would take decisions on its behalf in the interim, without the need to defer to NEC.\n\nA source said the decision was taken before Osun State governorship election. He, however. said the poor outing of the party in Osun, may have given more life to the move and the pressure being mounted on President Buhari to sanction the proposal.\n\n\u201cBuhari\u2019s approval is needed because of the inclusion of some of his ministers and other cabinet members who are believed to be sabotaging the APC, ahead of the 2023 presidential elections,\u201d the source said.\n\nThough he declined to list those who maybe affected by the purge, it was learnt that ministers, National Assembly members and some former governors have been pencilled down for disciplinary action by the party.\n\nSpeaking on the senatorial ambition of the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Senator Godswill Akpabio of the North West Senatorial District of Akwa Ibom State, he said: \u201cInasmuch as they contested within the stipulated time instituted by the All Progressives Congress (APC), they will participate in the election.\u201d",

Voters conducted themselves well.\n\n09:04am\n\nVoters at their polling units\n\n07:10am\n\nOyetola, Adeleke Go Head to Head as Osun State Votes\n\n*PDP claims APC planning to rig election\n\n*INEC promises free, fair poll\n\n*Police deploy 21,000; NSCDC positions 11,226 men\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo\n\nAfter weeks of acrimonious campaigns, the people of Osun State will today decide whether Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) should continue for another four years or elect a new man to succeed him.\n\nFifteen political parties are fielding candidates for today\u2019s election, but it is evidently a straight fight between Oyetola and Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThis would be the second time the two candidates would be meeting. Both Oyetola and Adeleke contested for the Osun governorship position in 2018, which Oyetola won after a rerun.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured the people of a free and fair poll and spent most of yesterday moving sensitive voting materials to the 332 registration areas across the 30 local government areas of the state.\n\nThe election umpire restated its readiness to announce the result in less than 12 hours after the poll.\n\nThe two leading political parties are desperate to win today\u2019s contest to signpost readiness to dominate the 2023 elections.\n\nTo underpin the importance of the poll, the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu led a final campaign for Oyetola last Tuesday. He was accompanied by party chieftains like the party\u2019s National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, vice presidential candidate, Kashim Shettima and several APC governors.\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar also led a powerful campaign team to the state on Thursday assuring the people that Adeleke is sure of victory in the poll, and that \u201can end has come to the reign of the ruling APC\u201d in the country.\n\nAtiku was accompanied by the National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu; Vice-presidential candidate of the party and Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and some governors of the PDP.\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high across Osun State, with voters bitterly divided among the two leading candidates.\n\nFear of violence was palpable, considering the rancorous campaigns before the poll.\n\nThe allegations by the PDP that the APC was working to rig the poll dominated discussion across the state.\n\nPolice Deploy 21,000 Operatives\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba has assured Nigerians that today\u2019s poll would be violence-free.\n\nBaba, who spoke last Tuesday, said to accomplish the task, no fewer than 21,000 operatives would be deployed across the state.\n\nBaba warned that the police would not allow any person or group of persons, no matter how highly and lowly placed in the society to derail the electoral process, and vowed that \u201cvote-buying or any form of inducement would not be allowed as they remained serious offences.\u201d\n\nThe IG adds: \u201cThe police will be deployed to protect the facilities of INEC and its personnel. This deployment is not meant to intimidate any law-abiding citizens; rather it is to deter misguided elements that may threaten the conduct of the election and violate the electoral act. It also serves as a strong warning that government is determined to protect the citizens.\u201d\n\nThe IG has also deployed the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigation Department, DIG Johnson Kokumo, for the governorship election.\n\nAlso deployed to the state are four Assistant Inspectors-General of Police, four Commissioners of Police, 15 Deputy Commissioners of Police, and 30 Assistant Commissioners of Police.\n\nBaba also moved the Osun State Commissioner of Police, Olawale Olokode (temporarily) to the Force Headquarters until the conclusion of the election.\n\nNSCDC deploys 11,226\n\nSimilarly, the Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Dr. Ahmed Audi, has deployed 11,226 officers and men to cover the 3,763 polling units, collation centres, flash points, as well as critical national assets and infrastructure during today\u2019s poll.\n\nThe deployed personnel were drawn from the national headquarters and nine state commands; Osun, Ondo, Ekiti, Oyo, Ogun, Lagos, Kwara, Kogi and Edo to supply manpower for the election.\n\nThe NSCDC said the objectives of the corps in the election were to create a secured environment for its successful conduct and enhance the general security in the state before, during and after the election.\n\nOyetola and Adeleke\n\nThe leading candidates for today\u2019s poll remain Oyetola and Adeleke.\n\nOyetola, who is seeking reelection for a second term, enjoys the privileges that come with being incumbent. He is also enjoying the perks of \u2018federal might\u2019 and the backing of Tinubu.\n\nHis chances in today\u2019s poll has been brightened by his good relationship with Osun civil servants. Unlike his predecessor who owed salaries for months, Oyetola has been consistent with salary payment and also improved the welfare of the civil servants. All of these, pundits argue, will work in his favour.\n\nHowever, the cold war between Oyetola and Rauf Aregbesola, his predecessor, may reduce the former\u2019s votes in LGAs controlled by the latter.\n\nThe disharmony within the party left it with factions \u2013 the Ileri Oluwa group is loyal to Oyetola while TOP pledges allegiance to Aregbesola.\n\nNotwithstanding, Oyetola stands a very good chance of getting a second term today.\n\nAdeleke, the \u201cdancing senator\u201d, says he is determined to recover his \u201cstolen mandate\u201d from the APC. He is in the race with a big war chest. He also has a broad support base.\n\nA lot of people from Adeleke\u2019s Osun West Senatorial District, which is yet to produce a governor since the fourth republic, are agitated. Adeleke will gain from this, but may not be enough to make him governor.\n\nThe crisis in Osun PDP may also affect Adeleke\u2019s chances. The party is also divided into factions. One is recognised by the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) while the other is backed by Olagunsoye Oyinlola, a former governor of the state, whose political sway in the state cannot be overlooked.\n\nStrengths on Senatorial Basis\n\nOyetola looks good to win Osun Central where he is from. Besides, many prominent Osun political stakeholders are from this senatorial zone, and they belong to the APC. They include former governor, Chief Bisi Akande and the current Senator, Ajibola Basiru, who is also the Oyetola campaign chairman. Osun Central is good-to-go for Oyetola.\n\nAdeleke is from Osun West, with Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi of the Accord Party. Here, Adeleke will have an upper hand, but not enough to make him governor. Oyetola will still get substantial votes here.\n\nIn Osun East, Adeleke will benefit greatly from the influence of Francis Fadahunsi, the Senator representing the area, who is a PDP member. Oyetola\u2019s good performance during his first term will give him victory in Osun East.\n\nINEC Chairman Charges Staff on Good Conduct\n\nThe Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu yesterday charged the staff of the Commission to remain neutral and repeat the transparent conduct exhibited in Ekiti State governorship election four weeks ago.\n\nIn a statement he signed, the INEC chairman, said: \u201cExactly 27 days ago, we conducted and concluded the Ekiti Governorship Election that was widely adjudged to be free, fair, credible, and inclusive.\n\n\u201cThe feat was happily an elongation of the earlier successes recorded in Edo and Ondo states on 15th September and 10th October 2020, and in Anambra State on 6th November 2021. The sheer determination, resilience, and competence displayed by all of you, our members of staff, made it possible for the Commission to achieve these lofty goals.\u201d\n\nHe reminded the staff of the commission of the need to maintain the same impartial conduct exhibited in the other states.\n\nYakubu said: \u201cI have assured our stakeholders and the people of Osun State that the Commission will not do anything to the advantage or disadvantage of any political party or candidate. We have made adequate arrangements for the election. We have promised a level playing field for all. The security agencies have assured us of safety.\n\n\u201cThe people of Osun State and Nigerians will understandably hold us to our promise on election day. They will observe our attitude and behaviour from the opening to the closing of polls. They will particularly observe our management of the election results and measure the extent of our adherence to the extant laws through every stage of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of commitment and professionalism, remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour. You must also stick to the Oath of Neutrality to which we have all subscribed. I have the confidence in your ability to consolidate on our recent successes.\u201d\n\nPDP Claims APC Planning to Rig Election\n\nThe PDP yesterday alleged an orchestrated plot by the APC \u201cto derail the nascent democratic process by compromising the integrity and sabotaging the will and desire of the people for a free, fair, transparent and credible electoral process\u201d in today\u2019s election in Osun State.\n\nThe party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba alleged that the APC had accentuated its rigging programme by deploying billions of naira to compromise some security and electoral officers to intimidate voters, manipulate electoral process and inordinately favour Oyetola, against the will of the people.\n\nThe PDP alleged that huge money had been funneled to certain compromised security and INEC officials \u201cto execute this ignoble scheme.\u201d\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cthe said INEC and security officials are reported to have been bought over to, among other things, criminally assist and provide cover for APC agents to prosecute a well-oiled vote buying and violence-triggering scheme.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba adds. \u201cOur Party has information on how two prominent APC governors from the South-west, a former APC National Chairman from the South-south, certain federal minister and a particular member of the House of Assembly from Lagos State are coordinating the release of billions of naira to bribe electoral and security officials, as well as fund heavily armed thugs imported from Lagos, Ondo, Ogun and other South-west states to unleash violence and help the APC to rig the election.\u201d\n\nThe PDP said that it had however been made aware that some patriotic INEC and Police officials vehemently rejected the poisonous offer by the APC.\n\nThe PDP called on the IG and Yakubu \u201cto take immediate decisive steps to check the activities of police and INEC officials deployed to Osun State so as to avert a breakdown of Law and Order, especially given the manifest determination of the people of Osun State to resist the APC on its evil scheme.\u201d",

          "title": "Rising Inflation Thrust Money Supply to N48.87trn in June, Highest Since 2010 \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Kayode Tokede\n\nLatest data released by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has revealed that money supply in the economy recorded the highest growth in 10 years, gaining 9.14 per cent or N4.46 trillion Year-till-Date (YtD) to N48.87 trillion in June of this year.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) last Thursday in its Consumer Price Index (CPI) disclosed that Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate reached a 65-month high of 18.6 per cent in June 2022 from 17.71 per cent in May. Inflation had opened January 2022 at 15.60 per cent.\n\nCPI measures the average change over time in price of goods and services consumed by the general public for day-to-day living i.e it measures the inflation rate.\n\nThe significant increase in money supply reflects increasing demand for cash by the general public caused by continued rise in prices of goods and services, evidenced by the fifth consecutive months rise in the inflation this year.\n\nAccording to THISDAY findings, the surge in money supply is driven by increased borrowing by the federal government and commercial banks\u2019 lending to the private sector propelled by the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) policy by the CBN.\n\nThe \u201cCredit and Money\u201d supply data by the apex bank revealed that money supply (M3) grew by 23.68 per cent to N48.87 trillion in June 2022 from N39.51 trillion reported June 2021.\n\nMoney supply is defined as total stock of money in an economy comprising currency (notes and coins) and deposit with commercial banks in Nigeria and it consists of broad money (M2) and narrow money (M1).\n\nFurther analysis of money supply also showed that major components M2 and M1 recorded sharp increases in June 2022.\n\nAccording to the CBN data, M2, rose by 25.56 per cent or N9.93 trillion in its Year-on-Year (YoY) growth to N48.8 trillion as of June 2022 from N38.86 trillion ending June 2021, while M1 increased by 27.26 per cent or N4.37 trillion YoY to N20.39 trillion as of June 2022 from N16.02 trillion reported June 2021.\n\nAlso contributing to the huge growth in money supply in six months of 2022, is the increase in credit to the private sector and government during the period.\n\nThe CBN data showed that credit to the government rose by 55 per cent or N6.4trillion to N17.99 trillion as of June from N11.59 trillion in the corresponding period of 2021.\n\nFurther analysis showed that the growth in credit to the government was 34.86 percentage points higher than the growth in credit to the private sector as of June 2022.\n\nThe CBN reported 20.37 per cent or N6.64 trillion increase in credit to private to N39.27 trillion as of June 2022 from N32.64 trillion reported in June 2021.\n\nWith the CBN retaining 65 per cent minimum Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR), among other regulating policies to boost commercial banks lending, credit to private sector between January and June 2022 has added N4.09 trillion and reached its all-time high.\n\nWith the latest figure, it means that credit to the private sector in YtD performance has added 11.61 per cent or N6.08 trillion from N35.18 trillion reported by the CBN in January 2022.\n\nAccording to the CBN, credit to the private sector was N35.99 trillion in February and hits N36.47 trillion in March 2022. It crossed the N37 trillion mark in April to N37.68 trillion.\n\nThe CBN in its money and credit statistics revealed that credit to the private sector reached N38.1trillion in May 2022.\n\nThe CBN had revealed that credit to private sector reached N35.73trillion in 2021 and reported N26.65trillion credit to private sector in 2019.\n\nTHISDAY can report that credit to private sector in 2019 when the LDR policy was introduced, gained N3.75trillion or 16.33 per cent to close at N26.69trillion from N22.95trillion it opened in 2018.\n\nIn 2020, credit to private sector added N3.5trillion or 13.12 per cent to close December 2020 at N30.15trillion from N26.65trillion recorded in January 2020.\n\nHowever, in the full year of 2021, credit to private sector rose by N5.08trillion or 16.57 per cent close 2021 at N35.38trillion from N30.65trillion reported by the CBN in January 2021.\n\nAnalysts in a chat with THISDAY attributed increased credit to the government as a factor contributing to growth in money supply, which they noted is also a major driving force behind the upward inflationary trend.\n\nThey added that increasing inflation rate might truncate its impact on the nation\u2019s economy at large.\n\nCommenting, Vice President, Highcap securities Limited, Mr. David Adnori said, \u201cIn general, an increase in the money supply drives inflation rather than the other way around. In our typical case, money supply growth far outstrips economic growth, which is a typical condition for stoking inflation.\n\n\u201cIn terms of inflation, the majority of the inflationary pressure we are experiencing is supply-side driven, as a result of issues like insecurity, poor infrastructure, insufficient logistics, and cost push factors from the external environment, such as the Russian-Ukraine conflict. As a result, I would ascribe a higher percentage (about 65-70per cent) of the money supply growth to inflation. I believe the balance is due to a higher credit growth to the economy, notably to the government.\u201d\n\nOn his part, CEO, Wyoming Capital & Partners, Mr. Tajudeen Olayinka noted that the N39.27 trillion credit to private sector as at June, 2022, still within the range of credit growth in 2021.\n\nAccording to him, \u201can average monthly growth rate of 1.66per cent since December, 2021, is an indication of a moderate credit extension to the private sector of the economy, in consonance with low absorptive capacity of the economy itself, and as possibly programmed by CBN, given mirage of problems bedevilling the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cAn economy with low productivity and total reliance on import must guide its credit expansion, in order not to put too much pressure on a faulty exchange rate management. Further credit expansion in the midst of poor monetary and fiscal coordination, could spell doom for the economy. This is one of the reasons our economy is not doing well.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the driver of credit to real sector, analyst at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye attributed the growth to 65 per cent LDR policy of the CBN, stressing that many banks complied with the directive on the minimum requirement.\n\nHe added that, \u201cthe intervention programs by the CBN in various sectors of the economy drove the increase as borrowers took advantage of the low interest rate.\n\nThe minimum LDR of 65per cent and intervention programs by the CBN in various sectors have contributed to the strong economic growth witnessed in the past quarters.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd, Mr. Ambrose Omordion noted that post-covid-19 business activities contributed to N38.1 trillion credit to private sector as of June.\n\nHe expressed that the recent increase in CBN\u2019s Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) might disrupt credit to private sector going forward, stressing that cost of production tends to witness increase and impact on local economy.\n\nHowever, the surge in money supply is driven by increased borrowing by the Federal government and lending to the private sector propelled by the various intervention funds of the CBN.\n\nInvestment analysts in a chat with THISDAY said increased credit to the government as a factor responsible for the sharp growth in money supply, which they noted is also a major driving force behind the upward inflationary trend.\n\nAccording to Adeyeye, \u201cMoney supply has been elevated over the last few months, mainly driven by a relatively dovish stance of the CBN. In our view, we think that the high money supply partly drove Nigeria\u2019s Inflation.",

          "title": "Aregbesola's return match, 'change the change' -- and other reasons Adeleke defeated Oyetola",
          "text": "Ademola Adeleke was elected governor of Osun state on Saturday, but it was by no means an easy ride for the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). His 403, 371 votes trumped those of Gboyega Oyetola, the incumbent governor and member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who polled 375,027.\n\nMany saw the defeat coming and will not consider it an upset because Adeleke was believed to have won the previous face-off with Oyetola in 2018 before it was \u201cmanipulated\u201d \u2014 although the case went all the way to the supreme court which upheld the result declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBut many observers will consider this as an upset because Oyetola, who has been governor for almost four years, is supposed to enjoy the power of incumbency and even recently cleared pension arrears and has been paying salaries regularly. They expected those things to work in his favour.\n\nHow then did Adeleke pull this through?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTHE AREGBESOLA FACTOR\n\nRauf Aregbesola and Oyetola, his successor as governor of Osun state, have not been on good terms since 2018 and rather than the relationship being repaired, it was getting further damaged with time. Oyetola was Aregbesola\u2019s chief of staff but Aregbesola did not really support his governorship ambition, eventually leading to a clash and a falling out with Bola Tinubu, reputed as the godfather of south-west politics.\n\nTinubu, who is now the APC presidential candidate, is understood to be related to Oyetola by blood and did not take kindly to Aregbesola\u2019s frosty relationship with Oyetola, who himself did not help matters by alienating Aregbesola in the political affairs of the state. TheCable understands that when Osun celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2021, the state government refused to invite Aregbesola to the event and also did not consider him for the honorary awards given to distinguished citizens of the states.\n\nAlthough Aregbesola unsuccessfully backed Moshood Adeoti, who served as the secretary to the state government under him, for the APC ticket this time around, there were no efforts to reconcile with him when the campaign council was constituted for Oyetola. Aregbesola was excluded. It would appear he decided to pull his weight in Saturday\u2019s election. The Osun Progressives (TOP), of which he is a member, did not work for Oyetola and this further harmed his re-election chances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAregbesola was out of the country when the election took place \u2014 a signal that he would rather not be around to mobilise for the candidate of his party. He simply looked the other way in what can be declared as a clear case of revenge. Oyetola lost by a margin of about 28,000 votes and he would be wondering what might have been if all the APC troops were fighting on his side.\n\n\u2018POLITICALLY RUDDERLESS\u2019\n\nOyetola, despite being chief of staff to a governor considered as an articulate speaker and political strategist, was not regarded as a man with the political heft. He was not particularly charismatic and was viewed in many quarters as being in office only because of Tinubu.\n\n\u201cHe was not particularly in touch with the people, compared to Ademola Adeleke who has the common touch. Forget all the talk about his dancing moves which the media usually criticise. Adeleke connected with the voters very well,\u201d a member of TOP told TheCable.\n\n\u201cIt is true that Oyetola does not have the gift of the garb but he could have improved himself over the years. There are schools where these skills are honed. He needed to be seen as someone who could communicate with the people and make them love him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, the APC in Osun state weakened under Oyetola\u2019s watch because of his lack of connection with the politicians, according to an insider who spoke with TheCable. The loss of the Aregbesola machinery was enough problem, but things got further complicated as Oyetola\u2019s own \u201cIleri Oluwa\u201d group also began to fall apart. He was accused of not \u201cservicing\u201d the party structure at the different levels: state, federal constituencies, state constituencies, local governments and wards.\n\nHe lost the election in hugely populated areas in Osun central, with Bisi Akande, a former governor of the state and one of APC elders, unable to deliver his zone to him.\n\n\u2018CHANGE THE CHANGE\u2019\n\nAPC came to power in 2015 promising Nigerians \u201cchange\u201d but it was a slogan that soon backfired as many people complained that the country was not experiencing the promise. Soon, the PDP started campaigning on \u201cchanging\u201d the change. The party took maximum advantage of that in the Osun governorship election. Many of the voters who chose Adeleke above Oyetola told TheCable that they just wanted a change and that they could not imagine another four years of APC.\n\nSome of the voters who spoke with TheCable said people were tired of Oyetola and wanted a change \u2014 despite the fact that the governor pays salaries promptly, unlike Aregbesola who owed arrears and became unpopular among the civil servants towards the end of his tenure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere is this fear that Oyetola could change in his second term in office. He hasn\u2019t promoted the civil servants since he assumed office till a few weeks to the election,\u201d one of those who voted for Adeleke told TheCable in Osogbo, the state capital.\n\nAt the national level, Nigerians have been groaning about the rising cost of living and insecurity and PDP has been campaigning that the ruling party must be voted out at all levels. The campaign did not yield dividends in Ekiti state where APC retained the governorship last month, and it is difficult to know how far it worked in Osun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the Adelekes are a political force in Osun and the PDP is not a pushover in the state. Isiaka Adeleke, their eldest brother, was the first governor of the state, elected in 1991. He was also an APC senator before his death in 2017. Ademola Adeleke inherited his structure and goodwill after his death and was elected to replace him on the platform of PDP.\n\nAND THEN, THERE IS THE BVAS MAGIC\u2026\n\nElections organised by INEC with the use of the bimodal voter accreditation system (BVAS) have been generally hailed as credible, starting with the Anambra governorship in November 2021. BVAS is an electronic device designed to read permanent voter cards (PVCs) and authenticate voters. All accredited voters are captured on the voter, thereby making overvoting easily detectable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, signed results sheets are captured and uploaded to the INEC servers immediately. This makes ballot snatching and ballot stuffing less attractive and also prevents the alteration of result sheets before collation. Quietly, INEC is using technology to improve the efficiency and credibility of elections. Politicians will now be left with resorting to technical and legal tussles to upturn the outcome.",

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Earlier on Friday, many African fintech startups offering virtual dollar card services sent emails to their customers stating that their virtual card service will be unavailable indefinitely starting Saturday, July 16, 2022. Virtual cards are digital replicas of physical bank cards. They are created and stored within digital virtual wallets.\n\nAn email sent to Barter customers by Nigerian-born unicorn Flutterwave read, \u201c\u2026effective Sunday, 17th July 2022, all our Virtual Dollar cards will be unavailable for any transactions and purchases.\u201d The payments giant attributed the reason for this suspension to \u201can update from the company\u2019s card partner\u201d. Barter is a Flutterwave consumer-facing virtual card platform that launched in early 2017.\n\nThis announcement by Flutterwave is bound to affect many other startups who use the company\u2019s white-labeled virtual card service to issue virtual cards to their customers.\n\nOther fintech startups including crypto exchange Busha, Rwanda-headquartered Payday, and Ugandan Eversend also issued similar notices.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear which \u201ccard partner\u201d Flutterwave and the other fintech startups are referring to, but these platforms have issued virtual cards powered by MasterCard and Visa\u2014two leading global card issuers. TechCabal is yet to confirm what exactly happened that led the \u201ccard partner\u201d to take this decision.\n\nIndividuals and businesses in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem affected by the unexpected notifications went on social media to complain about the widespread suspension of virtual card services.\n\n\u201cIt affects us in a big way because all our Facebook ads are connected to our Barter virtual card,\u201d Douglas Kenydson CEO Selar said. \u201cOur Amazon web services (AWS) plan is also connected, and you can\u2019t even afford to miss one payment, or else they\u2019ll take you off.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his other options, Kendyson expressed uncertainty about switching to existing virtual cards by Nigerian banks. He complained about the hassle of changing dollars and potentially dealing with failed card payments.\n\nKendyson\u2019s best alternative is to turn to the virtual card services of Mercury, a San Francisco-based digital bank for startups, that had restricted tens of African startups\u2019 accounts in March.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that this happened in the middle of the month so that whatever payment you need to make, make it,\u201d Kendyson said.\n\nIn the midst of the widespread announcement, startups like Bitmama and Mono took the opportunity to announce that their virtual card services are still up, a reminder that not all fintech startups were affected.\n\nBest in email from @bitmamaexchange \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Meet Burna Boy's monitor engineer, Precious Tawo as he takes us on his journey into sound engineering",
          "text": "Today\u2019s guest on Everyday People is someone whose magic you\u2019ve probably experienced at any Burna Boy, Wizkid, or Fireboy DML\u2019s concerts. Without further ado, let\u2019s meet Precious Tawo, freelance sound engineer and production manager. He has worked with firms like Google, IBM, and MultiChoice, and is a die-hard perfectionist, perhaps in recovery. He also runs Decibelz Production Limited, a one-stop-shop for all your audio rental needs.\n\nThere\u2019s this saying my sister made all of us get used to, which is still on my email address now:\n\nGood, better, best.\n\nI will never rest,\n\nUntil my good is better\n\nAnd my better best\n\nWe grew up singing that. We always lived by that mantra.\n\nSo I kept on putting my best into what I was doing. Everybody was interested in sitting on the console, but I was interested in knowing the whole craft.\n\nOn the 20th day [of the Calabar festival], we were doing a sound check in the stadium for the band, and my boss was not on the stage.\n\nSo he said, \u201cPrecious, please go to the console in front and mute the whole Front of House.\u201d\n\nFront of House is basically the mix the engineer mixes for the audience. So I ran there and quickly muted it. And he was shocked. Because he knew that at this point, he had not shown me anything that concerned the board.\n\n\u201cHow did you know how to mute the board?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou this boy! You are a Puma!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how they say it in Yoruba, but he called me Puma because he says I jump. At the end of the festival, I became the first trainee to join the main crew in less than three weeks. I was paid \u20a6230,000 ($1,403)*, which was the highest [amount of] money I had ever received.\n\nPrecious Tawo\u2019s journey into sound engineering\n\nPrecious Tawo\n\nI didn\u2019t choose the path; the path chose me. So sometime after I finished secondary school, I wanted to study marine engineering real bad because I had friends in the marine space.\n\nI even had to wait one year at home for the entrance exam period. And I even went as far as Ibadan [Oyo State, Nigeria] to write for Polaris Marine Academy entrance exam. Then I went to the Maritime Academy in Oron to write the exam.\n\nFortunately, I got admission into the Maritime Academy, Oron, but before it came out, I was already working as a facility manager in a hotel in Calabar [Cross River State, Nigeria] because I just wanted to while away time.\n\nI\u2019m not an idle person. And then I\u2019ve always been someone that\u2019s been independent, and I wanted my little stipend. I got to work in a hotel thanks to my dad\u2019s South African friend \u2014 the manager \u2014 who gave me a job as one of the facility guys.\n\nBecause of how fast I was and everything, I was transferred from the hotel to the event centre, where I worked for over six months. And this was when I wrote the Polaris entrance exam. As at November, I knew full well that my time there was done because I know when it\u2019s time for me to leave somewhere.\n\nI don\u2019t need to pray about it; I feel it in my tummy that it\u2019s time to go, and I leave without a plan, but I always have something all worked out later on. So I felt it was time to leave.\n\nAnd in 2013, the Calabar Festival was very popular. This was something that we normally went to the stadium to watch every December and wish that we were on stage or part of the crew.\n\nAt this point, I had no audio background. The only knowledge I had about audio came in November [2013] when we had the Beer Festival in 520 [Hotel, Calabar], and they wanted to rent equipment worth about \u20a65,000,000 ($31,645)**.\n\nI made the company give me \u20a6700,000 ($4,430)** to buy some equipment, and I was like, \u201cI am gonna make this work.\u201d\n\nAnd I did DJ for the Beer Festival with Virtual DJ on my laptop and saved them over \u20a63,000,000 ($18,987)**. That\u2019s the only thing I knew about audio, which was basically from YouTube; plug this here, plug this there, turn this here, turn this there.\n\nWorking at The Voice in 2021\n\nSo on November 25, 2013, I resigned and told my dad that I would like to work with the crew for the Calabar Festival because he had his friend there.\n\nMy dad was an immigration officer in the Tourism Bureau, so he sorted out the passports for most foreigners working in Calabar. So he had relationships with these guys.\n\nThe production manager then was one of his friends, and he told him his son was interested in working with the guys for the December festival.\n\nI heard they were paying them \u20a6200,000 ($1,255)***. And how much was I earning at my place of work? It was just \u20a618,000 ($113)*** initially, then it went up to \u20a625,000 ($156)***. If I could make \u20a6200,000 a month, it\u2019d actually be better than what I was making in a year or close to what I made in a year if I stayed at the event centre.\n\nI planned to join them only for that month and then use the \u20a6200,000 to start school when results come out in January or February.\n\nOn the first day, I was told to go to the Governor\u2019s office for the interview. I dressed in my nicely starched shirt and trousers, and a nice pair of shoes.\n\nOnly for me to walk into the office and they were like, \u201cOh, you are the Precious. Okay, no problem. Hop into the Hilux; let\u2019s go to the warehouse and show you around.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to change?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. Just come.\u201d\n\nWhen I arrived, they were loading trucks to move the equipment to the studio. This was the 28th of November. And when I got there, I had this whole \u201cbig boy\u201d thingy going on, so seeing boys loading trucks, I was like, \u201cNah, that\u2019s not what I came for; I came for the cool stuff.\u201d\n\nSo they asked me what I wanted to do, and I said, \u201cThe sound department,\u201d because I really loved the whole sound thing. When you went to the Festival, you could hear the speakers pumping from miles away, and I really wanted to be a part of that.\n\nPlus, I had just finished the Beer Festival and wanted something higher than I\u2019d experienced. They introduced me to Aigbovosa Giwa-Osagie, my boss. They took me around and showed me speakers I\u2019d never seen before up close.\n\nThen they introduced me to another person who would be my head.\n\nI was like, \u201cOkay, cool. I\u2019ll resume tomorrow. Nice meeting you guys.\u201d\n\nNext thing, \u201cNo o!. You are resuming now and joining them to load that truck.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, no problem. Easy thing,\u201d I told him.\n\nLuckily, I had a singlet and a pair of jeans in my bag because I was supposed to go somewhere from there. Nice pair of jeans o!\n\nWizkid\u2019s concert\n\nSo, I started loading with the guys. The equipment was very heavy, and there I was, not used to carrying heavy things, seeing young people like me doing it, and told myself I could too.\n\nWe finished loading four trucks after almost four hours and headed to the venue for the Festival\u2019s first event. And I was told to jump into the back of the truck because the Hilux was full.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: senior crew sits in the Hilux, junior crew at the back, and trainees like me sit on the equipment inside the 40-foot truck like the one used to convey cows.\n\nAt first, I was like no way, especially since Calabar is such a small place, but I eventually jumped in. Part of the price you have to pay, you know. At this point, my jeans were gone, and my singlet was like rags.\n\nWe got there, and my boss walked up to me and asked me what audio background I had. And I told him I had none, but the only thing I knew was the entry stuff, but I was willing to learn.\n\nSo when we started setting up, he asked me to go and get the 10 mm ep5 cable. In my head, I was supposed to go and see a cable labelled 10mm ep5.\n\nHe pointed in a direction of over 65 open cases, so I went there straight, and for like 40 minutes, I was searching for the ep5 cable, and I didn\u2019t even know what I was looking for. And then I couldn\u2019t even ask because the way he said it, it was like I was supposed to know the cable.\n\nSo I did not ask, and I didn\u2019t want to look small. After 40 minutes, I went back to him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t find the cable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I see it, what should I do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to do, but I can\u2019t find the cable in the box.\u201d\n\nAnd then he asked another guy that had been there for like four years to get the cable for him and take me and show me the cable.\n\nThis guy just opened the case, stretched his hand, and picked up the cable.\n\nMixing in a studio.\n\nYo! It was super embarrassing. And I didn\u2019t like the way everyone was laughing and everything. So I told myself that I was going to know everything in the company, how it works, and I was going to know all their needs.\n\nSo that night, I started downloading the PDF files for the equipment manuals and spent another hour downloading more when I got home at 3:00 a.m. before I slept.\n\nThe next night, since I was just a trainee, I sat in one corner with all the loud music and was just reading stuff, checking stuff, and going behind the Front of House to peep and see what they were doing even though it looked like they were running a spaceship.\n\nAfter the Festival, my boss gave me the opportunity to go to an event in Lagos for IBM computers. Then I also did Love Like a Movie by Darey Art Alade in February 2014, the outdoor version with Kelly Rowland.\n\nLong story short, I kept on growing, going from event to event. I\u2019m a sucker for information, always trying to keep myself updated. People were recommending me because no matter how good you are, you need people to recommend you.\n\nOn February 20 [2014], my mom called me to tell me that the result for the Academy was out, and I passed. My name was announced on NTA [a state-owned broadcasting station]. But, I had no plans to go to school anymore.\n\nThat February, I was also offered a position with the company, but my boss advised me not to take it.\n\nHe said, \u201cEvery week and every day, experts fly in from South Africa and the United States or wherever to come and work in Nigeria. And if you are good at what you do, they\u2019ll fly you from whatever hole you are in to come and do an event.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve worked with different companies and been exposed to various equipment and clients.\n\nAnd I will not put this achievement on one company. If I was working with one company, I\u2019d be stuck with their clients and the kind of events they do. I learn from everybody, and I also like the way I\u2019m being treated like the golden egg.\n\nI love my job. I\u2019ve done stuff for Google, Amazon, IBM, Airtel, MTN, MultiChoice, and The Voice. Presently I\u2019m Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer and Fireboy\u2019s Front of House engineer. I\u2019ve mixed for Wizkid\u2019s December concerts, Cardi B, and Davido; any big artiste really.\n\nLearning from mistakes\n\nMixing at Burna Boy\u2019s Dakar concert in 2022\n\nSometime in 2015, we had an event in Eko Atlantic; it was supposed to be the launch for Majestic Voyage and ten minutes before the show, we did the sound check. Everything was sounding all right and I was mixing monitors.\n\nFive minutes to the show, I tapped my screen and it was frozen. I tried restarting the console, but nothing. That meant every artiste who climbed that stage was not going to hear jack!\n\nI felt like the ground should open for me to enter. We tried everything and eventually had to plug my monitors into my boss\u2019 equipment. By this time, the first artiste, Yemi Sax, was already on stage. I had already explained to him and everything but the first three minutes of the show were hell.\n\nI somehow survived the performance and my boss stabilised everything and that\u2019s how we ran the show. Another moment was when I was doing a show at Calabar Cultural Centre, and then we had power issues in the middle of the show and the console went off.\n\nThe show was cancelled and they had to fix another date. I spent four years trying to correct that mistake. I was hard on myself for four years. I\u2019m a perfectionist so I like to give 110%. Eventually, I had to accept that every engineer has bad days.\n\nGiving back\n\nIn line with what I\u2019ve learnt over the years, I decided to try and pass on this knowledge because I found out that, at the end of the day, we have to leave a legacy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about money to me, my job is like my life right now. And I\u2019ve seen that many engineers have come and gone but there\u2019s nothing anybody can point to that they made. And so I started sharing knowledge at every opportunity I got. If I went to an event, I\u2019d teach the in-house engineer things I knew they would need if they asked politely, of course.\n\nI run a clinic for engineers, although I haven\u2019t done it since 2019.

          "text": "Financial experts have stressed the need for the Federal Government to implement the National Development Plan 2021-2025 (NDP) to spur the country\u2019s economic growth.\n\nThe experts said this at a webinar on Saturday with the theme: \u201cResetting Nigeria\u2019s Economic Growth Trajectory.\u201d\n\nThey said that practical measures should be adopted to implement the plans to enhance revenue generation.\n\nThe NDP which succeeds the Vision 20:2020 introduced in 2009 and the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan is a bridge for the country\u2019s long-term plan currently being developed, \u201cNigeria Agenda 2050\u201d.\n\nThe vision of the plan is to unlock the country\u2019s potential across all sectors of the economy for a sustainable, holistic, and inclusive national development.\n\nThe Director-General, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mr Lamido Yuguda, said that the implementation of NDP would boost productivity, employment and the standards of living.\n\nYuguda, represented by Mr Dayo Obisan, Executive Commissioner of Operations, SEC, said that the successful execution of the NDP was critical to achieving economic growth since its objectives cut across all sectors of the economy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government already has several laudable economic plans and the focus should be on increasing the level of implementation of these plans.\n\n\u201cThe NDP is one of such plans that the government can focus which is aimed at fostering economic growth and enhancing productivity.\n\n\u201cOne of its broad objectives is on economic diversification to improve non-oil revenue and increase the dollar earning power of our non-oil export.\n\n\u201cIt also focuses on investment in infrastructure; security and good governance; education and a healthy population; poverty alleviation; economic and social development across states,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Managing Director, Financial Institution Training Centre (FITC), Mrs Chizor Malize, emphasised the need to transit from a consumer nation to production for increased export capacity.\n\nAccording to her, the government should take cues from Asian countries on how they develop their economies, especially in the areas of public health, transportation, technology and housing.\n\nMalize said that the best way to drive large-scale employment was by reviewing policies on education and curriculum to equip and stimulate youths to become employers of labour.\n\nShe called on the government and other relevant stakeholders to consistently create an enabling environment to foster micro, small and medium-scale enterprises.\n\n\u201cIn China, we see a lot of strength and sophistication around technology but it will interest you to know that China started its reform through agriculture.\n\n\u201cChina recognise the importance of food security and alleviating people from poverty, so they leveraged investment in agricultural policies to create change and catalyse growth and empowerment.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest things that drove Singapore\u2019s success is visionary leadership because they deliberately tied political stability to economic growth.\n\n\u201cSingapore was deliberate about infrastructure in public health, transportation and housing as well as free market principles where businesses can thrive and attract foreign investors without the huge tax burden.\n\n\u201cJapan was crushed after World War 2 but now, manufacturing has elevated Japan and allowed them to command respect across the world,\u201d she said.\n\nMalize added that the FITC was doing a lot to empower the youth with its development-focused projects in the areas of innovation, environment, agriculture, technology and health.\n\nAlso speaking, the Managing Director, Cowry Asset Management Ltd., Mr Johnson Chukwu, urged the government to do more in growing the manufacturing, Information Communication Technology (ICT) and trade sectors, as these were key drivers of economic growth.\n\nChukwu said that growing the manufacturing sector involved addressing factors such as infrastructure, power supply, logistics, seaports for import and export of goods, transportation and availability of development finance initiatives.\n\nHe also stressed the need to develop human capital in the sector by ensuring the availability of quality education to build skills and capacity as well as produce quality goods for competitive advantage to attract investors.\n\n\u201cThe ICT sector contributes about 16.2 per cent to the economy. It is the new and digital economy and the government must do everything to encourage the sector,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Mr Taiwo Oyedele, Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at PwC, called on the government to harmonise taxes and demonstrate value for it to citizens; to encourage tax morale, and boost government\u2019s revenue.\n\nOyedele said that tax evasion in the public sector also posed a great challenge for the government as it was losing revenue.\n\n\u201cThe biggest tax evasion in Nigeria is in the public sector, with Ministries Departments and Agencies not remitting taxes to the government.\n\n\u201cGovernment has to think about harmonising taxes because the number of taxes and number of agencies collecting it is too many.\n\n\u201cNigerians are paying taxes but the government is not getting it due to corruption, leakages and inefficiency.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to solve the revenue challenges, the government should address these leakages with automation, intelligence and data,\u201d",

He was therefore trailed by his kidnappers after he left the vigil to his community where he was ultimately abducted, leaving his car at the scene. It was also gathered that the suspects had established contacts with the victim\u2019s family and placed N10m as ransom for his releases.\n\nThe Imo State Police Command spokesman, Micheal Abattam, never responded to an inquiry about the abduction and release of the NDDC personnel.",

It is preventable. Also to remind people with the disease that they can do alot with their life\u201d.\n\nThe nurse further revealed that \u201cThe Nirvana Initiative is doing a welfare package. A way of reaching out with people living with sickle cell disease with a welfare package which has to do with food, reminding them that food is important in their day to day and also to support them\u201d.\n\nA victim of sickle cell trait, Somto Omekukwu, a 22 years old lady and a graduate of Plant Science and Biotechnology, said being a sickler has limited her from things she passionately desire to do.\n\n\u201cI have been relatively stable most of my life but it has its challenges. Sometimes one plan something and you woke up not able to do it that day. You learn to manage the challenges and move on with your life.\n\n\u201cI like sports but most time I am not able to do as much as I was to. My parent realized that I am a sickler when I was about a year old and my mum was already pregnant with my little sister who also had sickle cell\u201d.\n\nAlso, Rukvwe Aride, 27 years old male graduate of Biochemistry and Chemistry Technology, recalled how he felt the first time he knew about his status.\n\nAride expressed \u201cI felt not really good when I knew about my status because I am wandering why me.

          "text": "By Onu Okorie\n\nIn Nigeria today, when agents of transformations in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari are being counted, the Director General of Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda will definitely standout, if the numerous reforms he has introduced is anything to go by.\n\nIn less than two years after assuming office the SEC management under Mr. Yuguda has not only set strategic goals but also continued to expand the frontiers of investment space thereby attracting improved local and foreign direct investment, FDIs into the economy through innovative regulatory guidelines and collaboration with other relevant institutions.\n\nFor instance, on market-wide issues, the Commission has drafted and presented an amendment to ISA Bill to the National Assembly as part of its efforts to enhance the regulatory framework of the Nigerian capital market, lead to the introduction of new products into the market, and increase the effectiveness of the Investments and Securities Tribunal, amongst other benefits to ensure that the provisions of the Bill represent realities in the nation\u2019s investment climate.\n\nAlso, the Commission is collaborating with National Assembly Business Environment Roundtable NASSBER to prepare a roadmap towards passage of the Bill within the shortest time frame.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management team has been implementing capital market development goals set out in the Capital Market Master Plan (CMMP) (2015-2025) and successfully completed the review of CMMP to realign the initiatives/deliverables to prevailing market conditions and keep the document relevant in the dynamic capital market due to issues related to Fintech, sustainability and regional integration.\n\nTo resolve legacy issues of Identity Management which is a crucial driver in improving market participation and solving unclaimed dividends and related problems, the management also inaugurated a market-wide Identity Management Committee with mandate to harmonize the various databases of investors in Nigerian capital market, facilitate data accuracy in the market, mitigate fraud, improve KYC requirements and manage AML/CFT risks, among others.\n\nThe report of the committee is expected to resolve issues that have hindered growth of the Market, hampered investor confidence, and matters that serve as barriers to entry for potential investors, amongst other benefits.\n\nOn primary market activities, the Yuguda-led executive management of the SEC has also in the past two years approved 41 new equities issues valued at N656.9 billion, 37 bonds valued at N776.2 billion, 28 applications for shelf programmes valued at N2.5 trillion and 21 Exchange Traded Derivatives Contracts.\n\nThis is even as it processed six Schemes of Merger, seven Acquisitions, 21 Corporate Restructurings, and three Takeovers during the period. It also ensured that over N11 billions of untraceable shareholders\u2019 funds from Schemes of Arrangement in the custody of Registrars were transferred to the National Investor Protection Fund NIPF.\n\nAs part of the process of improving time to market of transactions and fast tracking the review process, the Commission conducted training for issuing houses to help improve the quality of applications submitted.\n\nSimilarly, Commission also recorded a landmark achievement on the first electronic offering with combined feature of book building to Qualified Institutions and use of the price discovered from book-build for sales to Retail Investors. It also granted approval for the first 21 derivatives contracts which had seven and 14 different contracts from both the NGX and FMDQ Exchanges respectively in the past two years.\n\nOn Collective Investment Scheme CIS, the Yuguda-led management has also, following completion of series of monitoring and evaluation processes, commenced implementation of 100 per cent custody requirement in the CIS sector to protect investors. As a result, all clients\u2019 assets currently managed under discretionary and non-discretionary mandates are to be held under independent custodial agreements in custodial banks.\n\nThe Commission has also recorded remarkable milestones in its secondary market activities in the past years with successful demutualization of the Nigerian Exchange Limited NGX which investment analysts see as milestone in the development of Nigerian capital market.\n\nThis is even as the management collaborated with University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Alternative Finance, UK for the training of its select employees on a certified course on Fintech & Regulatory Innovation, to enhance the Commission\u2019s capacity in regulating Fintech.\n\nAlso, it collaborated with the World Bank to commission a Fintech Scoping project and held collaborative engagements with 15 International and local Fintech stakeholders to guide the Commission on its Fintech policies.\n\nThe Regulatory Incubation Guidelines to operationalize provisional regulation for aspiring Fintech firms were released within the period. In furtherance of its market regulation roles, management of the Commission was able to ascertain the quantum of unclaimed dividends of publicly traded companies that fall within the categories eligible to be borrowed by the Federal Government.\n\nThis amounted to N56, 584,795,648.71 and $8,153,118.41 respectively. In addition, it also facilitated the transfer into the SEC/CNB NIPF Account of N2.3 billion in excess of return monies and N11.4 billion in Schemes consideration money, both of which had previously been held in the custody of the Registrars.\n\nOn the pesky issue of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing Of Terrorism AML/CFT, following the GIABA Mutual Evaluation of Nigeria, the Yuguda-led executive management had made concerted efforts in the capital market to meet both the GIABA Mutual Evaluation Report MER Follow-Up Process and the FATF International Cooperation Review Group ICRG requirements in order to avoid Nigeria being placed on the FATF public grey list at the Plenary when the grace period expires in October, 2022.\n\nFor instance, following the MER findings that Nigeria had several important deficiencies in its AML/CFT/CPF system in relation to Technical Compliance, and that its effectiveness controls were insufficient to mitigate its high ML/TF/PF risks, the Commission championed the amendments of Rules and Regulations of the Virtual Asset Service providers; the sector specific regulations to repeal the 2013 SEC AML/CFT Regulations and enactment of the 2022 AML/CFT Regulations; the SEC AML/CFT RBS Framework.\n\nThese new rules and amendments were done in order to address Nigeria\u2019s MER deficiencies and broaden the scope of preventive measures available to VASPs. In furtherance of its regulatory mandate, the Commission conducted investigations into complaints by investors and out of the 250 complaints brought forward into the period, 182 were resolved.\n\nAlso, out of the 58 complaints in relation to Ponzi schemes received, 45 were resolved. The Commission was able to recover 10,659,168 units of various companies\u2019 shares as well as the sum of N1, 384,255,526.73 recovered for investors during the period under review.\n\nIt issued New Rules on Robo-Advisory Services to guide the regulatory requirements and expectations for providing automated advisory services in the market and released the Rules on Trade Repositories during the period under review.\n\nSimilarly, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission also introduced new rules on Crowd Funding, Social bonds, Digital Assets Exchange DAX, Digital Assets Custodians DACs, Issuance of Digital Assets as Securities and Requirements for registration of Digital Assets Offering Platforms as part of its efforts to guarantee security of investments in the capital market.\n\nOn Corporate Governance measures, the Commission also released guidelines on the Implementation of Sections 60-63 of Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and in order to strengthen the disclosure regime in capital market, the Commission in a circular dated January 19, 2022 provided public companies a fast track option for filing Audited Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition, the Commission also developed the SEC Corporate Governance Guidelines SCGG to address corporate governance issues not considered in the NCCG, and released same in October 2020. As part of its efforts to harmonise the reporting timeline of the SEC Corporate Governance Guideline SCGG with that of the National Code of Corporate Governance NCCG, it also in year 2021 exposed to the public for comments an amendment to Rules 42(2).\n\nThe Commission has also as part of its regulatory interventions to amicably resolve disputes between the board and shareholders of listed companies resolved the disputes between Alhaji Muneer Alade Bankole (the Chief Executive Officer and Sheikh Abdulmohsen A. Al-Thunayan Chairman of the Board, of Medview Airlines, resolved those between major shareholders of Ikeja Hotels Plc and returned the company to profitability and also reached a settlement with Oando Plc in 2021 after concluding investigation of Corporate Governance allegations levelled against the company.\n\nIn regard to its market development mandate, the Commission has continued its Investor Education and Public enlightenment programmes by organizing workshops on infusion of Capital Market Studies into the curricula of Basic and Secondary Schools in Nigeria and also collaborated with the Standards Organization of Nigeria SON and other partners to organize Stakeholders\u2019 Sensitization Workshops on Commodities Standards in Lagos and Kano during the period under review.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission held webinars on Non-Interest Capital Market Products, Financial Inclusion, Ponzi Schemes and Solid Minerals targeted at the pension industry, investor protection, women, Youth/millennial and the commodities segment of the market.\n\nAlso in pursuit of non-interest market education and enlightenment programmes, the Commission collaborated with Islamic Financial Services Board IFSB and the Auditing and Accounting Organisation of Islamic Financial Institutions AAOIFI to organize Non-Interest Capital Market training for over 1000 participants.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission has led the team to improve the capacity of the Nigerian Capital Market Institute NCMI by providing it with necessary tools to train Capital Market Operators CMO in different fields.\n\nOn international engagements, Mr Yuguda is now saddled with leadership of West African Securities Regulators Association WASRA. Under his leadership, rules for the integrated West African Capital Market were developed and reviewed.\n\nOn human capital development, the Commission had in 2019 conducted an internal capacity assessment that outlined staffing deficits and needs.\n\nAlso, in furtherance of its drive to leverage its operations by deploying innovative technologies and solutions to its departments and units, the Commission conducted a review of its IT infrastructure and determined that it was in a poor state.\n\nThe investigations focused on the internal and external perceptions of the Commission with the conclusion that the IT infrastructure was out dated and needed to be upgraded to international standards of securities regulators.\n\nAlso, on its Risk-Based Supervision Framework Implementation and Capacity Building Project the Commission secured a $400,000 grant from the African Development Bank AfDB to support capacity building projects in the areas of RBS, Derivatives and Green Bonds.\n\nThe Commission has also secured counterpart funding of $450,000 from AfDB on its Nigeria Securities Market Surveillance System Project to support the deployment of a real-time market surveillance system for the Nigerian capital market.\n\nIn addition, it has also secured from the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN the sum of N3.5 billion for Information Technology transformation project. Given the unparalleled achievements recorded so far, it has been argued by some financial experts that there is nexus between Yuguda\u2019s reforms and investors\u2019 making Nigeria a preferred destination in recent times.",

Governor Oyetola polled 375,027 votes.\n\nIt was enough for the Returning Officer of the election, Professor Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, to declare him winner and governor-elect.\n\n\u201cI declare that Adeleke Ademola Jackson Nurudeen of PDP, having satisfied the requirements of the law, is hereby declared the winner and he is returned elected,\u201d Professor Ogundipe declared, sparking jubilation among Adeleke\u2019s supporters.\n\n\ufeff\n\nSaturday\u2019s election featured 15 contestants with the rematch of Oyetola and Adeleke drawing the most attention.\n\nAs the results from the local governments trickled in, it was clear that the election which was generally considered peaceful was a two-horse race between both men.\n\nThey split 96.76 per cent of the total valid votes cast in the election.\n\nKehinde Atanda of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) came in at a distant third with 10,104 votes, followed by Akin Ogunbiyi of the Accord Party with 4,515 votes.\n\nVotes for the other candidates are as follows: Akinade Ogunbiyi, A party \u2014 4,514 votes; Awojide Segun, AAC \u2014 2,148; Kehinde Atanda, ADP -10,104; Awoyemi Lukuman, APM \u2014 1,222; and Adebayo Elisha, APP \u2014 601 votes.\n\nAdeleke Adedapo of BP got 374 votes; Rasaq Saliu, NNPP \u2014 393; Abede Samuel, NRM \u2014 777; Ayowole Adedeji, PRP \u2014 1,007; Omigbodun Akinrinola, SDP \u2014 515; Ademola Adeseye, YPP \u2014 1,303; and Adesuyi Olufemi, ZLP \u2014 364 votes.\n\nVictory At Last\n\nIn the last governorship election held in 2018, it was a tough contest as the APC flagbearer had to win a supplementary election before he was returned elected.\n\nFollowing the initial poll held that year, Oyetola trailed Adeleke who had led by 353 votes going into the supplementary election which held in seven polling units.\n\nThe votes garnered in the supplementary poll would later help the incumbent governor to overturn the deficit and put him ahead of his PDP counterpart, leading to his emergence as the winner of the keenly contested election.\n\nAccording to the final votes announced by the electoral umpire that year, Oyetola polled 255,505 votes while Adeleke scored 255,023 votes \u2013 a difference of 482 votes.\n\nIt was, however, victory at last for the PDP candidate and his supporters on Sunday (today) when he was returned elected by Professor Ogundipe who doubles as the Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos (UNILAG).\n\nCompared to his loss in the last election, Adeleke bounced back to defeat incumbent Governor Oyetola with a vote margin of 28,344.\n\nBetter Conduct\n\nSaturday\u2019s election started off on schedule at many polling units observed with accreditation and voting going on smoothly for the most part.\n\nSome of the candidates and observers also had words of praise for the conduct of the poll.\n\nGovernor Oyetola told reporters that he is satisfied with the conduct of the poll and commended the security operatives for \u201cdoing a very good job\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing has been very peaceful,\u201d he said after voting at Unit 2, Ward 1 in Boripe Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cI think INEC has performed very well,\u201d said PDP\u2019s Adeleke after he voted. More than 21,000 policemen had been deployed for the exercise along with three police helicopters and three gunboats.\n\nAhead of the polls, there had been concerns about possible disturbances by cultists and the menace of vote-buying.\n\nHowever, as the exercise progressed, reports from observers and security agents indicated that it was peaceful, backing up assurances by security operatives that adequate arrangements had been made for the poll.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to make adequate arrangements to take care of the possible consequences of the activities of the cultists,\u201d said the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the election, Johnson Kokumo.\n\n\u201cThat is, effecting their arrest before the election and of course mopping up light weapons in circulation. This is intended to create a conducive atmosphere where the gubernatorial election will take place without crisis.\u201d\n\nPeaceful Poll\n\nHours into the poll, the Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps, Brigadier-General Mohammed Fadah, adjudged the poll peaceful.\n\n\u201cThe place is more peaceful than Ekiti because there isn\u2019t any report of violence,\u201d he told Channels TV\u2019s Seun Okinbaloye when asked about the poll in Osogbo, the state capital.\n\n\u201cEverybody is peaceful like it\u2019s Sallah day, everywhere is peaceful and they are doing their thing in a very peaceful manner. There is no negative report so far.\u201d\n\nIn a preliminary report, the Civil Society Situation Room also adjudged the election as peaceful.\n\n\u201cFrom the Situation Room\u2019s observations, no violence has been recorded and the number of people who came out was encouraging,\u201d it said in another assessment report \u2013 the second for the day.\n\n\u201cWe commend the people of the State of Osun for coming out early to cast their votes, especially the elderly who waited in queues patiently.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to vote-buying, however, the steps taken to combat the act fell short.\n\n\u201cThere was open negotiation of buying and selling of votes well-coordinated by the polling agents in many of the polling units,\u201d the Civil Society Situation Room said in its assessment of the election.\n\n\u201cThere were no complaints from any of them (the polling agents) against each other. Codes were used to extract commitments from voters as opposed to the blatant money exchanging hands observed in the Ekiti State governorship election.\u201d\n\nVote-Buying Still A Problem\n\nCandidates also had concerns about vote-buying.\n\nThe governorship candidate of the Accord Party, Akin Ogunbiyi, told journalists that he witnessed vote buying in Aiyedire Local Government Area.\n\n\ufeff\n\nShortly after casting his vote with his wife at Ile-Ogbo Ward 1, Unit 1, Methodist Primary School, Ogunbiyi listed other areas where vote-buying took place to be in Ile-Ogbo and Osogbo environs.\n\nHe lamented that there was no official of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) there to arrest party agents who trade votes for money.\n\n\u201cThe police officers there can\u2019t do any arrest. They were sitting down. In fact, it was by their side that they (voters) were going to collect money for the vote that they sold,\u201d Ogunbiyi said.\n\n\u201cAn Aiyedire Local Government, there was a vehicle parked behind a building. There was a lady inside and there was another man. They were the ones who were exchanging cash for votes.\u201d\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe candidate of the Labour Party, Lasun Yusuf, also had concerns about vote-buying.\n\nAfter voting at his polling unit in Irepodun LGA around 10:20 am, he had a warning for voters.\n\n\u201cI just have fears for the future generation but let me sound a note of warning, if people actually go out today to buy the votes, Nigeria is in problem,\u201d he said.\n\nAhead of the polls, INEC had said it would work closely with security operatives on the issue of vote-buying. As part of efforts to tackle the menace, various security agencies were present in the state for the poll, including the EFCC.\n\n\u201cWe have our Force Intelligence Bureau operatives; our tactical operatives are here too. They are not in uniforms, they are everywhere, and we are working with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC),\u201d Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, told Channels TV during the polls.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe EFCC would later arrest three men for vote buying.\n\nAccording to the anti-graft agency, the three suspects were arrested through actionable intelligence and digital means, and all three will be prosecuted.",

          "text": "Following the attack on Kuje Correctional Centre by terrorists, Nigeria\u2019s Defence Headquarters (DHQ) on Saturday allayed fears of alleged impending attacks on Abuja.\n\nThis is coming as the Brigade of Guards has also set up a board of inquiry to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the Kuje incident and the involvement or otherwise of soldiers posted to the correctional facility on the day of the attack.\n\nThe Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Command of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) had issued a security alert on planned terror attacks on churches, schools and public infrastructure in Abuja.\n\nAnother anonymous alert, patterned after standard security alerts which had trended on social media indicated that there was an influx of unknown persons around Karshi Hills and Orozo, in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC).\n\nAccording to the alert, some persons were seen regularly and clandestinely going up the hills around Navy Town Estate thus raising high suspicion that the invaders were building camps within the hills which also connect to other adjoining forests within the FCT and Nasarawa State.\n\nThe alert said the terrorists planned to attack educational institutions located in the area.\n\nBut speaking in Abuja, the Director of Defence Information (DDI), Maj. Gen. Jimmy Akpor said security agencies were on alert and determined to contain any security threats to the seat of power.\n\nHe said: \u201cSecurity agencies are not sleeping. They are doing what needs to be done to keep the place safe. A lot of things are being done. Measures have been put in place. Of all the security agencies, none is sleeping\u201d.\n\nOn the intelligence alert of an impending attack making the rounds, he said expectations were that the citizenry would provide available information to security forces and not circulate such on social media.\n\nMeanwhile, the Brigade of Guards, charged with the security of the president, his family and the seat of power, said it has set up a board of inquiry to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the attack on the Kuje Correctional Centre by Boko Haram and the roles, if any, played by soldiers assigned to the facility.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja Saturday, the Assistant Director of Army Public Relations and Public Relations Officer of the Brigade of Guards, Captain Godfrey Abakpa, said: \u201cThe board of inquiry was set up to ascertain what happened that day to get to the root cause of the attack.\n\n\u201cA board of inquiry has been set up to ascertain what happened that day to get to the root cause of the attack.\u201d\n\nHe said contrary to reports that many soldiers were detained in underground cells, no soldiers were in detention.\n\nHe, however, affirmed that soldiers deployed to that area were responding to the demands of the investigation.\n\n\u201cNobody is being detained. The investigation is ongoing. Everybody is telling his side of the story. It is not our job to guard prisons but we respond in support of civil authority.\n\n\u201cThe board was set up because it happened within our area of responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the security cordon around the seat of power, he maintained that the measures were taken to ensure that the fleeing inmates, who escaped from Kuje and who may be lurking in the shadows were arrested.\n\n\u201cCheckpoints and patrols were ordered because some of the escapees are believed to be still around like the one arrested in the Area 1 Park,\u201d he said.\n\nHe gave the assurance that with the measures in place presently, such an attack would be difficult to come by.\n\n\u201cThere should be no panic. There is the tendency that no such further attack will be possible with the arrangements in place,\u201d he explained.\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

          "title": "With New Status, NNPC GMD\u2019s Nomenclature Now Group CEO",
          "text": "As the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) officially transits to a private entity that would be regulated in line with the provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), the nomenclature of the Group Managing Director (GMD) of the national oil company would also change to the Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO), in line with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021.\n\nThis is coming as Nigeria produced less crude oil in the first six months of 2022 compared with the same period in 2020 and 2021, an analysis of the data on the country\u2019s total oil production from the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), has indicated.\n\nAccording to findings by THISDAY, companies globally take conscious efforts to define how their impact would be measured, ranging from services to relationship management with both the employees and external stakeholders. Under the new status, NNPC Limited would be the holding company.\n\nThe Corporate Affairs Commission on September 21, 2021, completed the incorporation of the NNPC Limited following the provisions of the PIA 2021.\n\nThe PIA was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on August 16, 2021, following its passage by the National Assembly in July of the same year.\n\nSpecifically, Section 53(1) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021 requires the Minister of Petroleum Resources to cause for the incorporation of the NNPC Limited within six months of the enactment of the PIA in consultation with the Minister of Finance on the nominal shares of the company.\n\nWith the registration by the CAC, NNPC Limited was floated with an initial capital of N200 billion making history as the company with the highest share capital in the country.\n\nSince when the PIA was signed into law last year, the management of the NNPC has taken proactive steps to prepare it for the July 1 take-off as a CAMA company.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari would unveil the new NNPC Limited on July 19.\n\nThe shift in nomenclature from GMD to GCEO implies that going forward, the NNPC subsidiaries would be managed by the GCEO.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that consequently, the GCEO would now be directly responsible for the overall growth of all the subsidiaries and the holding company (NNPC Limited) and the Group CEO being the chief accounting officer is empowered to make decisions in line with established governances by CAMA.\n\nHowever, the title GCEO comes with additional responsibility for measurable performance, upholding the highest level of professionalism and accountability while acting as the company\u2019s representative in all strategic engagements globally.\n\nThis is a significant departure from the way NNPC used to operate as a corporation where most of the major decisions would have to pass through Federal Executive Council (FEC) approvals, among others.\n\nPIA introduced a landmark reform through the creation of NNPC Limited as a commercially focused CAMA entity that would operate without recourse to direct funding from the federal government.\n\nThis was a monumental change expected to reshape the overall industry in Nigeria while serving as a model for other National Oil Companies (NOCs).\n\nIn addition, this change would naturally come with higher expectations in terms of delivering value, greater responsibility for regulatory compliance, active engagement with stakeholders and above all, a scaled sense of accountability in the entire organisation.\n\n\u201cWe recognise the strategic importance of our talent pool in this journey and winning their commitment to delivering the desired results would continue to encourage us to innovate and reorganize the NNPC in a way that will be motivating and rewarding. We would, therefore, remain innovative in our structure and nomenclatures that fit our aspirations and inspire us to deliver exceptional value,\u201d a top official at the NNPC who pleaded to remain anonymous, told THISDAY.\n\nFurthermore, with the new status, greater emphasis must be placed on corporate governance. PIA 2021 made clear provisions regarding the Board of NNPC Limited. These provisions alongside CAMA mandate NNPC to be structured in a manner that conforms with best practices.\n\nMuhammadu Buhari inaugurated the Board of NNPC Limited and charged the Board members to ensure that the company remains focused on profitability, continuous value creation beyond legal and regulatory compliance, and operational excellence at par with industry peers while acting as an enabler to foster development.\n\nNNPC had explained that it was fully committed to effective corporate governance, accountability, appropriate risk management and sustainable value in the face of the energy transition.\n\nTo achieve this strategic requirement, four committees were set up by the Board of NNPC Limited comprising, the Board Establishment Committee (BEC), Board Finance, Strategy, and Investment Committee (BFSIC), Board Sustainability Committee (BSG) and Board Audit Committee (BAC).\n\nThe responsibilities of the committees are as follows: Board Audit Committee with oversight functions covering internal and external audit, enterprise risk management and internal controls, financial reporting, ethics, and compliance; Board Finance, Strategy and Investment Committee with oversight functions covering strategic planning, financing strategies and capital allocation, investment framework, performance reporting and Information Technology; Board Establishment Committee with oversight functions covering corporate governance, nomination and capacity development, succession planning and remuneration of directors, and Board Sustainability Committee with oversight functions covering long term sustainability, HSE, energy transition and Corporate Social Responsibility among others.\n\nThe Board committees are expected to be carrying out oversight functions of planning and implementation of the company\u2019s strategy and to define a framework for measuring and monitoring the performance of the company.\n\nIn terms of staff welfare, \u201ctoday NNPC is an equal opportunity employer of choice, going into the future, NNPC would be one of the most admired, attractive, and exciting global organisations to work with.\n\n\u201cOur Employee Value Propositions promise to be competitive and working with the company will offer employees the opportunity to actively contribute to creating long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders. This singular sense of fulfilment of professionalism and patriotism for the greater good would be the best form of reward and recognition for our dedicated staff,\u201d the source added.\n\nGroup Managing Director of the NNPC Ltd, Mr Mele Kyari, recently explained: \u201cOn 1st of July, we crossed over to the NNPC Limited both technically and financially on every aspect. Not only that, on the 19th of July, I\u2019m inviting all of you to be present. Mr President will unveil the NNPC Limited to all of us on the 19th of July, and I\u2019m inviting you.\n\n\u201cThe meaning of this to our industry is that you\u2019re going to have the partner of choice, the partner that will support you, the partner that will be the largest capitalised company in Africa. Not only that, a partner that will be born of best practice, of everything that you can think of because we\u2019re going to be a CAMA company. We are going to be another Shell, decision making would be easy, finances will also be easy.\u201d\n\nKyari stated that the NNPC would be very frontal in its moves to acquire as many oil and gas assets as possible with the mindset to become one of the biggest oil firms in the world.\n\n\u201cWhat is very fundamental is that the NNPC is set to be the partner of choice. We will be the biggest capitalised company in Africa. We will be the partner that will be focused on the commercial value of every engagement that we do.\n\n\u201cWe will be the biggest oil and gas company and therefore there will be no distinction between the NNPC and the rest of the partners that we have in this business.\n\nWith Growing Drilling Challenge, Nigeria\u2019s H1 Oil Production Falls by 28m Barrels\n\nMeanwhile, the data from NUPRC showed that Nigeria produced 302.4 million barrels in the first half of 2020, which was regarded as the COVID-19 year, 248.6 million barrels in the same period in 2021, and slumped further to 220.016 million barrels from January to June this year. That is an 11.29 per cent change between 2021 and 2022.\n\nWith the drop from the 302.4 million barrels in the first half of 2020 to 220.016 million barrels in the first half of 2022, Nigeria lost 82 million barrels of production between 2020 and 2022.\n\nThe NUPRC data further showed that in the first six months of 2021, when the world had started recovering from the pandemic, Nigeria also surpassed this year\u2019s six-month drilling total for the same period by 28.6 million barrels.\n\nThe figures highlight the seriousness of the drastic fall in the country\u2019s crude production capacity, which has been blamed on massive oil theft, deteriorating upstream infrastructure, prolonged lack of investment in the sector as well as the inability to restart oil wells shut down in the height of the pandemic.\n\nOf the country\u2019s recorded 35 terminals/streams, the NUPRC data showed that Ajapa, Ima and Anambra Basin remain non-producing, while Tulja-Okwuibome started producing in 2022, after a period of dormancy in 2020 and 2022.\n\nTo underscore the seriousness of the under-production challenge, out of the 1.772 million barrels per day of crude oil allocated to the country by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in June, Nigeria was only able to produce 1.158 million bpd, according to the latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) by the organisation.\n\nA THISDAY review during the week showed that Nigeria\u2019s daily underperformance pegged against the OPEC quota yielded a whopping 614,000 bpd or 19.034 million barrels deficit for the month alone.\n\nA further breakdown revealed that valued against $110 per barrel for the period, Nigeria may have lost as much as $2,093,740,000 to its inability to increase the country\u2019s production level.\n\nFor a country with a huge foreign exchange shortage, the loss could, if it had been plugged, for a start, help cash-strapped federating units (states and local governments) embark on major projects.\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "For the first time, President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday opened up on the intrigues preceding the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), revealing that he was given a list of 30 aspirants to choose a successor but he declined.\n\nBuhari, who stated that the presidential candidate of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu emerged through a free and fair democratic process, added that if he had anointed a candidate, his decision would have affected Vice President Yemi Osinbajo who was also an aspirant.\n\nThe National Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, had 24 hours before the primary election, announced the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, as the party\u2019s consensus presidential candidate, saying that President Buhari was behind the decision.\n\nBut following the backlash that greeted the announcement, President Buhari, according to a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, told the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum in his office in Abuja that he had \u201cno preferred candidate\u201d and had \u201canointed no one\u201d.\n\nProviding more clarification on Saturday when he paid Sallah homage to the Emir of Katsina, Dr Abdulmumini Kabir Usman, at his palace in Katsina, the state capital, President Buhari recalled the circumstances surrounding the emergence of Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the APC presidential candidate.\n\nAccording to him, the APC delegates were given a free hand to elect Tinubu to demonstrate the internal democracy in the party.\n\nPresident Buhari admitted that APC stalwarts gave him a list of 30 presidential aspirants to choose a preferred successor but he declined and allowed the delegates to elect the candidate of their choice, hence the emergence of the former Lagos State governor.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are doing our best and I hope that our efforts will be a blessing. There is nothing more important than peace and because of that those who are instigating insecurity whatever their reasons, we pray God will give us more wisdom to tackle them.\n\n\u201cI was given a list of 30 aspirants to pick from; most of them were my ministers and governors. So, who will I choose or support? One of the governors even came to see me and asked who we should choose.\n\n\u201cBut if I do that, it would affect my vice president because he was listening to our conversation. I then told them to choose who they want. So, they elected Tinubu as APC presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cI hope that the way they (APC) conducted their congress where they elected the party\u2019s National Chairman, the presidential candidate and how the presidential candidate picked his running mate \u2013 I hope the forthcoming (2023) general election will also be peaceful. I hope God will help us to conduct the general election peacefully.\n\n\u201cMay God help us to overcome the problem of this country. But if Nigerians know the condition that other African countries are in, they will thank God for the situation in Nigeria. We are doing our best and hope that God will give us more wisdom to continue to help and serve our people\u201d.\n\nBuhari admonished Nigerians to continue to be patient with the APC-led government and allow peace to reign during the forthcoming 2023 general election.\n\nHe explained that if Nigerians know what other African countries were going through in terms of insecurity and economic challenges, they would appreciate the Nigerian situation and his government\u2019s efforts.\n\nThe president added that there is nothing more important than security and peaceful coexistence and that his government would adopt revolving security measures to nip in the bud those instigating insecurity in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, in a statement issued by presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, President Buhari, said \u201cwhen the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) signalled parties to elect their presidential candidates, we had 30 aspirants, mostly ministers in my cabinet and governors.\n\n\u201cI told each of the aspirants to go and do their best. One particular governor, in his wisdom, came to meet me and asked who they should vote for at the party convention, checking if I had a preferred candidate.\n\n\u201cThere was no need for interference, knowing the competence of all the aspirants. They went and elected Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and he picked his running mate, Senator Kashim Ibrahim, for the 2023 elections. I am praying that we will have peaceful and successful elections,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President while thanking Nigerians for their support for the APC in 2015, and 2019, said he had a rich experience in the 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015 presidential elections, travelling to all the 774 local councils in the country, and in 2019 visiting 36 states.\n\nHis words: \u201cThey say he who wants to serve should be ready for the responsibility of leadership. Three times I wanted this position and three times I ended up at the Supreme Court. For that reason, in terms of experience, I have gathered a lot. I visited 774 local councils in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015.\n\n\u201cI feel privileged that Nigerians elected me in 2015. Since then, we have been doing our best to tackle the challenges, with God helping us. We are not alone. If only we know what other countries in Africa are passing through, we will be grateful to God, and protect our country. Other African countries are passing through a lot.\n\nAccording to him, since Nigerians elected him in 2015, his administration had been doing everything to fix the country.\n\nHe, therefore, called on all citizens to do their best to protect the country, saying if Nigerians know how difficult it has been for other African countries, they will thank God for their country.\n\n\u201cAs leaders, we are doing our best and will keep doing our best to improve the situation. I am praying that the Almighty God will give us more strength and wisdom to protect our people, and fulfil our promises of ensuring wellbeing\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also urged all Nigerians to be tolerant of the government as it continues to tackle the challenges facing the country, noting that the situation is worse in other African countries.\n\nEarlier, the Emir called on the president to expedite actions for the completion of the Kano-Katsina road dualisation project; the Kano-Katsina-Maradi railway and the Rimi Windmill Power generation projects.\n\nThe traditional ruler said apart from contributing to the economic and social development of Katsina State, the projects if completed would also generate employment opportunities for unemployed youths in the state.\n\nIn his remarks, Governor Aminu Bello Masari said security operatives were doing all they could to tackle banditry and other crimes in the state, calling on residents to also give them the needed support to ward off the criminals.\n\nGovernor Masari in the company of other top government officials later saw the president off to the Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua Airport where he later took off for Abuja in a Nigeria Air Force (NAF) plane.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Francis Sardauna in Katsina",
