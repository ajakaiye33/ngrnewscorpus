          "text": "The Council of Igbo Elders has said Ndigbo are not desperate for the presidency to warrant the outburst of Chief Raymond Dokpesi that if an Igbo man becomes president of Nigeria he will divide the country.\n\nThe former Chairman of DAAR Communications Plc and a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party had through a statement on Monday alluded that Nigerians feared a president of Igbo extraction would allow the country\u2019s breakup, citing separatist agitation by Indigenous People of Biafra in the South East.\n\nDokpesi had said, \u201cIf nobody has told Ohanaeze Ndigbo before, the concern today from some other regions is that if Nnamdi Kanu plays the role of Aguiyi Ironsi in leading a militant revolt against constitutional government in the South-East under Igbo presidency, the president will be pressured by his base to facilitate the UN processes for the South-East to call for independence from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThus an Igbo president may be compromised in protecting the political and geographic boundaries of Nigeria whilst Nigeria remains under the threat of IPOB\u2019s secessionist activities.\u201d\n\nBut Chairman, Council of Igbo Elders, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, in an interview with The PUNCH on Tuesday, pointed out that there were agitations for separation across the regions today.\n\nIwuanyanwu, while describing Dokpesi\u2019s statement as unfortunate, said Ndigbo had supported a united Nigeria practically, making investment all over the country.\n\n\u201cWhat he said is just like somebody who says if you give the presidency to somebody from North-East or North-West that the people will break away because Boko Haram want to break away from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram has even conquered part of those places and occupied some local governments. There is no local government in South-East where you have everybody saying this is Biafra apart from the protest which stemmed from injustice and unfair treatment of Igbos in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Publisher of Champion Newspapers said the argument of Chief Dokpesi was faulty.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe truth is that there is problem all over the country, North-East and North-West you have the problem of Boko Haram and ISWAP and they have even come up in the Middle-Belt.\n\n\u201cIn the South-West, we have Oduduwa groups; in the South-East, we have pro-Biafra groups; South-South too have people agitating.\n\n\u201cSo, the truth is that all patriotic Nigerians should come together, and do whatever we can to unite Nigeria, and you don\u2019t do that by discriminating against any tribe.\u201d\n\nThe elder statesman asked people like Dokpesi to preach justice, equity and fairness which he said was the cause of all the agitations in the country instead of spreading hatred.\n\nHe added that elders should be able to talk truth to leaders so that they would be able to do what they could to unite Nigeria and make Nigeria a great country.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Our member\u2019s jobs are being taken over by so many committees in the universities.\n\n\u201d There is the issue of nonpayment of salaries especially for our members in state universities. Some have not received salaries for up to six months, yet we hear that NUC is giving accreditation to new state universities.\n\n\u201cNUC should ensure that our members are not languishing in their offices. We are also disturbed over the negative development of nonuniformity in the Conditions of Service in the universities. This is happening to the morale of our members. We call for a uniform standard in the universities.\u201d\n\nThe association frowned at the alleged discrimination in the payment of salary at the Federal University of Technology, Akure, FUTA, were only teaching staff were said to have been paid salary by the authorities of the institution.",

          "title": "Why Nigeria should radically invest in vocational education",
          "text": "More than ever before, the vital road not yet taken in our educational system is staring us in the face. That is Technical and Vocational Education and Training, TVET. The term is so comprehensive \u2013 yet so precise \u2013 that one can feel the effects of its absence in every critical area of our national life. Since our mutual pretence that all is well with our policy in the sector has not saved us from the blind alley in which we have found ourselves in terms of development gap, it\u2019s high time we told ourselves the truth that our educational ideology and system should be reconfigured in favour of TVET.\n\nTVET refers to aspects of the educational process involving, in addition to general education, the study of technologies and related sciences, as well as the acquisition of practical skills, attitudes, understanding and knowledge relating to occupants in various sectors of economic and social life. UNESCO and the International Labour Organisation agree on this definition, a description that shows that TVET is so encompassing that it also largely accommodates academic knowledge, as symbolised by \u2018general education\u2019.\n\nThe importance of TVET in every society makes our uninspiring handling of it in Nigeria self-destructing. Ours is a country where there is a huge infrastructural gap. As a consuming economy, we import things produced via TVET by other lands, thus shelling out our barely available forex to the detriment of our prosperity. We not only import equipment and various tools, we also import technical hands to handle them. In our show of unwisdom, we compare artisans from other countries to ours and gleefully conclude that the foreigners (even from as near as Cotonou in the Republic of Benin) are better. And that is often the truth because we fail to give our people proper technical, vocational and entrepreneurial education, all of which TVET covers, while it does not leave literacy behind.\n\nThe aim of TVET is basically to ensure that our youths are empowered, for them to be responsible citizens, responsible to themselves so that they won\u2019t be a burden to society.\n\nIf we look at the trend of youth populations globally, we will find out that we have cause to worry in Nigeria. For instance, while it is low in the Middle East and Latin America, and coming down in Asia, it is shooting up in Africa, particularly Nigeria. Now, this is a time bomb if we don\u2019t do something about it. How many industries are we going to establish to catch up with this growing rate? So, if we are not waiting for tomorrow that is laden with disaster, we have to do something about it. And the time to do that is yesterday!\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nTowards deepening TVET in Nigeria, there is a lot we can learn from countries such as China and India. Although I will not be able to fully dissect their policies in this article, it is worthy of note that they put TVET on the same pedestal as academic education, if not higher than it in some areas. A proof of this is found in the high numbers of their well-administered TVET institutions. While China has 15, 091 of such institutions, India has 14, 312. Nigeria? Just 406 plus 222 polytechnics! Figures apart, China has a structure that makes it compulsory for every pupil to have TVET education in the foundation school, even if they are not going to specialise in it later. The policy then provides a smooth and clear path towards specialisation as the individual climbs the ladder of education. Very importantly too, it makes the ladder so flexible that one can cross from scholarship to TVET and vice-versa. It does not make either a junior or suffering option. And the result of that is visible in terms of the development that has become its lot.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIronically, Nigeria also started early and well. But, in the same way we have lost many values and other assets in every facet of our lives, we could not preserve what we envisioned. The first Nigerian higher educational and/or technical institute was established in1947 \u2013 Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH). It offers training in applied sciences, engineering, technology, commerce and management, agricultural production and distribution, and research. In 1952, three Colleges of Arts, Science and Technology were established in Zaria, Ibadan and Enugu. But enrolment was poor because of the general belief then that technical education is inferior to other types of education. It was thus not surprising that, in 1962, the three colleges were closed and their assets taken over by the first-generation universities of Ife, Zaria and Nsukka. In the 1970s more universities, polytechnics, and other colleges of higher learning were established but most of them were not technical-oriented as they offer courses in liberal arts, social sciences and sciences.\n\nFor us to get it right, as it is never too late for a people to correct a blunder as grave as neglecting TVET, technical education should be introduced and strengthened in our education policy. It should not be treated as being junior or inferior to intellectual education because if an inspiring perspective is not created about it from policy level, we will be sending a wrong signal to society. The policy should also be accordingly implemented. Awareness should be created massively that academic education and TVET are not mutually exclusive. Put differently, everyone needs to know that having vocational and technical education does not mean illiteracy in scholarship. The beauty of the system, indeed, is that it accommodates the intellectual, physical and creative domains.\n\nAlso, TVET should be introduced and taught right from foundation schools. This will generate the interest of children early enough, so that they will grow up with its idea. Many of them will eventually specialise in it later. In this light, we must train and encourage more TVET teachers. The training should involve both academic and industry experts. We should also consciously standardise the conditions of service of the educators to erase the picture of inferiority often presented in our society. The above, coupled with the need for massive awareness creation, are capable of revolutionising TVET in Nigeria, and it will put us on the road of genuine all-round development.\n\nI have some good news to share in this respect about the philosophy of the First Technical University (Tech-U) with regards to TVET. Travelling this road less travelled, Tech-U puts technical, vocational and entrepreneurial competence at the heart of scholarship. Upon resumption, for instance, students are exposed to mandatory four weeks vocational and technical training. No matter the courses they are pursuing, they are later integrated into the Directorate of Technical, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training to bridge the gap between theory and practice. We have also established the Directorate of Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer to coordinate IP and Industrial synergy, just as we foster town and gown relationship through strong synergy with the industries and technical/professional bodies.\n\nOf course, the university also appoints professionals as members of the faculties. At the end of our programmes, students will thus able be to stand out whether in employment or as employers. It is a system that has already started yielding results based of the feedback we get from organisations that they join for industrial attachment. Besides, some of them have been involved in construction work \u2013 painting, welding, fabrication, electrical etc. \u2013 going on campus. They are involved not as ordinary labourers but, on their own volition, as supporting hands for contractors who find them incredibly reliable. This is part of the reason the university has made provision for start-up fund for those of them with brilliant entrepreneurial and technical ideas. It is this kind of experience that has turned one an advocate of TVET on a fundamental scale, at the state and national levels.",

          "title": "APC chairmanship, Buhari\u2019s legacies and matters arising",
          "text": "The merger of four political parties in a mega opposition to the ruling Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP) in 2013 was a radical step taken to salvage the country from ruin, despair and hopelessness as a result of a lack of internal democracy, colossal corruption in key government institutions and a brazen disrespect for the rule of law.\n\nThe urgency to redeem Nigeria\u2019s global image as a haven for lawlessness and corrupt practices heralded the coming together of these political parties \u2013\u2013 the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA).\n\nIn retrospect, this alliance achieved its stated aim of taking power from the men who supervised the illegal sharing of our national assets to their cronies; weakened the armed forces through the diversion of funds approved for arms procurement, and the mismanagement of the country\u2019s foreign reserves.\n\nThe adoption of President Muhammadu Buhari as the presidential candidate of the newly formed All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2014 was hinged on his impeccable record of integrity, his simple approach to life and his background as former military ruler. The odds were in his favour and this goodwill was extended to more than 80% of the candidates that contested elections under the party \u2013 as they recorded a clean sweep in their various elections.\n\nMuch has been achieved by the ruling APC since it took power in 2015. The need to sustain the legacies bequeathed to the party by President Buhari on account of his goodwill and the events that occurred during and after the 2019 general elections has given more compelling importance on who emerges as the national chairman of the Nigeria\u2019s foremost party, APC.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn recent times, the media has been inundated with an x-ray of the candidates jostling for the national chairmanship position. As at the last count, close to 10 aspirants comprising of former governors, former and serving senators have directly or indirectly indicated interest to contest the vacant chairmanship position.\n\nBased on their recent activities related to the chairmanship position, Senators Tanko Al-Makura and Mohammed Sani Musa, former governors Abdulaziz Yari and Ali Modu Sheriff have stepped up their engagements within the party and in the media. It is commonplace to have the prospective candidates engage with party stalwarts and members of the fourth estate of the realm before making a formal elaborate pronouncement.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNo doubt, these candidates have enriched the outlook of the APC as a national party in their various states either during its formative years or at its later stage. Put differently, these are men of timber and calibre who have done their bits in the shaping of the party into the formidable force that it is today.\n\nBut then, the challenge that will face the party in the coming years goes beyond mere consolidation; it is about taking the party to the next level, ensuring the sustenance of its ideals as indeed the legacies of the current administration. That obviously requires new breathe of vision, energy and dynamism. This is where the question of the qualities of the individual aspirants to the office comes in. In other words, it comes to the question of whether the party can source for a fresh broom.\n\nThis is perhaps where the candidacy of the senator from Niger East, Sani Musa, comes across as interesting. Obviously, he does not belong to the class of the former governors often regarded as the \u2018heavyweights\u2019. Yet, he cannot be described as a pushover by any stretch of imagination.\n\nA silent player and achiever, his numerous selfless activities in and out of the party is outstanding if not unequalled. As the highest individual financial contributor to the APC in Niger State during and after the 2015 and 2019 elections, he presented election materials, vehicles for easy transportation, branded billboards and other souvenirs alongside radio and television jingles that conveyed the party\u2019s message to the remotest parts of the state. In this he has been consistent since 2014 in his contribution to the development of the party both at the state and national level. In the build-up to the 2015 general elections, he furnished and maintained the biggest campaign office in the country which happens to be that of his home state of Niger which inevitably served as the campaign headquarters of presidential and other elections in the state.\n\nNo doubt, there is also a lot to say about his highly cosmopolitan outlook which accounts for why he\u2019s highly respected among his peers in the National Assembly where he currently serves; his strong advocacy for inclusivity and his capacity to build bridges between the young and the old, and among the different groups in the Nigerian federation. Those virtues will surely serve the party well at this time.\n\nOne other factor going well for candidacy for the Niger East senator, Sani Musa, might well be the silent restructuring already on-going within the APC itself. Political analysts privy to the workings of the party have alluded to the body language of President Buhari and other top leaders within the party echelon as being unenthusiastic at the possibility of a former governor\u2019s emerging as party chair owing to what some have described as their overbearing tendencies. The argument here goes that the governors, having tasted of the enormous powers as chief executive of their states, stand the risk of seeking to run the party as if it is an extension of the states they previously governed. Some analysts, drawing from the party\u2019s recent odyssey appear to suggest that the experiences have not been stellar. Here, it is said of Senator Musa that he possesses all the right qualities to lead the party as its chairman without the highhandedness that the party\u2019s rank and file experienced in the hand of a former chairman who often handled party as if it was his personal fiefdom.\n\nAbove all, Musa has distinguished himself as a loyal party man with the requisite leadership acumen to carry on and sustain the legacies of President Buhari for the All Progressives Congress. He is as progressives as they come, a master-strategist, shrewd mobiliser who is not only passionate about the wholesome development of the nation but has the capacity to manage diverse people and interests irrespective of tribe and religion.",

          "title": "EndSARS: Why youths must tread with caution",
          "text": "October 20, 2020 will be forever entrenched on the national pages of this great nation, the #EndSARS campaign might have come and gone, however we cannot deny that it is an event which will continue to linger on in the minds of the majority.\n\nThe campaign started with the publication of a petition by convener Segun Awosanya. It was signed by 10,195 Nigerians and submitted to the National Assembly with the major demand on the government to scrap the police unit.\n\nThe Twitter campaign started on December 2, 2017, when a footage of police officers attached to the unit shot and killed a man surfaced online. The campaign became a trending topic on Twitter with over 400,000 Tweets within 12 hours.\n\nIn October 2020, Nigerians turned the online campaign to protest. Nigerians using 280 characters detailing their horrible and harrowing experiences with SARS, the dreaded unit of the police created to fight banditry. Before the campaign, there had been isolated cases of police brutality all over the country. However, it was during the campaign that the damage caused by such brutality was discovered.\n\nWhile we must salute the conscious efforts of the honest Nigerian youths who sought to make a change for the better good of all, we must also agree that it is the constitutional rights of citizens to have a peaceful rally or gathering. We must equally bear it in mind that history has taught us that many of these movements always metamorphose to a rowdy affair and becomes disruptive leading to narratives which speaks no good.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nCounting down to October 20, reports have it that Nigerian youths are planning a memorial protest in honour of those that lost their lives at the Lekki toll gate shooting in 2020. Based on this development, it is important that we take a critical look back at the incident, consider its implications as well as the aftermath of the movement turned riot.\n\nWhat began as a peaceful protest was eventually hijacked by hoodlums and this led to the loss of lives and wanton destruction. Despite the presence of security agents and imposition of curfew in the state, the hoodlums carried out their actions unchecked. Many buildings were burnt, with properties destroyed and looted.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to the Lagos police spokesperson, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, about 17 police stations were burnt by hoodlums in the state.\n\nThese stations include Idimu, Igando, Layeni, Denton, Ilenbe Hausa, Ajah, Amukoko, Ilasa, Cele Outpost under Ijesha, disbanded SARS office under Ajegunle, Ebute-Ero, Mushin (Olosan), Ojo, Ajegunle, Ikotun, and Ojodu. Properties found within the premises of the police stations, including vehicles, were also destroyed, while valuables, including weapons, were carted away by the criminal elements.\n\nThe oldest court in Nigeria, the Federal High Court at Igbosere, Lagos was razed down by hoodlums. Many case files were burnt in the fire, while others were carted away, Valuables, including desktop computers, air conditioners, refrigerators, chairs and others were also carted away by the hoodlums.\n\nAlso, the palace of the Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu was also attacked during the violence just as the governor\u2019s family house was also burnt down while the headquarters of Television Continental [TVC] was also burnt to the ground. The hoodlums extended their attacks to the Lagos State bus terminals at Oyingbo, Yaba and Berger. Several buses at the Oyingbo terminus were set ablaze, while some parts of Yaba and Berger bus terminals were torched by the criminals.\n\nMutiu Yekeen, Head of Corporate Communications, Primero Transport Services (PTS) Ltd, owners of BRT Buses, said the company lost over N100 million in six days resulting from the protest, which has had the nation\u2019s economic capital ravaged, while the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI, 2020) disclosed that Nigeria lost more than N700 billion in economic value in the aftermath of the EndSARS protests.\n\nThe economic loss suffered by Lagos State and Nigeria at large cannot be fully quantified, and we cannot afford to have a similar experience again. The nation is at a critical time of rebuilding and we need to collectively protect and preserve our assets. The governor of Lagos State must be commended for the proactive steps taken by him to address the situation, restoring normalcy and rebuilding the state\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Lagos State government recently through the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry awarded a total sum of N91 Million as compensation to 16 petitioners for the brutality, harassment, extortion and extra-judicial killings of their loved ones by the police officers. It would also be recalled that the panel has previously awarded a total of N171 million as compensation to 31 petitioners. This is a visible trait of a governor who will never allow any setback discourage him from fulfilling his mandate.\n\nEven as the youths intend to celebrate a memorial in honour of those who lost their lives during the struggle, history has shown to us that even the most honest and pure of intentions can be hijacked by unscrupulous elements. The #EndSARS protest started as a genuine and progressive movement, but it was marred by hoodlums. Also the youths need to thread with caution to ensure that no death is recorded again. Lives are irreplaceable and they must by all means ensure that they guard themselves and their activities against any and every factors that may militate against the peace in our society.\n\nNigeria is ours, and in our drive to push for a better narrative, we must be careful so that we do not fall victims to avoidable traps.",

          "text": "As [email protected] in mid-October, celebrates the 61st year, ask if Nigeria PLC on sale to the highest political bidders?\n\nOur democratic structure, NASS, lacking altruism, refuses to cut by 75%, its Salaries and Perks, SAPping Nigeria dry or restructure Nigeria and stood against comprehensive electronic voting, diaspora and local. These are vicious stabs in the poorly beating heart of a democracy still on life-support.\n\nHurray, NASS has caved to public outcry and reversed its selfish \u2018Ban on electronic vote transmission\u2019. This 21st century has strange anti-democracy backlashes \u2018against modernisation and innovation\u2019 but allowing \u2018anti-education\u2019 terrorists to use \u2018modernised and innovative\u2019 military transport and weaponry. NASS must learn that \u2018Electronic Voting\u2019 is now Course 1-0-1 to legitimise democratic governance. Also, NASS instead of boldly securing for the citizenry a befitting National Library, seeks to selfishly refurbish its own nearly \u2018abandoned\u2019 NASS library as a copycat of the American National Library of Congress. The best ideas are often used in Nigeria to repeatedly misappropriate funds. Even book business is dragged into corruption.\n\nNASS, please ensure that Nigeria\u2019s public National Library is befitting\u2019 before a \u2018befitting\u2019 NASS library. If NASS members really read and value books, they would never have taken till 2021 to \u2018discover\u2019 the NASS library deficit. Has any NASS official bemoaned the Nationwide Library Book Deficiency of 50-300m for 10-15m students at 5-20 library books each?\n\nIt was shocking to all that \u2018electronic voting\u2019 in Nigeria was not a single act but was Machiavelli-like secretly split into \u2018actual electronic voting\u2019 and ET \u2018Electronic Transmission of vote results\u2019 \u2013 \u2018contract-splitting\u2019. Such evil comes from malignant midnight brainstorming in unscrupulous political and technocratic circles previously notorious for \u2018home grown\u2019 political manipulations perpetuating a disruptive political agenda.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSadly, nasty political gambles have spanned mathematical creations like 12 2/3 of states, \u2018annulments\u2019, third term magic, reversible/deniable zoning, money under the hat or in the belly of an agbada or babanriga, votes in a phantom pregnancy or a pot belly for ever-reoccurring \u2018stuffed ballot boxes \u2019, \u2018snatched ballot box\u2019, the criminal falsification and fraudulent replacement of \u2018voter results\u2019 during transportation from polling booth to the collation centre. Add the debatable value of contract-splitting specifically for corruption like Contract 1 for clearing of gutter and the never executed but awarded Contract 2 for clearing of the rubbish dumped by the cleared gutter rubbish. The rubbish then falls back into the gutter with zero gain and financial cost. Add non-corrupt contract splitting \u2018supposedly\u2019 to speed up the job like the two contractors on the 120km Lagos-Ibadan Road and, shame on an obstructive NASS which diverted N120b budgeted \u2018job-finishing funds\u2019 to NASS constituency projects\u2019 not finished to date after 8+ years later. Add snakes or other creatures supposedly found in the transformer and office safe chopping all the money. As you have worked to improve the country, some Fellow Nigerians sat around actual tables discussing ways to implement these crimes against Nigeria, in thousands of places and many times over, nationwide in honour of the elusive true Federal Character! The court martials surrounding the Fayose Ekiti Elections confirm such election disruption meetings. Wherever good men and women sit to save and serve Nigeria best, others sit with self-service and destruction of the nation and the electoral process as goal.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThankfully INEC chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu is nobody\u2019s \u2018yes man\u2019 and refused to be silenced just because NASS had spoken. He risked being humiliated or sacked or even having false accusations of fraud and threats. He immediately protested, also a credit to the INEC commissioners, on behalf of voters, against electoral corruption-motivated misinformation. Others joined, including media, CSOs and international organisations assisting to drag Nigeria into modern electoral processes.\n\nWell, congratulations to Professor Yakubu and all others; NASS has approved Electronic Voting and Electronic Results Transmission. This will speed up and help sanitise the process. It removes travel time with extra security challenges to staff and theft or alteration between polling booth and collation centre, the headquarters, speeding up the electoral process in 70-80% of the country. If only Nigeria\u2019s courts were fully computerised and backed up.\n\nThe next battle is for \u2018Diaspora Voting\u2019. Nigerians get $17-24b annually from Nigerian remittances. Diaspora Nigerians want to vote and would have a huge election impact. Presumably that is the fear of the anti-diaspora voting lobby which would lose power.\n\nHowever, the battle for free and fair elections cannot be won if NASS still approves excessive ceilings for candidate spending \u2013 president N2b, governor N1b and senator N500m with background 70% Nigerian poverty. No politician or political party is \u2018humanitarian\u2019. Money nearing these figures must be raised and spent by each candidate, cumulatively dwarfing budgets for states and many federal ministries. All this money must be recouped, by every single politician in and out of office as 10-70% first line deductions, during political office usually from nearly phantom contracts, fictitious contracts feeding insatiable -political party structures, supporters, as political favours for election investors or for planning a \u2018next election war chest\u2019 of maybe N100b\u2019.\n\nHow can a governor perform with such deductions from the budget? Our winner-takes-all politics creates losers who pester same-party state governors who cut infrastructure, pensions and salaries of workers to \u2018help\u2019 pay up such \u2018political debt\u2019. The people lose perpetually. Knowing us, the midnight manipulators may manipulate even this NASS assent into malignant manifestation \u2013 like the rubbishing of Federal Character. A luta continua. Victoria non\u2013acerta.",

          "text": "\u2022Obaigbena salutes a man who chaired event that birthed ARISE Group\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and James Sowole in Abeokuta\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan, have extended the sympathy of the Nigerian government to the United States President, Joe Biden, and the people of America over the demise of a former US Secretary of State, General Colin Powell.\n\nThey expressed their feelings over the demise of Powell in separate statements yesterday.\n\nAlso paying tribute to the late former Secretary of State, the Chairman and Editor-in-Chief of THISDAY/ARISE Media Group, Prince Nduka Obaigbena, saluted Powell for his support and inspiration that ultimately helped to birth ARISE News Channel. According to him, \u201cPowell enabled the emergence of Arise News Channel, Africa\u2019s leading global broadcaster, through his support for the Arise Magazine and the Africa Rising Festival, which he Chaired at the Royal Albert Hall, London in 2008. Arise Magazine, the global style and culture platform later transformed into the Arise News Channel in 2013 and is now available to over 200 million people around the world on multiple platforms.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, said he believed that as the first African-American Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military position in the US Department of Defense as well as the first African-American Secretary of State, Powell was a great statesman and a global icon in every sense of it.\n\nHe recounted that as US Secretary of State, Powell played a very important role in advancing his country\u2019s foreign policy and national defence interests as well as being a great advocate of the eradication of Polio and addressing the deadly spread of HIV/AIDS disease in Africa.\n\nBuhari said his prayers and thoughts were with Powell\u2019s family and the people of the United States as they mourned the death of an exceptional leader and one of America\u2019s greatest prides, who as a professional soldier, a distinguished public servant and an effective diplomat, gave his utmost for his country.\n\nObasanjo, in his message, described the death of Powell as a loss not only to the America, but to the entire world, stressing that the late Powell was a trusted colleague and Comrade-in-arm, whose closeness as an African-American with the mother Africa assisted in the growth of the continent.\n\nIn a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo said, \u201cGeneral Powell\u2019s tenure in office marked a significant departure from the traditional relations between Africa and the United States.\n\n\u201cHe was Secretary of State under the administration of President George W. Bush, Jnr, part of the time I was President of Nigeria. He was not just an African-American, he was an African-American, who understood Africa. That is what I found in him, when he was Secretary of State.\n\n\u201cWith him, among others, I have always seen advantage in the closeness of the African-Americans with the mother Africa. It is mutually good and beneficial for the Africans at home and for our brothers and sisters in diaspora in the US, Caribbean or Southern America.\n\n\u201cI cherished our relationship for the good of humanity in general and especially, for the good of our race, which collectively is the most abused, despised and disregarded race in modern history. He was indeed a trusted colleague and Comrade-in-Arm,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nThe former president noted that the news of Powell\u2019s death was received with sadness, adding, \u201chis death is a great loss not only to his immediate family and to the United States of America but also to the entire world.\n\n\u201cThough the world, particularly Africa, would miss him, his legacies would continue to inspire many to reach the highest points of their productive, political and creative abilities. May God grant his soul perfect peace and rest.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Jonathan in a tribute personally signed, described late Powell as a renowned United States public servant and great leader, who left solid and indelible footprints in the sands of time.\n\nHe also stated that his stellar military career paved the way for other African Americans to reach for the top, because he articulated a new paradigm for engaging in military action.\n\nThe former President, in a statement by his Special Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, stated: \u201cUntil the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, Colin Powel was the highest ranking African-American to have served in the public sector of the United States. In that capacity, he served as a beacon of hope and was a pride of the Black Race.\n\n\u201cHis stellar military career, which saw him become the first Black Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which pivoted him to also becoming the first US Secretary of State of colour, paved the way for other African-Americans to reach for the top. His articulation of the Powell Doctrine gave the United States, and the world at large, a new paradigm for engaging in military action with honour and decorum.\n\n\u201cAs Secretary of State, he was known for his tactful management of America\u2019s foreign relations, of which he extended a right hand of fellowship to the Yar\u2019Adua administration, when I was Vice President.\n\n\u201cHis death, at 84 after a long, useful and fulfilled life, is mourned by my family and I, as well as the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation. He left solid and indelible footprints in the sands of time, and would be greatly missed. Our prayers are with his family at this trying time for them.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s former Minister of External Affairs, Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi, said his admiration for the late Powell was usually for his astute military insights and less for his political performance.\n\nThe former Director General of the Nigeria Institute International Affairs (NIIA) explained that, \u201cFor instance, while evicting Sadam Hussain\u2019s military from Kuwait, he declared it would be a strategic mistake to overthrow Sadam himself. That view has been vindicated. That he got roped into the weapons of mass destruction deception is the stuff of politics, which perhaps explains his disdain of it.\n\n\u201cThe second reason for my admiration is what is now referred to as the Colin Powell doctrine about the need of \u2018overwhelming force\u2019 to guarantee military victory. In this respect, I recall a debate about the appropriate size of the Nigerian army in the aftermath of the Nigerian civil war.\n\n\u201cLeading the side for downsizing were military Hawks like Gen TY Danjuma (and some of his colleagues in the Ruling Council) who saw a \u2018small compact and mobile Force\u2019 as being more economical for national defence arrangement,\u201d Akinyemi explained.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that then, in opposition was a group whose prominent advocate was himself, saying he preferred a large military for purposes of National defence.\n\nAkinyemi said he had argued then that there could be circumstances when only overwhelming force could win a war (a sort of Colin Powell doctrine).\n\n\u201cSuch circumstances as when a nation is besieged by guerilla warfare that overstretches the military. The military proponents decided to prune the military from about a quarter of a million men to about 100 thousand.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Powell\u2019s support for the Arise Magazine and the Africa Rising Festival, two major ideas that changed the course of Africa\u2019s entertainment and social space would later transform into the Arise Television Group, Nigeria\u2019s foremost international television station, acclaimed to be shattering ceilings.\n\nPowell, during one of the festivals that usually featured musical concerts of both local and international acts, had performed a popular \u201cYahooze dance\u201d with the crooner, Olu Maintain, to the awe of the world.\n\nBoth Arise Magazine and the Africa Rising Festival, ultimately gave rise to the fast rising television station of global standard, Arise News Channel.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says their days are numbered\n\n\u2022Troops kill 10 in Kaduna\n\n\u2022Tambuwal calls for coordinated operations in state\n\n\u2022Ortom worries about situation in schools\n\n\u2022US expresses readiness to help\n\nDeji Elumoye, Michael Olugbode in Abuja, George Okoh In Makurdi, John Shiklam in Kaduna and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday declared total war on bandits wreaking havoc in parts of the country, saying their days are numbered. The president, who was reacting to the killing, on Sunday, of over 40 people by bandits at Goronyo market, in Sokoto State, sent a tough warning to the criminals and declared, \u201cThe clock of your ultimate destruction is ticking as you will no longer have a place to hide.\u201d\n\nBuhari had earlier taken a critical look at the security situation in the country before news of the massacre in Sokoto State filtered in. He had boasted that the military and other security agencies were recording greater successes in the bid to rid the country of insecurity.\n\nThe president, however, counselled the Nigerian media on the need for accurate reportage of security and safety issues by replacing the usage of phrases, like \u201crising insecurity\u201d, with \u201cdeclining insecurity\u201d.\n\nBut in Kaduna State, security forces reportedly killed 10 bandits in Kwanan Bataru, Giwa Local Government Area.\n\nGovernor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, reacting to the killing in his state, called on the Nigeria Army to carry out coordinated operations in the North-west to help stamp out banditry in the region.\n\nIn a similar vein, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom expressed concerns about recent attacks and kidnapping of students in schools across the country.\n\nUnited States reiterated its readiness to lend support to Nigeria in its bid to contain insecurity.\n\nBuhari, in a release by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, declared, \u201cThe days of the bandits are, indeed, numbered, because the military capabilities of our forces are being boosted by the acquisition and deployment of advanced equipment.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe bandits are living in the fool\u2019s paradise of invincibility, but reality will soon dawn on them harder than ever before.\u201d\n\nBuhari added, \u201cThe bandits are currently under desperate pressures, because of the intense and sustained air and ground operations against them in their hideouts by our security forces.\n\n\u201cThe cowardly attacks on innocent people by the bandits show a rearguard action of criminals under pressure. But they will have no place to hide and our gallant security forces will not relent in the current offensive to defeat these callous enemies of humanity.\u201d\n\nThe president appealed to Nigerians not to despair, because his administration was determined, more than ever before, to protect Nigerians from murderous criminal gangs with no respect for the sanctity of human of life. He extended his sympathy to the families of the victims of the Goronyo attack and called on the people to remain patient, as the military strategised on how to crush the bandits.\n\nIn yet another presidential message by Shehu, to felicitate with the Muslim Ummah, Nigerians of all faiths and the followers of Islam all over the world on the occasion of Maulud-Un-Nabiyy, Buhari gave a snapshot of the increased activities of the armed forces, the police, and intelligence agencies to effectively respond to the security challenges in the country. He said the increased cooperation from the citizenry, coupled with reinvigorated, dynamic, and energised police, security and military leadership was helping the administration score more victories against terror, criminality, and economic sabotage.\n\nHe argued that the reality of declining insecurity should replace the inaccurate narrative of rising insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cWhile there is work to do, the men and women in uniform, who are helping the nation to achieve this goal, desire our collective appreciation and encouragement to do even more,\u201d Buhari said. \u201cThe whole country and its mass communications systems have a duty in this regard,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the government expected and intended for those trends to continue, and called on the media to address the tone, content, and standards of reporting on security and safety measures.\n\nHe said the time had come for the media to revise the prefixes \u201crising insecurity\u201d with \u201cdeclining insecurity.\u201d\n\nIn his felicitation with the Muslim Ummah to mark the Eid-Ul-Maulud on Tuesday, which has been declared a public holiday throughout the federation, Buhari said, \u201cI am delighted to send greetings of peace, unity and goodwill to the Muslim Ummah, fellow citizens, and Muslims all over the world as they observe and celebrate Eid-ul- Maulud.\u201d\n\nHe urged Muslims to strive for \u201cforgiveness and closeness to the noble life and teachings of the Prophet (SAW), whose birthday is being marked on this blessed day. On this auspicious occasion, I wish you all the blessings of today.\u201d\n\nSecurity Forces Kill 10 Bandits in Kaduna\n\nSecurity forces reportedly killed 10 bandits in Kwanan Bataru, Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nHowever, one person was killed while three others were abducted by bandits in Oil Village, a community located near Kaduna Refinery in Chikun Local Government Area of the state. The bandits were said to have invaded Oil Village on Saturday night, unleashing terror on the residents.\n\nSources in the community said one Mr. Auta was killed by the bandits while attempting to alert the community about the presence of the criminals.\n\nOne source said, \u201cMr. Auta noticed the presence of the bandits and he sneaked out of his house to alert the community since telephone services had been cut off.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, as he was manoeuvring his way out to alert the community, the bandits sighted him and shot him dead. The bandits were many and were well armed, we couldn\u2019t alert security agencies, because telecom services had been cut off in our area.\u201d\n\nHe added that three other people, including a medical doctor and his son, where abducted. The doctor was said to have withdrawn his son from one of the schools for fear of kidnappers, only to be abducted at home.\n\nAnother resident of the area, who shared the information on a WhatsApp platform of \u201cCommunity News Update\u201d, said the bandits invaded the community about 11pm on Saturday, killing one of his neighbours while another neighbour and his son were abducted. Lamenting the situation, he solicited for prayers from members of the platform.\n\nKaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, disclosed that 10 bandits were killed by security forces in Kwanan Bataru, on the outskirts of Fatika in Giwa Local Government Area. In a statement on Monday, Aruwan said the bandits were neutralised in a gun duel with security forces, adding that several others escaped with gun shot injuries.\n\nAruwan stated, \u201cOne Alhaji Abubakar Usman, who is likely to have been kidnapped in a neighbouring state and was being held by bandits in the area, was rescued by the troops, and is being debriefed at the moment.\n\n\u201cThe bandits, who managed to escape, left behind several motorcycles, one revolver, mobile phones, torchlights and some charms. One of the sheds used by the bandits to hold hostages was burnt.\u201d\n\nBandits Attack Sokoto Sunday Market, Kill 40\n\nNo fewer than 40 people were killed as suspected bandits attacked a market in Goronyo Local Government Area of Sokoto State. The armed men attacked the market on Sunday, which happened to be the market day.\n\nSources in the village said the marauders attacked the market in large numbers and started shooting sporadically, leading to the death of over 40 persons.\n\nA source, which spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed that the casualty figure was over 40, as the area was still unsafe for residents to access. The attack was the third in the area in two weeks.\n\nLast Thursday, suspected members of the outlawed volunteer vigilante group, also known as Yan Sakai, attacked and killed nine Fulanis at Manmade market in Gwadabawa Local Government Area of the state. Suspected bandits also killed 20 persons at Ungwan Lalle market, in Sabon Birni Local government Area of Sokoto State.\n\nThe Sokoto State government had earlier ordered the closure of markets in the Eastern Senatorial District of the state as a measure to fight the rising insecurity in the state.\n\nTambuwal Calls for Coordinated Operations in Sokoto\n\nSokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal called on the Nigerian Army to carry out coordinated operations in the North-west to stamp out banditry in the region. Tambuwal made the call on Monday, when the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Faruk Yahaya, paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Sokoto, the state capital.\n\nThe governor disclosed that the operations of the army in Zamfara State were having a negative effect on Sokoto State, especially, the Eastern part of the state, hence the need to carry out the operations simultaneously.\n\n\u201cBetween yesterday and today, we have lost many people in Goronyo Local Government Area of the state,\u201d he said, adding that before now, the situation in the state was not as bad. He appealed to the Nigerian Army to review its operations in the state.\n\nThe governor also asked the Chief of Army staff to deploy more troops, resources, and intelligence to the state to end the banditry. He promised that his administration would do everything in its powers to support the security agencies to end insecurity in the state.\n\nEarlier, Yahaya commended Tambuwal for his support to security agencies in the state. The army chief, who was in Sokoto, his home state, on his first visit since his assumption of office as Chief of Army Staff, said he was in the state as part of a familiarisation tour to divisions across the country. The purpose, he said, was to interact with troops and encourage them on their duties as well as hold security meetings with governors and relevant stakeholders.\n\nHe said the perpetrators of criminal activities across the country were also human, and said there was need to work with everyone to track down the criminals among the people.\n\nIn a related development, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, prayed for the continuous success of the security agencies against criminal elements in the country. While receiving Yahaya in his palace, the Sultan said he was always happy to receiving army personnel, having being one of them before ascending the throne. He disclosed that Sultan\u2019s Palace remained home to everyone, not only the army chief, but every Nigerian, irrespective of where they came from or their religious background.\n\nThe Sultan said his council would continue to pray for the army chief and his people, saying the task before them is more than the civil war era\n\nOrtom Worries over Insecurity in Nigerian Schools\n\nBenue State Governor Samuel Ortom expressed concern about recent attacks and kidnapping of students in the country. Ortom spoke on Monday at his country house, Gbajimba, in Guma Local Government Area, during the virtual handing over and commissioning of a Government Science Secondary School built by some oil companies in the country, including Chevron, Famfa, Prime, and Equinor.\n\nHe said education remained the bedrock of growth and development of any nation, wondering why schools should be the target of criminals.\n\nThe governor lauded the oil companies for investing heavily in the education sector as part of their social responsibility policy. He pledged, on behalf of his government, that everything in its powers would be done to protect the facility and announced immediate perimeter fencing of the school.\n\nThe governor also decried the high number of internally displaced persons in the area and urged the federal government to do everything to ensure that the people returned to their homes.\n\nHe said, \u201cI will not keep quiet and allow some group of people chase my people away from their homes and continue to make them IDPs. Gbajimba has over 500,000 IDPs. I appeal to the federal government to stop these herdsmen and declare them a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cThey should stop the killing and destruction of our property. I will not engage any militia group but seek justice of my people.\n\n\u201cSecurity is a mandatory responsibility of every government. I want to appreciate the recent effort made by government in nipping insecurity in the bud, especially, in the state but it should be sustained.\n\n\u201cI also appreciate the effort of security agencies, who are sacrificing their lives to ensure peace in our state. The federal government should do massive recruitment and adequate funding of security agencies so that they can put in their best in securing the lives of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nUS Ready to Support Nigeria to Fight Insecurity\n\nThe United States government declared its readiness to lend support to Nigeria towards the fight against insecurity. The assurance was given during a meeting between a visiting US Deputy Security Adviser, Jonathan Finer, and Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, where security issues were discussed.\n\nThe US official said his country was willing to support Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after a closed-door meeting, Finer said, \u201cGoing forward, the security issues are very pretty whether it\u2019s terrorism or piracy, the US can support.\n\n\u201cYou mentioned democracy. The president is very much looking forward to convening the summit for democracy in December. The pillar of this summit is going to be issues relating to election, corruption.\n\n\u201cNigeria is not just a partner of the US but also a friend, which is much appreciated. The time that we spent and the conversations we had are very constructive and the partnership over all.\n\n\u201cI will not repeat all of the minister\u2019s briefing but it does speak the enormous agenda that the two countries share. We talked about the pandemic and the delivery of vaccines and the next phase of this which is actually making sure that those vaccines are administered and get into peoples arms, which is something we want to support.\u201d\n\nOn climate change, Finer said the US \u201cwelcomes Nigeria\u2019s commitment to increase its ambition, when it comes to climate change and we hope that it continues. There are no significant issues on our mutual agenda that can be addressed without working together. So, we are committed to continue doing that.\u201d\n\nOnyeama said the discussion was on a broad range of issues. He said, \u201cWe talked about the security situation of the country: banditry, Boko Haram, secessionist groups and other acts and challenges to insecurity, including that of Guinea and how we can cooperate with the US in addressing all the issues.\n\n\u201cWhile acknowledging the tremendous support from the US in the area of security, the recent delivery of A29 fighters and supporting other areas, we assessed the situation in the Sahel beyond Nigeria, right up to Libya, and how we can work closely together to address the terrorist challenges and the security situation in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn twitter ban, the minister said, \u201cWe talked about the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria and how that is progressing,\u201d adding that the issue of COVID-19 also came up at the meeting.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe talked about the COVID-19 context and the US has been very generous. Just very recently, last week, they provided, again, vaccines to Nigeria, five million, and then another vaccine of 3.5 million that were delivered to the Nigerian government. We are grateful to the US government for this generosity.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Govt declares DPR, PEF, PPPRA defunct\n\n\u2022You have no reason to fret, FG assures agencies\u2019 staff\n\n\u2022My immediate concern is to meet OPEC quota, says Komolafe\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday formally inaugurated the leadership of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NURP) as well as the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe development signaled the official winding up of three agencies which they succeeded as prescribed by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nThe now defunct agencies according to the federal government are the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), whose Director, Mr Sarki Auwalu, was dropped by President Muhammadu Buhari after his name was initially sent to the National Assembly; the Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF) and the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA).\n\nMinister of State, Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Sylva, while speaking on the sidelines of the inauguration of the chief executives of the NURP, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe and his counterpart at the NMDPRA, Mr. Farouk Ahmed, in Abuja, described the occasion as historic, saying it marked the beginning of a new era in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe explained that after a rigorous screening process and the issuance of letters of appointment to the new chief executives, both regulatory agencies have now taken off with competent leadership.\n\nWith the new law, Sylva stated that the federal government was expecting a lot of growth in the oil and gas industry, which he said had been stagnated for a long time while a lot of investors stood aloof.\n\n\u201cToday, the PIA has clarified the legal framework around the sector and the agencies and I don\u2019t see anything now stopping investors from coming and we are very lucky to have very competent industry people with proven experience.\n\n\u201cWe believe they can hit the ground running. Nigeria should brace up for exponential growth in the oil and gas industry,\u201d the minister stated.\n\nOn the fate of the preceding agencies, he explained that it remains a matter of law, noting that as the PIA states, all the assets and even the staff of the agencies would now be vested in the commission and on the authority.\n\n\u201cThat means that the DPR will not have anything. It doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It also repeals the DPR Act, the Petroleum Inspectorate Act and the Petroleum Equalisation Act and the PPPRA Act. The law specifically repeals them and it is clear that those agencies do not exist anymore.\n\n\u201cThe law also provides for the staff and for the jobs in those agencies to be protected. But I am sure that unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t cover the chief executive who was on a political appointment,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nThe minister disclosed that the process of assigning and aligning affected staff was ongoing and would be completed in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cThat process will be ongoing because we have to rationalise the staff. The authority has staffing coming from the defunct PEF, PPPRA and the DPR and of course the commission staff will come from the DPR. That\u2019s going to be the process that will be ongoing for the next few weeks or so,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nThe new chief executive of the upstream commission, Komolafe, in his comments, assured that the enactment of the PIA would usher in a massive turnaround in the activities of the upstream that he was appointed to midwife.\n\n\u201cNigerians should expect massive deliverables from the moment we take over in the sense that the PIA has ended a regime of uncertainty in terms of the governance of the industry.\n\n\u201cBasically, we shall focus on activities that enhance the production activities in the upstream in a manner that we will be able to hit our OPEC quota and will endeavour to ensure that we deliver to Nigerians a 21st century regulatory commission.\n\n\u201cWe will not just be a regulator, we will be an enabler of investment. So, Nigeria should expect be part of what we actually plan under our watch,\u201d he stressed.\n\nOn plans by the international oil companies (IOCs) to exit their onshore and shallow water operations, Komolafe stated that it remains purely an investment decision, but stressed that the commission would strive to engage the IOCs to understand their challenges.\n\n\u201cWe will engage critically with them and if it becomes their decision to move from their onshore activities, what will be paramount to us is to look at their challenges and see how far we can intervene positively. Don\u2019t forget the act makes the commission both technical and financial regulator.\n\n\u201cWe will do more because investment decisions are commercial decisions and we will see how we can intervene. But it\u2019s an investment decision borne out of certain considerations. We will try to know what those considerations are and intervene where we can.\n\n\u201cBut the key is that we focus on activities that will expand and enhance production activities in a manner that we can be meeting our OPEC quota and as much as possible to optimise the federation revenue,\u201d he noted.\n\nAlso speaking, the midstream and downstream boss, Farouk, promised to give a lot of attention to the development of the country\u2019s enormous gas resources.\n\n\u201cThe key area that you touched which is close to my heart is the gas development. This will lead to industrialisation, job creation and our main focus is to attract investment in gas. Of course, we need to work with the commission, the IOCs to invest in our hydrocarbons and more so in the gas sector because we have abundance of gas even more than the reserve of crude oil.\n\n\u201cWhy do we have shortage of gas, maybe because there\u2019s no investment? Why are we having challenges in investment, maybe because our pricing framework and other parameters that investors look at don\u2019t measure up? The PIB stagnated for over 20 years and the investors were sitting on the fence waiting to see what direction things were going. Now everything is clear, thanks to the government.\n\n\u201cWe will ride on that and create more opportunities for investment by going through the whole value chain for production to consumption in terms of fair pricing to all stakeholders,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum, Dr. Nasir Gwarzo, in his remarks urged all the staff of the defunct agencies not to fret over their future, stating that everyone would be fairly treated.\n\n\u201cThis is to assure our staff and CEOs that the transition process has been fine-tuned in such a way that shows smooth transition including the anxiety among members of staff across board. There\u2019s a strong leadership under the minister of state to make sure everybody is given a fair transition,\u201d he assured.\n\nOn his part, Auwalu remarked that the defunct DPR was willing to ensure a smooth takeover by the new agencies, stating that during week, meetings will be held to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "WSJ: How Nigerian Military Bought Back Anti-aircraft Gun from Kidnapping Gang",
          "text": "*Criminal gangs flush with ransom money, extorting governments\n\n*Farmers sell land to free their children, incidence fuelling inflation\n\n*NAF describes allegation of payments to bandits as \u2018fake news\u2019\n\nUgo Aliogo with agency report\n\nThe Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has described how the Nigerian military paid cash to buy back an anti-aircraft gun that posed a threat to President Muhammadu Buhari, who flew through the endangered airspace to his hometown, some 80 miles away.\n\nThe report alleged that kidnapping gangs that encamped in Nigeria\u2019s Rugu forest had seized the anti-aircraft gun during a clash with a military unit. It stated that the ransom, almost $50,000 in crisp Nigerian bank notes, was paid to retrieve the weapon.\n\nSoldiers, intelligence officers, and mediators, who had visited the kidnapping camps, described a surfeit of munitions, which included more anti-aircraft guns acquired since the mission to buy one back.\n\nBut the Nigerian Air Force, in a statement, described the report that it made such payment to armed bandits as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no basis for the NAF to pay bandits or any criminal elements that it has continued to attack and decimate in Katsina State (and) other parts of the North-west,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt said despite the allegation, NAF conducted air interdiction in the area recently.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe attention of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has been drawn to reports alleging that the NAF, through one of its personnel, paid the sum of N20 million to armed bandits operating in Jibia Local Government Area (LGA) of Katsina State in exchange for an anti-aircraft gun allegedly seized.\n\n\u201cThe report went on to state that the reason behind the payment was to retrieve the anti-aircraft gun which, it alleged, the NAF feared could be used against aircraft operating within Katsina State.\u201d\n\nNAF said there was no iota of truth in the allegation, adding that it is designed to cast aspersion on the service.\n\nIt alleged, \u201cThe said report is totally false. It should therefore be taken as fake news and disregarded. Indeed, we ordinarily would not have responded to such baseless and utterly illogical allegation but for the need to set the record straight as well as reaffirm the NAF\u2019s unflinching commitment to decisively dealing with the armed bandits and all other criminal elements.\u201d\n\nNAF stated further, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, it must be stated that there is no basis for the NAF to pay bandits or any criminal elements that it has continued to attack and decimate in Katsina State, other parts of the North-west as well as other Theatres of Operation in the country.\u201d\n\nHowever, the federal government did not respond to THISDAY\u2019s request for comments.\n\nBut the foreign journal maintained, \u201cCriminal factions appear to be better equipped with larger-capacity advanced weaponry than national security agencies,\u201d quoting a confidential internal report presented to the president in July.\n\nWSJ further alleged that over several months, the militant leader had agreed to part with the truck-mounted 12.7 millimetre anti-aircraft gun in exchange for the ransom.\n\n\u201cHis men had plenty more munitions,\u201d he was quoted to have said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the army\u2019s weapons,\u201d according to an officer, whose account was corroborated by another senior Nigerian official involved in the previously undisclosed mission, the report said.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t pay, we kill them,\u201d a militant leader in Zamfara State, Shehu Rekeb, was quoted to have said in a phone interview.\n\nHis men were herdsmen, he said, who had been mistreated by the state and subjected to arbitrary arrests.\n\nOnce armed with machetes, they now have weapons on par with the military and collaborators inside the army, he was quoted to have claimed.\n\nMore so, the report disclosed that in forests in the North-west, the loosely organised criminal gangs that raised funds by kidnapping school children were now flush with arms, cash and operating beyond the reach of an increasingly fragile state.\n\nIn some instances, government officials in Africa\u2019s most populous nation have been paying the gangs to return stolen weapons and kidnapped personnel, WSJ said, citing confidential documents and interviews with senior military officials, soldiers and independent mediators, and one of the gang leaders.\n\nThe New York-based newspaper narrated how during one of the incidents, masked men emerged from the forest on motorbikes, surrounding a young intelligence officer clutching a cash-filled bag.\n\nIt said, \u201cAn hour later, the officer, who declined to be identified, was clasping hands with a leader of a diffuse network of criminals, whose campaign of kidnapping civilians\u2014including hundreds of schoolchildren\u2014has raised millions of dollars to build an arsenal of heavy weaponry they are using to wrest control of swaths of the north, including the president\u2019s home state.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s government\u2014still battling Islamic State militants in the North-east\u2014refers to the lesser-known criminal groups in its North-west as \u201cbandits\u201d, the WSJ report said.\n\nIt said several senior security officials described mass kidnapping for ransom as the country\u2019s primary new security crisis.\n\nThe report said one official, who had reviewed intercepts of bandit leaders\u2019 communications, described how the militants spoke of accumulating weapons to defend themselves from rival gangs and from government-backed vigilantes and to conduct increasingly brazen operations against schools, villages, state officials and each other.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re settling scores\u2026government cannot do anything,\u201d one senior government security said.\n\nThe bandits have seized more than 1,000 children from their schools this year. Thousands of schools have closed in a country, where half the population is under 18 and which has become home to the world\u2019s largest population of out-of-class children\n\nFarmers have abandoned their land or sold it to purchase their children\u2019s freedom, sending the price of corn, rice and beans to new highs. Hundreds of villages have been deserted, after fighting that has left a quarter of a million people homeless.\n\n\u201cMy son has been captive in the forest for months,\u201d said Bulus Kwoi, whose firstborn was one of 140 students abducted from Bethel Baptist School in Kaduna in July. \u201cPlease, will you give us the money to free them?\u201d he appealed.\n\nMost of the bandits are from the Fulani ethnic group, a traditionally cattle-rearing society, whose herdsmen have been fighting for years with farmers over access to dwindling grazing lands.\n\nThe report also alleged that more recently, some herdsmen had reorganised into kidnapping gangs, seizing everyone from villagers to prominent politicians.\n\nLast month, bandits raided a military training college in Kaduna State, north of the capital, killing two soldiers, grabbing more weaponry and kidnapping a ranking military officer, a major at the country\u2019s national defense academy.\n\nConfident that they hold the upper hand, the bandits have called in to talk radio stations to boast of their weaponry and have invited journalists to photograph their stockpiles, WSJ reported.\n\nThe Nigerian Police last month said they arrested three suspects in the kidnapping of students from Bethel Baptist School in Kaduna State.\n\nIn the past three months, bandits have been blamed for abducting political leaders and Catholic priests, and for regular killings of policemen. In July, the air force said a pilot was shot down over the Rugu forest after attempting an airstrike on bandit encampments there.\n\nThe report said bandits were a distant priority for United States policy makers focused on Nigeria\u2019s jihadist threat, though American officials said they had intercepted calls from suspected Islamist militants in the North-east, who were advising bandits in the North-west on kidnapping operations and negotiations.\n\nThe Nigerian military opened a new offensive last month, bombarding forest encampments with airstrikes from US-delivered jet fighters. The government ordered cell phone reception suspended across four states, cutting off tens of millions of residents, as part of a military offensive that some officials claimed was succeeding.\n\nVillagers have paid bandits to not kidnap their children, intensifying a protection racket. Unable to defend communities, the governors of three northern states have told citizens to pick up weapons, fuelling a local business of fashioning muskets from scrap metal.\n\n\u201cHardly a day passes by without a person being killed or kidnapped. No single day,\u201d Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Bello Masari, had said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for the people to rise up,\u201d he added.\n\nWSJ reported that the mission to buy back the anti-aircraft gun began with a handoff from a high-ranking air force intelligence officer in Abuja: a black zip-up bag he alleged was full of N20 million.\n\nIt was given to the young intelligence officer tapped to exchange it for the anti-aircraft gun the bandits had seized in an area, where Buhari frequently flew to visit his hometown of Daura.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cThe officer flew to the town of Jibia on the border with Niger, where a dozen armed men emerged from the forest to meet him. They escorted him on motorbikes into thickening forest for hours, arriving at the home of their leader, a wiry man in his 30s, who collected the sack.\n\n\u201cWhile the bandits began disassembling the antiaircraft gun and attempting to strap it to a wobbling motorbike, their leader aired a series of grievances against the state: Vigilantes had kidnapped his father, young men could no longer earn a livelihood rearing cattle, and airstrikes were killing civilians in his camps. \u201cYou are bombing us from the air,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are killing our children.\u201d\n\nHis fighters were conducting reprisal operations against vigilantes and the army, which had helped them accrue a huge weapons stockpile, he said.\n\nEventually, WSJ said, the bandits strapped the antiaircraft gun across two motorbikes and began to wheel it out of the camp. \u201cThey made it look so simple,\u201d the air force officer said. \u201cThey made it feel casual.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State amid a plot to remove his deputy, Rauf Olaniyan, on Monday presented two vehicles worth millions of naira to the immediate past chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, Alhaji Omokunmi Mustapha, and his successor, Dayo Ogungbenro.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the governor\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, the vehicles, both Toyota Land Cruiser SUVs, were presented as an exit gift and a welcome gift to Mustapha and Ogungbenro at the Government House, Agodi, Ibadan.\n\n\u201cOyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, on Monday presented an exit gift and a welcome gift of two brand new Toyota Land Cruiser Jeeps to the outgone chairman of the Oyo State PDP in the state, Alhaji Omokunmi Mustapha, and the newly-elected PDP chairman, Dayo Ogungbenro, respectively.\n\n\u201cThe chairman, Oyo State Advisory Council, Senator Hosea Agboola, who made the presentation at the Government House, Agodi, Ibadan, on behalf of the governor, charged the duo to work together for the success of the PDP.\n\n\u201cAgboola described the governor as a kind-hearted man who cares for the party and the masses in the state. He also used the occasion to urge other governors in the country to emulate the uniqueness of Governor Makinde.\n\n\u201cHe also called on Mustapha and Ogungbenro to collaborate for the progress of the party, adding that the gesture from the governor is commendable and unprecedented in the history of the state. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Plot To Impeach Oyo Deputy Governor Advances, Governor Makinde To Discuss Move With Oyo Lawmakers In Ghana\n\n\u201cIn their various reactions, the duo of Hon. Ogungbenro and Alhaji Mustapha thanked Governor Makinde for his magnanimity. The duo promised to remain focused and to protect the party from the threat of external forces.\u201d\n\nThere are, however, concerns about the governor\u2019s lavish spending as the source of money used to purchase the vehicles remained questionable.\n\nA civil servant, who asked not to be named, described Makinde\u2019s action as a \u201cmisplacement of priority.\u201d\n\nThe donation comes a few hours after SaharaReporters exclusively reported plot to impeach the state Deputy Governor by the PDP/dominated State House of Assembly.\n\nOlaniyan would soon be impeached by the lawmakers, a source privy to the move had said.\n\nJust last weekend, a petrol station and bakery belonging to the Deputy Governor were vandalised in Ibadan.\n\nThere were suspicions in some quarters that the Chairman of the Motor Park Management System in the state, Lamidi Mukaila, popularly called Auxiliary was behind the vandalism.\n\nThe vandalised petrol station and bakery are managed by the wife of the Deputy Governor, Prof. Amdalat Olaniyan.\n\nBefore then, thugs had, twice on the same day, unleashed terror on aggrieved PDP members who had converged for a parallel congress at Jogor Event Centre, Ibadan.\n\nThough this is not the first time, previous impeachment attempts have been thwarted by the lawmakers who feel Olaniyan has been good to them, a source in the state House of Assembly said.\n\nTo make it work this time around, all members have been scheduled to travel to Ghana, a neighbouring West African country.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the trip was coordinated by Makinde\u2019s closest ally, 48-year old Seye Famojuro, who hails from Osun and lives in Ibadan.\n\nIn Ghana, they will be joined by Makinde who would introduce to them, the need for the impeachment process.\n\nThe chairman of the Oyo State House of Assembly Service Commission, Musah AbdulWasii, who is also the immediate past Deputy Speaker of the State House of Assembly, has been pencilled down as a replacement.\n\nThough he contested and lost the last election on the platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), he is now in PDP and revers Hosea Agboola, a former Senator popularly called Alleluyah as his leader instead of Monsurat Sunmonu, a former Senator and his former leader in the African Democratic Congress (ADC).\n\nMusah\u2019s preference of Alleluyah to Sunmonu is not far-fetched as the former is closer to Makinde than the latter.\n\nThough both Makinde and Olaniyan are engineers, sources told SaharaReporters that it has been rough since the beginning of the administration.\n\n\u201cIn a bid to win the 2019 governorship poll, many people had suggested the names of Engr. Raufu Olaniyan to Engr. Seyi Makinde. Olaniyan was then a governorship aspirant on the platform of the ADC. He hails from Igboho, one of the numerous towns in Okeogun, the second-largest geo-political zone in Oyo State, after Ibadan, the state capital. Parts of the reasons why Makinde considered him was because of his experience as a former top civil servant,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cHe was permanent secretary of the Oyo State Road Maintenance Agency (OYSTROMA). Secondly, he is acceptable to the Muslim population beyond Okeogun. And he has a deep pocket, though he doesn\u2019t flaunt it. He is also close to former governor Rashidi Ladoja. All these were what Makinde considered.\n\n\u201cBut Olaniyan\u2019s acceptance was at a great cost. His closeness to the former and incumbent governors of Osun, Rauf Aregbesola and Gboyega Oyetola and Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai, all of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was almost ruined. They didn\u2019t \u2018bless\u2019 the move. He accepted it and worked tirelessly to ensure PDP wins. Meanwhile, Makinde promised to, unlike his immediate predecessor, make use of his deputy governor if they won.\n\n\u201cGovernor Makinde initially wanted to fulfil his promise but was soon misled by the likes of Alleluyah and co. Initially, Makinde conceded Olaniyan\u2019s Oorelope local government area to him. Alleluyah and Olaniyan are both from Okeogun and he feels threatened by the emergence of Olaniyan.\n\n\"Soon, the governor started ignoring his deputy. In a clear show of hatred, the governor awarded the renovation of the deputy governor\u2019s lodge and till date, it is still at the plastering stage. It is by the road and everyone can see it.

          "text": "Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State amid a plot to remove his deputy, Rauf Olaniyan, on Monday presented two vehicles worth millions of naira to the immediate past chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, Alhaji Omokunmi Mustapha, and his successor, Dayo Ogungbenro.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the governor\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, the vehicles, both Toyota Land Cruiser SUVs, were presented as an exit gift and a welcome gift to Mustapha and Ogungbenro at the Government House, Agodi, Ibadan.\n\n\u201cOyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, on Monday presented an exit gift and a welcome gift of two brand new Toyota Land Cruiser Jeeps to the outgone chairman of the Oyo State PDP in the state, Alhaji Omokunmi Mustapha, and the newly-elected PDP chairman, Dayo Ogungbenro, respectively.\n\n\u201cThe chairman, Oyo State Advisory Council, Senator Hosea Agboola, who made the presentation at the Government House, Agodi, Ibadan, on behalf of the governor, charged the duo to work together for the success of the PDP.\n\n\u201cAgboola described the governor as a kind-hearted man who cares for the party and the masses in the state. He also used the occasion to urge other governors in the country to emulate the uniqueness of Governor Makinde.\n\n\u201cHe also called on Mustapha and Ogungbenro to collaborate for the progress of the party, adding that the gesture from the governor is commendable and unprecedented in the history of the state. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Plot To Impeach Oyo Deputy Governor Advances, Governor Makinde To Discuss Move With Oyo Lawmakers In Ghana\n\n\u201cIn their various reactions, the duo of Hon. Ogungbenro and Alhaji Mustapha thanked Governor Makinde for his magnanimity. The duo promised to remain focused and to protect the party from the threat of external forces.\u201d\n\nThere are, however, concerns about the governor\u2019s lavish spending as the source of money used to purchase the vehicles remained questionable.\n\nA civil servant, who asked not to be named, described Makinde\u2019s action as a \u201cmisplacement of priority.\u201d\n\nThe donation comes a few hours after SaharaReporters exclusively reported plot to impeach the state Deputy Governor by the PDP/dominated State House of Assembly.\n\nOlaniyan would soon be impeached by the lawmakers, a source privy to the move had said.\n\nJust last weekend, a petrol station and bakery belonging to the Deputy Governor were vandalised in Ibadan.\n\nThere were suspicions in some quarters that the Chairman of the Motor Park Management System in the state, Lamidi Mukaila, popularly called Auxiliary was behind the vandalism.\n\nThe vandalised petrol station and bakery are managed by the wife of the Deputy Governor, Prof. Amdalat Olaniyan.\n\nBefore then, thugs had, twice on the same day, unleashed terror on aggrieved PDP members who had converged for a parallel congress at Jogor Event Centre, Ibadan.\n\nThough this is not the first time, previous impeachment attempts have been thwarted by the lawmakers who feel Olaniyan has been good to them, a source in the state House of Assembly said.\n\nTo make it work this time around, all members have been scheduled to travel to Ghana, a neighbouring West African country.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the trip was coordinated by Makinde\u2019s closest ally, 48-year old Seye Famojuro, who hails from Osun and lives in Ibadan.\n\nIn Ghana, they will be joined by Makinde who would introduce to them, the need for the impeachment process.\n\nThe chairman of the Oyo State House of Assembly Service Commission, Musah AbdulWasii, who is also the immediate past Deputy Speaker of the State House of Assembly, has been pencilled down as a replacement.\n\nThough he contested and lost the last election on the platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), he is now in PDP and revers Hosea Agboola, a former Senator popularly called Alleluyah as his leader instead of Monsurat Sunmonu, a former Senator and his former leader in the African Democratic Congress (ADC).\n\nMusah\u2019s preference of Alleluyah to Sunmonu is not far-fetched as the former is closer to Makinde than the latter.\n\nThough both Makinde and Olaniyan are engineers, sources told SaharaReporters that it has been rough since the beginning of the administration.\n\n\u201cIn a bid to win the 2019 governorship poll, many people had suggested the names of Engr. Raufu Olaniyan to Engr. Seyi Makinde. Olaniyan was then a governorship aspirant on the platform of the ADC. He hails from Igboho, one of the numerous towns in Okeogun, the second-largest geo-political zone in Oyo State, after Ibadan, the state capital. Parts of the reasons why Makinde considered him was because of his experience as a former top civil servant,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cHe was permanent secretary of the Oyo State Road Maintenance Agency (OYSTROMA). Secondly, he is acceptable to the Muslim population beyond Okeogun. And he has a deep pocket, though he doesn\u2019t flaunt it. He is also close to former governor Rashidi Ladoja. All these were what Makinde considered.\n\n\u201cBut Olaniyan\u2019s acceptance was at a great cost. His closeness to the former and incumbent governors of Osun, Rauf Aregbesola and Gboyega Oyetola and Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai, all of the All Progressives Congress (APC) was almost ruined. They didn\u2019t \u2018bless\u2019 the move. He accepted it and worked tirelessly to ensure PDP wins. Meanwhile, Makinde promised to, unlike his immediate predecessor, make use of his deputy governor if they won.\n\n\u201cGovernor Makinde initially wanted to fulfil his promise but was soon misled by the likes of Alleluyah and co. Initially, Makinde conceded Olaniyan\u2019s Oorelope local government area to him. Alleluyah and Olaniyan are both from Okeogun and he feels threatened by the emergence of Olaniyan.\n\n\"Soon, the governor started ignoring his deputy. In a clear show of hatred, the governor awarded the renovation of the deputy governor\u2019s lodge and till date, it is still at the plastering stage. It is by the road and everyone can see it. So, the deputy governor makes use of his house. When critical issues are to be decided, he prefers to use his chief of staff, secretary to the state government or any other trusted ally. In fact, the deputy governor has been reduced to nothing.\u201d",

          "title": "Who\u2019s afraid of crypto-salaries?",
          "text": "Like most Nigerian workers, Kola*, at his former job, used to be paid his salary in the country\u2019s official currency: the naira\u2014until he started working at a fintech company registered outside Nigeria. Now he gets paid in USD Coin (USDC), a Stablecoin tethered to the US dollar. With this switch in his salary\u2019s currency, Kola was offered a juicy opportunity to exit a quagmire many young Nigerians find themselves in: they make more money than their parents did but in a currency that has fallen so low their paycheck doesn\u2019t reflect in their purchasing power.\n\nNigeria, like many African countries, grapples with currency risk. Back in 2015, its current president, Muhammadu Buhari, campaigned on a promise to increase the value of the naira. But since the start of his presidency, the country\u2019s currency has plunged badly because demand for the dollar continues to outstrip supply. This plunge in the value of the naira has been majorly fueled by Nigeria importing more goods than it exports. With declining oil prices forcing the Nigerian government to devalue its official currency twice in the past year, and by roughly 35% over the past five years, the resultant inflation has thrown over 7 million people into poverty in 2020 alone, according to the World Bank.\n\nSince saving in naira is a dead plan, more Nigerians now save their earnings in foreign currencies. Data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that Nigeria had a total domiciliary account balance of \u20a66.566 trillion as of March 2021, and when this figure is converted to dollars at the official rate of \u20a6410 per dollar, it translates to about $16 billion.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nVolatile naira drives Nigerians to digital currencies\n\nNigeria\u2019s weak currency has pushed its citizens into saving their money in foreign currencies, for wealth and value preservation. But even this is in limbo because uncertainties rule the country\u2019s financial regulatory climate. Nigeria\u2019s CBN has a long history of clamping down on individuals, groups and companies it suspects of being responsible for the slump in the value of the naira. Out of nowhere, the CBN banned the sale of foreign currencies to bureau de change operators\u2014also called the parallel or black market\u2014in the country, accusing them of creating an artificial foreign exchange scarcity. It also threatened to go after abokiFX, a website that collates the black market foreign exchange rates daily, asserting that there is only one acceptable exchange rate: the Investors\u2019 and Exporters\u2019 FX Window.\n\nThis has made a lot of people apprehensive, especially those with funds in their domiciliary accounts. Their fears were heightened after Ibrahim Obanikoro, a member of parliament, suggested in a tweet that the CBN close all domiciliary accounts for the next year.\n\nIn addition to saving in foreign currencies, Nigerians have turned to cryptocurrencies\u2014digital currencies that are out of the reach of federal government control.\n\nThis newfound hunger for cryptocurrency has seen Nigeria emerge as the leading country, per capita, for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in the world, according to a report by Statista\u2014despite government crackdown. In fact, the African continent has been the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world. Chainalysis estimates that African countries collectively received around $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021. For context, sub-Saharan Africa received an estimated $48 billion worth of remittances in 2019, about half of which went to Nigeria, according to a Brookings Institute study. Between July 2019 and June 2020, the volume of cryptocurrencies sent to Africa from outside the continent was the highest of all regions Chainalysis studied. With 96% of the crypto value coming from outside the continent, this suggests that more Africans are receiving remittances via crypto.\n\nDigital money is the future of finance\n\nIn February this year, the CBN placed a ban on cryptocurrency in the country when it directed banks to close the accounts of persons or entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions. At the time, the Nigerian apex bank claimed that cryptocurrencies and digital currencies were largely used in terrorism financing and money laundering, citing the anonymity of their transactions.\n\nBut months after that, the government, seeing it couldn\u2019t quench the fire of cryptocurrency in the country, bet on digital money as the future by launching a central bank digital currency (CBDCs) named eNaira and nicknamed \u201cProject Giant\u201d.\n\nDigital money like cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and Stablecoins will play a significant role in the future of financial services. Cryptocurrency is gaining worldwide acceptance; Stablecoin, a peculiar type of cryptocurrency, has been labelled the \u201cfuture of money\u201d by the Harvard Business Review; and all these are in direct competition with CBDCs.\n\nRest of World reported on how Stablecoins have found a use case in volatile markets like Nigeria, where CBN\u2019s regulations force Nigerians to spend limited amounts of US dollars via their dollar cards each month. In order to bypass this limitation, Nigerians have switched to using Stablecoins to make their payments.\n\nStablecoins, such as the Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD) and USD Coin (USDC) are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar or gold. In sub-Saharan Africa, Stablecoin remittances can be up to 20 times cheaper than traditional money transfers. USDT and USDC transfer fees are often as low as 0\u20131%. Paxful, a leading cryptocurrency trading platform in the country, declares that 1.5 million Nigerian users, representing about 5% of the platform\u2019s trading volume, use USDT, the most popular Stablecoin.\n\nThere is a growing adoption of Stablecoins like $DAI, $USDT, $BUSD and $USDC in Nigeria. Unlike such cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are notorious for their volatility, Stablecoin, like CBDCs, is a non-interest coin. Stablecoins have seen rapid growth this year, with USDC, the second-largest Stablecoin in the world, reaching a market capitalisation of over $30 billion.\n\nSalary alert\u2026but in crypto\n\nJust like Olaf Carlson-Wee, Coinbase\u2019s first employee who was paid entirely in Bitcoin, as far back as 2013, for three years, Nigerians also want to be paid in crypto.\n\nEarlier this year, in July, Timi Ajiboye, CEO and CTO of Helicarrier (formerly Buycoins), announced that the company\u2019s employees would now be paid in USDC. Twitter went agog, with many presenting themselves to Ajiboye for employment at his company.\n\nIn a process Kola describes as \u201cseamless\u201d when he receives his salary in USDC, he converts to naira only the amount he plans to spend for the week. \u201cI don\u2019t withdraw my full salary at once because you never know what the exchange rate will be tomorrow. So, even if waiting would add \u20a6500 to my salary, I\u2019d rather wait than withdraw all at once and have the naira in my account drop in value between when I withdraw it and when I spend it.\u201d\n\nKola says he can convert his crypto, using his company\u2019s product, a cryptocurrency trading app, within two hours. He is unbothered by persistent news around the steady drop of the naira. He isn\u2019t completely insulated from the naira crash, though, as a Nigerian living in Nigeria. But, he notes: \u201cAt least my salary\u2019s value isn\u2019t dropping as fast as it would have if I was earning in naira.\u201d\n\nA colleague of Kola\u2019s, Deji*, who receives his base pay and benefits in USDC as well, reveals that all employees were kept in the loop right from when the company decided that that was the route it would take regarding employee compensation. As a fintech company, there was no need to convince anyone on the team about how Stablecoins would protect them from the steady fall of the naira.\n\nThe problem with crypto-salaries\n\nAt Kola\u2019s company, individual contract staff, who make up a majority of its workers, are responsible for remitting their taxes. To help the employee with this process, an internal document containing information on tax and pension calculations and payments has been circulated around the company. This is the company battling the challenge that comes with paying employees in crypto, as legal barriers in many countries prevent this. Some of the barriers include the non-recognition of cryptocurrency as a legal tender and the challenge of calculating taxes when employees are paid in cryptocurrency.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s still risky to pay employees in crypto in the US because the currency is recognised by the Inland Revenue Service (IRS) as a property and not a legal tender. A piece of legislation, the Fair Labour Standards Act\u2014a major custodian of employee rights\u2014backs this position. The act states that employees must be paid in \u201ccash or negotiable instrument payable at par\u201d.\n\nWhile legal systems around the world need more time to develop regulations that cater for crypto adoption, US-based Coinbase announced last week that it is launching a new direct deposit service, \u201cGet paid in crypto,\u201d that will let nearly anyone in the US receive all or part of their wages in cryptocurrencies. There are high hopes for the success of this rollout because if even a fraction of Coinbase\u2019s millions of US customers sign up, the service will contribute, in no small way, to making crypto mainstream in the broader American workforce.\n\nSome countries are already making progress with creating laws that define the payment of workers in cryptocurrency. For example, since 2019, New Zealand has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency and be taxed accordingly.\n\nBut in Nigeria, paying employees in crypto remains illegal. Nigeria\u2019s primary legislation on the relationship between an employer and employees, the Nigerian Labour Act\u2014established in 2004\u2014renders any contract where part or all of a worker\u2019s wages is made payable in another manner apart from legal tender illegal, null and void.\n\nDespite these legal constraints, Nigerian employers in technology startups continue to make smart moves to create value for their employees and the move towards remunerating employees in crypto is one that\u2019s unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "title": "Editi Effiong: father, writer, producer and tech bro",
          "text": "Editi Effiong\u2019s genius is quiet yet obvious at the same time. He\u2019s a multifaceted creator, builder and thinker\u2014unafraid to tackle the impossible without doubt. From setting up Anakle, a Nigeria-based digital marketing agency, 10 years ago to transitioning into film-making a few years later, Editi has established himself as one of the leading entrepreneurs of his generation. When asked how he would define himself, he responded with, \u201cI\u2019m a father, writer, producer, and tech bro.\n\nThe big picture: Editi Effiong is not your average guy\n\nMany people know Editi Effiong as the brains behind Anakle. Some others might know him for the films he made through his production company, Anakle Films or might have stumbled across him after his involvement in the post-#ENDSARS judicial hearing panel in 2020. Editi attended and documented the daily proceedings, sharing videos, photos and commentaries on his Twitter page. His dedication to reporting on how Lagos State investigated the unforgettable event that took place on October 20 last year, garnered him respect, admiration and a flock of new followers and cheerleaders.\n\nAnakle Films\u2019 theatrical releases, Up North and The Setup, were acquired by Netflix in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Up North, which was based on a story written by Editi, is best described as one of Nollywood\u2019s most adventurous films. Up North did two things successfully: It brought some versatility to Nollywood, Nigeria\u2019s behemoth movie industry; and heralded the arrival of a different Editi. He was no longer just the CEO of a well-respected digital agency with a client list that most marketing agencies would love to get their hands on\u2014Wikipedia, Flutterwave, Glo, to name a few\u2014he was now a film producer and writer who took his craft seriously.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi at a filming location in Northern Nigeria\n\nThe Set Up pulled us in a different direction. In this film, there are no adventures or lush, green fields. But there\u2019s suspense and the dirty underworld of crime. Anakle Films distributed The Set Up with legendary film-maker, Niyi Akinmolayan, sitting on the director\u2019s chair.\n\nEditi displayed his writing chops in his most recent short film, Fishbone, released in May 2020. Fishbone, written and directed by Effiong himself, unearths the terrifying business of counterfeit drugs and how it strips our society of its ability to show love and compassion. Fishbone is a deliberately revealing film; it shows us snapshots of Effiong\u2019s mind and showcases his directorial ingenuity.\n\nIn this exclusive interview with TechCabal, Editi opens up about his childhood, the complexity that is his mind, building Anakle, being a father, and his decision to become a full-time film-maker and writer.\n\nAnakle and the race to get businesses online\n\nEven though Editi is eager to hand over the CEO reins to Anakle\u2019s COO, Munachi \u201cMuna\u201d Nwoke-Ekpo, and purposefully step into his role as founder and CEO of Anakle Films, I was compelled to kick off the interview with questions about Anakle\u2019s beginnings.\n\nIn 2011, digital marketing didn\u2019t have as much clout as it does now. It is hard to imagine a world that didn\u2019t exist with numerous digital and social media platforms. Our current economic climate demands that entrepreneurs move their businesses online and acquire a new crop of customers who are obsessed with social media and consumer technology. In conversation, Editi is a masterful storyteller who uses transparency and humour to pull his listeners in. At no point during our chat did he leave me feeling confused or unimpressed.\n\nKoromone Koroye: What inspired you to start Anakle? What did you see and understand about digital marketing that most people didn\u2019t back in 2011?\n\nEditi Effiong: Back in 2011, we had a slide that predicted that internet penetration would deepen in five years. We also predicted that more than five million Nigerians would be on the internet and that that number would eventually rise to 30 million by 2016. Back then, mobile penetration wasn\u2019t that great and Blackberry phones were still a thing. My business partner, Abass, would charge business owners \u20a650,000 to help them run digital marketing campaigns. And that 50K came with a money-back guarantee: if we weren\u2019t able to successfully promote their brands, they got their money back without any hassles. I mean, how on earth does someone believe that the internet can help you sell more? But we saw that there was a market online and we bet big on what we saw.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: According to the Digital 2021 report, there were an estimated 104 million internet users in Nigeria in January this year. Additionally, internet penetration stood at 50% and 33 million Nigerians with active social media accounts, within that same period.\n\nDo you remember Anakle\u2019s first major campaign?\n\nEditi: In 2010, we ran Interswitch\u2019s first digital campaign. We did this whole flash animation video to push Interswitch\u2019s anti-fraud campaign. I designed the flash. In the early stages of Anakle\u2019s business, I was in charge of execution and Abass handled business operations. So, in this flash animated campaign, if someone emails you for your password or PIN, you don\u2019t give them because Interswitch would never ask you for your PIN or personal information. It was a really great campaign at that time. I mean now, we might take a simple campaign like that for granted; but 12 years ago, building and executing a campaign like that was a phenomenal experience for us and the brands we served during that period.\n\nHow did businesses relate with social media back when Anakle started out?\n\nEditi: \u200b\u200bThe first bank to get on social media was GTB (Guaranty Trust Bank) followed by Diamond Bank. We worked on a project with them and they had their brand assets burned onto a CD. Yes, CDs were a thing back then. But, anyway, they opted for the CD route because they didn\u2019t want anyone to distribute their assets to other sources or agencies. So I picked up Diamond Bank\u2019s CD on a Tuesday and started working on it straight till Thursday. And Thursday happened to be my wedding day.\n\nWoah. You did client work on your wedding day?\n\nEditi: Yes! I was out in the foyer of the hotel room working on this project until I got called into the hall to say my vows and, you know, get married. So I put down my laptop, you know, went and got married and came back and continued working even through my honeymoon. And to think that this was only the second bank that we helped build a Facebook app and get them on social media. Diamond Bank was the second bank in Nigeria to go down the digital marketing route.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, there was a huge opportunity to help businesses get online. And one of the things Anakle was trying to do was help smaller businesses improve brand visibility by getting them acquainted with the internet. We didn\u2019t just target the big brands and enterprise businesses, especially in the beginning. Anakle saw the future of digital marketing and built a business out of it. Our mission was to help businesses grow into the online space, and that\u2019s pretty much it.\n\nAt what point did you realise that Anakle had fulfilled its mission, or at least a part of it?\n\nEditi: There have been many moments. In 2017 we did a very successful campaign with Wikipedia. And that campaign was a forerunner to what became Anakle films. That campaign counted as a major milestone for us. There\u2019s also the part we played in hiring and training people who were new to the digital marketing space. For most of them, Anakle was their first job out of school, and now, most of them are running their own successful companies and projects. You know, making money and growing a company are necessary targets, but I\u2019ve always been more excited about mentoring people and helping them grow in the industry and become better versions of themselves even outside of the work they do at Anakle or anywhere else.\n\nIf our business no longer inspired the people who walked through its doors, then we have failed at our mission. So I get really excited when I see consistent growth in the people who walk through our doors; they come in, grow and become more than they thought they could be before they joined the company.\n\nWhat were Anakle\u2019s hiring values in the beginning? And did those values change after the business grew and garnered success?\n\nEditi: We were looking for people who had the \u2018Anakle spirit\u2019, which is a certain level of fearlessness. We wanted people who could work without fear. I didn\u2019t care too much about CVs and cover letters. We were looking for people who could challenge us; people who could look at the universe as it is and ultimately try to bend it. Because when people are able to challenge the status quo and say, \u201cI can take that on\u201d, then they can create a fire campaign for Sterling Bank or any other enterprise client.\n\nEditi Effiong\n\nHow did you delight Anakle\u2019s early employees?\n\nEditi: I\u2019ll be honest: Back then, we couldn\u2019t compete with Nigerian banks and their salary offerings and other benefits. so we ended up designing a workplace that was exciting. We wanted young people to feel excited about working for us and working out of our office. The Anakle office became our recruitment tool and it was so inspiring to hear people say they wanted to work with us, especially after visiting our office.\n\nNew beginnings: Anakle Films and the road to becoming a director, screenwriter, and producer\n\nKoromone: Moving swiftly along from building Anakle to setting up Anakle films\u2014\n\nEditi: Thank God!\n\nWhen did you know you were ready to make the move?\n\nEditi: Money! I had the money to make that leap of faith into Anakle Films.\n\nSo, how did it feel making that transition from running Anakle to leading the charge at Anakle films? Especially knowing that you were going to put a lot of time and effort into building out Anakle Films\u2019 brand?\n\nEditi: I think the biggest factor there is having a team that can do its job\u2014big props to Munachi. If you\u2019ve never heard of Muna, he\u2019s the best COO in the business. He\u2019s quiet but hard-working and has been with me for 11 years. Muna has done an amazing job at running the business at a group level, and having him around has been extremely helpful and instrumental. I recently received and turned down a global leadership position at a global company\u2014a fantastic offer with great pay\u2014but I turned it down because I wanted the freedom to wake up and do what I love doing or to not do something I hate doing. There\u2019s a madness to having that freedom that works for me. And I think I owe a lot of that to Muna. He gave me the courage to step out of Anakle.\n\nAn illustrated photo of Editi directing a film at a location in Nigeria\n\nTell us about your history and relationship with writing\n\nEditi: This isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I didn\u2019t start writing today. I\u2019ve been writing my entire life. I was also an avid reader when I was younger. My father studied literature and linguistics, so there were a lot of books around the house. I write almost every day and have written almost every day for my entire life. And when I cannot put into words things I want to say, I end up writing them down. I have hardly ever gotten in trouble for writing because I\u2019m able to articulate my thoughts without ambiguity. Wow! I just used a big word.\n\nMy move to Anakle Films is my way of preparing for retirement. I want to retire as a writer. My entire life is run by writing and this is the direction it is headed now. Anakle Films is my excuse to write; it gives me a reason to write, create and build something from the ground up. As you can imagine, there\u2019s a lot of craziness and madness around the work, but I love it.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: Ambiguity is a situation or statement that is unclear because it can be understood in more than one way. [Source: Cambridge dictionary]\n\nEditi on documenting justice for #EndSars victims and survivors and finding his voice again\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: A few months after the #ENDSARS massacre, Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu set up a nine-person Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate allegations of police brutality perpetuated by the now-defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in Lagos State. This part of my conversation with Editi struck a raw nerve for the both of us, especially for Editi who had to restrain his emotions while he answered my questions. I think it takes a lot of courage to document the truth in the midst of pain and grief.\n\nKoromone: Let\u2019s pivot and talk about 2020. How did you find yourself involved in the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry that sat in Lagos? A number of people don\u2019t know this, but you were shooting a film during that period.\n\nEditi: Yes, I was. When I couldn\u2019t attend sessions, I was on set. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. And, you know, I managed it through my teenage years until it went away. After October 2020, my stutter returned. I stutter a lot these days, especially when I\u2019m dealing with difficult situations. So if you pay attention when I speak, you will hear how slow and deliberate I am with my words. I speak slowly to avoid stuttering, and everytime I think about what went down during #EndSars, it messes up my speech.\n\nThe night of the shootings, I could hear the gunshots. And I was going to drive out there because our people were bleeding and needed help, but my wife said, \u201cNo, you cannot go. It is too dangerous.\u201d So, I didn\u2019t go, and that night, I couldn\u2019t speak at all. For hours, I could not say a word. Anytime I tried to say a word, something came up from inside me and blocked off my speech. And since then, I\u2019ve been managing a very bad stutter that comes and goes\u2014but mostly only comes when I\u2019m dealing with difficult subjects. And in the days following October 20, I felt nothing but numbness. Going to those panel sessions was kind of a metaphor for trying to find my voice again.\n\nFor a few weeks following the shootings, I couldn\u2019t speak properly, and writing about the sessions was my way of speaking and reconnecting with the voice I had lost.\n\nShare this article\n\nKoromone Koroye | Author",

          "title": "\u201cWe weren\u2019t motivated to become a unicorn\u201d: Wave\u2019s West Africa head reflects on startup\u2019s rapid growth",
          "text": "Created by two Americans four years ago to lower the cost of mobile money in Senegal, Wave is currently valued at nearly $2 billion after a recent $200 million Series A round led by Stripe, Sequoia Heritage, Founders Fund, and Ribbit Capital.\n\nTechCabal caught up with Coura Sene \u2013 the startup\u2019s General Manager for the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) \u2013 to discuss Wave\u2019s journey to becoming the first unicorn startup in the French-speaking Africa region.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMichael: Being a top executive at a ~$2bn company, most would picture you always in suits and with a laptop. How do you have fun?\n\nCoura: Firstly, I rarely wear a suit (laughs). I enjoy casual office wear. Wave is the perfect work culture since it\u2019s quite relaxed. In my spare time, I enjoy going out with my children and reading books. It\u2019s how I unwind after a long day at the office. I also like to travel, go out to restaurants, and shopping malls with my family.\n\nMichael: How did your previous roles prepare you for the top position at Wave?\n\nCoura: In my first 10 years of work experience, I learned lessons I can share with a growing team to avoid certain mistakes. In addition to having studied computer science, I have a generalist background that I can apply to most situations. In the second decade of my career, I worked as a freelancer. That taught me how to fight: fight to win the job, fight to get things done, and fight to get paid. It truly made me fearless and instilled in me the mindset to run a fast-growing company like Wave.\n\nMichael: Congratulations on the recent $200m funding. How were you able to build a unicorn startup in four years?\n\nCoura: We weren\u2019t exactly motivated to become a unicorn. Rather, we stayed obsessed with our mission and serving our users, and focused on building a mobile money service that was easy to use and extremely affordable for millions of people. We never lose sight of our mission to build a modern financial network across Africa. It\u2019s what motivates us.\n\nMichael: Okay. I\u2019d appreciate some context into the early days of Wave. How different are things now compared to then?\n\nCoura: In the early days, we were just a bunch of people who were passionate about building a better mobile money service. The office was a house. We\u2019d sit on the floor to discuss the business. We\u2019d brainstorm the product, mission, and impact while eating a simple local meal.\n\nFor our market research, we visited local markets and malls to talk to people. We\u2019d test our product and if a feature didn\u2019t work or people didn\u2019t like something, we\u2019d go back to the drawing board. In those early days, we had so many iterations and did many pilot tests before we actually launched our mobile money service. In Mbour, a popular fishing pier that we have made our home base, it was hard not to run into a Wave user or agent in late 2018.\n\nIn the first three months after product launch, we grew rapidly. When I first saw our numbers, I did a double-take. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. They seemed unreal. Fast forward three years. In 2021, more than half of Senegal\u2019s adult population actively uses Wave.\n\nMichael: How large is the Wave agent network across Senegal and Ivory Coast?\n\nCoura: We have a 25,000-agent network. In both Senegal and Cote d\u2019Ivoire, we deliberately chose to partner with mobile money professionals. We could have built our own network from scratch but we believe strongly in adding value to the ecosystem by supporting existing players in the value chain. We want them to thrive.\n\nWe wanted to work with people who know the market, are familiar with the product, can detect fraud, etc. We are selective about our partners; we have zero intention of flooding the market with too many agents as they would not generate enough revenue. Both Wave users and agents need to be satisfied. Mobile money should be easy. Users shouldn\u2019t be inconvenienced. They shouldn\u2019t have to trek to find a service point. At the same time, agents need transaction volumes so they can earn a decent livelihood.\n\nMichael: In addition to low-cost transactions, what have the key drivers of growth been? Are there specific approaches that were crucial to getting people to use the service?\n\nCoura: Simplicity and a highly adapted solution. Any complexity is on us. People responded enthusiastically to Wave because we\u2019re 70% less expensive than telco-led mobile money.\n\nSecondly, we\u2019ve seen high user adoption thanks to our simple, easy-to-use, and highly adapted mobile money product. We always designed our service thinking how can we make this effortless for our users? Any complexity is on us. From a product point of view, we were inspired by a product like WhatsApp for its minimalistic design and effortless user experience. Lastly, we\u2019ve invested significant resources in customer service. We want to ensure that any needs or the occasional compliance of customers are resolved immediately.\n\n\n\nMichael: And what are some of the barriers to wider adoption of Wave? Have you had to deal with any regulatory challenges?\n\nCoura: We operate at the intersection of two highly regulated sectors, finance, and technology. At a regulatory level, we work with our partners to ensure that we\u2019re 100% compliant with rules and regulations. We also work hand-in-hand with our partner banks who have given great support.\n\nAs can be expected, there are often hiccups along the way. I\u2019ll give an example. According to regulators, fintechs, such as Wave, can sell value-added services, like airtime, on top of their platforms. Nevertheless, in March 2021, we were blocked by Orange to sell airtime. We believe this represents monopolistic behavior and have appealed to Senegal\u2019s telecoms regulator, ARTP. We are working tirelessly for it to be restored. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the same issue happened with the Telco companies. We hope that in a few years Wave, and fintechs in general, won\u2019t have to face such challenges. We aim for Francophone West Africa to become like East Africa where the telecoms have created a provider status for fintechs. In the end, we are advocating not just for Wave but for the whole fintech sector.\n\n\n\nMichael: Personally, what\u2019s been the toughest nut for you to crack as Wave\u2019s GM?\n\nCoura: It\u2019s been tough keeping up with growth. The product grew its own two legs and ran on its own \u2014 we\u2019ve had to catch up with it! (Laugh).\n\nSecondly, I\u2019d say it\u2019s been a challenge to stay focused. We have to be deliberate in what gets our attention. It can be too easy to become distracted by hype. It can be flattering or nice but we always have to circle back and ask if it moves the business forward. As Wave expands rapidly, we have to continually adapt our organisational structure to our growth goals and needs.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve done it well. We created a special company culture and style of our own. That I\u2019m extremely proud of.\n\nMichael: Senegal is regarded as one of the fastest-growing mobile money markets in Africa. But how large is the industry presently?\n\nCoura: Senegal is a dynamic market with different mobile money services operated by both telecom companies and banks. It has been favorable as the Senegalese are open to adopting products and services from new providers. However, Senegal is also a challenging market as there is significant competition. There are many other mobile money services, mainly offered by telecom companies. It\u2019s hard to give data about how large the industry is, as companies do not always give such data but I would say that at least 90% of adults in Senegal use one mobile money.\n\nMichael: Why do you think Francophone Africa is often ignored by the startup funding community?\n\nCoura: Francophone Africa has inherited the French system\u2019s bureaucracy, heavy administration, and governance style. Processes and regulations can be stricter than in other regions. As we\u2019re in the digital era, English has become the de facto language in technology, which might have made it more natural for investors to focus on Anglophone markets.\n\nBut nowadays, people are waking up to opportunities in Francophone Africa. If you take the region as a whole, which even shares the same currency, the CFA franc, investors start to appreciate that the total size of the market and the opportunities it presents outweigh any perceived challenges.\n\nMichael: Are there major differences you have observed between the markets where Wave operates?\n\nCoura: I think the big difference between Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Senegal is the dynamism of the fintech ecosystem. There is definitely more appetite for digital in Senegal, which can even be described as a testing laboratory, but the potential is huge in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire thanks to a much larger Ivorian economy.\n\n\n\nMichael: On partnerships. Wave has a collaboration with UBA and Ecobank in Senegal. What informed these deals?\n\nCoura: According to regulations, fintechs can either have a mobile money license or work with a bank. It\u2019s natural for any startup to go the bank route and it was natural for us to partner with pan-African banks like UBA and Ecobank. They welcomed us with open arms. They are pro-innovation and pro-technology and were willing to support us in our mission to transform mobile money for the better.\n\nMichael: Do you see room for the integration of fintech, telco, and banks towards solving Africa\u2019s financial inclusion challenge?\n\nCoura: That\u2019s the way it should be. That\u2019s what Wave is here for and why we exist in the first place. Wave is part of the solution when it comes to tackling the challenge of financial inclusion in Africa. We are here to complement the banks and the De-Fi companies by going further in reaching people they cannot include financially\n\nMichael: What does the rest of the world need to learn from what\u2019s happening with mobile money in Africa?\n\nCoura: Africa\u2019s mobile money market is gigantic! People cannot grasp its true scale. In Africa, there are still hundreds of millions of people waiting to access financial services. Mobile money is still current as well as the next big thing. There is room to do more and improve.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "I promise it\u2019s funnier in Swahili\u2026Kenyan Comedian Eddie Butita is Showing Netflix How Swahili\u2019s Done",
          "text": "For about a month now, Ubers branded with Netflix\u2019s logo have been zipping through Nairobi\u2019s streets. An Uber driver pulls up, blasting early-2000s hip-hop, ready to take on his next ride.\n\nWhen asked why his car is decked out in Netflix decals, he says that he and a group of other drivers were approached by a marketing company offering $90 to anyone willing to ride around the city with the Netflix promotion plastered on the side of their cars. \u201cEasy money,\u201d he says.\n\nStreaming Gets Serious\n\nNetflix is more serious than ever about capturing Kenyan viewers. Since September, Netflix has been offering freemium services and running targeted Twitter campaigns. But, in a move that displays a real willingness to solidify themselves in the hearts and minds of the East African nation\u2019s growing viewers, the streaming giant is now offering Swahili-language programming.\n\nTo roll out this project, the $25 billion company enlisted the help of celebrated Kenyan comic, Eddie Butita.\n\nOver a period of months, Butita translated and oversaw the dubbing for the Swahili language version of Wanda Sykes and Regina Y. Hicks\u2019 Netflix sitcom, The Upshaws.\n\nAt 28 years old, Butita has contributed to iconic series like Churchill Show and the work of other famous Kenyan comedians like Eric Omondi.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear that he was not approached by Netflix based on comedic talent alone. Butita is skilled at wielding digital technology in a market that\u2019s grown so big that Netflix can\u2019t ignore it.\n\nComedy Meets Digital Media\n\nComedy is big in Kenya, but digital media made it bigger.\n\nKenya\u2019s mobile penetration rate grew by 11% from 2020 to 2021 alone, making it one of the most connected countries in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and South Africa. On top of higher-than-average mobile phone usage, the country is also home to some of the fastest mobile broadband speeds in Africa.\n\nMobile phone adoption in Kenya opened access to on-demand content via platforms like Youtube and Facebook. Before this, the nation\u2019s airwaves were more competitive than ever, forcing users to prioritise watch time.\n\n\u201c[It] has made it easier for people to access content anytime, anywhere. They don\u2019t have to be at home to watch certain TV shows. They can come back and watch. And if it\u2019s live, you can post it later,\u201d said Butita in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nThe flexibility viewers have to watch what they want when they want has the ability to extend the shelf life of content, opening the door for brand deals and collaborations for Kenyan comics\u2014an income stream that didn\u2019t always exist.\n\n\u201cPreviously you had to wait to perform or be featured in a movie. But now, you get a brand deal that gives you $10,000, $20,000 or $5,000 just to shoot content and do product placement,\u201d Butita said.\n\nBut Butita\u2019s collaboration with Netflix wasn\u2019t as simple as product placement. The process of translating and recording a dub from English to Swahili, for a US comedy show, was one that involved new levels of creativity and innovation, forcing Butita to ask himself \u201cSanifu or Sheng?\u201d\n\nLocalising Swahili\n\nSwahili is a regional language spoken throughout East Africa and it takes on different forms in each country.\n\nSanifu Swahili or \u201cproper Swahili\u201d is a term used to describe Swahili spoken in the standard form. Standard Swahili is spoken widely in Tanzania and on Kenya\u2019s coast, but in Nairobi, the language has taken on a new life. In the multicultural environment that is the Kenyan capital, a Swahili- and English-based slang called Sheng is spoken among the youth. The urban language has become popular enough for Butita to consider its use in his translations.\n\nBut Butita wanted to make sure that the comedy translated in his dubs could be felt by Swahili speakers across the world.\n\n\u201cI did some lines more than five or 10 times because you rewrite the sentence, it becomes funny, but now you feel like it\u2019s funny to just you because there\u2019s something you understand that other people might not understand. So you change the line. When you\u2019re recording again, you get a different feeling because of the cultural diversity that\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nROI on Local Content\n\nButita\u2019s dubbing and development of The Upshaws is nothing short of revolutionary, but one has to wonder if Netflix\u2019s Kenya-play will be the one that wins the game.\n\nAlthough Netflix is offering a free, limited mobile plan for Kenyan users in the short term, the viewer is still responsible for footing the data cost required to use the streaming service.\n\nMobile broadband speed in Kenya may be high, but the cost of data is high as well. According to the Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing (2021) report from Cable, a British technology research firm, Kenya takes the lead as the most expensive country for mobile data in East Africa. Viewing one hour of Netflix content on low resolution (480p) uses 300 MB of data per hour; in high resolution (1080p), Netflix uses 3 GB per hour. At an average cost of $1.05 per GB of data, Netflix viewers in Kenya stand to pay anywhere from $0.32 to $3.15 to watch a one-hour show.\n\nOn top of high data costs, Netflix will, in order to retain Kenyans\u2019 attention, eventually have to pivot to local content instead of dubs alone. The streaming giant has already done this with some success in South Africa, with shows like the teen drama, Blood and Water.\n\nBut in Kenya, content creation has been somewhat hampered by the low return on investment on original content due, in part, to the difficulty creators face finding fair-priced outlets to screen their content allowing them to recoup funds.\n\nGlobally Competitive Content\n\nMaybe this is where Netflix plans to make an intervention with streaming services. Netflix is a global platform that allows viewers to tap into content from any country at any time. The overnight success of the South Korean film, Squid Game, showed us just how successful well-made local content, that does not come from the West, can be. But, Korea\u2019s success in film and television has been hard-won through more than 40 years of carefully mobilized political and financial resources. It\u2019s paid off, in 2020 the nation\u2019s film industry was valued at around $884,229,150.\n\nIn markets like Kenya, where the culture of content creation is still growing, Netflix will have to spend more time and money developing local content that pops.\n\n\u201cIf we have platforms willing to purchase the content and make the returns be meaningful to creators, that means more content can come out and more people [can] get opportunities,\u201d Butita said.\n\nThere are signs that Netflix is already taking steps to make this happen. Netflix teamed up with UNESCO to fund six young creators in sub-Saharan Africa to develop six short films that reimagine folktales, set to be released in 2022.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author @alexandriasahai",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time.

          "title": "Nigerian clean energy startup, Homefort Energy, wants to make sure you never have cooking gas worries again",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2007, Nigeria\u2019s gas consumption was 70,000 metric tonnes. However, in 2020, the Nigerian cooking gas market experienced rapid growth, with consumption increasing by 1400% in the last 13 years.\n\nBesides, in June 2021, per Vanguard, a local media platform, the Nigerian Federal Government announced plans to increase the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a cooking fuel from 5% to 90% in the next ten years.\n\nThis is because the number of users has quadrupled, and the retail network has grown significantly, according to the federal government.\n\nHowever, Opeyemi Owosho, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of clean energy startup, Homefort, says, \u201cthis expansion has resulted in a poor consumer experience in which consumers are unable to monitor the amount of gas remaining in their cylinders.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, unexpected gas shortages are a common and recurring issue.\n\n\u201cLikewise, a large number of retailers are unlicensed, and their business practices endanger their immediate surroundings,\u201d Godwin Ogboye, Homefort\u2019s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), says.\n\n\u201cLPG marketers are hesitant to invest in new cylinders because they are unable to track the location of their cylinders, resulting in asset loss,\u201d Dapo Oyewumi, Chief Production Officer (CPO), adds.\n\nSo, these three men launched Homefort to address these issues.\n\nBuilt by an experienced team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom L-R: Godwin Ogboye (CTO), Opeyemi Owosho (CEO), Dapo Oyewumi (CPO); Source: Supplied\n\nBefore co-founding Homefort, Owosho worked for five years in the gas industry at Fitcotech, which creates safety products to improve users\u2019 LPG handling safety.\n\nWhile there, he discovered some gaps in Nigeria\u2019s cooking gas retail market.\n\n\u201cI invited Dapo, whom I met at the General Electric Garage back in 2013, to collaborate on the idea. Dapo persuaded Godwin, an embedded system engineer, to join the team,\u201d Owosho declares.\n\nHe also has a degree in petroleum and gas engineering and has worked in gas safety operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOyewunmi was a former prototype manager at General Electric Garage. He is a hardware product engineer with a wide range of skills.\n\nOgboye was the former CTO of GRICD, a startup that developed a smart cold chain box that actively regulates temperature-sensitive items during transportation and storage. He is an embedded systems engineer who also works as a full-stack developer.\n\nSolving a real problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpeyemi Owosho (CEO); Source: Supplied\n\nHomefort automates gas delivery to homes and businesses using Internet of things-enabled smart metres.\n\n\u201cThese smart metres act as an interface with Homefort\u2019s user app. When a smart metre is connected to a cylinder, the app allows the user to monitor the gas level in real-time,\u201d Owosho explains.\n\nThe company offers digital tools to enterprise customers to help them track the movement and location of their cylinders across the retail value chain.\n\n\u201cOur smart metre\u2019s tamper-proof feature achieves over 95% customer retention by preventing unauthorised retailers from refilling their cylinders,\u201d Owosho says.\n\nFor consumers, Homefort claims its smart metre transmits data about its consumers\u2019 gas usage to Homefort, which allows them to monitor the gas levels in their customers\u2019 cylinders remotely.\n\nHomefort\u2019s web app provides a bird\u2019s-eye view of gas levels in all of its customers\u2019 cylinders. As a result, when a customer runs out of gas, Homefort notifies them and schedules a delivery.\n\n\u201cWe notify and schedule a cylinder swap for customers who are running low on gas. As a result, our customers never run out of gas,\u201d Oyewumi says.\n\nMoreover, barcode tags on Homefort cylinders allow them to track the age and health of the cylinders in real-time. They also receive notifications when cylinders reach their expiration or maintenance dates.\n\nBesides, the company claims that its technology is exclusive to them. Its technology assists LPG marketing companies in increasing customer retention rates by preventing unauthorised retailers from refilling their cylinders, resulting in consumer retention rates of greater than 95%.\n\nIt also helps LPG marketing companies in tracking the location of their cylinders to reduce asset loss.\n\nSetting the pace in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGodwin Ogobye (CTO); Source: Supplied\n\nWhen it comes to LPG companies in Nigeria, Homefort believes that their competitors are still in the development phase, which gives them an early advantage.\n\n\u201cNupe Energy is Homefort\u2019s main competitor. However, as of now, they are not yet operational. Their product\u2019s hardware is complete, but they are still working on the software,\u201d Owosho clarifies.\n\n\u201cThere are competitors operating in East Africa, with two of them planning to expand into Nigeria, which I believe is a good thing because more competition leads to a faster consumer education curve,\u201d Ogboye says.\n\nOverall, Homefort believes that its competitive advantage stems from the team\u2019s unique skill set and in-depth knowledge of the industry.\n\nA model that works\n\nHomefort generates revenue from annual subscription fees and gas sales.\n\nThe Homefort app allows users to access the company\u2019s services. To gain access to Homefort, users must first install the Homefort app, available for both Android and iOS systems.\n\nUsers pay a \u20a620,000 ($48.59) annual subscription fee, which covers the costs of smart metre access, gas delivery, and cylinder maintenance.\n\nAlso, Homefort replaces a new user\u2019s existing cylinder with a brand new cylinder at no cost if the age of the existing cylinder is less than eight years post-production.\n\n\u201cThe expiration time for LPG cylinders is between 8-10 years. While most new users who switch to Homefort already have existing cylinders, we replace their existing cylinders with brand new cylinders from Homefort at no cost if the age of the existing cylinder is less than eight years,\u201d Oyewumi submits.\n\nNew users who do not have cylinders or whose cylinders are more than eight years old must purchase Homefort cylinders.\n\n\u201cOur gas is typically 5% less expensive than that of roadside convenience stores. We make a 30% profit on every 12kg of gas we supply to our customers,\u201d Ogboye says.\n\nUsers can use the app to track gas quantity used, gas quantity remaining, consumption, and transaction history. This feature is available and accessible to paid subscribers.\n\nSteady growth in a challenging economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDapo Oyewumi (CPO); Source: Supplied\n\nIn June 2021, Homefort raised a pre-seed round of $100,000 to help the company recruit its first hundred users. Idris Bello invested in the round.\n\nAlso, the company received $70,000 from All-on, the Nigeria Content and Monitoring Board, and Fate Foundation.\n\nEven though Homefort is barely 11 months old, the company has over 120 monthly active users. Also, in the last four months, its monthly user base has increased by 500%.\n\n\u201cWe have a long and growing waitlist of about 1,050 users. And our growth strategy is very enterprising; by December 2022, we plan to grow our user base to 5,000 per month,\u201d Owosho says.\n\nAccording to Oyewunmi, every member of the team, which has grown from 3 to 12, is wholly committed to the product\u2019s success.\n\nSome components of Homefort\u2019s smart metre are sourced from China and the depreciation of the naira against the US dollar has significantly impacted the company.\n\nHowever, it has begun reverse-engineering some of the components they import from China to reduce their reliance on dollars for component procurement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve begun reverse-engineering some of the components we import. By June 2022, we hope to have 70% of components sourced locally,\u201d Ogboye says.\n\nIn the last two years, both funders and the media have increased their focus on energy tech startups that focus on clean and renewable energy.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem is rapidly expanding. There is, in my opinion, no better time to be a founder than right now. The ecosystem\u2019s support from experienced founders is incredible,\u201d concludes Owosho.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthtracka, a Nigeria-based healthtech startup decentralised laboratory testing in Africa by providing at-home tests and digital results, has announced joining the Techstars Toronto Accelerator programme.\n\nThe three-month-long scheme will provide direct mentorship, funding, and access to a global network for the platform. The five-month-old startup will be joining 11 other startups in this cohort.\n\nLast week, we d\u00edd a feature on the startup. We discussed the inspiration behind the idea, starting and scaling in the ecosystem as a first-time female founder, foraying into the southwestern city of Ibadan, and much more.\n\nIn a follow-up conversation with the founder, \u00ccf\u1eb9ol\u00f9w\u00e0 Dare-Johnson, she discusses what a place in the Techstars Toronto means for Healthtracka, how she gauged the timing for applying to an accelerator and plans following the startup\u2019s time at the program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does it feel to get into Techstars Toronto?\n\nWe feel very validated. The problem we have set out to solve, poor access to laboratory tests, is one that we\u2019ve always known to be worth solving. Seeing a global accelerator like Techstars also identifying with us and backing us is exciting. It gives us a lot more motivation to make things work.\n\nHealthtracka is five months old; why apply to an accelerator?\n\nFor early-stage startups, and especially for a first-time founder like myself, there comes a time when you just want to ensure that you\u2019re building the right way. Why go through the mistakes those ahead of you made when you can learn from them? Accelerator programmes are opportunities to refine your ideas and processes through the right lenses.\n\nWould you recommend this move to other founders, and why?\n\nOh, yes, absolutely. I will recommend that every founder joins a global accelerator for the sake of themselves and their companies. Entrepreneurship can be a lonely excruciating journey, especially at the early stage, and being a part of a great accelerator programme is extremely valuable. Accelerators like Techstars are curated specifically to equip founders as they build and grow their early-stage startup companies.\n\nWhat was the attraction to Techstars?\n\nTheir reputation over the years. And as they say, Techstars is like the Havard of the ecosystem. They\u2019ve backed early-stage companies that have gone on to become Unicorns, so we recognised that they have \u00edntegrity. And of course, Techstars Toronto because I have spoken to Sunil, and I see how passionate he is about helping early-stage startups get to the next level. It is an opportunity to work with and learn from outstanding mentors and leverage their experience, skills, and network to create a platform where all Africans have access to at-home lab testing.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after the Techstars programme?\n\nOne of our key goals involves doubling our customer base, and we expect that from a numbers perspective, we can increase the number of tests carried out and our customer acquisition. We also hope that we have increased access to global opportunities and stakeholders, given the reputation of Techstars, which we\u2019re looking to ride on to make bigger moves.\n\nCan we expect Healthtracka\u2019s expansion into the Canadian market?\n\nAt this point, there\u2019s nothing out of the picture; we can think globally. If we decide to expand into Canada, Techstars has the resources to ensure that we have all the support that we need. There\u2019s a part of Techstars that is called Mentor Madness; it\u2019s basically back-to-back meetings with great mentors. There\u2019s just a lot in store for us following our time in the accelerator, and this is opening our minds to possibilities.\n\nWhat are your Africa expansion plans?\n\nWe\u2019re currently present in two Nigerian cities, and we\u2019re looking to expand across Nigeria and then into other African countries. The good thing about our model is that it\u2019s asset-light, so we\u2019re agile and can move fast. Beyond that, one of the things that makes us so proud is our impact. We\u2019re adding more years to people\u2019s lives by bringing the lab closer to them. Also, the fact that we\u2019re providing more jobs as we expand is something we\u2019re proud of.\n\nDo you think that healthtech is an attractive industry for investors?\n\nWell, fintech is booming right now in Africa. But then, my principle is to always look at the future. It\u2019s easy to say healthtech isn\u2019t getting as much investment, but a few years ago, when eCommerce seemed to be getting all the funding, some people were insightful enough to say fintech was the next big thing. And now, the truth is healthtech is the next big thing, especially in Africa, where various challenges require innovative solutions. And as these solutions are built, investors will see a lot more of these opportunities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealthtracka joins Nigerian startups like TalentQL, Quidax, and Treepz (formerly Plentywaka) in the Techstars Toronto portfolio.\n\nAccording to Sunil Sharma, Managing Director of Techstars Toronto, the nature of the problem that Healthtracka is looking to solve was a major attraction.\n\n\u201cAccessing healthcare in a timely manner is critical to protecting health. This is something that we immediately imagined as a serious problem in Africa with massive populations and crowded healthcare settings combined with gridlock traffic and low doctor-to-population ratios.\u201d\n\nRecognising the urgency of the problem, Sharma says that the issue of delayed access to healthcare services is not faced by Africans alone, so it was necessary to bring the team onboard.\n\n\u201cDespite being a more developed nation, Canadians also face long delays in laboratories and clinics, which can lead to testing delays or avoidance altogether. I could only imagine that if this is a problem here, it must be even more acute in Africa. When we met Ifeoluwa and Victor, we knew immediately that this was the team to back.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2006, Techstars is a seed accelerator that helps budding companies with human and financial resources, from mentors to funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

But new trends such as non-fungible tokens (NFT) prove that blockchain is capable of so much more.\n\nEven becoming a system of government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA system of government? Well, kind of. A Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is a blockchain innovation where organisations exist as computer code, and all operations are automated.\n\nHow does it work? It uses something called smart contracts. They\u2019re regular contracts but drawn up by a programmer instead of a lawyer.\n\nThese smart contracts ensure all parties hold up their end of the bargain when predetermined conditions have been met.\n\nStill don\u2019t get it? Our reporter, Bolu Abiodun, talks about Africa\u2019s first DAO, bnugDAO and what it all means.\n\nJust click this: DAO: A blockchain innovation that promises businesses and governments where everyone\u2019s the leader\n\nSendbox\u2019s $1.8 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotu Balogun and Olusegun Afolahan. Source: TechCrunch\n\nOn Monday, October 18, 2021, Nigerian eCommerce startup, Sendbox announced its $1.8 million seed round from 4DX Ventures, Enza Capital, Flexport, Y Combinator, FJ Labs, and Golden Palm Investments.\n\nThe idea for the Y Combinator portfolio company came to Emotu Balogun, Sendbox\u2019s Founder, from challenges he faced while running his previous startup, Traclist. He discovered that merchants struggled with fulfilling orders, so he started building Sendbox with Olusegun Afolahan in 2016.\n\nThe startup launched two years later in 2018 to provide African merchants with an efficient way to fulfil orders. Sendbox caters to different merchant classes and individuals looking to send items. Small merchants enjoy some discounts, saving up to 30% on delivery costs while eliminating the need for several logistics providers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, Sendbox offers local deliveries in Nigeria and international deliveries to up to 200 countries, including the US, the UK, and Canada. With this latest funding, the startup plans to offer finance and payments offerings to users and expand to East and West Africa.\n\neCommerce startups in Africa have not always hit the heights expected of them for various reasons. However, activities seem to have picked up in the last year, with several startups in Nigeria, Kenya, and Egypt, the recipients of substantial investment rounds.\n\nWith most of them focused on serving B2B clients, the African eCommerce landscape looks quite promising.\n\nUber is testing its ride-sharing service in Kenya\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRide-hailing company, Uber, is reportedly testing a new ride-sharing option, Pool Chance. Per TechCrunch, the service was discovered while trying to book a cab in Nairobi. Confirming this, an Uber spokesperson revealed the option could soon be available to users in Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nThis is the first time the service has been introduced by the startup in Africa and is similar to UberPool. With Pool Chance, users can get a discount if the driver picks up another rider. In Nairobi, the option is available on the Chap Chap service, while it will be available on the UberX category in Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLorraine Ondoru, Uber\u2019s Head of Communications for East and West Africa, speaking to TechCrunch, disclosed that the service would cut costs for riders. \u201cWe are currently trialling a new Uber ride, Pool Chance, which will cut costs for riders in Nairobi (Kenya) when they share their ride with others heading in the same direction.\n\n\u201cWe use this approach when introducing something new, and we want to ensure the marketplace remains healthy and balanced. We will share more details once this has been officially launched.\u201d\n\nAssuming Uber\u2019s plans for Pool Chance succeed, more users could sign up to use the service, thus increasing competition with Bolt, its biggest rival in Africa. In August, the latter closed a $600 million round, increasing its valuation to $4 billion and providing more resources to match Uber. So, you can expect to see a counteroffer from Bolt to users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nIn Venezuela, a Rum Maker Offers Gangsters a Life Outside of Crime.

          "title": "Household spending surpasses pre-pandemic levels yet Nigerians poorer",
          "text": "Household consumption has surpassed pre-pandemic levels because Nigerians have to pay more for goods and services and not because they are earning more.\n\nAccording to a report from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on the Expenditure and Income approach to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), household consumption rose 13.7 percent to N54.8 trillion in the first half (H1) of 2021 compared with N48.2 trillion in H1\u2019 2020 and N49 trillion and N44 trillion in H1\u2019 2019 and H1\u2019 2018, respectively.\n\nNigerians are spending more on goods and services as a result of rising prices, which reduces the funds available for savings and investment necessary to grow the economy.\n\n\u201cThe increase in household spending is a signal that people are spending more as a result of an increase in prices of goods and services not because they are earning more,\u201d Ayodeji Ebo, senior economist/head, research and strategy, Greenwich Merchant Bank, said, noting, \u201cThis will have significant implications on savings and investment.\u201d\n\nHousehold final consumption expenditure is a transaction of the national account\u2019s use of an income account representing consumer spending. It consists of the expenditure incurred by resident households on individual consumption goods and services.\n\nRead Also: Nigerian households\u2019 finances suffer deeper strain\n\nAlthough inflation has been declining for six straight months, at 16.63 percent in September 2021, most Nigerians are yet to feel the impact on the prices of goods and services.\n\nFor instance, BusinessDay findings show that a 12.5kg cooking gas cylinder was sold in Lagos for N3,800 in October 2020; N4,500 in June and July 2021; N6,000 in September, and now N7,500 in Lagos and Ogun states, depending on locations. Prices of major food items like bread, rice, egg and beans have also continued to soar.\n\n\u201cAnother reason aside the increase in prices is that economic activities have improved and job numbers have moderated compared to 2020 when people lost jobs, so people have more to spend,\u201d Temitope Omosuyi, an investment strategy analyst at Afrinvest Limited, said.\n\nHe also explained that during recessions when the government spent more to boost the economy, households spend less in an attempt to save for the future but as the economy rebounds, the consumption level picked up.\n\nHousehold consumption accounted for the largest share of real Gross Domestic Product at market prices, representing 53.68 percent and 51.82 percent in Q1 and Q2\u2019 2020, respectively, according to the NBS.\n\nHowever, with prices of goods rising and incomes stagnating, it means many people cannot afford to save, which has a grave impact on the economy.\n\n\u201cFor our stage of development, we need a lot of investment spending for us to boost our long-term growth potentials,\u201d said Omotola Abimbola, a macro economist at Lagos-based Chapel Hill Denham.\n\n\u201cThose have boosted investment spending a bit but we still need to see more to drive growth,\u201d Abimbola said.\n\nNigeria has one of the lowest savings rates globally. According to the International Monetary Fund, the gross savings rate in Nigeria stood at 13.9 percent in 2019, far below China at 45 percent, and even below Tanzania (24.8%), South Africa (15.8%) and Togo (21.2%).\n\nHigher savings help to finance higher levels of investment, which would boost productivity and economic growth.\n\nThe four components of the GDP are household consumption, private investment, government spending, and net exports.\n\nThese components explain that the GDP or output is a function of household consumption, government expenditure, investments and net export indicated as Y= C + G + I + (X-M).\n\nGovernment spending plunged 53.3 percent to N2.16 trillion in Q2\u20192021 compared with N4.63 trillion in Q2\u2019 2020 as private investment surged 46 percent to N13.43 trillion in the second quarter of 2021 compared with N9.20 trillion in the same period last year.\n\n(X-M) shows the difference between domestic spending on foreign goods (i.e., imports) and foreign spending on domestic goods (i.e., exports). Net exports grew 71.6 percent to N9.22 trillion in Q2\u2019 2021 from N5.37 trillion in the second quarter of 2020.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s economic growth will quicken in 2022 to a seven-year high of 3.3 percent before rising further by 3.8 percent and 3.9 percent in 2023 and 2024 respectively, as crude oil production recovers from a record low this year, the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a report Tuesday.\n\nIf the economy expands as predicted by EIU, it will also mark the first time Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer has expanded faster than population growth rate since 2015, snapping six straight years of decline that has thrown more Nigerians into the poverty pit.\n\nImproving oil production will serve as a trigger for other factors likely to boost growth in those years, according to the EIU.\n\n\u201cA more stable foreign exchange market, lower inflation and a smaller fiscal deficit freeing up credit to the private sector will also contribute and allow growth averaging 3.8 percent in 2023-2024,\u201d the EIU team noted.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria economy yet to heal after highest GDP growth since 2014\n\nThe EIU expects Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange scarcity to abate from 2022, \u201cas the current account turns to surplus, owing to higher exports and a lower import bill for petrol, following an increase in local refining capacity.\u201d\n\nThe picture is however predicted to change from 2025 with growth cooling to 1.7 percent and a further 1.0 percent in 2026, as global oil prices dip, a sign that Nigeria\u2019s reliance on its oil sector remains strong.\n\nA devaluation of the naira is also likely to happen in that period, according to the EIU team.\n\nNigerians, from households to manufacturers and investors, have been hard hit by a bruising fx shortage that has caused inflation to soar to about double of the Central Bank\u2019s preferred target.\n\nDespite a slowdown in the last six months, headline inflation in Nigeria remains at over 16 percent as against the CBN\u2019s target of between 6-9 percent.",

          "title": "Without jobs, protests like #EndSARS can reoccur \u2013 Analysts",
          "text": "Without jobs there are possibilities that the EndSARS protest that saw the Nigerian economy losing billions of naira in October 2020 could reoccur, analysts say.\n\n\u201cIf the youths were engaged with good and decent jobs, it would not have been easier to mobilise them considering the political apathy these young people have,\u201d Ayodele Shittu, a senior lecturer at the Department of Economics, the University of Lagos with specialisation in economics of entrepreneurship and innovation, said.\n\nAccording to Shittu, the solution is for the leaders, teachers, and politicians to consider investment in the capacity and development of these young Nigerians as a priority.\n\n\u201cOnce this is done, directly or indirectly, we will begin to stimulate production and once that is done, the level of consumption will reduce trade investments, exportation will begin to increase and this will create enough room to demand new products and services and that is where you need to demand labour.\u201d\n\nJennifer Oyelade, director of Transquisite Consulting, a UK and Nigerian registered Recruitment and Training Consultancy, advised that from an education perspective, social media marketing and strategy are areas to generate jobs since the youths spend a lot of time on social media.\n\n\u201cWe have a thriving digital market. So, if they engage themselves with more roles in digital marketing and work with organisations to increase their digital presence, that can generate jobs,\u201d Oyelade added.\n\nRead Also: Has anything changed since #EndSARS protests hit Nigeria?\n\nA year ago, Ridwan Muhammed, a 27-year old self-employed researcher went to the Lekki Express tollgate to protest harassment from the now disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) unit of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nThe harassment occurred due to the use of his laptop which he carries about every day as it is a means of generating income for himself.\n\n\u201cSince I cannot get a job, my laptop is a means of livelihood. But each time I go out, SARS and the police will harass me based on my laptop, labeling me a \u201cyahoo boy,\u201d Muhammed complained.\n\nJust like Muhammed, enraged Nigerian youths took to the streets to protest against police brutality, the insidious failure and neglect of the government to deliver good and equitable economic opportunities to them.\n\nBut the aftermath of the protest had a negative impact on the economy as it lost over N700 billion to the protest, according to the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI). And the economy is yet to recover from that impact.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest economy has a large, vibrant, and young population which comprises over 65 percent. But a broken educational system and dearth of opportunities have made the government regard them as less important. As a result, they have continued to flee the country in search of a better future elsewhere, thereby fuelling the country\u2019s brain drain.\n\nAccording to a 2020 Next Generation survey report by the British Council, employment worries (80 percent), crime (74 percent), political corruption and/or violence (73 percent), and lack of financial security (72 percent) are the main matters personally affecting young Nigerians.\n\nA young female from Port Harcourt, Rivers State who does not want her name printed, said in the report that, unlike Nigeria, graduates in other countries already know the field they will fall into.\n\n\u201cHere you will hunt for jobs hopelessly because the government doesn\u2019t have anything good for you.\u201d\n\nTwo recessions experienced in the last five years caused by the decline in global oil prices in 2016 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2o20 has pushed more people, particularly the youth into the unemployment net.\n\nAvailable data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show that within those two periods, the number of unemployed persons has risen by 100 percent to 23.2 million in Q4 2020 from 11.6 million in Q4 2016.\n\nAlso, those unemployed that fall within the age group of 15-34, rose by 62 percent to 12.8 million in Q4 2020 from 7.9 million in the same period of 2016. Unemployment within that age group is usually the highest compared to other groups.\n\nAnd the unemployment numbers are expected to increase as the World Bank has projected that by 2030, the number of youth needing jobs will increase to 40.2 million from about 30.8 million projected in 2021, as poverty further pushes them to seek work rather than remaining in school.\n\n\u201cMacroeconomic reforms to the exchange-rate, trade, and fiscal policies to diversify revenue sources away from oil and ignite the structural transformation are needed to create good wage jobs,\u201d the report advised.\n\nIt is also called rendering help to small enterprises so they can thrive and grow. \u201cFor farms, this involves research into improved crop and livestock varieties as well as public investment to support storage, transport, and market access could help boost agricultural productivity.\u201d\n\nSholarin David, a partner with Grace Curia Attorneys said the country needs to change the orientation from certificate to skill acquisition.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s bring the required skills into the university and teach them. The knowledge they have acquired to make them educated, they can input that into the skills and that will bring innovation. When that is done people will be busy, reducing the reliance on the government for jobs,\u201d Sholarin further said.",

          "title": "How FirstBank Employees Making a Difference Through the SPARK Initiative",
          "text": "Every other day, social media brings us a picture or video of a dilapidated school somewhere in Nigeria or shares images of a distraught widow, a struggling roadside trader or street hawker, or some other hapless victims of the extremely harsh realities of living in Nigeria. Immediately, as if on cue or automated, viewers launch into stinging attacks of government, public officials, the privileged class and even Nigeria itself. The attacking mob wastes no time in calling for the government\u2019s head or the heads of public officials with responsibilities in the jurisdiction or sector where the unfortunate sights surfaced from.\n\nThe online mob seems unconcerned that while its eyes and ears, aided and locked in by the binoculars and headsets of social media, are completely focused on distressing situations it may not be able to help other than rant about, countless situations that it can help are calling for attention in its immediate neighbourhood every single day. Focusing on things so far away while ignoring or pretending not to see the things in one\u2019s immediate vicinity is a human tendency which is well recognised. Journalists even have a term for a similar or related behaviour among their own. \u201cAfghanistanism\u201d is the tendency of the media to focus on news and happenings in remote places and other parts of the world to the exclusion or neglect of covering happenings and problems in the local environment of the media. It is like the psychological or emotional equivalent of the eye defect medical practitioners refer to as hyperopia or farsightedness. Sufferers can see objects that are far away but have difficulty focusing on objects that are up close.\n\nBy focusing on faraway objects people do not have to offer to give a helping hand but can offer their finger to point at others and their tongue to criticise and pontificate. Everyone can criticise and pontificate online or become an \u201ce-warrior\u201d, like Nigerians like to call it, fighting government and whoever and whatever in society they are unhappy with from the comfort and safety of their bedroom and behind their keyboard. It is the easiest of things to do but not the noblest or kindest. It is the well-trodden path but should never be confused with taking the high road in reaching out with compassion to people around whose lives and circumstances could do with some kindness.\n\nTaking the high road rather than practising Afghanistanism or psychological hyperopia is the approach adopted by First Bank of Nigeria Limited, the premier bank in West Africa with its impact woven into the fabric of society. This approach has played an important role in sustaining FirstBank\u2019s development-oriented services for over 127 years as the region\u2019s foremost financial inclusion services provider. It has been a driving motivation for how the bank operates. FirstBank always considers the impact of all its operations and actions on customers and other stakeholders, including the environment, to ensure it is making a net positive difference in the end. And this orientation has attracted to the bank people who share a similar outlook \u2013 whether as employees, partners or other stakeholders. They look forward every year to an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of the bank and make a net positive difference in their own immediate environments. These men and women do not pretend that they can solve or intervene in all the challenging situations confronting people in their immediate environments but they do not refrain whenever they can lend a helping hand and make a difference.\n\nThrough an Employee Giving and Volunteering programme employees of FirstBank find a ready platform to fully identify with the compassionate disposition of the bank, which further has a number of initiatives that enable employees to give expression to this identification. The Start Performing Acts of Random Kindness (SPARK) Initiative is but one such initiative. Aimed at expanding and deepening FirstBank\u2019s involvement within the communities of its various stakeholders, SPARK seeks to do so by integrating and institutionalising random acts of kindness in society. Among employees SPARK has inspired and encouraged kindness and empathy as well as consideration for others. It has also contributed to employee bonding and teamwork, which have been critical to enhancing work performance.\n\nThis year\u2019s implementation of the SPARK Initiative has seen employees under the banner of their various departments make choices regarding the specific nature of intervention they would want to undertake and the specific group of people or institutions within their immediate communities that they would want to extend the milk of human kindness to. Employees and their departments could choose any one of the four areas that constitute FirstBank\u2019s corporate responsibility and sustainability (CR&S) pillars: Education, entrepreneurship, health and welfare, and environment. Under education, they have had a choice to make between support for infrastructural facilities in schools, such as renovation of dilapidated buildings, painting of school buildings, and provision of laptops and desktops; or donation of items such as classroom chairs and tables, books and stationaries; or provision of scholarships for best students, feeding of school students per day or week, funding of a school initiative such as JETS club, bootcamp, space club, etc. If employees and their departments were interested in supporting entrepreneurship, then they had the chance to empower through entrepreneurship programmes of their choosing such as sponsoring youth and women to acquire skills like fashion designing, baking, hairstyling, make-up artistry, electrical repairs, event decoration and planning, catering, etc., or enabling entrepreneurs with tools and equipment to work or supporting SMEs and start-ups.\n\nWhere the health and welfare area was their preferred area of intervention, employees and their departments could choose from: donations to orphanages (selected from an approved list of orphanages); support to a good cause, for example lending a helping hand to the Down Syndrome Foundation; support to widows; support to people with health-related issues; and off-setting medical bills. And if employees and their departments were to decide to go for the environment, then they could choose from: support to environmental issues, such as support to Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) initiatives; donation of garbage cans to a community; partnership with a recycling firm to recycle waste; support to LAWMA such as donating cleaning tools (brooms, dustbin parkers), etc.\n\nWhile several departments in FirstBank did things worth showcasing so the good citizens of Nigeria (individual and corporate) can emulate, this piece has just enough space to accommodate the activities of only three departments: Human Capital Management and Development (HCMD), Compliance, and Marketing and Corporate Communications (M&CC) departments. The employees in these departments seemed involved in efforts to outdo each other in acts of kindness, which made more sense and would leave a real difference on the ground as against criticising and pontificating online on faraway issues.\n\nThe Human Capital Management and Development department decided that reaching out to one of the most vulnerable groups in Nigeria \u2013 underprivileged widows and their underfed children \u2013 was the best way they could stay true to the \u201cHuman\u201d in their name. And employees in the department moved beyond their Marina location to the nearest environment where some of the most vulnerable widows are to be found to go show kindness. The Makoko community situated in Lagos Mainland and which CNN once described in a report as \u201cNigeria\u2019s floating slum\u201d was overwhelmed to receive the august visitors from HCMD bearing so much food stuff to benefit their widows and children. What they did not realise was the overwhelming sense of gratitude felt by their benefactors for the opportunity to be able to give back.\n\nTagged \u201cFeed a Widow Initiative\u201d, the undertaking was HCMD employees\u2019 way of putting a smile back on the faces of widows in impoverished communities and they got more than they could ever have imagined. Their hosts received them with the broadest of smiles and said goodbye to them with the grandest of gratitude; and they left with very broad smiles on their own faces. The jury is still out on who between the hosts and their guests ended up with the broadest of smiles on the day. And given the \u201cfierce contest\u201d to outdo the other in smiling, one is again forced to wonder why people labelled e-warriors would choose to forfeit this kind of real joy for the joyless world they have locked themselves in by clinging on to Afghanistanism and psychological hyperopia.\n\nNot so for employees in the Compliance department. Not to be outdone and, in fact, as though going up the hierarchy of human needs, Compliance employees decided that they would focus on the education need of their beneficiary community. HCMD had done an excellent job of providing the basic \u201cstomach infrastructure\u201d without which it would be difficult, if not impossible, to get any of the beneficiaries interested in any talk about more sublime matters like education and mental development. So, employees of Compliance department, in order to encourage pupils to continue their pursuit of education, procured Mathematics and English Language textbooks for 617 pupils who would be in senior secondary (SS) 1 and 2 classes of Gbara Community Secondary School in Jakande, Ajah in the next academic session. The visit to the school and book donation were undertaken when the pupils were in the third term preceding the new academic session.\n\nThe gesture was Compliance employees\u2019 own way of giving back in such a manner as to relieve the pupils of this public school, particularly those from indigent homes, and their parents or guardians of the financial burden involved in providing textbooks for the two core subjects. It was also, in an uncanny way, an attempt by the employees to ensure the pupils were in full compliance with the requirements for taking on the two most important subjects in the secondary school curriculum, putting the pupils at a vantage position to excel in these two essential subjects. There were other benefits of the engagement that the employees noted. They observed that their presence in the school inspired the children, giving them \u201chope that a better life was within reach and could be achieved.\u201d The employees thus expressed optimism that the engagement boosted the children\u2019s interest in succeeding in life through the pursuit of education.\n\nFor employees of the Marketing and Corporate Communications department (M&CC), entrepreneurship was the area they decided to focus on, to make a difference in their own immediate environment. Every day they came to their office on Broad Street or the bank\u2019s head office in Marina, they passed by a number of roadside traders around the various office buildings in the locations. They observed that some of these traders were exposed to the elements or having difficulties in their business and struggling to make ends meet, and decided that they would do something about it. And true to their word, they did something about it that made so much difference in the businesses and circumstances of the traders. They provided the traders the following: branded umbrella to offer shade from both sun and rain, improving the conditions under which they operated and their quality of life; branded chairs and tables to accommodate more customers in their corner as well as grants to boost their business capital.\n\nAnyone who has met with employees in the corporate communications department of any major bank in Nigeria would readily admit that these professionals have among them some of the most skilful digital marketers around. So, it is not for lack of skills to be e-warriors that M&CC employees chose to extend the milk of human kindness flowing in them to roadside traders around their office rather than practise Afghanistanism. They could have chosen to concentrate all their time and resources on attacking the government online and blaming public officials for all the challenges in the economy and the spate of insecurity all over the nation and whatever else would make M&CC employees true champions of Afghanistanism and psychological hyperopia. But would that make any difference to the lot of the roadside traders around them and lessen their burden? So, M&CC employees chose the road less travelled but one that could deliver the desired impact, and it did.\n\nThere are so many lessons to draw and feelings to take away from the examples demonstrated by employees of these three departments in Nigeria\u2019s foremost lender. Besides committing their time and resources to their chosen humanitarian initiatives using the platform of the SPARK Initiative that places FirstBank at the forefront of the social impact space through employee advocacy, the employees have shown that they have the milk of human kindness flowing through their veins. They have demonstrated that they would rather consider how they could extend kindness to people around them and make a difference than pretend not to see the situations affecting those around them while playing Afghanistanism and psychological hyperopia online.\n\nFor the rest of us who are not FirstBank employees, the message could not be clearer: The next time we feel like we must share on social media distressing images to provoke government-bashing or we feel constrained to make stinging comments on such images that are shared to criticise Nigeria, we should first pause and look around us. We should look to see if we can identify situations where we, not government or Nigeria, can make a difference. Then we should take our fingers off the keyboard and go out there or make that call that will make a difference in some other person\u2019s life and circumstances. We should be like FirstBank and its employees. We should follow their example of trying to outdo themselves in showing kindness to others. We should start where we are with what we have, to make a difference right now \u2013 yes, this very minute and not some future time.",
          "summary": "FirstBank always considers the impact of all its operations and actions on customers and other stakeholders, including the environment, to ensure it is making a net positive difference in the end.\nAnd this orientation has attracted to the bank people who share a similar outlook \u2013 whether as employees, partners or other stakeholders.\nThe Start Performing Acts of Random Kindness (SPARK) Initiative is but one such initiative.\nAmong employees SPARK has inspired and encouraged kindness and empathy as well as consideration for others.\nWe should look to see if we can identify situations where we, not government or Nigeria, can make a difference.",

This is in recognition of rights of every Nigerian to express his or her interest.\n\n\u201cWe wish we could permit such street protests. However, intelligence at our disposal has revealed plans by some faceless groups or individuals to stage an anti-EndSARS anniversary protest in the state same day.\n\n\u201cIn view of the conflicting interest between the pro and anti- EndSARS anniversary groups and threat to cause mayhem, the Command once again warns both groups against any form of street protest between now and 20th October, 2021 and beyond,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement added that \u201cIt is acknowledged that citizens have the right to peaceful protests. However, in this instance having carried out a critical security assessment and intelligence report at the disposal of the Lagos Command in respect of the planned protests and attendant implications on public safety, the Command considers it inappropriate to allow such protests to hold. It will not stand aloof and allow breakdown of law and order which the protests may cause.\n\n\u201cTo avoid a recurrence of the gory protests of last year during which some innocent Nigerians including police officers were gruesomely murdered, private and public property plundered and maliciously destroyed, the police will not abdicate their responsibilities of protection of lives and property by allowing such avoidable incident happen again in the state\n\n\u201cTherefore, in the interest of security and public safety, the Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, wishes to warn the organisers of the protests that the police will deploy all legitimate means to stop or neutralise the planned protests.\u201d\n\nThe police warned parents, guardians to warn their children against participating in the protests.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, youths and other individuals or groups planning to take part in the protests are further warned in their own interest to shelve the plan,\u201d the statement said.",

The artist, then, threatened to show up at the Governor\u2019s office to present the humorous image.\n\n\n\nThe artist\u2019s audacity elicited Sanwo-Olu\u2019s response under the viral post, inviting the artist to present the funny drawing.\n\n\n\nSanwo-Olu, dressed in Boy Scouts\u2019 venturing green shirt, beret and light-brown pant with yellow tie to match, received the comic image from the artist and praised the creativity behind the post.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m truly excited with the creativity we have in Lagos and the amount of talented youths we have here.

          "text": "\n\nMuslim Community across the world marked Eid-el-Maulud Nabyyi (birth of the Holy Prophet Muhammad), with the northern governors calling on Mulslim faithful to emulate the teachings and virtues of the Holy Prophet Mohammed (S.A.W).\n\nChairman Northern Governors Forum (NGF) and Plateau state Governor Simon Lalong gave the charge in a message in a statement by his director of press, Dr Makut Macham.\n\nThe NGF said: \u201cThe special occasion brings to remembrance the teachings of the Holy Prophet who emphasized love, forgiveness, peaceful coexistence and humility among others.\n\n\u201cThe failure of humanity to practice love is what has given rise to selfishness, violence, intolerance, religious bigotry, ethnic hatred, corruption, high crime rate and unimaginable level of wickedness that is prevalent in various forms.\u201d\n\nHe added that the celebration should be used as a moment for reflection and reconsideration of the fortunes of the nation, which the governors believed \u201ccan be changed if all Muslims live their lives according to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as contained in the Holy Qur\u2019an.\u201d\n\nLalong said \u201cNigeria in dire need of inter-religious harmony and dialogue, practical faith based conduct as well as truthful lifestyles that unite people and enhances their ability to experience and share love with one another irrespective of their faiths, education, economic status and ethnicity.\u201d\n\nWhile wishing the Muslim community a successful celebration, Governor Lalong assured that \u201cthe Northern Governors Forum will continue to work hard in promoting peace, tolerance, national unity and religious harmony particularly in the present circumstances where the nation is in need of a common front to overcome, corruption, insurgency, fight poverty and accelerate development.\u201d\n\nCleric urges job creation\n\nAlso, a renowned Islamic cleric, Sheikh Khalifah Aliyu Ahmad Abulfatahi, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle poverty and related suffering confronting the Nigerian masses.\n\nThe Islamic scholar also called on the federal government to create job opportunities for the teeming unemployed youths who have graduated and roaming the streets in search of jobs.\n\n\n\nSheikh Abdulfatahi made the plea while addressing a mammoth crowd of faithful from far and near that converged on the Madinatu Jummaat Central Mosque, Maiduguri, Borno state to celebrate the event.\n\nAt the event were Muslim faithful from Sudan, Senegal, Ghana, Mali, Morrocco, Mauritania, Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon.\n\nAnd from within the country, attendees came from Lagos, Oyo, Kwara, Kogi, Niger, Sokoto, Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi, Kaduna, Kano, Nasarawa, Gombe, Bauchi, Plateau, Yobe, Jigawa and Benue states among others.\n\nThe occasion was organised by Sheikh Ahmadu Aliyu Abulfatahi Foundation.\n\nAddressing the gathering, Sheikh Abdulfatahi said the event was to serve as remember of the prophet\u2019s struggles, efforts, teachings, sacrifices and propagation of Islam.\n\nHe said it was also to celebrate the successes recorded so far, especially \u201con how Islam is being widely accepted as a religion of peace and unity, expanded and developed the Muslim community worldwide in unity and diversity of all races, tribes, origins, riches, poverty and knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe gathering prayed for peace, unity and stability of the country, particularly, a quick return of permanent peace and harmony to Borno state and north-east region as well as the country as a whole.\n\n\n\nAbdulfattahi also urged \u201cNigerian leaders to continue to be honest, have the fear of God in their dealings and carry their subjects along by way of fulfilling their electioneering campaign promises and providing for the less privileged or needles in the society.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAssisting the needy or providing succour to the poor or less privileged in the society is very rewarding and God is always with those who help others among them especially, the poor,\u201d the cleric said,\n\nHe also called on Muslims to emulate the virtues of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (SAW), his successors and descendents.\n\n\n\nHe thanked Borno state Governor Babagana Umara Zulum and other Mulsim faithful that attended the event.\n\nMMWG\n\nAlso, the Muslim Media Watch Group of Nigeria (MMWG) tasked Nigeria leaders to do things right all times for the nation\u2019s prosperity.\n\nIn its message to mark the Eid el- Maulud, the group stated that \u201cthe exemplary character of the Holy Prophet made him an outstanding Leader during his own time and his integrity earned him large followership in the Communities where he never lived before that is \u2013 Madinah and in Makkah \u2013 where he was earlier driven out.\u201d\n\nThe group said \u201chis triumphant entry back to Makkah was a significant turning-point which all followers and leaders must underscore that \u2013 with good leadership and followership \u2013 a Nation could reach the greater heights in no distant time.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by its National Coordinator Abdullahi Ibrahim and made available to journalists Tuesday, the MMWG observed that \u201d few Nigerian Leaders have discipline and integrity.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, \u201cwas responsible for bad governance leading to unfulfilled promises to the electorates, corruption, lack of strong legal backing to stem insecurity, immorality and underdevelopment in areas of economy, health, education and provision of social infrastructures.\u201d\n\nThe statement called on Nigerians \u201cto be selective in the choice of their Representatives and Leaders to be voted for come 2023 Elections, otherwise their situation would not change if credible Leaders and Representatives are not chosen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Media Watch Group commended President Muhammad Buhari on his achievements in areas of infrastructural development so far \u2013 stating that the decay in the Nation\u2019s infrastructure was massive due to corruption of the past adding that that is why his giant strides in the area is being under-estimated.\n\n\u201cOn corruption, the Group called on President Buhari to step up his anti-corruption fight, especially on creation of special courts to deal with all the outstanding anti-corruption cases and other economic crimes. It also commended the President on his efforts in seeking global support on fighting insecurity and rehabilitation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMMWG stated that celebration of Birthday of Prophet Muhammad would of be no value to Muslims who jettison his ideals of religious commitment, tolerance of the people of other faiths and building of egalitarian Society where welfare of the less-privileged is prioritised.\u201d\n\n\u2018Better tomorrow awaits Nigeria\u2019\n\nIn a similar message, Chairman Senate Committee on Local Content Teslim Folarin surged Nigerians to be hopeful of a better tomorrow for the country .\n\nSenator Folarin, who represents Oyo Central Senatorial District, stated this in his message to felicitate with Muslim faithful on this year\u2019s celebration of the birthday of Holy Prophet Muhammad (SAW).\n\nHe stressed that for the better tomorrow, the time has come for Muslim Ummah in and across the country to pray for Nigeria to overcome the current economic crisis in the land.\n\nIn the message made available by his special adviser on media and publicity, Comrade YSO Olaniyi, the lawmaker said \u201cthe life and times of Holy Prophet Muhammed (SAW) were replete with lessons of sacrifice, service and humility. The virtues of service and exemplary leadership, as demonstrated by the Holy Prophet, should guide Nigerian leaders to give their all in the overall interest of Nigerians.\u201d.\n\nWhile wishing all Muslims a happy celebration, the lawmaker reiterated his pledge to continue providing qualitative representation and meaningful dividends of democracy to his constituents and the state at large.\n\nPDP urges rebirth\n\nIn a related message, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) urged Nigerians to use the occasion of this year\u2019s Eid-el Maulud for solemn introspection and make commitment towards a rebirth in all areas of national life.\n\nPDP National Publicity Secretary Kola Ologbondiyan said this in a statement in Abuja Tuesday.\n\nHe said: \u201cEid el-Maulud, the celebration of the birth of Holy Prophet Mohammed, presents a providential occasion for our nation to put behind, all issues that cause disunity, disaffection, strife and despondency and move to a new beginning by embracing the virtues of love for one another, tolerance, mutual understanding and forgiveness, in line with the teaching of the Holy Prophet.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur party urges Nigerians to resist all forces that seek to disunite them for selfish reasons and continue to work together, especially in their determination to and chart a new course for our dear nation on the platform of the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also calls on Nigerians to use the occasion to make fervent supplication to God for divine intervention as well as show love by reaching out to one another, especially the less privileged and victims of escalated acts of terrorism in our country.\n\n\u201cThe party also urges those behind the mindless killings and acts of terrorism in our country to have a rethink and retrace their steps, while charging those in authority to redouble their efforts in finding solutions to the challenges facing our nation at this critical time.\n\n\u201cThe PDP felicitates with Nigerians and wishes them a happy Eid-el Maulud celebration,\u201d the party said.\n\nAPC\n\nMeanwhile, a voluntary think-tank group of the All Progressives Congress, known as APC Legacy Awareness and Campaign (APC-LAC) has said the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration was backing efficiency and transparency in the management of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas resources with action.\n\nThe group added that the president would not slow down or relent on efforts to transform the NNPC.\n\nLeaders of the group; Barr. Ismail Ahmed, Lanre Issa-Onilu, Tolu Ogunlesi and Salihu Moh. Lukman, said this in a statement Tuesday in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s promise to bring long overdue efficiency and transparency to the management of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas resources is being backed by action. And the journey has only just started. President Buhari will not slow down or relent in his NNPC reform efforts.\n\n\u201cOne of the many transformational legacies that will be associated with his administration will be the rebirth of the National Oil Company, and a repositioning that will set it on the path to becoming a world-class institution,\u201d they said.\n\nThe statement listed some of the achievements of the APC-led administration to include: \u201cPublished Audited Financial Statements for 2018, 2019 and 2020. This is the first published Audited Financial Statements since the NNPC came into existence 43 years ago.\n\n\u201cCommenced clearing the backlog of Cash Call arrears owed International Oil Companies (IOCs), inherited from previous administrations, and amounting to more than five billion dollars.\n\n\u201cCompleted the Escravos-Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS) Phase 2, doubling its capacity to 2.2 billion cubic feet of gas.\n\n\u201cCommenced construction of the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) Gas pipeline, Nigeria\u2019s biggest-ever domestic gas pipeline project.\n\n\u201cCommenced the total revamp of the Port Harcourt refinery \u2013 yet another industry jinx being broken.\n\n\u201cResolved a 12-year-old dispute surrounding (Oil Mining License) OML 118, unlocking more than $10 billion of potential investment held up by the dispute,\u201d among others.\n\n\u201cThe crowning achievement has been the presidential assent to the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), after two decades of unsuccessful attempts. With the emergence of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), a new chapter has definitely commenced in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\n\u201cNew industry regulatory agencies have been established, to provide the necessary oversight befitting the new status quo, and the President has received National Assembly approval for his nominees to the management teams of these new agencies. It is truly a new dawn for oil and gas in Nigeria,\u201d it said.\n\n",

          "text": "The security challenge facing the Nigeria\u2019s south-eastern region took a turn for the worse Monday when gunmen stormed a stakeholders\u2019 meeting in Nnenasaa, headquarters of Njaba local government of Imo state, killing two traditional rulers.\n\nBlueprint gathered that the meeting was being held to find a lasting solution to the lingering security problem in the local government area, particularly the activities of unknown gunmen.\n\nOne of our correspondents learnt that over 10 traditional rulers were in attendance.\n\nThe names of the dead monarchs were given as the Obi 1 of Okwudor autonomous community, Eze E. Anayochukwu Durueburuo and Eze Sampson Osunwa of Ihebineowerre autonomous community.\n\nIn the ensuing melee, some attendees who got injured were rushed to the hospital, while others were also lucky to have escaped unhurt.\n\nPolice spokesperson in the state, Mike Abattam, who confirmed the incident to journalists, said the command had commenced investigation into the attack.\n\nBandits neutralised\n\nAnd in a combined air and ground assaults, troops neutralised over 50 bandits in Birnin Gwari local government area of Kaduna state, the Kaduna state government has said.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan said Tuesday in a statement in Kaduna.\n\nHe said the bandits were killed at the Saulawa-Farin Ruwa axis of Birnin Gwari council.\n\n\u201cOver 50 bandits have been neutralized during a combined ground and air assault in the Saulawa-Farin Ruwa axis of Birnin Gwari LGA.\n\n\u201cAccording to operational feedback to the Kaduna state government from the Command of the Joint Operations, a Nigerian Air Force helicopter gunship provided close air support to ground troops advancing from the Dogon Dawa-Damari-Saulawa axis.\n\n\u201cFollowing extensive scans, bandits were spotted on five motorcycles, about 4km east of Saulawa, waiting to ambush the ground forces. They were engaged vigorously by the helicopter gunship, and were wiped out.\n\n\u201cAfter this, armed bandits on about 50 motorcycles were sighted fleeing towards Farin Ruwa, and were struck effectively by the gunship. Fleeing remnants were mopped up by ground forces.\n\n\u201cA second helicopter gunship joined the operations, and many more fleeing bandits were neutralized by precise strikes. Assessment revealed that more than 50 bandits were neutralised during the joint operation.\n\n\u201cGovernor Nasir el-Rufai expressed his satisfaction at the operational feedback, and congratulated the ground troops and gunship crews on the rout. He urged them to sustain the momentum and bring even more bandits to their bitter end,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nEight terrorists killed\n\nIn a related development, about eight terrorists of the Islamic State West Africa (ISWAP) and Boko Haram were killed in an encounter with troops of Operation Hadin Kai, Nigeria\u2019s counter terrorism operation in the North-east.\n\nArmy spokesperson, Brig-Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, said this in a statement Monday.\n\nHe said the eight terrorists died during two different encounters.\n\n\u201cThe first incident took place on Monday at the Forward Operating Base (FOB) Wulgo, Borno state. The second took place around 151 Battalion location where their gun truck ran over a Vehicle Improvised Explosive Device. Four terrorists died in each of the operations,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said fighting equipment such as AK 47 rifles, six magazines and 50 rounds of 7.62mm special were also recovered from them.\n\nThe statement further quoted the chief of Army staff, Lt. Gen Faruk Yahaya as commending the efforts of the troops and urged them to be more focused.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cTroops of Joint Task Force North East Operation HADIN KAI (OPHK) deployed alongside Cameroonian Defence Force have exterminated four ISWAP/BHTs at the Forward Operating Base (FOB) Wulgo, on 18 October 2021.\n\n\u201cThe vigilant troops successfully foiled an attempted infiltration of the terrorists group into the camp, while on a patrol to dominate their area of responsibility. The troops swiftly responded with overwhelming volume of fire and spontaneous reinforcement from the Battalion Headquarters, compelling the terrorists to retreat.\n\n\u201cTroops immediately carried out a hot pursuit and exploitation after the encounter, along the terrorists\u2019 route of withdrawal and neutralised three BHTs. The gallant troops also recovered three AK 47 rifles, six magazines and 50 rounds of 7.62mm special.\n\n\u201cIn another development, four ISWAP/BHTs terrorists have met their Waterloo same date, around 151 Battalion location. The terrorists were burnt beyond recognition, as their Gun truck mounted with Anti Aircraft Guns ran over Vehicle Improvised Explosive Device. Own troops are currently conducting further exploitation ahead of the location to clear any surviving terrorist.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya has commended the efforts of the troops and charged them to remain aggressive and focused, as they dominate their areas of operational responsibility, in order to ensure complete extermination of the terrorists and restoration of normalcy.\u201d",

          "title": "Trump Files Lawsuit to Keep January 6 Documents from Congress",
          "text": "Former President Donald Trump on Monday sought to block the release of documents related to the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection to a House committee investigating the attack, challenging President Joe Biden\u2019s initial decision to waive executive privilege.\n\nIn a federal lawsuit, Trump said the committee\u2019s August request was \u201calmost limitless in scope,\u201d and sought many records that weren\u2019t connected to the siege. He called it a \u201cvexatious, illegal fishing expedition\u201d that was \u201cuntethered from any legitimate legislative purpose,\u201d according to the papers filed in federal court in the District of Columbia.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawsuit was expected, as he had said he would challenge the investigation and at least one ally, Steve Bannon, has defied a subpoena. But the legal challenge went beyond the initial 125 pages of records that Biden recently cleared for release to the committee. The suit, which names the committee as well as the National Archives, seeks to invalidate the entirety of the congressional request, calling it overly broad, unduly burdensome and a challenge to separation of powers. It requests a court injunction to bar the archivist from producing the documents.\n\nIn a joint statement late Monday, Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the panel\u2019s vice chairwoman, said they would fight the lawsuit, which they said is \u201cnothing more than an attempt to delay and obstruct\u201d the investigation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long history of the White House accommodating congressional investigative requests when the public interest outweighs other concerns,\u201d Thompson and Cheney said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more compelling public interest than trying to get answers about an attack on our democracy and an attempt to overturn the results of an election.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration, in clearing the documents for release, said the violent siege of the Capitol more than nine months ago was such an extraordinary circumstance that it merited waiving the privilege that usually protects White House communications.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawsuit came the evening before the panel is scheduled to vote to recommend that Bannon be held in criminal contempt of Congress for his defiance of the committee\u2019s demands for documents and testimony. In a resolution released Monday, the committee asserts that the former Trump aide and podcast host has no legal standing to rebuff the committee, even as Trump\u2019s lawyer has asked him not to disclose information. Bannon was a private citizen when he spoke to Trump ahead of the attack, the committee said, and Trump has not asserted any such executive privilege claims to the panel itself.\n\nThe resolution lists many ways in which Bannon was involved in the leadup to the insurrection, including reports that he encouraged Trump to focus on Jan. 6, the day Congress certified the presidential vote, and his comments on Jan. 5 that \u201call hell is going to break loose\u201d the next day.\n\n\u201cMr. Bannon appears to have played a multi-faceted role in the events of January 6th, and the American people are entitled to hear his first-hand testimony regarding his actions,\u201d the committee wrote.\n\nOnce the committee votes on the Bannon contempt resolution, it will go to the full House for a vote and then on to the Justice Department, which would decide whether to prosecute.\n\nIn a letter obtained by The Associated Press, the White House also worked to undercut Bannon\u2019s argument. Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su wrote that the president\u2019s decision on the documents applied to Bannon, too, and \u201cat this point we are not aware of any basis for your client\u2019s refusal to appear for a deposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s determination that an assertion of privilege is not justified with respect to these subjects applies to your client\u2019s deposition testimony and to any documents your client may possess concerning either subject,\u201d Su wrote to Bannon\u2019s lawyer.\n\nBannon\u2019s attorney said he had not yet seen the letter and could not comment on it. While Bannon has said he needs a court order before complying with his subpoena, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and former White House and Pentagon aide Kashyap Patel have been negotiating with the committee. It is unclear whether a fourth former White House aide, Dan Scavino, will comply.\n\nThe committee has also subpoenaed more than a dozen people who helped plan Trump rallies ahead of the siege, and some of them have already said they would turn over documents and give testimony.\n\nLawmakers want the testimony, and the documents, as part of their investigation into how a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, a violent effort to halt the certification of Biden\u2019s election win. The committee demanded a broad range of executive branch papers related to intelligence gathered before the attack, security preparations during and before the siege, the pro-Trump rallies held that day and Trump\u2019s false claims that he won the election, among other matters.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawsuit says the \u201cboundless requests included over fifty individual requests for documents and information, and mentioned more than thirty individuals, including those working inside and outside government.\u201d\n\nThe files must be withheld, the lawsuit says, because they could include \u201cconversations with (or about) foreign leaders, attorney work product, the most sensitive of national security secrets, along with any and all privileged communications among a pool of potentially hundreds of people.\u201d\n\nThe suit also challenges the legality of the Presidential Records Act, arguing that allowing an incumbent president to waive executive privilege of a predecessor just months after they left office is inherently unconstitutional. Biden has said he would go through each request separately to determine whether that privilege should be waived.\n\nWhile not spelled out in the Constitution, executive privilege has developed to protect a president\u2019s ability to obtain candid counsel from his advisers without fear of immediate public disclosure and to protect his confidential communications relating to official responsibilities.\n\nBut that privilege has had its limitations in extraordinary situations, as exemplified during the Watergate scandal, when the Supreme Court ruled it could not be used to shield the release of secret Oval Office tapes sought in a criminal inquiry, and following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nMonday\u2019s lawsuit was filed by Jesse Binnall, an attorney based in Alexandria, Virginia, who represented Trump in an unsuccessful lawsuit late last year seeking to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in Nevada. Trump and his allies have continued to make baseless claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump\u2019s suit quotes from the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2020 ruling in a case by House committees seeking the then-sitting president\u2019s tax returns and other financial records. But that case involved courts enforcing a congressional subpoena. The high court in that case directed lower courts t o apply a balancing test to determine whether to turn over the records \u2014 it\u2019s still pending.\n\nWhite House spokesman Mike Gwin said, \u201cAs President Biden determined, the constitutional protections of executive privilege should not be used to shield information that reflects a clear and apparent effort to subvert the Constitution itself.\u201d\n\nAP",

          "text": "Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Interior Affairs has said girls will be allowed to return to secondary schools soon.\n\nSaeed Khosty, a spokesman for the interior ministry, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the exact timing will be announced by the Ministry of Education.\n\n\u201cFrom my understanding and information, in a very short time all the universities and schools will be reopened and all the girls and women will return to school and their teaching jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing the Taliban\u2019s takeover of Afghanistan, teenage girls were told to stay home from school until a \u201csafe learning environment\u201d could be established. But boys in all grades and girls of primary age were told to return to school.\n\nThe exclusion of older girls has aggravated fears that the Taliban could be returning to their hardline rule of the 1990s, when women and girls were legally barred from education and employment.\n\nKhosti \u201cindicated that it was imminent that girls in secondary schools and their female teachers would be returning very soon,\u201d said Al Jazeera\u2019s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Kabul.\n\n\u201cThis is something that we\u2019ve been hearing from the Taliban since they took power. Yes, they\u2019re going to return. But it\u2019s going to take time. And of course, that\u2019s taking a toll on a lot of the girls,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey want to go back to school, they want to continue their studies. This is also one of the demands of the international community for the Taliban to protect and safeguard the rights of girls and women to go to school and to work.\u201d\n\nWhen the Taliban took power in August, the armed group promised to uphold the rights of girls and women. But its actions since have worried the international community.\n\nIt has sent mixed signals about women returning to work in government offices and has forced universities to enact policies of gender segregation in order to reopen.\n\nIt also named an all-male cabinet, saying women could be included later.\n\nAntonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, earlier this month condemned the Taliban\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d promises to Afghan women and girls and appealed to the group to fulfil their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law.\n\n\u201cBroken promises leads to broken dreams for the women and girls of Afghanistan,\u201d the UN chief said. \u201cWomen and girls need to be in the centre of attention.\u201d\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s rollback of women\u2019s rights has also prompted criticism from Qatar and Pakistan, which have called on the international community to engage with the Taliban.\n\nAt a news conference last month, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said it \u201chas been very disappointing to see some steps being taken backwards\u201d by the Taliban.\n\nAl Thani said Qatar, which hosts the Taliban\u2019s political office, should be used as a model for how a Muslim society can be run. \u201cOur system is an Islamic system [but] we have women outnumbering men in workforces, in government and in higher education.\u201d\n\nPakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan meanwhile said that although he doubted the Taliban would once again place an outright ban on girls\u2019 education, the group should be reminded that Islam would never allow such a thing to happen again.\n\n\u201cThe idea that women should not be educated is just not Islamic. It has nothing to do with religion,\u201d Khan told the BBC media outlet.",
