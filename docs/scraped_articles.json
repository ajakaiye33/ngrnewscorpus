          "text": "The Nigerian Bar Association, some Senior Advocates of Nigeria and the Oyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde, have cautioned the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), against the move to amend the Land Use Act.\n\nWhile the NBA and senior lawyers, including Ifedayo Adedipe, Yusuf Ali and Tayo Oyetibo said the Federal Government\u2019s move was unconstitutional, Makinde stated that he would not support it.\n\nThe Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, had on Thursday said the Federal Government was reviewing the Land Use Act of 1978.\n\nMustapha, who was represented by a permanent secretary in the Office of the SGF at the 51st annual conference of the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers in Abuja, said the review would take out sections of the Act that inhibited economic development.\n\nI won\u2019t support violation of Land Use Act- Makinde\n\nBut Makinde said the Land Use Act of 1978 vested the control of land in each state in the governor.\n\nHe said he did not envisage anybody to take any step that would be contrary to this.\n\nThe governor, who said this on Wednesday through his Chief Press Secretary, Taiwo Adisa, while responding to an inquiry by one of our correspondents, said he would not support any step taken outside the constitution concerning the issue of land.\n\nHe said, \u201cGovernor Makinde is a believer in the constitution of the land. He will not support anything that is outside the stipulations of the constitution.\n\n\u201cAs much as we know, the Land Use Act is a constitutional matter and the states must be involved in anything that has to do with its review.\n\n\u201cThe act has vested the lands in the governor of the state and we don\u2019t envisage anyone taking contrary steps.\u201d\n\nLand is our inheritance in S\u2019East, we won\u2019t support what hurts our people\u2014Umahi\n\nAlso, the Ebonyi Government State said it would oppose the Federal Government\u2019s move to review the Land Use Act, if other states in the country faulted it.\n\nThe Ebonyi State Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources, Chief Ogodo Ali, stated this in Abakaliki on Tuesday, in a telephone interview with one of our correspondents.\n\nThe commissioner, \u201cI am a man under command and whatever my governor says, is what I stand for. But I know that the Land Use Act cannot be reviewed just like that. And to review the Act, it has to go through a lot of processes.\n\n\u201cI am of the opinion that once the state governments begin to kick against this kind of move from the Federal Government, I know my own governor. He will oppose it.\n\n\u201cI heard him (my governor) speak today, that in the South-East, what our forefathers left for us is land. Some people bequeath gold and silver; but a few others, like in the South-East, bequeath land.\n\n\u201cAnd I know that my governor loves his people and he wouldn\u2019t like anything to hurt his people and that was why he opposed Ruga. So, we have to toe the path where our people must be protected, without attacking any arm of the government.\u201d\n\nMove, unconstitutional \u2013 NBA\n\nThe Assistant Publicity Secretary of the NBA, Ferdinand Naza, while speaking to one of our correspondents on the intended review of the Land Use Act, said, \u201cIn Nigeria, there are procedures which have been laid down for the amendment of a law, such the Land Use Act in this case. According to the Nigerian constitution, only the National Assembly can review or amend the Land Use Act.\n\n\u201cIf there is any proposed review to the Act, my advice to the President is that it should first be submitted to the floor of the National Assembly for debate.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s move suspicious, unconstitutional \u2013 SANs\n\nSenior lawyers, in separate interviews with The PUNCH on Wednesday, warned the President and the Federal Government, saying they could not singlehandedly review the Land Use Act,\n\nIfedayo Adedipe (SAN), told one of our correspondents that, \u201c As a Nigerian citizen, I really worry about the obsession of our President over this grazing issue.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the National and State Houses of Assembly have to be involved before any amendment or review can take place. Nevertheless, I view with suspicion the attempt by the President to review the Land Use Act, considering his stance on this grazing issue.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it is important to state that people engaging in animal husbandry do so for their own personal benefits. Grazing is simply one of many private businesses run by individuals, not the government. It is really unfortunate that the President has chosen to obsess over this issue.\u201d\n\nYusuf Ali (SAN), said, \u201cThe Land Use Act is part of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the constitution expressly states the method by which the Act can be reviewed. It is clear that the President cannot singlehandedly review a law; he has to first propose a review or amendment to the National Assembly before anything can be done.\n\n\u201cI am eager to see the changes the President wants to effect in the Land Use Act so I can ascertain the true purpose of this intended review.\u201d\n\nTayo Oyetibo (SAN), stated, \u201cThe Land Use Act has been integrated into the constitution so the procedure for amending the Act invariably involves the National Assembly. Although the President can initiate this process, it has to first pass through the National Assembly; there is no other way.\n\n\u201cWhat matters the most is that the constitutional provisions for the amendment of an Act must be complied with.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Security expert advocates measure to boost Police morale -",
          "text": "Prince Obed Chinonyerem\n\nBy Henry Ojelu\n\nA security expert, Prince Obed Chinonyerem has said that one of the key ways to encourage Police officers to effectively execute the job of securing the country is for citizens to show them love and appreciation.\n\nPrince Chinonyerem stated this in Lagos while speaking at a Strategic Crime Control Programme in Lagos tagged \u2018Police is Our Friend\u2019 organised by the Global Allies And Lovers Of the Police Network, GALPONET, a non-governmental organisation promoting the interest and welfare of police officers and their families.\n\nChinonyerem who is also the convener of GALPONET noted that police officers are tasked with the onerous duty of protecting the citizens despite facing many economic and social challenges but are less appreciated and loved by those they protect.\n\nHe advocated a change of the current negative attitude towards the police and insisted that to boost the morale of police officers, citizens must also play the role of showing love, care, and appreciation.\n\nREAD ALSO: Perspectives on the Nigeria Police Force\n\nChinonyerem pointed out that an average police officer is not a happy person because of poor salary, unhealthy work environment, societal negligence, and many other factors yet he or she is compelled to protect citizens who do not appreciate them.\n\nHe said: \u201cUntil we begin to change this negative attitude, we may not get the kind of police we desire.\n\n\u201cShowing love to police officers\u2019 wives, husbands, children, and relatives around you, gives, them the impression that they are respected and are obliged to do more.\n\n\u201cNo nation can survive in this world without police, as long as lives, properties, law, and order are concerned in that nation.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s all start doing this and see if police will harass anyone or ask anyone for a bribe.\n\n\u201cThey will automatically feel loved and appreciated. That alone would lift their souls, raise their commitment to quality service with integrity.\u201d\n\nGiving insight on the reason behind the \u2018Police is Our Friend\u2019 campaign embarked on by GASPONET, Chinonyerem said: \u201cFriendship doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum, it is a function of love, respect, understanding, and responsibilities, meaning if we\u2019re not shown any of these, then we shouldn\u2019t expect the benefits accrued to friendship.\n\n\u201clf police is truly our friend, will you be happy seeing your friend working under the rain and hot sun, patrolling in the middle of the night risking his life for the citizens; all for a salary less than what we spend daily.\n\n\u201cCompared to the countries across the world, NPF salary structure is referred to as \u201csurvival stipend\u201d\n\nThe average Nigerian police is not a happy man or woman. As a result of poor salary, unhealthy working environment, societal negligence, more especially the rank and files, accumulated bills to pay, personal family issues to attend to.\n\n\u201cYet, he\u2019s being pushed under the sun to control traffic and watch over you, who hardly appreciates him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s there doing a job he knows his family\u2019s future is not guaranteed; should he lose his life, because he has practically seen how the families of those who died to suffer. How many of us can do this?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the light of this, that we decided to come up with this initiative. We want a change of our perception and attitude towards the Police; we are the ones to make them feel loved and appreciated before we can enjoy them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to take this campaign to schools, churches business places, even to our creche, nursery and primary schools, it is a high time we stop making them become Police-phobia, by threatening them that police will arrest them.\n\n\u201cWe should start letting our children know that Police is for their good interest, they do the job of the pastor, evangelist, teacher, prophet, and apostle to the citizens, by guiding them to know and say the truth always.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a time when our governors will declare a day as \u201cPOLICE APPRECIATION DAY\u201d (PAD) Just to encourage them.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

They have been escaping. But what we did this year is, before the results are brought here, they are taken to Bursary to confirm those that have paid the charges.\n\n\u201cSo it is those that are confirmed that the academic board will consider their results and release. For those who have not paid the service charges, we would not release their results. So if you want to see your result, go and pay the service charges.\n\n\u201cNow that group, they are going to write exams now, they have not paid last session, they have not paid this session and they want us to release that result for them so that they can write this exam again. That is the major issue\u201d.\n\nHe listed some achievements recorded since assumption of office in 2017, to include reduction of examination period for both Regular 1 and Regular 2 (part time) students to three, instead of six weeks, leading to reduction in security cost, as well as drop in the level of malpractice and impersonation during examinations.\n\n\u201cOther achievements are the introduction of a student work study scheme for indigent students which is part of the entrepreneurship idea of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, a more efficient education portal to ease payment of charges, the construction of 3,000 capacity auditorium which is 95 percent completed and a table water factory.\u201d\n\nCharging students not to give room to distractions such as unproductive use of phones, unending partying, he said \u201cthere is no short cut to success. You must sit down and open your book. You must take your lectures, go for your lab and workshops. You must also, take notes\u201d.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Sola Ogundipe\n\nThe World Bank has announced a provision of $4.4 billion for the purchase and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines for 51 developing countries, but Nigeria is not listed among the benefiting countries half of which are in Africa.\n\n\n\nThe financing is part of the Bank\u2019s commitment to help low- and middle-income countries acquire and distribute vaccines and strengthen their health systems.\n\n\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the Bank said more than half of the latest financing comes from the International Development Association, IDA, the Bank\u2019s fund for the world\u2019s poorest countries, and is on grant or highly concessional terms.\n\n\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Bank Group has approved more than $150 billion to fight the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the development, World Bank Managing Director of Operations, Axel van Trotsenburg, said: \u201cThe World Bank is helping developing countries in every region of the world with vaccine purchase and rollout. Significant challenges still remain regarding vaccine deployment and hesitancy.\n\n\u201cWe are taking action on all fronts to tackle these challenges, working in solidarity with international and regional partners to expedite doses to as many people as possible and to enhance disease surveillance, preparedness, and response.\u201d\n\n\n\nReiterating its call to governments, pharmaceutical companies, and organisations involved in vaccine procurement and delivery, the Bank urged for help to increase transparency and build greater public information regarding vaccine contracts, options and agreements, vaccine financing and delivery agreements, and doses delivered and future delivery plans.\n\n\n\nThe Bank asked the countries anticipating excess vaccine supplies in the coming months to release their surplus doses and options as soon as possible, in a transparent manner, to developing countries with adequate distribution plans in place.\n\n\n\nThe $4.4 billion is supporting COVID-19 vaccination efforts in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Benin, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Comoros, the Republic of Congo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, El Salvador, Eswatini, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, and Honduras.\n\n\n\nOthers are Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Kosovo, the Kyrgyz Republic, Lao PDR, Lebanon, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Moldova, Mongolia, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Rwanda, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tajikistan, Togo, Tunisia, Ukraine, Yemen, and Zambia.\n\nAccording to the Bank, its vaccine finance package is designed to be flexible. It can be used by countries to acquire doses through COVAX, the Africa Vaccine Acquisition Task Team, AVATT, or other sources.\n\n\n\nIt also finances vaccine deployment and health system strengthening, such as vaccine cold-chains, training health workers, data and information systems, and communications and outreach campaigns to key stakeholders which are crucial to ensure vaccination acceptance.\n\n\n\nThe Bank has aligned its eligibility criteria for COVID-19 vaccines with the revised eligibility criteria of COVAX and other multilateral partners and is partnering with the African Union and Africa Centre for Disease Control to support AVATT initiative with resources to allow countries to purchase and deploy vaccines for up to 400 million people across Africa.\n\n\n\nThe Bank is also convening a task force with the IMF, WHO, WTO, and other partners to track, coordinate, and advance delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries.\n\nLatest findings show that 95 percent of countries have developed national vaccination plans, 79 percent have safety measures in place, and 82 percent have prioritizations of populations to receive the vaccine.\n\n\n\nHowever, only 59 percent have developed plans to train the large number of vaccinators needed and less than half have a plan in place to generate public confidence, trust, and demand for COVID-19 vaccines.",

Needless to say that this is a man who has the interest of others at heart. He is selfless. Now that\u2019s so rare to find in the sphere of public service.\n\n\u201cOn this 60th birthday celebration, I extol a caring and charismatic leader who discharges his duties with a youthful spirit and creditably well too, while exhibiting fantastic leadership qualities.\n\n\u201cIn the words of John C. Maxwell, \u201ca leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way\u201d. Sir, permit me to say I am grateful and thankful for having you as a brother, leader, role model, and guardian.\n\n\u201cHaving the privilege to be close to you, one would learn patience, humility, nobility, dutifulness, and appreciable workplace ethics. You are one man who won\u2019t allow power and fame to get into his head while maintaining his self-confidence though.\n\n\u201cOn this special day of yours, I pray God continues to guide you and expand you more in all facets of your life.

He was granted bail by Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nMarch 28, 2019 \u2014 Justice Binta Nyako revoked the bail that was granted to Kanu on health grounds and issued a bench warrant for his arrest.\n\nSeptember 2017 \u2014 Kanu disappeared from public radar after his home was raided by the military.\n\nHe reportedly fled the country after the invasion of his home in Afara-Ukwu near Umuahia, Abia State, during military\u2019s \u2018Operation Python Dance II\u2019 staged to quell agitation for Biafra Republic in September 2017.\n\nSeptember 20, 2017 \u2014 The federal government obtained a court order on to designate IPOB a terrorist group and to proscribe it.\n\nFebruary 19, 2018 \u2014 The Federal High Court in Abuja ordered that Kanu, be separately tried from the rest of his co-defendants.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe was facing a five-count treasonable felony charge alongside four other pro-Biafra agitators \u2013 Chidiebere Onwudiwe, Benjamin Madubugwu, David Nwawuisi and Bright Chimezie.\n\nNovember 26, 2020 \u2014 A Federal High Court in Abuja commenced Kanu\u2019s trial, in his absence. Five prosecution witnesses were provided to testify against Kanu.\n\nJanuary 27, 2021 \u2014 The Federal High Court Abuja continued the trial of Kanu. The matter was initially fixed for hearing on Nov. 26, but when it was called, both Kanu and his counsel, Mr Ifeanyi Ejiofor were absent in court.\n\nThe notice was served on the federal government\u2019s prosecution team and Ifeanyi Ejiofor, the defendant\u2019s counsel.\n\nJune 27, 2021 \u2014 The Federal Government in collaboration with security agencies apprehended and brought Kanu back to Nigeria.\n\nJuly 26, 2021 \u2014 The Federal High Court, Abuja, ordered that Kanu, be remanded in the Department of State Service (DSS) facility, pending the trial continuation.",

          "text": "By Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has slammed his Zamfara State\u2019s counterpart, Muhammad Matawalle, for dumping the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC ) saying his integrity and credibility were at stake.\n\nWike reasoned that only governors, who failed to develop their state, were trooping to the APC to escape prosecution vowing that he would never betray his people and his party.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople must have respect for themselves. There are things I cannot do for the sake of my children. In 2019, Matawalle said I will never leave PDP.\n\n\u201cI will never disappoint PDP. If I disappoint PDP, I will never have peace in my life. Today, what has happened? Is everything politics? It is not true.\n\n\u201cEverything cannot be politics. Your credibility, your integrity is important in life. I will never betray my people.\u201d\n\nHe said the preoccupation of any governor, who meant well for his state, should be the delivery of dividends of democracy to the citizenry and not to join the APC.\n\nWike spoke during the inauguration of the reconstructed Rumuigbo, Chief Johnson Amadi, Igbodo, Finima, Rumuopareli, Bauchi, Ohia and Isaac Boro streets in Old Government Residential Area (GRA), Port Harcourt.\n\nThe governor insisted that only spineless governors and politicians would succumb to threats and blackmail of the ruling APC to join the party or risk persecution.\n\nHe expressed disappointment that President Muhammadu Buhari had yet to ask Prof. Ben Ayade of Cross River State the fate of the superhighway project he invited him to flag off at the beginning of his administration.\n\n\u201cA governor invited Mr President (Muhammadu Buhari) to flag off a super highway of 260 km, and up till now, Mr President has not asked the governor about the highway,\u201d he said.\n\nWike explained his administration had since 2015 made conscientious effort to transform the landscape of Rivers and restore the Garden City status of Port Harcourt, contrary to \u201cmisleading lies being peddled by the likes of former Director-General of Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr Dakuku Peterside.\n\nThe governor in a statement signed by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, alleged that said Peterside, lacked the moral rectitude to criticise his administration.\n\nHe said it was unfortunate that, persons, who laid the foundation for cultism in Nigerian universities had gradually found their way into the country\u2019s political sphere.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWike said the cluelessness and lack of focus of the immediate past administration in the state, in which Peterside served as Commissioner for Works, led to the abandonment of projects like Abonnema Ring Road awarded by Governor Peter Odili, Rumuolumeni-Rumuepirikon road, Woji road among others.\n\nBut, he said he had since completed such projects in the interest of the state.\n\nThe governor described the former NIMASA DG as a political neophyte saying the PDP won all the elections in his Opobo Local Government Area since 2015.\n\nWike maintained that curfew imposed in the state following attacks on security formation would only be relaxed when he received security briefs from the State Security Council.\n\nHe said: \u201cI will not lift the curfew until the security people tell me it is time to call off the curfew. Only criminals complain against the curfew. I prefer to protect life and property.\u201d\n\nFormer Fovernor of Abia State and Senator representing Abia Central, Senator Theodore Orji , who performed the inauguration of the eight streets, commended Wike for the infrastructural transformation in Rivers.\n\nHe noted that Rivers people were happy with the achievements of the Wike\u2019s administration because the state remained the only place where projects were being commissioned and inaugurated on daily basis.\n\nOrji said it was rather mischievous for Peterside and others to peddle lies about the glaring developmental strides of the Wike\u2019s administration.\n\nRivers State Commissioner of Works, Elloka Tasie-Amadi said the reconstructed eight streets had a combined length of 4.4km, an average road width of 9m (7m to 10m) and 3.7km of new drains.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis project to the uninitiated will look merely like an improvement in the character of the road and its design speeds having been reconstructed and expanded, but it goes beyond the road.\n\n\u201cIt not only improves the character of the neighbourhood and by extension our capital, it (the reconstruction) goes further to positively impact on real estate, security and much more, offering all the benefits associated with good road and transportation access.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, these roads have been built to last, freeing up funds for other needs in the future. It is said that it is always cheaper to do it well the first time thereby avoiding costly repairs and repeat works.\u201d",

          "title": "Nnamdi Kanu Now Dot in a Circle, Arrested in Addis Ababa, Remanded",
          "text": "Tells court why he fled\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\n\n\nAbout three years after jumping bail, the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, was yesterday re-arraigned before Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja, for the continuation of his trial for treasonable felony.\n\nReliable security sources told THISDAY yesterday that Kanu was rearrested in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia by Interpol following an intensive search for him by the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) in collaboration with its foreign counterparts.\n\nAccording to the sources, when, following the storming of his parent\u2019s compound in Afaraukwu, Abia State, by a detachment of soldiers on 14th September 2017, Kanu \u2018disappeared\u2019 virtually into thin air, the federal government felt concerned. Since both, his Nigerian and British passports were still in the custody of the Federal High Court in Abuja, there were strong suspicions that Kanu got the support of the United Kingdom High Commission in Nigeria for his escape. That was later proved to be the case.\n\nA security source, who spoke to THISDAY last night, said the federal government was further incensed when a global human rights agency sent a letter to the Permanent Mission in New York, asking Nigeria to either produce Kanu or explain his whereabouts.\n\n\u201cOnly a few days later, Kanu surfaced in Jerusalem, Israel, with a photograph taken at the \u2018Wailing Wall\u2019 where he granted one of those his stupid interviews,\u201d said the source.\n\nThe security source explained that whereas Kanu breached all the conditions for which he was granted bail by the Federal High Court in Abuja on 29th April 2017, he orchestrated a campaign of calumny against the country.\n\n\u201cFirst, he went into hiding, creating the impression that he was killed by soldiers and when he eventually appeared, he became more emboldened in his criminal activities,\u201d she said.\n\nKanu, according to the security source, was able to travel to many countries around the world because he holds a British passport.\n\n\u201cWith that, he thought he was invincible. From wherever location, he was operating from (and I can tell you that he has not been to the UK in the past two years), he used the power of social media to cause havoc by making incendiary broadcasts,\u201d she said.\n\nWith the money Kanu reportedly garnered through fundraising to \u201cestablish his phantom Biafran Republic\u201d, according to the source, Kanu lived large, and that eventually proved to be his undoing.\n\n\u201cWhat he did not know was that the security agencies were on his trail. His lifestyles consisted mostly of going out with different women, buying expensive pieces of jewelry, chartering aircraft, and drinks. And because he got many gullible people who were donating to his so-called IPOB, he had so much money to play with such that he even hired lobby groups for his propaganda activities,\u201d the security source told THISDAY.\n\nShe explained that the security agencies have intercepts of how Kanu formed the Eastern Security Networks (ESN) and how the members became a terror group as well as his directives to IPOB operatives that bordered on incitement to violence. \u201cWe know those he collaborated with to instigate the killings against the police in the South-east,\u201d said the source who added that it was on Kanu\u2019s instruction that certain prominent politicians from the Southeast should be visited with violence whenever they are sighted abroad.\n\nThe source cited the specific example of former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu.\n\nAfter trailing Kanu for several months and infiltrating his ranks, the security agencies finally pinned him into Addis Ababa where he was arrested by Interpol and then extradited to Abuja last Sunday.\n\nKanu returned yesterday to the court of Justice Nyako that had in late 2017 granted him bail.\n\nThe self-acclaimed leader of IPOB and four others were arraigned before the Federal High Court on a six-count criminal charge bordering on a treasonable felony in June 2016.\n\nThough they pleaded not guilty to the charge, different judges, including Justice Nyako, who heard the case denied their bail.\n\nHowever, Justice Nyako soft-pedaled following Kanu\u2019s deteriorating health and admitted him to bail to enable him to access quality medical care.\n\nThe court, on April 25, 2017, had admitted him to bail in the sum of N100 million and three sureties in like sum, one of whom must be a serving senator. This made Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe stand in for him.\n\nHowever, Kanu\u2019s bail was revoked in March 2019 and a bench warrant for his arrest issued in November 2019, following his long absence in court for his trial.\n\nThe court also separated the trial of Kanu from five others earlier arraigned with him to pave the way for the continuation of their trial.\n\nBut with his arrest and extradition, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, earlier announced yesterday, Kanu was brought before Justice Nyako by personnel of the Department of State Services (DSS), to continue his trial.\n\nThe Federal High Court complex in Abuja was completely taken over by a contingent of policemen to prevent a possible security breach by Kanu\u2019s supporters.\n\nFew minutes to his entering the dock, Malami, at an emergency press briefing, told judicial correspondents that Kanu was intercepted by security agents and was being taken to court for continuation of his trial.\n\nMalami, who was flanked by the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Alkali Usman; police spokesman, Mr. Frank Mba, and his DSS counterpart, Dr. Peter Afunanya, was silent on where Kanu was arrested.\n\nHe said: \u201cSelf-acclaimed leader of the proscribed secessionist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has been arrested through the collaborative efforts of Nigerian intelligence and security services.\n\n\u201cHe has been brought back to Nigeria in order to continue facing trial after disappearing while on bail regarding 11- count charge against him.\n\n\u201cRecent steps taken by the federal government saw to the interception of the fugitive Kanu on Sunday, the 27th day of June 2021.\n\n\u201cNwannekaenyi Nnamdi Ngozichukwu Okwu-Kanu, born 25th day of September 1967 at Afaraukwu, Abia State, is a holder of Nigerian Passport No. A05136827 first issued on 17th October 2013 at FESTAC, Lagos.\u201d\n\nMalami added that Kanu was arrested on October 14, 2015, on an 11-count charge bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms and improper importation of goods, among others.\n\nMalami added that Kanu, upon jumping bail, engaged in subversive activities that include inciting violence through television, radio, and online broadcasts against Nigeria and its institutions.\n\n\u201cKanu was also accused of instigating violence, especially in the South-eastern Nigeria that resulted in the loss of lives and property of civilians, military, paramilitary, police forces and destruction of civil institutions and symbols of authorities.\u201d\n\nHowever, following his appearance in court, Justice Nyako ordered Kanu to be remanded in the custody of the DSS.\n\nThe remand order was sequel to an application by the federal government\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Shuaibu Labaran.\n\nRuling on the remand application, Justice Nyako held that the prosecution should inform Kanu\u2019s lawyer of his re-arrest and remand in the custody of the DSS, as well as the next, adjourned date.\n\nThe judge subsequently adjourned till July 26 for the continuation of the trial.\n\nTells Court Why He Fled\n\nMeanwhile, Kanu has rationalised his jumping bail, saying he abandoned his trial and escaped out of the country in 2017 following a threat to his life.\n\nHe sought the permission of the court to speak, shortly after he re-arraigned.\n\nThough he did not have any legal representation, Kanu, who was dressed in a black tracksuit, looked healthy and unruffled.\n\nHe explained that he did not deliberately abscond from the court to avoid trial.\n\nHe said his disappearance was due to the unlawful invasion of his house by security agents, in an operation, he said resulted in the death of many innocent people.\n\nHe added that he went underground to avoid being killed.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy lord, my house was invaded and people were killed. I would have been killed too if I had not hidden myself. That was why I have been unable to attend court.\n\n\u201cI would have been killed the way others were killed when my house was invaded.\u201d\n\nJustice Nyako asked him to get in touch with his lawyer to brief him about all that had transpired in the case in his absence.\n\nKanu\u2019s Family Speaks on Arrest, Warns FG\n\nThe family of Kanu yesterday told the federal government not to maltreat their son.\n\nHis younger brother, Emmanuel, told journalists in Umuahia that Kanu is on the path of truth and has not committed any crime to deserve persecution.\n\nHe said the IPOB leader was only demanding freedom for Biafrans, which is their fundamental human right.\n\nHe warned the federal government to handle their son with caution, adding that the whole world is watching.\n\n\u201cMy brother (Kanu) has awoken the consciousness of Nigerians about the goings-on in the country.\n\n\u201cHe stood for the truth, and heaven is on the part of anyone standing for the truth.

          "text": "Deputy gov: PDP can still retrieve our mandate\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has explained that the impressive performance of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) at all levels of government was responsible for the defection of Zamfara State Governor, Hon. Bello Matawalle from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling APC.\n\nMatawalle yesterday formally announced his defection to the APC.\n\nHowever, the deputy governor of the state, Mr. Mahdi Gusau, who refused to defect with Matawalle, has said the PDP could retrieve its mandate from the governor.\n\nThe National Chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, has, however, said that the party is confident of winning the 2023 general election, despite the defection of some of its governors to the APC.\n\nSpeaking at a rally yesterday in Gusau, Matawalle said that he had been nursing the ambition of leaving his party, PDP, for several reasons.\n\n\u201cI am now the leader of APC in Zamfara State and I am ready to work with each and everyone wishing to contribute to the rapid development of the state,\u201d he said.\n\nThe APC National Caretaker Committee Chairman and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, congratulated Matawalle for defecting to the party.\n\nBuni said Matawalle is now the leader of APC in Zamfara State.\n\nHe also announced that the state APC caretaker committee has been dissolved.\n\n\u201cI also want to bring to your notice that as from today, the APC Caretaker Committees of Zamfara State from the ward to the state level have been dissolved,\u201d Buni said.\n\nAlso speaking at the occasion, former governor of the state, Mr. AbdulAziz Yari welcomed Matawalle to APC, adding that, he was ready to give all necessary support and cooperation for him to succeed.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to bring to the notice of each and every one in Zamfara State that I am not in any way against the defection of Governor Matawalle to our great party.\n\n\u201cI was a governor for two terms; as such, I thank the Almighty Allah for giving me the chance to lead my people for eight years.\u201d\n\nMatawalle joined the APC with all members of the state House of Assembly and National Assembly members except a representative from Anka/Talata-Mafara Federal Constituency and the deputy governor, who remains in the PDP.\n\nThe rally was attended by governors of Kogi, Niger, Katsina, Kaduna, Kano, Borno, Ogun, Jigawa, Plateau, and Kebbi State; Secretary to the Government of Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha; and Minister of Humanitarian Affairs among others.\n\nThe event scheduled for 2 pm, did not start until after 6.30 pm.\n\nIn his swift reaction to the defection, the deputy governor told journalists in Abuja that the PDP should retrieve its mandate from the Zamfara State governor.\n\nHe argued that the Supreme Court judgment was clear, stressing that the mandate belongs to the opposition party.\n\n\u201cJudgment was divine. The Supreme Court said that the APC has no votes because of the quarrel and crisis in the party and said that the party that came second should assume office as the governor. So, this is divine; if the PDP desires to reclaim its stolen mandate, the party is free.

I am free and I have not committed any impeachable offence.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis is not the first time that a governor will defect without his deputy. It happened when Wamakko defected to the APC and his deputy, Muktar Shagari, remained a member of the PDP.\u201d\n\nAlso, reacting to the defection, the president, in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, congratulated Matawalle on his defection from the PDP to the APC, saying the ruling party \u201cis becoming more popular because of its impressive performance record and commitment to good governance.\u201d\n\nIn a message delivered on his behalf at the defection ceremony by the SGF, Mustapha, President Buhari said: \u201cI\u2019m proud of your timely and wise decision to join the governing party and our doors are wide open to other politicians who believe in our vision to rebuild Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYour voluntary decision to join our party confirms the fact that our agenda for good governance is the only reason why Nigerians are getting attracted to the APC because the other alternative didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThe President used the forum to urge APC Governors and elected lawmakers across the country to continue to work harder to ensure the party maintains its popularity and retains power beyond 2023.\n\nHe reminded all elected party officials of the fact that \u201cyour performance at all levels will impact significantly on the fortunes of the party\u201d, adding that \u201cparty leaders should avoid complacency at all times in order to build the APC from strength to strength.\u201d\n\nSecondus: PDP will Still Win Presidential Election, Despite Defections.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Chairman of the PDP, Secondus yesterday said that the party is confident of winning 2023 general election, despite the defection of some of its governors to the APC.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, Secondus also accused the APC governors who gathered in Gusau, Zamfara State to celebrate the defection of Matawalle, of celebrating bloodshed of innocent Nigerians that died in the insurgency in the state.\n\n\u201cThey are going after our governors but we are going after the masses of this country. The governors have one vote but we have the people, the masses, the people who are suffering under this government.\n\n\u201cWe feel the pains of Nigerians who are suffering, those slaughtered like chicken and killed. We have the majority support of the people and will form the next government at the centre,\u201d he reiterated.\n\n\u201cThe masses are solidly behind us, the masses are for the PDP and we stand here to state clearly that we shall form this new government coming in 2023 because of the masses and not because of the governors.\u201d, the national chairman of PDP said.\n\nSecondus acknowledged that the deputy governor, Gusau and eight members of the Zamfara State House of Assembly did not defect with the governor.\n\nSecondus said clearly that the party will challenge the defection of Matawalle in court as there is no provision of independent candidate in the electoral laws.\n\n\u201cI have never seen where you have economic crises, insecurity crises, then the ruling party goes, poaching governors and 18 governors as published on Social Media will be moving, leaving their states to Zamfara, to celebrate the killings of innocent citizens in Zamfara State, the hunger in Zamfara State.

This report, a copy each, must be made available to each and every senator this Tuesday afternoon. I don\u2019t know how the committee would arrange it, but every senator must have a copy today.\n\n\u201c[And] we would be considering the report on Thursday.

          "text": "Only 1.3m out of 95.6m numbers authenticated\n\nEmma Okonji\n\nFollowing the slow verification of the National Identification Number (NIN) by the Identity Management Commission (NIMC) the federal government yesterday extended the deadline for NIN-SIM data verification from June 30 to July 26.\n\nYesterday\u2019s extension of the deadline made it the seventh time the federal government would be postponing the deadline, since the beginning of the exercise.\n\nThe federal government has equally increased facilities for the registration of NIN to 5,410 nationwide.\n\nIn a joint statement yesterday by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), and signed by the Director of Public Affairs at NCC, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, and the Head, Corporate Communications at NIMC, Mr. Kayode Adegoke, stated that the decision to extend the deadline was made after a request by stakeholders on the need to consolidate the enrolment and NIN-SIM verification process following the rapid increase in the number of enrolment systems nationwide.\n\nThe federal government, in December 2020, had directed telecoms subscribers to register their NIN and submit same to network operators for verification and linkage with their SIM cards.\n\nHowever, the Joint Implementation Committee (JIC) on harmonisation of National Identification Number (NIN) with Subscriber Identification Module (SIM), otherwise known as NIN-SIM Harmonisation Committee, has rated NIN-SIM verification and integration exercise very low for May .\n\nThe committee\u2019s latest report on NIN submission and verification, covering March to May, which was obtained by THISDY, showed that subscribers have continued to submit their NINs to mobile network operators (MNOs) for verification and linkage to their telephone lines, as directed by the federal government.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that the verification and linkage have been abysmally slow, due to the alleged poor funding of NIMC, the government agency, responsible for NIN enrolment and verification.\n\nAccording to the committee\u2019s report, active telephone lines as of May were 192 million, and a cumulative 95.6 million NIN owners submitted their NIN in the same month. But only 1.3 million NINs were verified and linked during the review period.\n\nA breakdown of the statistics showed that in March, active telephone lines were 196 million, but the number dropped to 192.4 million in April and further dropped to 192.1 million in May 2021. The number of subscribers that submitted their NINs through the networks of MNOs was 90.35 million in March, representing 46 per cent of the total number of subscribers.\n\nThe figure increased to 90.38 million in April, representing 47 per cent and further increased to 95.6 million in May, representing 49.7 per cent.\n\nFrom the total number of NIN submitted, only 588,010, were verified and linked in March 2021, representing 0.6 per cent, only 929,846 were verified and linked in April, representing one per cent, while only 1.3 million NINs were verified and linked in May, representing 1.4 per cent of the total number of submitted NINs.\n\nTotal NIN enrolment by MNOs in March was 210,487 with 123,379 generated NINs.\n\nIn April, it rose to 413,272 NIN enrolments with 234,499 generated NINs. In May, the figure rose again to 530,893 NIN enrolments with 335,193 generated NINs.\n\nBut from March to May, the total NIN enrolments by all NIMC partners, were two million in March, three million in April, and two million in May.\n\nThe total NIN penetration, which is the number of NINs successfully linked, was put at 51 million in March, representing 24.1 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s population of 211.4 million, 54 million in April, representing 25.5 per cent of the population, and 56 million in May, representing 27 per cent of the population.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the low verification figure, both NIMC and NCC declined to comment, but a source close to NIMC said: \u201cThe figures are correct but NIMC cannot comment because NIMC is not involved in NIN-SIM linkage, even though NIMC verifies all registered NINs from its back end server.\u201d\n\nNIMC is of the view that the issue of incomplete and inappropriate SIM registration on the network of MNOs, could be responsible for slow NIN-SIM integration, but the Joint Implementation Committee thinks otherwise, blaming the situation of slow verification on poor funding of NIMC, resulting in the inability of NIMC to implement the recommended Bulk NIN Verification process that would speed up NIN verification and integration.\n\nThe committee said NIN verification and linkage by MNOs remained meagre at 0.6-1.4 per cent from March through May 2021, in comparison to 46-49.7 per cent of the national telecommunications base that submitted NINs over the period.\n\nIt stated that the trend will continue as long as bulk NIN Verification by NIMC is not in place.\n\nThe committee\u2019s report said: \u201cIt is pertinent to mention that Bulk NIN Verification is still at the Proof-of-Concept (POC) stage since January 2021. NIMC needs to confirm a timeline when Bulk NIN Verification will commence. Without this, MNOs will continue to collect submitted NINs from customers but will not be able to verify and link them to customer\u2019s telephone lines, as required, to achieve the stated objectives of the government. Without Bulk NIN Verification, MNOs would have to resort to overnight Batch NIN Verification processing using the Single NIN Verification API or otherwise invite their customers to visit MNO outlets for Individual NIN verification using the same API. NIMC\u2019s systems would become overwhelmed by the millions of requests for overnight Batch NIN Verification processing from all MNOs leading to poor performance outright failure of the processing systems.\u201d\n\nThe committee called on NIMC to take urgent action to rollout Bulk NIN Verification, without which verification of the 95.6m submitted telephone lines, which would continue to grow monthly, cannot happen and government\u2019s directive to verify and link NINs to customer SIMs will not be achieved.\n\nThe Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, had in December 2020, issued a directive through NCC, for all telecoms subscribers to register their NIN and submit same for to their network operators for verification and linkage.\n\nThe initial directive had two weeks window to complete the NIN registration and verification, with a threat to deactivate the SIM of any subscriber who failed to comply within the stipulated period.\n\nThe deadline was later extended and since then, government has continued to extend it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u00b7 Says no petrol price increase in next two months\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is planning to borrow $3.8 billion to actualise its agenda of acquiring a 20 per cent stake in Dangote Refinery.\n\nNNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, said yesterday that the money would be borrowed from financial institutions.\n\nHe said some financial institutions had already agreed to fund the acquisition, while the debts would be paid back from the NNPC\u2019s earnings from dividends and profits accruing from its investment in the fuel plant.\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day refinery, located in Lagos State, which Kyari said had been tentatively valued at about $19 billion, is expected to come on stream in 2022 and will produce 50 million litres of petrol per day.\n\nKyari spoke just as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Secretary-General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, expressed optimism over the overall conditions of the oil market as the cartel and its allies yesterday began a meeting to herald a resolution on whether to further ease crude oil production curbs.\n\nAccording to Kyari, there is no underhand dealings concerning the extant transaction, as the federal government\u2019s presence on the board of the Dangote Refinery will not only secure its energy needs, but give it a strong voice in the running of the asset to guarantee the country\u2019s security.\n\nKyari, in two separate interviews with two television stations, which THISDAY monitored in Abuja, stated that all the borrowing institutions, including Afrexim Bank, are comfortable with the deal, adding that the federal government will not invest a dime in the deal.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not sure Mr (Aliko) Dangote wants to sell his equity in the refinery. I can confirm that it was at our instance that we started this engagement and he did not want to sell these shares.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no resource-dependent country in the world that will watch a business of this scale, bordering on energy security which also has implications for even physical security of our country, and you watch it and you don\u2019t have a say.\n\n\u201cWe started this process long before Dangote started his refinery project. We are going to take equities in very significant businesses anchored on the oil and gas operations, for example, fertiliser plants, methanol plants, small condensate refineries and so many other businesses that we are dealing with, so that we can expand our portfolio.\u201d\n\nKyari added that the NNPC has a responsibility to ensure a constant flow of fuel, and as a policy, it will continue to acquire stakes in any refinery in excess of 50,000 barrels per day.\n\n\u201cEven for this Dangote Refinery, we are not going to take government money to buy it. That is the mistake that people are making because they think that we are going to take federation money to pay for these refineries.\n\n\u201cWe are going to borrow on the back of the cash flow from this business because we know that it is viable and it will work and return dividends and it has a cash flow that is sustainable,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari also reiterated that work had begun on the Port Harcourt refinery rehabilitation, while the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts for Warri and Kaduna will be awarded in July.\n\nAccording to him, the net effect is to have an environment where Nigeria becomes the hub for petroleum products supply to change the current dynamics of petrol supply even globally, where the inflow of products from Europe will be reversed.\n\n\u201cWe will award the EPC contract for the Warri and Kaduna refineries within the next two to three weeks, maximum by the end of July, so that these two processes will run concurrently, so that at the end of the day we will have all the refineries working,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari stated that with the current arrangement, petrol will be delivered commercially, adding that part of the requirements of the lenders is that NNPC must not operate the refineries.\n\n\u201cWe must have an operation and maintenance contractor. That means that practically, these refineries will be run by the lenders and the cash flow will be able to support the payments because the bankers have seen that the cash flow will support it,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that five similar initiatives were currently in the offing, of which decisions will be taken within three months, with about 200,000 barrels per day combined capacity of condensates.\n\nKyari said: \u201cWe have signed term sheets with the owners of the refineries. I am not sure Dangote will be very happy with this. We are taking 20 per cent equity of the Dangote Refinery. There\u2019s a valuation process because this business is very regulated and very international. No bank will lend money to you to buy equity in any business of this scale if you have not followed the best valuation process.\n\n\u201cThe reality today is that we have a valuation of this refinery. I am not sure, but it\u2019s about ($)19 billion. I do not have an exact figure. We haven\u2019t closed on this, there\u2019s an ongoing engagement. There\u2019s governance around this that we need to conclude and that includes seeking the authority of the Federal Executive Council.\u201d\n\nHe said discussions on acquiring a stake in the refinery started as far back as December 2020, adding that no bank with have anything to do with an asset that is over-valued, because they know that costs won\u2019t be recovered.\n\nKyari assured the public of openness on NNPC\u2019s relationship with the Dangote Refinery, adding that while crude oil will be sold to the company in naira, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will sort out at what value it will come.\n\nHe said the Dangote Refinery would take off spending of freight of about N21, ensure proximity to supply where it can reach anywhere within the country in one day, while dividends will be shared to Nigerians, who are the owners of the corporation.\n\nOn the landing price of petrol, he stated that as of two days ago, it was N256 per litre but added that pump price of fuel will not be increased in the next two months as engagement with the organised labour has not been concluded.\n\nHe said while the subsidy regime wasn\u2019t sustainable, President Muhammadu Buhari was not also keen on taking the product out of the reach of Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the president had directed that current volumes which are unaccounted for must be contained to bring down spending on subsidy.\n\nKyari explained that while there\u2019s an expectation in the Appropriation Act that NNPC will make a monthly remittance of at least N120 billion, only one leg of the NNPC\u2019s funding of the Federation Account has been affected by its non-remittance of funds, like royalties and taxes are still being generated.\n\nHe stated that discussions were being rounded off on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), to see that the passage of the legislation is done within the next two weeks.\n\nBarkindo Optimistic as OPEC+ Decides on Production Easing\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Secretary-General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, expressed optimism over the overall conditions of the oil market as the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) of the cartel and OPEC allies yesterday began a meeting to herald a resolution on whether to further ease crude oil production curbs.\n\nOPEC stated that the fundamentals have significantly improved in recent months, a hint that a resolution to allow member countries pump more oil may be in the offing tomorrow during the OPEC+ ministerial meeting.\n\n\u201cThe overall brighter picture in relation to the pandemic recovery efforts has led to the significantly improved oil market conditions and prospects for future growth,\u201d Barkindo said at the JTC conference.\n\nThe 53rd meeting of the body, which held via videoconference to review the latest oil market developments and discuss future prospects, was convened in preparation for the 31st meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) and the 18th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting planned for between today and tomorrow.\n\nBarkindo underscored the vital role carried out by the JTC in providing high-quality technical analyses of the latest oil market developments, adding that the research and assessments conducted by the committee will serve as a crucial input to the decision-making process of the cartel.\n\nHe stated that the discussions will build on the successful deliberations of the last meeting and lauded the unwavering commitment and tireless efforts demonstrated by the participating countries.\n\n\u201cThe Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) participants clearly continue to play an important and valuable role in accelerating the oil market rebalancing process,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn the last edition of the OPEC\u2019s Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), OPEC projected global oil demand to rise by six million barrels per day in 2021, while world economic growth was forecast at a rate of 5.5 per cent in the same period.\n\nUsually, the DoC ministerial meetings are supported by the JMMC, which is tasked to analyse oil market developments, monitor the conformity of the DoC voluntary production adjustments and recommend further actions.\n\n\u201cA combination of improving market indicators and the ongoing commitment of DoC countries to restore stability to the global oil market suggests that we are on the right path to recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, despite lingering uncertainties,\u201d Barkindo added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has stated that the problem confronting Nigeria is Nigerians, and not ethnicity or religion as being opined in some quarters.\n\nBuhari noted that Nigerians should be blamed for the injustices rather than ethnicity or religion, not minding the complexities of the Nigerian condition.\n\nAccording to a release by the President\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President spoke while receiving members of the Muhammadu Buhari/Osinbajo Dynamic Support Group, who visited State House, Abuja, to present a compendium of five years achievements of the administration.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur problem is not ethnicity or religion, it is ourselves. After my third appearance in the Supreme Court, I came out to speak to those who were present then. I told them that from 2003, I\u2019d spent 30 months in court.\n\n\"The President of the Court of Appeal, the first port of call for representation by presidential candidates then, was my classmate in secondary school in Katsina. We spent six years in the same class, Justice Umaru Abdullahi.\n\n\"My legal head was Chief Mike Ahamba, a Roman Catholic and an Ibo man. When the President of the court decided that we should present our case, my first witness was in the box.\n\n\u201cAhamba insisted that a letter should be sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to present the register of constituencies in some of the States, to prove that what they announced was falsehood. It was documented.\n\n\u201cWhen they gave judgment, another Ibo man, the late Justice Nsofor, asked for the reaction from INEC to the letter sent to them. They just dismissed it. He then decided to write a minority judgment. That was after 27 months in court.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Supreme Court. Who was Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN)? A Hausa-Fulani like me, from Zaria. The members of the panel went in for about 30 minutes, came back to say they were proceeding on break. They went for 3 months. When they came back, it didn\u2019t take them 15 minutes, they dismissed us.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, who was the CJN? Kutigi. Again, a Muslim from the North. After 8 months or so, he dismissed the case. Again in 2011, because I was so persistent, Musdafa, a Fulani man like me, from Jigawa, neighbor to my state, was CJN. He dismissed my case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken you round this to prove that our problem is not ethnicity or religion. It is ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe President boasted that in all the six years of his governance, nobody could accuse him personally of stealing and corruption.\n\n\u201cI refused to give up. I had tried to wear Agbada after what happened to me in Khaki. Something was done to me, because I did something to others. You know it. In the end, I myself was arrested, sent to detention, and they were given back what they had taken. I was there for three and a quarter years. This is Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI hope historians and intellectuals would document this, because it is a fantastic state of political development. Let our grandchildren and great grandchildren see how we came along. We didn\u2019t get it as easy as other people think. Not because God has given us great population and resources. We have suffered along the line.\n\n\"I try to mention these things because you got yourselves together, used your resources, energies without any input from me. I cannot thank you enough. I\u2019m very grateful to you and to Nigerians because in 2019, I visited all the states, the people that turned out to see me across the country (because I\u2019m dedicated to serve Nigeria and Nigerians), the love is genuine.\n\n\"Thank God that over the years, they can\u2019t accuse me of corruption. And I\u2019ve been everything; Governor, Minister of Petroleum Resources, Head of State, President and in my second term.

          "title": "Inside Branch\u2019s ambitious '20% investment' challenge to Nigerian banks",
          "text": "When Branch launched in Nigeria in 2017, it was a single product company with a money lending license to offer loans to individuals. Loans start from as low as \u20a61,000 (~$2) and increase gradually up to \u20a6500,000 (~$1,200) as the borrower repays.\n\nFour years, \u20a640 billion (~$97 million) and three million loans later, the business is evolving.\n\nThe company which also operates in Kenya, Tanzania and India acquired a Nigerian microfinance bank license this year. In doing so, Branch has joined the growing number of Nigerian fintechs maturing into digital banks after some years in the lending app nursery. Carbon and Fairmoney are in this class too.\n\nBranch\u2019s mobile app (available only for Android) now includes a wallet that offers users unlimited money transfers and commission-free bill payments, in addition to instant loans (it is quite instant; I have tried it more than once between April and now) that are collateral-free.\n\nBut the Branch feature that catches the eye is the \u201cInvest\u201d tab. Clicking the button, users are invited to \u201cEarn 20% per annum by investing with Branch.\u201d\n\nFor example, a user who keeps \u20a61 million in this product for a whole year receives \u20a6200,000 at the minimum. Returns are paid every Monday and if left in the Branch wallet, compound for the next payment.\n\n20%?! How are they able to offer that?\n\nYou are not alone in asking. It was the first question Dayo Ademola, Branch Nigeria\u2019s managing director, faced on CNBC in May. It was the main curiosity as well on a Zoom call with journalists earlier this month.\n\nAccording to a June 18, 2021 Central Bank of Nigeria fact sheet, Heritage Bank offers 13.88% on fixed deposits, the highest of any Nigerian deposit money bank. But that\u2019s an outlier; Access Bank\u2019s 7.28% is about the average rate.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s 3.94%, though one of the lowest, is better than what Stanbic IBTC, Standard Chartered and First Bank all offer. So how is Branch, a startup, able to go so high on retail investments?\n\nInvestor capital, low costs\n\nTo assure customers that their funds are safe, Ademola explained that Branch\u2019s finance money license from the CBN permits them to offer fund management services and they \u201conly invest customer funds in principal securities and low-risk securities.\u201d\n\nShe does not specify what these securities are. Low-risk securities could be government treasury bills. But since practically every other bank makes the same claim and that the yield on instruments like treasury bills are stifled by inflation, Branch\u2019s extra margin has to come from elsewhere.\n\nSo, on CNBC as with the call with journalists, Ademola offered two reasons why Branch can afford its promise: investor capital and a profitable, lean business operation.\n\n\u201cOur investors have effectively taken a long view of our business in Nigeria,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nDayo Ademola, managing director of Branch Nigeria.\n\nBy this she points to the fact that Branch, which is a San Francisco-based company, has been funded by, among others, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the biggest Silicon Valley venture capital investment firms and early Facebook investor.\n\nBoth organisations participated in Branch\u2019s two big funding rounds \u2013 a $170 million Series C round in April 2019 and a $70 million Series B a year earlier, attracted by Branch\u2019s branding as a \u201c$2 loan\u201d service for emerging markets. $50 million of that 2018 raise was a debt facility from a firm that focuses on alternative credit.\n\nVISA is also an investor in Branch and has driven their Nigeria expansion. But beyond leaning on investor capital, Ademola said Branch is able to depend on its balance sheet from lending to support other ambitions. \u201cOur lending business is profitable here.\u201d\n\nThis profitability, she explains, has been possible because of the lowered cost of not having to operate physical bank branches across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe operate on a lower cost structure than your typical commercial bank and are able to pass some of these savings on to our customers,\u201d Ademola said.\n\nBetter than your bank?\n\nBranch Nigeria\u2019s pitch, then, is that it is \u201cbetter than your bank.\u201d\n\nDigital banks tend to tease variations of this tagline \u2013 Kuda, for example, is the \u201cbank of the free.\u201d But as Ademola said, no other Nigerian fintech startup offers a 20% annual return on investment products.\n\nCarbon offers a number of options that offer between 9 and 11% earnings. There is not yet an investment product on Fairmoney.\n\nInvestment offerings on digital platforms Branch and Carbon. Source: Screenshots from both companies\u2019 mobile apps.\n\nBecause I have borrowed easily on Branch, there is an appeal to adventure along on their bold investment claim. But it may be necessary to approach promises of high-returns with a sense of caution.\n\n\u201cFintechs don\u2019t have cheap sources of deposits in the form of current and savings accounts (CASA), hence they may try to attract customers with high-reward, yet possibly high-risk deposit products,\u201d Adedayo Bakare, an investment analyst, tells me.\n\nWhile a 20% return is an enticing high reward, it also signals the high-risk nature of the models fintechs have to adopt in order to beat banks. \u201cHigher risk is also why they charge borrowers high rates on loans. Because it is not backed by collateral,\u201d Bakare adds.\n\nIndeed, Branch\u2019s microloans charge a 20% interest. A \u20a62,000 (~$5) loan for one month, for example, will be paid back with \u20a62,400 \u2013 a 20% interest rate. By contrast, Guaranty Trust Bank is able to lend to its customers at a 1.5% monthly rate.\n\nAnd how about investor capital as a pillar? Bakare is skeptical: \u201cIf you look at the structure of funding for banks, investor capital is not even up to 30% of funding in many cases.\u201d\n\nReaching every smartphone\n\nBranch doesn\u2019t have audited accounts in the public domain showing their non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and capital adequacy ratio (CAR).\n\nBoth numbers would give a clearer picture of the returns on their three million loans. Going by its profitability and investor capital, it would appear both metrics are in good health.\n\nIt will then be intriguing to see customer reaction to the newly launched investment offer. Nigerians have fallen for ponzi schemes at an alarming rate that suggests legitimate platforms offering high-reward returns can find an audience.\n\nAdemola, who became Branch\u2019s MD for Nigeria in March, is confident of being the country\u2019s go-to platform, extending financial access wherever a smartphone receives an internet signal.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In a fashion typical of African governments, authorities in the Kingdom of Eswatini have ordered network providers in the country to cut off access to the internet as a nationwide protest continues to rock the small southern African kingdom.\n\nDemonstrations demanding reforms to the country\u2019s absolute monarchy started during the weekend and things turned violent overnight on Tuesday as security forces fired gunshots and tear gas to disperse protesters, multiple reports show.\n\nActivists in the country are demanding democratic reforms and the lifting of bans on all opposition parties. They have said they will intensify demonstrations against the government, which have been on for four consecutive days now.\n\nVideos of people burning tires, throwing stones at cars, and barricading streets in cities like Manzini and Matsapha have also been circulating on social media.\n\nProtestors block roads in Manzini, King Mswati\u2019s Government blocks internet to control situation. pic.twitter.com/Pk9ao9duio \u2014 Swazi News (@SwaziNews) June 29, 2021\n\nEswatini protestors now operating at night burning businesses linked to King Mswati and Government properties.

Banks have also closed up until the unrest subsides.\n\nGovernment has further suspended schools & introduced a 6pm-5am curfew with immediate effect. Acting Prime Minister: \u201cAll offices should be closed by 3:30pm to allow workers to get home safely while essential workers will be required to produce a permit when travelling at night.\u201d \u2014 Eswatini Government (@EswatiniGovern1) June 29, 2021\n\nAnd in addition to these, the government has blocked the internet.\n\nESWATINI GOVT orders major network providers to cut internet connection, closes schools, imposes 6pm-5am curfew as protests continue. pic.twitter.com/wtMIEzte6u \u2014 Nation Breaking News (@NationBreaking) June 29, 2021\n\nOver the past few years, Africa has been plagued by social media and internet shutdowns in the run-up to elections and in response to protests or dissent.\n\nBetween January 2020 and February 2021, internet and social media blackouts were imposed in Uganda, Chad, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. Nigeria restricted access to Twitter on June 4, albeit under different circumstances.\n\nInternet blocks on the continent prevent access to social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. In what is a worrying trend, local activists and international observers note that these blocks curtail the democratic right of freedom of speech and expression.\n\nAnger against Africa\u2019s last absolute monarch\n\nA former British protectorate, Eswatini is Africa\u2019s last absolute monarchy and one of the few remaining in the world. King Mswati III has ruled by decree for more than three decades, with unfettered political power over his 1 million people.\n\nThe royal family has come under fire for their lavish spending while most inhabitants, who are subsistence farmers, live below the poverty line. Crowned in 1986 when he was just 18, the king currently has 15 wives who occupy several state-funded palaces.\n\nThe small landlocked country changed its name from Swaziland in 2018, a move that was seen as a step towards democracy. However, King Mswati III has reportedly been running a repressive government, with several reported cases of human rights abuse, and consistently evaded years-long calls for meaningful democratic reforms.\n\nDespite anger towards Mswati over the years, demonstrations have not been commonplace in Eswatini. This is because the kingdom has continually stifled dissent and protests, as well as banned political parties from participating in parliamentary elections since 1973. Still, the 53-year-old monarch has denied being an autocrat.\n\nSeveral opposition leaders and activists were arrested in 2019, the same year when civil servants in the country went on several strike actions, accusing the monarch of draining public coffers at the expense of his subjects.\n\nThe series of crackdowns has done little to discourage anti-monarchy sentiment among the people as they continue to demand a democratic government that will serve their interests. This culminated in the ongoing anti-monarchy demonstrations in many parts of the country.\n\nAmid the protests, reports say the king has fled to neighbouring South Africa although Eswatini\u2019s acting Prime Minister, Themba Masuku, denied the claims on Tuesday. It\u2019s unclear at the moment what the situation is in the country but the internet shutdown is only likely to worsen the crisis.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Supa Strikas to Startups, Tomi Davies\u2019 approach to Angel Investing",
          "text": "In 2001, Tomi Davies backed his first company \u2014 Strika Entertainment. At the time, he didn\u2019t have a name for what he was doing; he was just helping friends.\n\nHe\u2019d later learn that what he was doing was called angel investing \u2014 an individual providing financial backing for small startups or entrepreneurs, typically in exchange for equity in the company.\n\nWith this knowledge, he co-founded the Lagos Angel Network in 2012, and a few years after, the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nTwenty years after his first investment, TD, as he is fondly called, has gone on to make many more investments and build the angel investment space in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe problem I\u2019m still trying to solve is that of funding for every African entrepreneur\u2019s great idea.\u201d\n\nWe start out our conversation talking about his first investment in Supa Strikas, a popular comic I grew up reading.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did the investment in Supa Strikas happen?\n\nTD: It started with meeting a South African named Oliver Power, I was head of IT research at Marks and Spencer in the UK then. A few years later when we returned back to our countries, he and a few others approached me to tell me that they had come up with an idea to do a comic.\n\nIt was a superhero comic book that featured the likes of Shaka the Zulu, Mansa Musa and Alaafin of Oyo.\n\nIt sounded like a good idea but I had to ask them, \u2018How are we going to make money?\u2019 because we needed to raise some investment. They said we\u2019re going to use a different model, we\u2019re going to get sponsorship from brands. We\u2019ll be like Marvel comics.\n\nSo I went to Cape Town, we had lengthy conversations and concluded this idea won\u2019t sell. We pivoted to a soccer storyline. Africans love football. We created an all African football team called Supa Strikas. It turned out to be successful.\n\nI ended up with the Nigerian rights for Supa Strikas for my contribution. So I am Supa Strikas Nigeria. There\u2019s Supa Strika Nigeria and Supa Strika South Africa. I no longer have shares in Supa Strikas South Africa. We sold our shares to Moonbug and Moonbug sold it to Disney. That\u2019s the story of Supa Strikas.\n\nDA: Why Angel and not Venture Capital?\n\nTD: I live through my portfolio. That\u2019s what keeps me alive, that\u2019s what keeps me fresh. I like the flexibility of choosing what to invest in and following up with the founders.\n\nDA: How do you operate?\n\nTD: My primary organisation is Technovision Communications. It operates as TVC Labs, which is funded by the 22 partners of the Technovision syndicate. These partners include people like Iyin Aboyeji, Kola Aina and Olumide Soyombo.\n\nTVC Labs runs accelerator programs that identify different startups that we work with. Now my portfolio consists of about 18 active startups like Trove, BigCabal Media*, Flexiserve, Trueflutter, Kishi, doci healthcare and others.\n\nDA: What was the reason for founding the Lagos Angel network?\n\nTD: The Lagos Angel Network was a happenstance. In 2012, I was already involved in angel investing. I had recognised that this was what I was going to do for the rest of my life.\n\nI ran into Dotun Sulieman; Funke Opeke of MainOne, Fatunmata Coker, Demola Aladekomo of Chams, Gbenga Sesan of Paradigm initiative, Gbolahan Elias, Folabi Esan and a host of others. We decided to put some structure to this and we started the Lagos Angel Network. We began structured investing\n\nDA: What about African Business Angel Network (ABAN)?\n\n\n\nTD: After a while, there were about 5 angel networks on the African continent.\n\nWe started partnering with my friend Ben White who runs VC for Africa and we ran the African Early Stage Investment Summit. Eric Osiakwan ran Angel Fair Africa. Through these events, the Europeans heard about us and they invited us to Slush.\n\nSo we all went to Helsinki in 2015 for Slush. At Slush, they said we needed an African Angel network to create networks and to educate people on what angel investing is all about.\n\nMy big sister Candace Johnson just turned around and said to me \u2018you\u2019re going to be the President.\u2019 I looked around, I didn\u2019t know they had all agreed to this. I looked at Dotun Suleiman, he was my senior at King\u2019s college and we formed the Lagos Angel Network together. He was the person I was expecting to be president but he said this is all yours.\n\nSo as president of ABAN, I spent the next 5 years crossing Africa and building networks. We now have 50 angel networks around 33 African countries.\n\nI am personally responsible for initiating the angel networks in the Gambia, Namibia, Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa and the list goes on. In Nigeria, I\u2019ve been responsible for the South-South Angel Network, Abuja Angel Network and also in Lagos, the women\u2019s only angel network called Rising Tide Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s important at this stage to point out that at ABAN I have co-founders. They are Ben White, Rebecca Enonchong, David van Dijk, Alexandra Fraser and Christopher Campbell.\n\nI\u2019d like to give a special shout out to David van Dijk. He is the backbone of ABAN. He runs the foundation, ensuring everything is running smoothly.\n\nDA: What does it mean to be a part of ABAN and what has been the network\u2019s impact?\n\nTD: The future of Africa is being built by a generation of entrepreneurs that are using technology to provide innovative solutions to the people of this continent.\n\nAnd those who support that cause will have a return not just in social impact but also in financial returns. That\u2019s the fundamental belief of ABAN.\n\nAs a member of the network, what you\u2019re signing up for is that we\u2019ll provide human and financial support to those working on these solutions.\n\nAs for Impact, Let me just paint a picture. In 2015 there were 5 angel networks on the African continent. Let\u2019s assume that they had 10-20 members each, so that\u2019s 50 \u2013 100 members in total. In 2021, there are now 49 angel networks in 33 African countries and Even if they have an average of 10 members each, that\u2019s 490 members. That\u2019s more human and financial support.\n\nWe created the Diaspora Angel Network, to co-invest in the local angel networks. So if you\u2019re sitting in London and you want to invest, you can invest through these networks.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the adoption rate like in Africa?\n\nTD: That\u2019s a tough one. Adoption rates are low because it\u2019s not for the faint-hearted and requires patience. Most importantly, it requires a passion and dedication to the entrepreneurs themselves. If you do not have that love of seeing others succeed, then there are different ways to spend your time or money.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when investing in startups?\n\nTD: The way I pick startups is called the POEM Framework. It goes way back to when I left Marks & Spencer. I joined Ernst & Young, where I was the chief operating officer for its incubator program. The way we worked was by doing a lot of research, then experimenting and using the results to improve on the experiment. In today\u2019s thinking, that\u2019s best captured by Eric Reis in what he calls the lean startup product development methodology.\n\nOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\nThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\nFinally, you ask, is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also is the business model sustainable. Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\n\nDA: How do you invest, alone or along with others? Also, how do you find these startups?\n\nTD: I only co-invest post-revenue, seed stage. As for the startups, I find them, they find me.\n\nI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, I sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum.\n\nThis means I tend to have a lot of people looking for deals that I can participate in but more importantly, I now do what\u2019s called program orchestration. I try to stimulate thinking, through programs that develop entrepreneurs with organisation partners like Google and Microsoft. In these programs I find entrepreneurs. That\u2019s me finding them. Every other day, from different channels there are founders reaching out.\n\nDA: It seems like an endless stream, how does due diligence happen?\n\nTD: Due diligence depends on the stage. At ideation, we say no. We either provide mentorship or advisory. There are three types of due diligence we do.\n\nFinancial: Here we\u2019re asking how much are you making, is this sustainable, what\u2019s it costing you to acquire customers? Do the numbers make sense?\n\nLegal: Are you legally incorporated, are there agreements between the founders and employees.\n\nCommercial: What\u2019s the size of your market? Is there a market? What kind of competition do you have out there? Is your market growth rate positive? We look at IP ownership \u2013 how you develop your products.\n\nBefore that we\u2019re going to issue a term sheet. Typically if it\u2019s a slam dunk, meaning someone has invested in you before, we can get it done within 30 days. If it\u2019s a first time investment, then it can take up to 90 days.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your relationship with other types of investors like Private Equity and Venture Capital?\n\nTD: I\u2019m the only person that I know that\u2019s crazy enough to say what I\u2019m about to say. I\u2019m an angel investor, I\u2019m also the chief investment officer for a Venture Capital, I sit on the board of a Private Equity company (MBO Capital). So we get along pretty well.\n\nDA: Hmm, all in one. So what have your exits been like?\n\nTD: There are different types of exits but in our continent, the only exit that\u2019s a real one is the acquisition exit. Just like Stripe acquired Paystack. Those are the typical exits you\u2019ll see.\n\nFor an early angel investment, you can expect anything from 20 to 50x return on investment. I\u2019d like to point out that for every good exit, there\u2019re at least ten bad ones. There are some deals I\u2019ve lost money on that I\u2019ve retained relationships with the founders.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s more than just about the money. The challenge is to build a better future, so as long as people are heading in that direction then it\u2019s your responsibility [as an angel investor] to support them. That\u2019s how I see it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have relationships to support you, you won\u2019t build good things. Exits are a good measure, but how I measure success is by those 15-18 founders that I\u2019m constantly helping to be better.\n\n\n\nTD: Are you focused on any particular sectors?\n\nDA: Yes. First tech-enabled businesses. My background is in tech, so that\u2019s the underlying thesis.\n\nThen there\u2019s the concept of essentials. We must all eat, so I invest in food and agriculture. Health, education and power are also part of essentials.\n\nThe next is primary things like transportation, logistics.\n\nThen we have the future of work. Anything that facilitates enterprise from a technology standpoint like the rise of Zoom in the past year.\n\nThose are the areas I focus on rather than sectors because I start from a tech enabled stand point.\n\nDA: What trends do you see?\n\nTD: In my space, the use of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are underrated. When you consider that the average home now has a 30 inch screen somewhere in it, the potential for that is limitless. We talk about the reason fintech exists is because people have smartphones. Well, they\u2019ll keep on making the screens better and more affordable. Currently because we\u2019re used to the broadcast model, we\u2019re not thinking about the interactivity that\u2019s possible. That\u2019s an opportunity I\u2019m seeing that I expect someone to take advantage of.\n\nImagine a solar based screen that you don\u2019t need to worry about charging. You can attach a router to it, so it\u2019s interactive. This means I can teach a school remotely \u2013 one to many not one to one like on mobile. It means I can also remotely manage staff.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about exotic technology but simple technology that exists today. The price points to knock them together today are high but if you look at the opportunity cost, there\u2019s alot to play for.\n\nThat\u2019s just one opportunity, I won\u2019t be surprised that a startup takes advantage of this as long as COVID keeps us out of each other\u2019s way.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve written a number of books, are you working on a new one?\n\nTD: Yes, I\u2019m working on one now, which should be done sometime in 2021.\n\nDA: Any hints on the name?\n\nTD: The working title is \u2019Conversations with an African Angel.\u2019\n\n*Tomi Davies is an investor in Big Cabal Media, TechCabal\u2019s parent organization.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Diagnostic healthtech startup, MDaaS, secured a $2.3 million seed extension funding and added a new product feature to its array called SentinelX.\n\nEarly-stage VC firm, Newton Partners, led the round, with participation from CRI Foundation, FINCA Ventures, Techstars and Future Africa\n\nFounded in 2016 by Co-founder and CEO, Oluwasoga Oni, MDaaS is on a mission to create easy access to diagnostic and preventive care for Nigerians.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Oni revealed that the idea for MDaaS came when, as an MIT student, he and some classmates were asked to develop something that could impact a billion lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn to a doctor father who ran a 30-patient hospital and seeing firsthand the problem of finding good and affordable medical equipment, he knew just the right idea to run with.\n\nAlongside Opeyemi Ologun and Genevieve Oni, MDaaS Global was born. They began by bringing secondary medical equipment into Nigeria from the US, offering service support, and then distributing it to hospitals via outright sale, rent, or lease.\n\nThe founders ran with this business model for a while, until it occurred to them what the actual problem was.\n\nThey realised that purchasing medical equipment was a waste of money because, more often than not, patients couldn\u2019t afford to pay for services rendered.\n\nDeciding to change their model, they switched to building diagnostic centres in communities with inadequate clinical services and finding out the equipment needed by small and medium-sized hospitals in that area.\n\nTheir first diagnostic centre was launched in Ibadan, Southwest Nigeria. And since then, they\u2019ve built six other centres located in different Nigerian cities.\n\nThey have a wide range of medical offerings, from digital X-ray and ultrasound to electrocardiogram (ECG) and other laboratory services.\n\nThe idea for SentinelX came when the company was screening COVID-19 patients. They found out that although some patients didn\u2019t have the disease, they had underlying health conditions like high blood pressure that they weren\u2019t aware of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRealising the need for a customer-focused product, they built SentinelX, enabling users to run through a series of tests with 60 or 70 biomarkers to check for individual susceptibility to a wide range of diseases.\n\nFor a one-off payment of \u20a635,000 ($85.05), users can access a doctor for a year. Post-screening, MDaaS has a unique care plan to address customers\u2019 health concerns.\n\nCurrently, SentinelX is running in private beta, with plans for the product to go live in September 2021.\n\nThis funding will be channelled toward building more diagnostic centres in Nigeria.\n\nFor the big picture, the startup is looking to be one of Nigeria\u2019s three largest diagnostic centres.\n\nAlthough a timeline wasn\u2019t disclosed, MDaaS is considering a pan-African expansion, serving a million patients per year, and operating 100 centres across the continent by 2025.\n\nThough proper diagnosis plays a crucial role in preventing and curing diseases, the equipment necessary to carry it out is usually unaffordable for small and medium-sized hospitals in most African communities.\n\nWith more technological startups branching out to create a sustainable medium for diagnostics and healthcare, more people might have easy access in Africa.",

Nigeria is 15th In the Getting Credit category, its best ranking in the report\u2019s 10 categories.\n\nWhile this seemingly corroborates what fuels optimism for growth, many SMEs in Nigeria are in the informal sector.\n\nConsequently, these businesses have limited access to credit facilities and government regulations because they\u2019re not registered.\n\nThe Confidence Index also maintains that 55% of the SMEs surveyed are concerned about the rising cost of doing business, while 53% cited access to capital funding as a major concern.\n\nThe country\u2019s inflation rate gives little room for optimism.

          "title": "PhD Certificate Scandal: Head of Service\u2019s report affirms ICPC\u2019s indictment of ex-FIIRO boss",
          "text": "A recent report from the office of the Head of Service (HoS) of the Federation has ratified the demotion and removal of a former Acting Director-General of the Federal Institute of Industrial Research Oshodi (FIRO), Chima Igwe, who was indicted for certificate fraud in 2019.\n\nThe report, which is the outcome of a presidency-sanctioned investigation, also endorsed the move by the governing board of FIIRO to commence the process of appointing a substantive director-general of the agency.\n\nIt came after the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) also indicted Mr Igwe and recommended that he should refund the remunerations he earned with the controversial certificate.\n\nMr Igwe has been under ICPC investigation for claiming to have secured a PhD at the Universite d\u2019Abomey Calavi, Republic of Benin, but has no certificate to show for it.\n\nHe is said to have risen through the ranks in FIIRO based on a letter of attestation from the university for about 18 years, prompting some officials of the institute to petition the ICPC.\n\nThe ICPC said in a statement in February 2020 that investigation showed that Mr Igwe actually completed the three-year programme between 1999 and 2002, and wrote his thesis.\n\nHowever, the commission said he did not defend the thesis, and so cannot be said to have been awarded a PhD.\n\nIt added that the university said that much in a letter to the Nigerian Mission in Benin dated January 22, 2020.\n\nBased on the outcome of ICPC investigation, the FIIRO board suspended him and demoted him to the level he was 18 years ago.\n\nAlthough many within and outside FIIRO called for the dismissal and prosecution of Mr Igwe for certificate fraud, the board only demoted him to the level he was 18 years ago.\n\nThe board also commenced the process for the appointment of substantive DG.\n\nBut the Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonna Onu, who has been accused of showing undue interest in keeping Mr Igwe as the director-general of FIIRO, has opposed the fresh appointment process embarked upon by the board.\n\nPresidency weighs in\n\nIn December 2020, the presidency, through the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Gambari, weighed in with a directive to the HoS of the Federation, Folashade Yemi-Esan, to investigate the allegations against Mr Igwe, as a follow-up to the ICPC investigation.\n\nHe wrote in the memo sent to the HoS that the President had \u201cDirected that a detailed investigation be carried out by the Head of Service on the certification of Dr Chima Cartney Igwe as Director-General, Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi (FIIRO) with necessary disciplinary actions, if required.\u201d\n\nThe memo also directed that \u201cin the interim, Dr. (Mrs.) EA. Asagbara should take over as Overseeing Director-General of FIIRO, pending the appointment of a substantive Director-General.\u201d\n\nDocuments obtained by PREMIUM TIMES showed that the panel set up by the HoS to investigate the matter concluded and submitted its report to the presidency through the Chief of Staff, in February.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe three-man investigative committee, headed by Babura Inuwa, in its report dated February 8, noted that the demotion of Mr Igwe should be upheld and that he should refund the illegal salaries obtained using the fake certificate.\n\n\u201cArising from the report of the committee, the following are recommended:\n\n\u201ci. The placement of Dr Chima Cartney Igwe by the Governing Board of FIIRO as Chief Research Officer, CONRAISS 13, with effect from 18 July 2020 is in order and therefore it should be upheld;\n\n\u201cii. The directives of the Governing Board, as well as ICPC recommendations, that Dr Chima Cartney Igwe should refund all salaries he had illegally earned from 18th July 2004 is in order and therefore it should be upheld;\n\n\u201ciii. Dr Igwe should submit a copy of his PhD thesis to the Institute in line with the extant regulations and practice; Dr Igwe should present his original PhD certificate No. 081 2020/UAC/EDSEA/D/SA dated 14th February 2020 to the Institute for sighting and submit a copy for record purposes in line with extant regulations and practice,\u201d the executive summary of the report read in part.\n\nThe committee emphatically stated that based on his current rank as Chief Research Officer, Mr Igwe \u201cis not qualified and should not be considered for the position of the substantive Director-General of FIIRO.\u201d\n\nMore troubles\n\nThe committee also recommended that the Governing Board should commence disciplinary procedures against Mr Igwe for absence from duty without leave or permission.\n\nThe report also cited the refusal of the indicted FIIRO boss to carry out lawful instructions from superior authority by reverting to the Chief Research Officer with effect from 18 July 2020.\n\nThe investigative committee also suggested in the report that the officials who approved the evaluation of Mr Igwe\u2019s controversial PhD certificate be sanctioned.\n\n\u201cThe Director (Education Support Services Department) who approved the evaluation, and the Assistant Director (Evaluation and Accreditation), who evaluated the Ph.D certificate in the Federal Ministry of Education, should be sanctioned for lack of diligence in the manner they handled the issue of Dr Igwe.\u201d\n\nIt then advised the Minister of Science and Technology, Mr Onu, to allow the Governing Board of FIIRO to operate freely within the ambit of the provisions of extant regulations.\n\nMinister resists recommendations\n\nDespite the recommendations by the HoS corroborating an earlier indictment issued against Mr Igwe by the ICPC, the Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, has continued to frustrate moves by the FIIRO board to appoint a substantive head for the agency.\n\nIn a recent letter dated May 21, 2021 seen by PREMIUM TIMES, he instructed the board to suspend the appointment of a substantive head for FIIRO.\n\nThe letter signed on behalf of the minister by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Science and Technology, Edet Akpan, curiously cited the presidential directive for an investigation into Mr Igwe\u2019s certificate scandal, as the basis for the FIIRO board to suspend the appointment of a new DG for the agency. The investigation referred to by the minister had been concluded and its report submitted to the presidency as far back as February.\n\n\u201cI am directed by the honourable minister to acknowledge receipt of your letter on the above subject ref. no. FGB/6.01/43 dated April 28, 2021, and inform you that the Presidency has directed that a detailed investigation be carried out by the head of the civil service of the federation on the certification of Dr Chima Cartney Igwe as Director-General (FIIRO), with necessary disciplinary action if required.\n\n\u201cIn view of the above, you are further requested to suspend all actions and processes on the appointment of a substantive director-general/CEO for FIIRO; pending the outcome of the investigation and subsequent directives of Mr President on the matter,\u201d the letter read.\n\nBackground\n\nWithout a doctoral degree as required by law for major FIIRO positions, Mr Igwe served in different capacities using an attestation letter from his supervisor in Universite d\u2019Abomey Calavi, Benin Republic, dated 2002, to gain several promotions.\n\nHe had claimed that he bagged a PhD from the university in 2001.\n\nMr Igwe, a former director-general of the institute believed to be an ally of the minister, was appointed as acting DG to succeed Gloria Elemo, the immediate past substantive DG of the institute, on May 13, 2019.\n\nThe authenticity of Mr Igwe\u2019s PhD certificate degenerated into a ruckus in 2018 after some workers petitioned the anti-graft agency for proper investigation.\n\nThe ICPC later revealed that the degree was non-existent, which subsequently led to Mr Igwe\u2019s removal from the director-general\u2019s position and demotion by the board last year.\n\nInstead of presenting an original certificate during the ICPC investigation, he chose to depose to an affidavit of attestation issued by the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, swearing to have obtained the doctorate certificate.\n\nAfter the outcome of the ICPC investigation, the FIIRO\u2019s governing board said, through the attestation, Mr Igwe earned undeserved salaries for years.\n\nWhile many workers and civil society groups called for the dismissal and prosecution of Mr Igwe for the fraudulent action and perjury, the disciplinary committee only recommended his demotion to the level he was 18 years ago. He was also suspended by the board.\n\nAfter his suspension by the board, Mr Igwe returned to the Benin Republic University in February 2020 to defend his thesis and was issued another attestation to indicate he completed the PhD.\n\nThe new attestation showed the effective date of the award of the PhD as February 2020.\n\nBut a year after Mr Igwe\u2019s indictment, the institute has yet to get a substantive director-general. Moves made by the board to appoint a new director-general has been blocked by the minister, who is said to have sympathy for Mr Igwe, critics say.\n\nWhen PREMIUM TIMES reached for comments, the Special Adviser to the Minister, Ibiam Oguejiofo, declined to speak on the matter.\n\nIn line with the December 2020 presidential directive, Yemisi Asagbara, has been the acting director-general.\n\nAll efforts to get a substantive Director-General for the institute, have been thwarted by the minister.\n\nMr Ogbonnaya had repeatedly averted every effort of the Ibrahim Gwarzo-led Governing board of the institute to commence the process.\n\nGroup kicks\n\nThe Executive Director of Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA), Olanrewaju Suraj, a strong voice in the civil societies demanding accountability in respect of the matter, says Mr Ogbonaya is hell-bent on imposing Mr Igwe as the substantive Director-General of the institute.\n\n\u201cThe minister (Ogbonaya) was all bent on making him (Mr Igwe) the DG. And nobody is saying he should not put his state men in that position but it should not be someone that has a questionable record as Mr Igwe.\u201d\n\nMr Suraj told PREMIUM TIMES on Thursday, that the board should be allowed to go ahead with the appointment process for a new head.\n\n\u201cThe probing of Mr Igwe has nothing to do again with the appointment of a DG because he is not qualified to be part of the process,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "Mr Igwe has been under ICPC investigation for claiming to have secured a PhD at the Universite d\u2019Abomey Calavi, Republic of Benin, but has no certificate to show for it.\nBased on the outcome of ICPC investigation, the FIIRO board suspended him and demoted him to the level he was 18 years ago.\nAfter the outcome of the ICPC investigation, the FIIRO\u2019s governing board said, through the attestation, Mr Igwe earned undeserved salaries for years.\nAfter his suspension by the board, Mr Igwe returned to the Benin Republic University in February 2020 to defend his thesis and was issued another attestation to indicate he completed the PhD.\n\u201cThe probing of Mr Igwe has nothing to do again with the appointment of a DG because he is not qualified to be part of the process,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s challenges, according to President Muhammadu Buhari, are not based on ethnicity or religion.\n\nNigerians, according to Buhari, should blame themselves for the country\u2019s fundamental inequities.\n\nAt the State House in Abuja, the President spoke while receiving members of the Muhammadu Buhari/Osinbajo (MBO) Dynamic Support Group.\n\nFemi Adesina, his spokesman, confirmed this in a statement sent to DAILY POST.\n\nAfter contested presidential election results in 2003, 2007, and 2011, Buhari said that those who ruled against him were of his ethnic background and religious persuasion, while those who stood up for him were of different faiths and ethnicity.\n\n\u201cOur problem is not ethnicity or religion, it is ourselves,\u201d the President submitted.\n\n\u201cAfter my third appearance in the Supreme Court, I came out to speak to those who were present then. I told them that from 2003, I\u2019d spent 30 months in court.\n\n\u201cThe President of the Court of Appeal, the first port of call for representation by presidential candidates then, was my classmate in secondary school in Katsina. We spent six years in the same class, Justice Umaru Abdullahi.\n\n\u201cMy legal head was Chief Mike Ahamba, a Roman Catholic and an Ibo man. When the President of the court decided that we should present our case, my first witness was in the box.\n\n\u201cAhamba insisted that a letter should be sent to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to present the register of constituencies in some of the States, to prove that what they announced was falsehood. It was documented.\n\n\u201cWhen they gave judgment, another Ibo man, the late Justice Nsofor, asked for the reaction from INEC to the letter sent to them. They just dismissed it. He then decided to write a minority judgment. That was after 27 months in court.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Supreme Court. Who was the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN)? A Hausa-Fulani like me, from Zaria. The members of the panel went in for about 30 minutes, came back to say they were proceeding on break. They went for 3 months. When they came back, it didn\u2019t take them 15 minutes, they dismissed us.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, who was the CJN? Kutigi. Again, a Muslim from the North. After 8 months or so, he dismissed the case.\n\n\u201cAgain in 2011, because I was so persistent, Musdafa, a Fulani man like me, from Jigawa, neighbour to my state, was a CJN. He dismissed my case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken you round this to prove that our problem is not ethnicity or religion. It is ourselves.\n\n\u201cI refused to give up. I had tried to wear Agbada after what happened to me in Khaki.\u201d",

          "text": "US comedian Bill Cosby was freed from prison on Wednesday, in a blow to the #MeToo movement, after a US court overturned his conviction for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman 15 years ago.\n\nThe 83-year-old left SCI Phoenix, a state jail 35 miles (56 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia, after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that Cosby had been denied a fair trial.\n\nCosby, who shattered racial barriers with his Emmy-winning role on \u201cI Spy\u201d in the 1960s, was convicted in 2018 of assaulting Andrea Constand at his Philadelphia mansion in 2004.\n\nBut the judges wrote in a 79-page decision that a non-prosecution agreement between a former district attorney and Cosby over evidence he gave in a civil case meant the actor should not have been charged.\n\n\u201cCosby\u2019s convictions and judgment of sentence are vacated, and he is discharged,\u201d they wrote.\n\nCosby, who also starred as a dad and doctor on the hit TV series \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d in the 1980s, left prison just before 2:30 pm (1830 GMT), a spokesperson for Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Corrections told AFP.\n\nHis conviction was the first guilty verdict for sexual assault against a celebrity since the advent of the worldwide reckoning against sexual violence and abuse of power dubbed the #MeToo movement.\n\nAccusers of Cosby and supporters of the movement expressed anger at his release.\n\nLawyer Lisa Bloom said she and the three Cosby accusers that she represents were \u201cdisgusted that he is a free man today.\u201d\n\nCosby served more than two years of a three-to-ten-year sentence for aggravated indecent assault and has always maintained his innocence.\n\nHe has not reacted to his release and Cosby\u2019s publicist did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlthough more than 60 women charged that they had been victims of sexual assault by Cosby, he was tried criminally only for Constand\u2019s assault, since the statute of limitations had expired in the other cases.\n\nCosby has insisted that the encounter with Constand, who was then a Temple University employee, was consensual.\n\n(AFP)",

The syllabus was issued to candidates through The Board\u2019s Integrated Brochure and Syllabus System, IBASS; The CD which is given to candidates after completion of the registration; the link https://www.ibass.jamb.gov.ng. as provided with the candidates\u2019 profile code,\u201d it explained.\n\nThe examination body further explained that It was not automatic that the NECO/WAEC syllabus should transform into JAMB\u2019s, otherwise there would not have been a need for a separate syllabus for the UTME.\n\n\u201cThe UTME is not school-based and not an achievement test, but a selection or ranking test which ordinarily does not require a syllabus and does not have room for fail or pass as in achievement tests.\n\n\u201cThe rumor of mass failure is a fluke and a campaign by those whose source of illicit income has been further blocked.\n\n\u201cIt is our belief that based on facts on the ground, every right-thinking Nigerian would question the 6,944,368 figures on which the 14% \u201cpass\u201d is based.\n\n\u201cFor instance, in the 2021 UTME, 1, 415,501 registered for both UTME/DE. Out of this figure, 1,340,003 candidates registered for UTME and 75, 498 registered for DE.\n\nThe total number of candidates who took the UTME is 1, 300,722 with 78 389 candidates absent.\n\n\u201cYou can then imagine the spuriousness of the figure of 6, 944,368 on which 14% is based. The truth is that this year\u2019s performance is not significantly different from those of previous years,\u201d said JAMB.",

Section 156(i)(a) and third schedule, Part 1, Item F, Paragraph 14(1) of the Constitution have outrightly disqualified her.\n\nWe are, therefore, writing to ask the Chairman to save the Senate President, the Senate itself and Mr. President from being ridiculed.\n\nWe call on your committee to reject the nomination of Onochie because she cannot be neutral or independent as she is factually known to be an unrepentant card-carrying member of the APC with an uncountable number of proofs.\n\nHer confirmation will be a wholesome abuse of democratic tenets and dragging the reputation of the President and the Senate in the political mud.\n\nPlease, don\u2019t make an avoidable legislative and political mistake for the country.\n\nKindly, accept the assurances of our highest consideration and esteem regard.\n\nSen.

He is facing treason charges and was remanded in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) following an order by a Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nBut the World Igbo Congress in a statement signed and issued by its chairman Anthony Ejiofor and spokesperson Basil Onwukwe, urged the federal government to treat the IPOB leader according to universally accepted laws.\n\nThe group on Wednesday called on the \u201cNigerian Government to ensure that Nnamdi Kanu is treated in accordance with the rules and international conventions that guarantee that his rights and personal safety are protected.\u201d\n\nKanu, a UK citizen, had been in the country after jumping bail.

It is right for that party to be discarded by those committed to progressive governance and the welfare of both their state and nation.\n\n\u201cAs did Governors David Umahi of Ebonyi State and Ben Ayade of Cross River before him, Governor Matawalle withstood the coercion and pressure of the regressive PDP to remain with their damaged enterprise.\n\nMatawalle understood that the PDP was not the way, and wisely decided to part company with those who would pull the nation backward so that he can join hands with those who seek national improvement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI encourage Governor Matawalle to now work even more closely and cooperatively with President Muhammadu Buhari to help realize his progressive mandate and tackle the challenges that now face us.\n\n\u201cThe APC\u2019s doors are open to those who want democracy to flourish.\n\nThe entry of Governors Matawalle, Umahi and Ayade into the party demonstrates that the APC umbrella is sufficiently broad to accommodate all those with valuable ideas and contributions to the party and our country.\n\n\u201cMay other well-meaning people in the PDP also come to the realization that the PDP is not the place to achieve what is good and constructive for Nigeria and may they also change station accordingly.\n\nThe nation has entered a historic moment. Now is not the time to waste your time and effort. Come and join the APC so that we all can work in better unison to build a better nation.\u201d",

          "text": "Pennsylvania\u2019s highest court overturned Bill Cosby\u2019s sex assault conviction Wednesday after finding an agreement with a previous prosecutor prevented him from being charged in the case.\n\nCosby has served more than two years of a three- to 10-year sentence at a state prison near Philadelphia.\n\nHe had vowed to serve all 10 years rather than acknowledge any remorse over the 2004 encounter with accuser Andrea Constand.\n\nThe 83-year-old Cosby, who was once beloved as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dad,\u201d was convicted of drugging and molesting the Temple University employee at his suburban estate.\n\nHe was charged in late 2015, when a prosecutor armed with newly unsealed evidence \u2014 Cosby\u2019s damaging deposition from her lawsuit \u2014 arrested him days before the 12-year statute of limitations expired.\n\nThe trial judge had allowed just one other accuser to testify at Cosby\u2019s first trial, when the jury deadlocked.\n\nHowever, he then allowed five other accusers to testify at the retrial about their experiences with Cosby in the 1980s.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court said that testimony tainted the trial, even though a lower appeals court had found it appropriate to show a signature pattern of drugging and molesting women.\n\nCosby was the first celebrity tried and convicted in the #MeToo era, so the reversal could make prosecutors wary of calling other accusers in similar cases.\n\nThe law on prior bad act testimony varies by state, though, and the ruling only holds sway in Pennsylvania.\n\nProsecutors did not immediately say if they would appeal or seek to try Cosby for a third time.\n\nThe justices voiced concern not just about sex assault cases, but what they saw as the judiciary\u2019s increasing tendency to allow testimony that crosses the line into character attacks.\n\nThe law allows the testimony only in limited cases, including to show a crime pattern so specific it serves to identify the perpetrator.\n\nIn New York, the judge presiding over last year\u2019s trial of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, whose case had sparked the explosion of the #MeToo movement in 2017, let four other accusers testify. Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison. He is now facing separate charges in California.\n\nIn Cosby\u2019s case, one of his appellate lawyers said prosecutors put on vague evidence about the uncharged conduct, including Cosby\u2019s own recollections in his deposition about giving women alcohol or quaaludes before sexual encounters.\n\n\u201cThe presumption of innocence just didn\u2019t exist for him,\u201d Jennifer Bonjean, the lawyer, argued to the court in December.\n\nIn May, Cosby was denied parole after refusing to participate in sex offender programs during his nearly three years in state prison.\n\nHe has long said he would resist the treatment programs and refuse to acknowledge wrongdoing even if it means serving the full 10-year sentence.\n\nThis is the first year he was eligible for parole under the three- to 10-year sentence handed down after his 2018 conviction.\n\nCosby spokesperson Andrew Wyatt called the parole board decision \u201cappalling.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said Cosby repeatedly used his fame and \u201cfamily man\u201d persona to manipulate young women, holding himself out as a mentor before betraying them.\n\nCosby, a groundbreaking Black actor who grew up in public housing in Philadelphia, made a fortune estimated at $400 million during his 50 years in the entertainment industry.\n\nHis trademark clean comedy and homespun wisdom fueled popular TV shows, books and standup acts.\n\nHe fell from favour in his later years as he lectured the Black community about family values, but was attempting a comeback when he was arrested.\n\n\u201cThere was a built-in level of trust because of his status in the entertainment industry and because he held himself out as a public moralist,\u201d Assistant District Attorney Adrienne Jappe, of suburban Montgomery County, argued to the justices.\n\nCosby had invited Constand to an estate he owns in Pennsylvania the night she said he drugged and sexually assaulted her.\n\nConstand, a former professional basketball player who worked at his alma mater, went to police a year later.\n\nThe other accusers knew Cosby through the entertainment industry and did not go to police.\n\nThe AP does not typically identify sexual assault victims without their permission, which Constand has granted.\n\nAP",

It noted that the presumption of innocence is an \u201cessential part of the right to fair trial\u201d.\n\nAmong those held under the NSL are Jimmy Lai, the retail tycoon turned media mogul who founded the pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily. After being briefly allowed bail under strict conditions that amounted to house arrest, 73-year-old Lai was returned to jail in December. The Apple Daily itself shut down last week after its editor and top executives were also arrested under the NSL and the company\u2019s assets frozen \u2013 also under the law \u2013 which meant it was unable to pay staff and vendors despite having the money to do so.\n\nAmnesty said that as of 23 June 2021, 64 people had been formally charged under the law with 47 in pre-trial detention.",

          "text": "Dozens of people have died in Canada amid an unprecedented heatwave that has smashed temperature records.\n\nPolice in the Vancouver area have responded to more than 130 sudden deaths since Friday. Most were elderly or had underlying health conditions.\n\nThey said the heat was a contributing factor in many cases.\n\nOn Tuesday, Canada recorded its highest ever temperature for a third straight day \u2013 49.5C (121F) in Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nBefore this week, temperatures in the country had never passed 45C. The heatwave is due to a dome of high pressure hovering over the north-western US and Canada.\n\nExperts say climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\n\nThe heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 65 people in the city of Vancouver, police say.\n\nThe suburb of Burnaby, meanwhile, reported at least 34 sudden deaths and the Surrey area recorded 38.\n\n\u201cVancouver has never experienced heat like this, and sadly dozens of people are dying because of it,\u201d police sergeant Steve Addison said.\n\n\u201cOur officers are stretched thin, but we\u2019re still doing everything we can to keep people safe,\u201d he said, before adding that daily sudden death calls in the city had more than trebled.\n\nIn the tiny village of Lytton, about 155 miles (250 km) east of Vancouver, resident Meghan Fandrich said it had been \u201calmost impossible\u201d to go outside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been intolerable,\u201d she told the Globe & Mail newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to stay indoors as much as possible. We\u2019re used to the heat, and it\u2019s a dry heat, but 30 [degrees] is a lot different from 47.\u201d\n\nMany homes in British Columbia do not have air conditioning as temperatures are usually far milder during the summer months. Temporary water fountains and cooling centres have been set up in the Vancouver area.\n\nDozens of officers have been redeployed in the city, while the increased volume of 911 calls has created a backlog and depleted police resources.\n\nThe country\u2019s weather service, Environment Canada, has issued heat warnings for the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, along with areas of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the second coldest country in the world and the snowiest,\u201d said David Phillips, a senior climatologist for Environment Canada.\n\n\u201cWe often see cold snaps and blizzards but not often do we talk about hot weather like this\u2026 Dubai would be cooler than what we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d\n\nIn the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.1C in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon may be linked to the heatwave.\n\nThe heat is intense enough to melt cables, shutting down the Portland Streetcar Service on Sunday.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering why we\u2019re canceling service for the day, here\u2019s what the heat is doing to our power cables. pic.twitter.com/EqbKUgCJ3K\n\nAn electrical utility in Spokane, Washington, has also introduced rolling blackouts to cope with huge power demand as residents run air conditioners.\n\nOne Seattle resident told the AFP news agency that the city felt like a desert: \u201cNormally\u2026 60, 70 degrees is a great day \u2013 everybody is outside in shorts and T-shirts \u2013 but this is\u2026 ridiculous\u201d\n\nAmazon allowed members of the public into areas of its Seattle headquarters as a cooling-off location on Monday, while people in Portland also flocked to cooling centres.",
          "summary": "Dozens of people have died in Canada amid an unprecedented heatwave that has smashed temperature records.\nPolice in the Vancouver area have responded to more than 130 sudden deaths since Friday.\nThe heatwave is due to a dome of high pressure hovering over the north-western US and Canada.\nThe suburb of Burnaby, meanwhile, reported at least 34 sudden deaths and the Surrey area recorded 38.\nThe country\u2019s weather service, Environment Canada, has issued heat warnings for the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, along with areas of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba.",

          "title": "At 100, China\u2019s Communist Party Looks to Cement Its Future",
          "text": "For China\u2019s Communist Party, celebrating its 100th birthday on Thursday is not just about glorifying its past. It\u2019s also about cementing its future and that of its leader, Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIn the build-up to the July 1 anniversary, Xi and the party have exhorted its members and the nation to remember the early days of struggle in the hills of the inland city of Yan\u2019an, where Mao Zedong established himself as party leader in the 1930s.\n\nDug into earthen cliffs, the primitive homes where Mao and his followers lived are now tourist sites for the party faithful and schoolteachers encouraged to spread the word. The cave-like rooms feel far removed from Beijing, the modern capital where national festivities are being held, and the skyscrapers of Shenzhen and other high-tech centers on the coast that are more readily associated with today\u2019s China.\n\nYet in marking its centenary, the Communist Party is using this past \u2014 selectively \u2014 to try to ensure its future and that of Xi, who may be eyeing, as Mao did, ruling for life.\n\n\u201cBy linking the party to all of China\u2019s accomplishments of the past century, and none of its failures, Xi is trying to bolster support for his vision, his right to lead the party and the party\u2019s right to govern the country,\u201d said Elizabeth Economy, a senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution.\n\nThis week\u2019s celebrations focus on two distinct eras \u2014 the early struggles and recent achievements \u2014 glossing over the nearly three decades under Mao from the 1950s to 1970s, when mostly disastrous social and economic policies left millions dead and the country impoverished.\n\nTo that end, a spectacular outdoor gala attended by Xi in Beijing on Monday night relived the Long March of the 1930s \u2014 a retreat to Yan\u2019an that has become of party lore \u2014 before moving on to singing men holding giant wrenches and women with bushels of wheat. But it also focused on the present, with representations of special forces climbing a mountain and medical workers battling COVID-19 in protective gear.\n\nThe party has long invoked its history to justify its right to rule, said Joseph Fewsmith, a professor of Chinese politics at Boston University.\n\nShoring up its legitimacy is critical since the party has run China single-handedly for more than 70 years \u2014 through the chaotic years under Mao, through the collapse of the Soviet Union and through the unexpected adoption of market-style reforms that over time have built an economic powerhouse, though millions remain in poverty.\n\nMany Western policymakers and analysts believed that capitalism would transform China into a democracy as its people prospered, following the pattern of former dictatorships such as South Korea and Taiwan.\n\nThe Communist Party has confounded that thinking, taking a decisive turn against democracy when it cracked down on large-scale protests in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square in 1989 and quashing any challenges to single-party rule in the ensuing decades \u2014 most recently all but extinguishing dissent in Hong Kong after anti-government protests shook the city in 2019.\n\nIts leaders have learned the lesson of the Soviet Union, where the communists lost power after opening the door to pluralism, said Zhang Shiyi of the Institute of Party History and Literature.\n\nInstead, China\u2019s newfound wealth gave the party the means to build a high-speed rail network and other infrastructure to modernize at home and project power abroad with a strong military and a space program that has landed on the moon and Mars. China is still a middle-income country, but its very size makes it the world\u2019s second-largest economy and puts it on a trajectory to rival the U.S. as a superpower.\n\nIn the meantime, it has doubled down on its repressive tactics, stamping out dissent from critics of its policies and pushing the assimilation of ethnic minorities seeking to preserve their customs and language in areas such as Tibet and the heavily Muslim Xinjiang region. While it is difficult to gauge public support for the party, it has likely been boosted at least in some quarters by China\u2019s relative success at controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and its standing up to criticism from the United States and others.\n\n\u201cWe have never been so confident about our future,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told journalists on a recent trip to the party\u2019s historic sites in Yan\u2019an.\n\nTiananmen Square, where Mao proclaimed the founding of communist China in 1949, is no longer a home for student protesters with democratic dreams. On Thursday, the plaza in the center of Beijing will host the nation\u2019s major celebration of party rule. While most details remain under wraps, authorities have said that Xi will give an important speech.\n\nThe anniversary marks a meeting of about a dozen people in Shanghai in 1921 that is considered the first congress of the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 though it actually started in late July. The festivities will likely convey the message that the party has brought China this far, and that it alone can lift the nation to greatness \u2014 arguing in essence that it must remain in power.\n\nXi also appears to be considering a third five-year term that would start in 2022, after the party scrapped term limits.\n\nThe centennial is at once a benchmark to measure how far the country has come and a moment for Xi and the party to move toward their goals for 2049, which would mark the 100th year of communist rule, said Alexander Huang, a professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan. By then, Xi has said, the aim is basic prosperity for the entire population and for China to be a global leader with national strength and international influence.\n\n\u201cWhether they can achieve that goal is the biggest challenge for the Chinese leadership today,\u201d he said, noting growing tensions with other countries, an aging population and a young generation that, as elsewhere, is rejecting the grueling rat race for the traditional markers of success.\n\nStill, the party\u2019s ability to evolve and rule for so long, albeit in part by suppressing dissent, suggests it may remain in control well into its second century. The party insists it has no intention of exporting its model to other countries, but if China continues to rise, it could well challenge the western democratic model that won the Cold War and has dominated the post-World War II era.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, you only talk, talk, talk,\u201d said Hua of the Foreign Ministry. \u201cYou try to win votes. But after four years, the other people can overthrow your policies. How can you ensure the people\u2019s living standards, that their demands can be satisfied?\u201d",
