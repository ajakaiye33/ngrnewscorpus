          "title": "Naira will fall from N570/$1 to N400/$1 at black market if\u2026 \u2013 CBN ex-deputy gov, Moghalu",
          "text": "A former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Kingsley Moghalu, says the value of the naira will fall from N570/$1 to N400/$1 at the parallel market if there is a massive rush of dollars into the Nigerian market through export earnings.\n\nMoghalu made this known in a PUNCH Live Interview on Thursday.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe reason we have the prices we have is that the official rate is perceived by the market not to be the real rate; that\u2019s the fundamental reason why you have a huge gap of N410 at the official rate \u2013 Investors and Exporters\u2019 window \u2013 and then N570 in the black market. That is unbelievable.\n\n\u201cNormally, you will have a gap between the official rate and the parallel market but in our time, we made sure that that gap was not a lot \u2013 it wasn\u2019t more than N10, N15, max N20.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening now shows that there is a very fundamental crisis in the Nigerian economy. And unfortunately, the economy does not respond to political commands, the economy does not respond to political statements, the economy does not respond to military orders; the market responds to its own dynamics \u2013 demand and supply.\n\n\u201cIf you have a massive rush of dollars into the Nigerian market today, the price of the dollar would crash and the naira can come to N400 in the black market, you may be shocked.\n\n\u201cSo, it is about going to fix what would bring in the quantity of dollars that would rebalance the equation.\u201d\n\n\u2018CBN need to gain investors\u2019 confidence\u2019\n\nMoghalu, who was a deputy governor at the apex bank between 2009 and 2014, also explained how the apex bank stabilised the naira against the dollar for five years during his time at the bank, noting that the CBN must work on gaining the confidence of investors.\n\nMoghalu had deputised Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, who was CBN Governor from June 2009 to February 2014.\n\nBoth Sanusi and Moghalu were at the apex bank during the administrations of the late President Umaru Yar\u2019adua and then-President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nDuring the period, the naira steadied around N150/$1. However, the naira has maintained an unprecedented downward trend in the last six years since the beginning of the administration of the current President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele.\n\nThe naira now trades at N570/dollar at the parallel market while it trades around N412/$ at the I&E forex window which is the only official rate recognised by the CBN.\n\nThe downward trend of the naira had fueled calls for the sacking or resignation of the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, by some political groups including the Peoples Democratic Party. They blamed Emefiele, who has been CBN governor since June 2014, for poor monetary policies.\n\nHowever, speaking on Thursday, Moghalu blamed the downward trend of the naira on the activities of speculators and the lack of autonomy of the apex bank.\n\nWhen asked how he and Sanusi stabilised the naira against the dollar for years, Moghalu told PUNCH Live that the apex bank worked on investors\u2019 confidence during the period.\n\nThe CBN ex-deputy governor, however, lamented that the CBN has lost its autonomy to the political class and has little or no investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nAccording to the former presidential candidate of the Young Progressive Party in the 2019 election, the government of the day does not respect the independence of the CBN and it becomes a choice for whoever is the governor whether to play along or assert his or her independence and bear whatever cost given the kinds of political leaders that are in the country.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that the CBN in July stopped selling forex to Bureau De Change operators and asked legitimate travellers to approach the banks to access cheap forex but the banks have been inundated with fake demands.\n\nEmefiele had said that the BDCs defeated their purpose of existence to provide forex to retail users and had become wholesale and illegal dealers.\n\nAsked whether the stoppage of forex sales BDCs was the cause of the downward trend of the naira in recent weeks, Moghalu said the CBN should not have sold FX to the BDCs in the first instance.\n\n\u201cA Central Bank supplying foreign exchange to BDCs is very odd, Nigeria must be the only country or one of the very few countries that does that. It is only part of the wider problem.\n\n\u201cStatism is killing the Nigerian economy, the government interferes too much in the market and in that process, distorts the markets and the Nigerian citizen suffers,\u201d he said, adding that the sale of FX to the BDC encourage hoarding, roundtripping and exploitative tendencies by those who do not need FX but who have access to it.\n\nHe also said that the presidential order directing the CBN not to release money for food importation including heavily consumed commodities like milk was part of the problem of the rising demand for forex because the country does not produce sufficient milk whereas there is a high demand for the product amongst Nigerians.\n\nContinuing, Moghalu said that by pumping more forex into the market, the CBN is depleting the foreign reserves of the government, noting that economic diversification and exportation were the way out of the FX crisis",

It is a total war that must be won,\u201d she stressed.\n\n\u201cWe are engaging the traditional institution, community and religious leaders to build a partnership because NAFDAC cannot do it alone. \u201cIt is a clarion call. All hands should join us to fight this menace to finish. That is why we are moving from door to door with this campaign which involves roadshows into communities and villages.\n\n\u201cWe are also advising parents to watch their children who are in school. You need to ask valid questions and when children come back from school, check their bags and also observe the peer group or friends of your children, it is very important,\u201d Prof. Adeyeye advised.\n\nShe also disclosed that in the last four years, the agency has been battling the proliferation of Tramadol and fighting drug lords who import them. \u201cWe have destroyed several containers worth hundreds of millions of naira of Tramadol that are shipped into the country and are being diverted.\n\n\u201cMost of the nefarious activities being committed by criminal elements, drug abuse is at the heart of it. That is why we are fighting it frontally.\u201d\n\nRecall that a recent national survey by UNODC, NDLEA and NAFDAC, had shown that Nigeria almost tripled the world average on the prevalence of drug abuse.\n\nThe global average according to the survey is pegged within 5.6 percent but Nigeria alone rated around 14.4 percent.\n\nThis, Prof Adeyeye said, showed that there is a critical problem of drug abuse in Nigeria, a reason why NAFDAC is intensifying its campaign against drug abuse with the community to community campaign.",

I think we are all in the same bucket, the same basket.\n\n\u201cAll the 36 states do not need to join at the same time. Today my brother in Rivers State has gone far enough.\n\n\u201cI think the case has gone to the Appeal Court and there is also a stay of execution.\n\n\u201cLet me allow the rule of law. But for states saying they do not need VAT, maybe they do not know the hidden treasure in VAT.\n\n\u201cIf today I sell a house in Uyo, or any other person sells a property, the value is enhanced because of the good roads, electricity, security and water I have created, and the value I have added to the property. Why should the VAT on the property not come to me 100 per cent?\n\n\u201cJust look at the money I have spent on capital projects in the first quarter put at N143 billion, if you take 7.5 per cent of that, why should all not come to me?\u201d",

          "text": "The Federal Government has said the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) would continue to collect Value Added Tax (VAT) following the ruling of the Court of Appeal on the matter.\n\nFIRS had been locked in a legal tussle over VAT collection with Rivers and Lagos states governments after they enacted laws decentralising the collection of the consumption tax.\n\nHowever, some states had also rallied in support of FIRS, kicking against the proposed disruption.\n\nBut the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in New York on Wednesday that the ruling of the Court of Appeal that FIRS and the Rivers Government maintain status quo favoured FIRS.\n\nHe said it was FIRS that had been collecting the VAT before the dispute arose over which the Rivers government approached the High Court.\n\n\u201cThe position of not only the Federal Government but indeed the judiciary is the fact that status quo associated with the collecting of VAT should be maintained. And as far as the judicial system is concerned, the status quo as at the time the parties approached the court, it was the Federal Inland Revenue Service that was indeed collecting the value added tax. So with that in mind, the Federal Government has succeeded in obtaining an order that establishes the sustenance of the status quo, which status quo is that the Federal Inland Revenue Service should continue collection.\n\n\u201cThis is pending the determination of the cases that were instituted by states, particularly the Rivers State Government and the Lagos State government. The cases are being determined by the court.\u201d\n\nRivers government had urged the Supreme Court to set aside the Court of Appeal\u2019s September 10 ruling ordering it and FIRS to maintain status quo on the issue of VAT collection.\n\nA three-member panel of the Court of Appeal headed by Haruna Tsammani, issued the order being challenged at the Supreme Court by the Rivers government.\n\nThe state also urged the apex court to disband the panel of the appellate court, which gave the interim order and ordered another one to be constituted to hear the case.\n\n\u201cBut one thing of interest is the fact that the Federal Government had indeed taken cognisance of the fact that where there exists a dispute between a state and federal government, it is the Supreme Court that should naturally have the jurisdiction to determine the dispute between the state and the federation. And we are taking steps to consider the possibility of instituting an action before the Supreme Court for the purpose of having this matter determined once and for all,\u2019\u2019 Malami said.\n\nHowever, Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel, has said the decentralisation of VAT collection would favour every state in the country.\n\nSpeaking during a programme on Arise TV, he said opponents of the decentralisation of VAT collection cannot envision the hidden treasure it would bring.\n\n\u201cIf my brother states have gone to court, we are all one and in the same basket. All the 36 states will not need to join at the same time. As of today, my brother in Rivers has gone far enough. I don\u2019t rush to sign that into law. For now, let me allow the rule of law. Let\u2019s allow the rule of law to take its course. Some states saying that this is not needed is probably because people don\u2019t see the hidden treasure in VAT. There are so many things, and we\u2019ve discussed this at so many fora.\n\n\u201cFor example, If I sell a house in Uyo, and the value of the property is enhanced because of good roads, electricity and security that\u2019s been provided by the state government and when VAT is taken out of that property, why shouldn\u2019t that tax 100% come to me? Why should I take it to go and share?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing everywhere, so those who are saying that VAT cannot favour everyone; it will favour every single state in this country. There\u2019s no exclusion at all. Because it\u2019s a consumption tax, and whenever there are human beings, there must be activities. And where there is activity, there must be consumption, and where there is consumption, VAT follows, which will lead to revenue.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "The Yobe State Governor, Alhaji Mai Mala Buni, has said The Sun Award, which he will receive next month, will serve as an impetus to render more selfless service to the country and humanity.\n\nGov Buni, who is also the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), will on October 16, 2021 receive The Sun Political Icon award for 2020 along with 22 others, who will receive various awards.\n\nSpeaking when he received a delegation led by the Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief of The Sun Publishing Ltd, Onuoha Ukeh, Gov Buni said he particularly considered the recognition invaluable because he neither lobbied for it nor was the choice influenced by anybody around him .\n\nHe said that the honour was a confirmation that people are appreciative of the achievements he has recorded, both as the governor of Yobe and National Chairman of APC\u2019s CECPC, while reiterating that it will spur him to do more for the country and humanity.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am highly honoured and I commend the Management of The Sun Newspaper for finding me worthy to be nominated for this award. I am really encouraged and motivated to do more because it is only when some people appreciate what you are doing that you will be propelled to do more.\n\n\u201cThis award will certainly be a booster for me to scale up the achievements, both as National Chairman of APC\u2019s CECPC and the governor of Yobe State. It is sweeter because as you rightly pointed out, it is not an award I lobbied to get. It is even better when it is coming from a credible media outfit like The Sun Newspaper.\n\n\u201cOf course, I know the outstanding qualities of The Sun Newspaper. There can be no democracy without the media because you are the watchdog and you actually keep key players on their toes. Above all and as I said earlier, I thank The Sun management.\u201d\n\nExplaining the situation of things in his state, Buni said: \u201cAs you all know, Yobe is one of the worst hit states, devastated by the Boko Haram insurgence. Of course, the insurgency has been there for over a decade now and you can imagine the level of devastation not only in terms of infrastructure but also in human angle of it.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the areas of healthcare, education and the like, you will notice that a three-year old child when this Boko Haram started, is around 15 years now. You can imagine the vacuum, the trauma and the number of out-of-school children as a result of the situation.\n\n\u201cWe are just starting to pick the pieces after the devastation. We have taken some deliberate steps to ensure that we catch up. However, we passionately plead for all hands to be on deck in addressing the situation.\u201d\n\nEarlier, The Sun MD, explained that the choice of Governor Buni as The Sun Political Icon of the Year award was arrived at after a vigorous scrutiny.\n\nListing factors that influenced the choice, he cited the achievements recorded both as the ruling party boss and in Yobe, in the area of administrative competence, peace resolution mechanism, unity, infrastructure, education and agricultural development, among others.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt a time when the country, especially, the North East geopolitical zone, is plagued by insecurity, you have done so much to almost insulate your state from security breaches and inter-tribal squabbles. Yobe has been relatively peaceful, with little disruption of business activities compared to other states in the zone. You did not only leave enviable landmarks in your state but also displayed your ingenuity and competence in party administration since assumption of office as the national chairman APC Caretaker Committee.\u201d\n\nHe said the APC Caretaker Committee, under Buni\u2019s watch, has doubled its efforts to meet up with the tasks of retaining power beyond 2023, bearing in mind that democracy is as strong as the political parties it produces.\n\n\u201cThe CECPC under you has rebuilt the party to strengthen Nigeria democracy in an unwavering commitment to lead the process of political change in the country. In line with the CECPC\u2019s core mandate; to engender unity in the party, promote true reconciliation and give a sense of belonging to every party member, your dispute-resolution mechanism and efforts at resolving internal misunderstandings have paid off, with many formerly aggrieved members withdrawing and terminating many litigations involving the party.\u201d\n\nThe Sun MD said Buni had led APC CECPC to embarked on membership registration, revalidation and register update in order to shore up the party\u2019s membership and support-base nationwide.\n\nAccording to him, Buni\u2019s efforts resulted in \u201cAPC now having over 40 million registered members. Many Nigerians joined the party on account of your excellent, transparent leadership style.\n\n\u201cAs a peacemaker and stabilising voice, you have constantly met party leaders, party groups and interests; to accommodate all in the APC fold. At the last count, political heavyweights ranging from the grassroots, National Assembly members to state governors, with many still planning to leave their political parties for APC.\u201d\n\nChronicling his achievements as governor, The Sun MD, said: \u201cIn the last two years of your administration in Yobe State, you have introduced a new result oriented approach to addressing healthcare services in primary, secondary and the tertiary healthcare facilities.\n\nThe Sun Awards ceremony will be held at the Expo Convention Centre, Eko Hotel & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos on Saturday, October 16, 2021.\n\nApart from Gov Buni, others who will receive awards are: Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and Mallam Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (Man of the Year); Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State ( Governor of the Year); Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State (Political Icon); and Comrade Philip Shaibu, Deputy Governor of Edo State (Sports Personality).\n\nOthers are Allen Onyema, chairman, Air Peace and Dr. Adedeji Adeleke (Exceptional Philanthropist); Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa (retd), chairman, National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency and Brig Gen Ibrahim Shuaibu, Director General of the National Youths Service Corps (Public Service); Engr Nnamdi Ezigbo, chairman, SLOT Systems Limited and Dr. ABC Ojiakor, chairman, SEPLAT Petroleum Company Ltd (Entrepreneur of the Year); Alhaji Mustapha Ado, chairman, Ammasco International Ltd and Chief Ebuka Onunkwo, Chairman, Seahorse Lubricant Industries Limited (Industrialist of the Year).\n\nAlso to be honoured are First Lady of Ondo State, Chief Mrs. Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu (Most Supportive First Lady,); Chief Obinna Iyiegbu (Obi Cubana), chairman of Cubana Group (Hospitality Icon) and Kanayo O. Kanaya, star actor and producer ( Nollywood Icon).\n\nOther award winners are Mr. Moses Ekpo, Deputy Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Chief Olabode George, Prof George Obiozor, President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide and Amb Babagana Kingibe (Lifetime Achievement); Chief Frank Okafor, chairman of Marco Polo Group Limited and Prince Chris Igwe, chairman, Mainland Oil Limited (Investor of the Year).\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

The grand finale of the march has been fixed for today, when President Buhari will address the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).\n\nThe group is demanding the conduct of a regional referendum so that indigenous people from the southern and Middle Belt can decide on their nationhood, describing the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria as a fraud having been enacted without the consent of the people. The million-man march is also targeted at showcasing to the world the crimes against humanity, attacks on press freedom, free speech and other criminalities allegedly aided by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\n\nAkintoye alleged that an unnamed top Nigerian government official and a popular Lagos journalist were hired to pay foreigners of African descent to masquerade as \u201cOne Nigeria\u201d protesters to counter the NINAS march.\n\nHe, however, assured that no matter how the Federal Government tried to scuttle the NINAS march, the will of the people would prevail and urged all people of the South and Middle-Belt in the US and Canada to troop out in their numbers for the protest against what he said was the \u201crape of our ancestral land and hijack of our assets and sovereignty by the Fulani-controlled Nigerian government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Friday grand march in New York shall be historic, hence, the Nigerian government is jittery. The ring leader of government officials from Kwara State and a top Lagos journalist are now in New York to start hiring black people who will pretend as Nigerians to stage a pro-Buhari and One Nigeria Protest to counter NINAS on Friday.

          "title": "Against Mood of the Nation, PDP Retains Chairmanship in South",
          "text": "*How two groups emerge over zoning of offices\n\n*Our mandate does not include zoning political offices, says Ugwuanyi\n\n*6,000 delegates to decide new national chairman\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nAs predicted by many and against the mood of the nation, the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), may have finally settled for its chairmanship to come from the South, paving way for a northern presidential candidate and dashing hope of those asking that the party fields a southerner to fly its presidential ticket.\n\nLast night, at a long-winding meeting of its zoning committee, headed by the Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, the committee could not summon the courage to go with the mood of the nation. Instead, the party resolved to retain its chairmanship in the South of the country, ahead of its national convention slated for October 30 and 31, after majority\u2019s opinions supported the decision. What transpired in the committee meeting and ultimately, its outcome is seen as mission accomplished for norther members with presidential ambition.\n\nAlthough no official would speak on record about what transpired at the meeting, several, however, spoke on the condition of anonymity and confirmed the development.\n\nMindful of the sensitivity of the matter, the party leadership has also decided to delay the announcement of the outcome, using the period between now and next Thursday to calm frayed nerves and to also use the next few days to consult further as well as sell the majority opinion reached at yesterday\u2019s meeting to other members, who wanted the chairmanship to go to north.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the PDP was able to swing the idea, because a majority of those, who made up the committee were sympathetic to the aspirations of the northern presidential hopefuls, thus making the decision a lot easier for those in support of retaining the chairmanship in the south.\n\nA stakeholder, who pleaded anonymity and was opposed to the road being travelled by the PDP leadership, claimed that the eventual decision of the committee was not surprising, because they had simply worked to the answer, including through the composition of the zoning committee.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe outcome was not surprising, given that key members of the committee are either northern presidential candidates or are supporters of northern presidential candidates. They include the secretary and Aliyu Mohammed, who is a Saraki supporter; Muazu Aliyu Babangida, who supports Atiku openly; Ayodele Fayose, whose interest is not clear, but some believe he is eyeing the chairmanship; Sule Lamido, who is a candidate; Boni Haruna,who supports Atiku, Attahiru Bafarawa, and Baraje who support Saraki.\n\n\u201cThese members were nominated to please the said candidates, so, the outcome was supposed to be expected. Any talk that they are not zoning presidency to the region is a fallacy, because once you zone the chairmanship to the south, the presidency automatically goes to the north. That is the tradition. There is no way the chairman and the presidential candidates can come from same place.\u201d\n\nThe meeting had earlier run into a dilemma as there was an open division amongst members of the committee over the zoning of the office of the national chairman of the party, leading to the emergence of two different groups with different positions.\n\nNot surprisingly, however, while a group largely made up of northern members of the party preferred the south to produce the national chairman, some of their southern counterparts wanted a northerner to emerge the national chairman.\n\nUgwuanyi, after the meeting had clarified that his committee had no mandate to zone political offices such as the president or the vice President but strictly party offices.\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman of the PDP National Convention Organising Committee (NCOC) and Governor of Adamawa State, Ahmadu Fintiri, yesterday, hinted that over six thousand delegates were expected to elect new members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party at their October national convention.\n\nTHISDAY is reliably informed that at its meeting yesterday, attended by 25 northern members and 23 southerners, it was four regions against two, as all the northerners, THISDAY gathered, spoke in support of the chairmanship to be zoned to the South as well as maintain the status quo in terms of zoning of other NWC offices.\n\nThey were joined by seven South West members thereby reducing the votes of the southerners, who wanted the chairman to come from the North to 16 against the 32 that wanted the Status Quo to be maintained.\n\nThe South West leaders, who aligned with their northern members, because their zone was strongly bidding for the chairmanship, included a former deputy governor of Oyo State, Hon. Taofeek Arapaja; a former Minister of State for Federal Capital Territory, Chief (Mrs.) Jumoke Akinjide; former governor of Ekiti State, Mr. Ayo Fayose; a former Lagos PDP chairman, Hon. Deji Doherty; Senator Hosea Agboola, Senator Duro Faseyi and Hon. Rita Orji (from Lagos).\n\nIt was also decided that the party should suspend discussion on the issue of zoning of the presidential ticket as that was a bridge to be crossed when the time comes.\n\nTHISDAY gathered the chairman of the committee, Ugwuanyi, had allowed everybody two minutes each to speak and the majority spoke strongly in favour of retaining the status quo, a development said to be clear to all that a decision had been taken as far as the chairmanship of the party was concerned.\n\nInterestingly, the announcement of the decision of the Committee after the voting exercise was allegedly delayed deliberately till another meeting scheduled for Thursday September 30, 2021 in Abuja, for strategic reasons, including subduing likely tension as a result of the outcome and to secure the buy-in of others, who were unhappy.\n\nThe party leadership, THISDAY learnt, had decided to appeal to all members not to rock the boat as the decision over where to push the chairmanship was openly and transparently debated.\n\nThat, nonetheless, the adjournment, other sources claimed, was to allow for more consultations.\n\nThe meeting was attended by 47 out of the 48 members. The Southerners in attendance were 22 and the northerners were 25 members. While all the 25 northern members agreed that the national chairman should come from the south, their southern colleagues insisted that the national chairman must come from the north.\n\nA former Senate President and erstwhile Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, led the group that wanted the office of the national chairman zoned to the north.\n\nAnother source claimed it was agreed that whatever position there was before the meeting between the north and south should be retained but that the zones should decide what position would go where.\n\n\u201cThe office of the national chairman remains in the south, particularly, to the South West but remains subject to ratification, when we meet next Thursday September 30,\u201d a source said.\n\nThe two groups have emerged from within and outside the 48, originally 44 members, before four other members were added, bringing the committee membership to 48.\n\nThe first group, identified as the \u2018Maintain the Status Quo Group\u2019 wanted all the party offices to be retained in the geographical side to which they presently were. The second group called the \u2018Move Around Group\u2019 wanted all the posts presently in the South to be transferred to the North while the ones in the North should move southward.\n\nBy the calculation of the \u2018Maintain the Status Quo\u2019 group, the chairmanship of the party would be retained in the South while the National Secretary would move to the North. But the \u2018Move Around Group\u2019 wanted the next chairman of PDP to emerge from the North while the South produced the Secretary.\n\nAlso, while the \u2018Move Around Group\u2019 believed that zoning the chairmanship to the North would make the presidential ticket to be automatically zoned to the South, they insisted that the issue at hand was party position and whenever the party got to the point, where it had to nominate the presidential standard bearer, the matter would be resolved.\n\nThe \u2018Maintain the Status Quo\u2019 group held the opinion that the zoning committee should adopt the position of the Bala Mohammed Committee, which reviewed the performance of the party in the 2019 general election and declared that the presidential ticket of the party would be thrown open for aspirants from all the six zones.\n\nAnyim, who led the Move Around Group, had the support of some elements in the South-south and Southeast zones. The \u2018Maintain the Staus Quo Group, led by the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, had the buy-in of key leaders of the party across the Southwest, and the three zones in the North, making it four zones against the two of South-south and Southeast.\n\nAlso, a PDP governor from the North was said be supporting the former group, because he did not want a certain section of the North to produce the next President. But the Status Quo group enjoyed the support of another key governor from the South.\n\nThe \u2018Maintain the Status Quo\u2019 group has been anchoring its position on the fact that if the party did mass transposition from North to South and Vice versa in the zoning, then, it would defeat the argument that some members of the current NWC led by Uche Secondus were being removed from office, because of their performance in office. It was believed that a mass transposition system would make it obvious that the Secondus NWC was just a victim of politics.\n\n\u201cIf not for the issue of performance, which some leaders raised against the continuation of Secondus and his team, the members of the current NWC would have been eligible to seek second term. We are prevailing on them not to seek second term, because we believe they did not do well and that there is need for change of strategy, approach, injection of new hands and some energy, vigour and wisdom into the party. So, to make mass switch across geo-political divide will defeat the argument,\u201d the source said.\n\nAnother source, which condemned the \u2018Move Around Group\u2019 argued that, \u201cThis group consists of people, who want the presidential ticket zoned to their backyard. They are afraid of going across the country to canvass for votes and seek support that will give them a popular party mandate.\u201d\n\nUgwuanyi, while addressing newsmen after the closed-door meeting held at the Government House, Enugu, reiterated that, \u201cWe had a fruitful meeting and we adjourned to conclude next week,\u201d but earlier, he cleared the air that the committee had no mandate to zone political offices.\n\nHis words: \u201cOur Committee is strictly limited to the PDP National Executive Offices to be contested at the 2021 PDP National Convention scheduled for the end of October, 2021. We have no mandate to zone political offices such as President or Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Enugu governor maintained that the PDP remained the most credible platform to deliver good and accountable governance to Nigeria, adding that the work of the committee would contribute immensely \u201cin this deliberate search for National Officers of our Party that will help PDP achieve the lofty ideals and goals of our founding fathers.\u201d\n\nHe encouraged members of the committee to be frank, open and constructive in their proposals and debates, as well as exhibit consistency with the weight of their mandate.\n\n\u201cThe membership and leadership of this committee have been carefully selected as it is composed of very experienced, competent and eminent Nigerians, who are desirous of repositioning the PDP to play its role not just as the main opposition political party in Nigeria but to build a party that offers alternative policy proposals and hope to Nigerians that there is still light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Ugwuanyi said.\n\nMembers of the committee present at the meeting included the Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, who is the Deputy Chairman; the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mahdi Aliyu Mohammed, who serves as Secretary; former Presidents of the Senate, Senator Iyorchia Ayu and Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, and former Governors of Niger, Ekiti, Sokoto, Jigawa and Adamawa States, Dr. Muazu Aliyu Babangida, Ayodele Fayose, Attahiru Bafarawa, Sule Lamido, and Boni Haruna, respectively.\n\nAlso at the meeting were Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki, Hon. Sunday K. E Okoye, Chief Dan Orbih, Chief Ali Odefa, Mrs. Dr. Kema Chikwe, Chief Osita Chidoka, Chidi Lloyd, Senator Bassey Ewa Henshaw, Senator Emmanuel Nwaka, andDonatus Udeh, among others.\n\nIn a related development, Fintiri, while announcing that over six thousand delegates were expected at the national convention, said all new members of the national conversations must first be elected as delegates to enable them contest as party officials in the working committee.\n\nThough there were provisions for statutory delegates as provided for in the PDP constitution, the party also inaugurated a sub-committee on the review of the PDP constitution.\n\nFintiri, who spoke after the Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, inaugurated the 15 various sub-committees of the convention, said the party was ready for the national confab.\n\nAccording to Fintiri, \u201cAs you can see, we are here with all the 15 sub-committee members. The chairman, the vice chairman and the secretaries are here. I\u2019ve given them directions. I\u2019ve given them a template as to what is expected of them and they will go back and adequately prepare and submit the report back to me in the next five days, after which the main committee will sit and approve.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, on the number of delegates expected, Fintiri said, \u201cWe are expecting over 6000 delegates by our new constitution and we\u2019re fully prepared for that. We\u2019re expecting everybody in every ward that is a delegate to attend the convention.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also on how far the party has gone in resolving the leadership crisis, the chairman of the convention committee explained that, \u201cWe are moving on, I\u2019m the chairman of the convention committee, you can see we are doing our work, and everybody is happy, everybody is participating. I don\u2019t seem to see any crisis in this party except the one that is coming from the journalist.\u201d\n\nThe convention had earlier inaugurated 15 various committees for the success of the convention, and amongst those named was a former Inspector General of Police, Solomon Arase as Chairman of Security committee; his deputy is a former Chief of Army Staff, Ishaya Bamayi.\n\nThe governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, was named chairman of the special committee.\n\nOther committee chairmen were Udom Emmanuel, Constitutional Amendment Committee; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Zoning Committee; Mohammed Bello Adoke, Screening Committee; Ike Ekweremadu, Screening Appeal Committee; and Ifeanyi Okowa, Accreditation Committee\n\nOther are Ahmadu Fintiri, Electoral (statutory) Committee; Godwin Obaseki, Publicity Committee; Bala Mohammed, Venue Committee; Mariya Waziri, Welfare & Entertainment Committee; Ibrahim Dankwambo, Transportation Committee; Darius Ishaku, Contact and Mobilisation Committee; Biodun Olujimi, Protocol Committee; Nuhu Zagbayi, Medical Committee; and Umaru Ibrahim Tsauri, Secretariat Committee\n\nThey were all expected to submit their report in five days time to the main convention committee.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says oil producing areas in N\u2019Delta hurt by paltry amount\n\n*Supports states\u2019 collection of VAT\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nThe Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Chief Udom Emmanuel, yesterday called for an upward review of the three per cent allocation to host communities as contained in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nHe said oil producing communities in the Niger Delta were hurt by what he described as the paltry three per cent allocation in the Act. The Act made a provision for three per cent allocation to oil producing communities and 30 per cent for frontier exploration which has drawn severe criticisms from stakeholders in the Niger Delta.\n\nSpeaking on \u2018The Morning Show\u2019 on Arise News Channel, as part of activities to mark the 34th anniversary of the creation of the state, the Akwa Ibom governor said the people of the state were agitated and unhappy by the allocation, a situation he said cost the state a lot in its bid to calm frayed nerves.\n\n\u201cIf I want to speak about that, I might go a little bit harsh but it hurts us badly. For oil producing communities, a paltry three per cent?\n\n\u201cSo what was the essence of going round to collect memoranda and it was not taken into consideration at all? It hurts us so badly and a whole lot of agitation down there and our people are not happy. I must let the whole world know that our people are not happy and it is costing us a whole lot as government to pacify our people to allow this go, hoping that the government at the center would look at it again\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cBut trust me, the three per cent that they are allocating to host communities is not enough by any ramification, and I don\u2019t want to sound alarmist but I am also trying to make sure that we pacify our people hoping that something will be done as soon as possible,\u201d he added.\n\nHe harped on the need to review the allocation.\n\n\u201cIgnoring this issue will not make it go away. I think the earlier we address it and bring people back on board, the better for everybody. The host communities are not happy, the oil producing areas are not happy, so something should be done.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be right to ignore the people. You don\u2019t go and wake up something and cause controversy and assume things this way by ignoring it,\u201d he cautioned.\n\nHe further warned that the issue must not be allowed to return to the era of resource control.\n\n\u201cLaws were made for man not the other way round so those who gave the wisdom of three per cent can also give the wisdom of five per cent or more. Even if they give us 10 per cent, it wouldn\u2019t be too much.\n\n\u201cLet them not take us back to the era of resource control. We hope it would be looked into so our people would continue to live in peace,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the controversy surrounding collection of the Value Added Tax (VAT) by states which had become a subject of litigation, he said VAT collection would be in favour of every state.\n\n\u201cThose who are saying that VAT collection by states would not favour them are not accurate because VAT collection by states would favour every single state in this country. No exclusion at all because its a consumption tax. Are you going tell me wherever there are human beings, there must be activity, and when there\u2019s activity, there must be consumption and where there is consumption there must be VAT and where there is VAT, there is revenue\u201d, he said.\n\nOn the progress made by the state-owned airline, Ibom Air, he said the airline which started with three aircraft now operates eight commercial planes.\n\nHe said the oil producing state was developing a smart terminal that would process one million passengers every year.\n\n\u201cAnytime there is talk about aviation development in Akwa Ibom, I get very excited because in the face of adversity, when others are saying is a casting down, that we are trying to let Nigerians know that there is a lifting up.\n\n\u201cI also want people to know that when we talk about adversity quotient is in every single human being, and you can bring that to bear in whatsoever you do.\n\n\u201cI appeared on a program one time and it generated a whole lot of questions. I said that as a people and as a state, everybody knows, we may not have cash, but we can create money and there are various ways of creating money,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the big countries in West Africa not even one has a national carrier; Nigeria does not have and it pricked my mind that this is not rocket science and as a state we can venture into\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI was sworn into office, May 29, 2015. We started discussing Ibom Air immediately, I won the election. After the election, by April, before I was sworn in April 2015, we inserted the concept to see what we needed to do and then today is a success story and we are going to do more.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we are developing a smart terminal building that would not only compete in Africa, but in the world. A smart terminal building that can process one million passengers every year.\n\n\u201cWe are taking aviation development as a major gateway. We are thinking of cargo terminal and also dominating the regional.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, speaking about the ongoing legal tussle regarding the collection of VAT, the Attorney General and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami, yesterday said the FIRS would continue to collect the consumption tax following the ruling of the Court of Appeal on the matter.\n\nMalami, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in New York, that the ruling of the Court of Appeal that FIRS and the Rivers Government maintain status quo, favoured FIRS.\n\n\u201cThe position of not only the federal government, but indeed the judiciary is the fact that status quo associated with the collecting of VAT should be maintained,\u201d Malami said.\n\n\u201cAnd as far as the judicial system is concerned, the status quo as at the time the parties approached the court, it was the FIRS that was indeed collecting the value added tax. So with that in mind, the federal government has succeeded in obtaining an order that establishes the sustenance of the status quo, which status quo is that the FIRS should continue collection. This is pending the determination of the cases that were instituted by states, particularly the Rivers State Government and the Lagos State government. The cases are being determined by the court.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut one thing of interest is the fact that the federal government had indeed taken cognisance of the fact that where there exists a dispute between a state and the federal government, it is the Supreme Court that should naturally have the jurisdiction to determine the dispute between the state and the federation.\n\n\u201cAnd we are taking steps to consider the possibility of instituting an action before the Supreme Court for the purpose of having this matter determined once and for all,\u2019\u2019 Malami said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*CNPP, others tackle PDP over attack on CBN Governor\n\n*Says party chasing shadows while its house is burning\n\nObinna Chima\n\nCentral Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele has called on Nigerians in the diaspora and other foreign investors to take advantage of the opportunities in the country.\n\nEmefiele insisted that despite the economic challenges, numerous investment opportunities with good returns abound in the country.\n\nThis is just as the Conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP) has disowned the call by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Emefiele\u2019s resignation.\n\nBut speaking at the US-Nigeria Investment Summit held in New York, on the sidelines of the ongoing United Nations General Assembly, Emefiele advised Nigerians in the diaspora to begin to consider investing in their nation.\n\n\u201cWhy am I here? I am here to convince those of you in the United States that it is time for us to begin to look back home. The opportunities are there. I know you would say: How do I access credit facilities? Sometimes you find that the difficulty in accessing credit may be a problem, but you can come and start from somewhere because of the numerous opportunities.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is that Nigeria is opening up and I can tell you that people all over the world are beginning to think of what they can do with Nigeria and not what they can do for Nigeria. We Nigerians must set examples by folding our sleeves and doing things for ourselves before we can expect others to support us. That is the word I have come with today, that we are determined to do it for ourselves,\u201d the CBN told his audience during his 36 minutes presentation.\n\nEmefiele pointed out that because of the desire to stimulate economic growth in the country, the country\u2019s economic managers recently went to the Presidency and advised the government to take some bold moves.\n\nHe listed some of the initiatives to include the ongoing repositioning of the Nigeria Commodity Exchange, the newly established Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria (InfraCo) and the upcoming Nigerian International Financial Centre (NIFC).\n\nHe explained: \u201cIn the agriculture sector, we found that the big problem we have is the movement of goods from farm to market. It is a logistics and transportation problem. We got approval from the Presidency to reposition the Nigeria Commodity Exchange which plays a pivotal role in the movement of goods from farm to market. Another important move is the creation of the Infraco. You all know that infrastructure has been a problem in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to set up a world class infrastructure to begin to see how to revamp Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure without placing a burden on the federal government. So, the question now is where do you (Nigerians in the diaspora) stand? We would like you to come join and work with us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe reiterated the resolve of the central bank not to allow cryptocurrency transactions in Nigeria\u2019s financial system, just as he expressed excitement about the central bank\u2019s digital currency, the e-Naira, which would be unveiled in few days\u2019 time.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, because of activities surrounding Nigeria\u2019s Independence celebration on October 1, the earlier planned launch of the e-Naira on same date would likely be rescheduled to October 4, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe central bank would not want the event to take the shine away from the Independence celebration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be the first country in Africa to launch a digital currency. It is a novel idea because we think it will facilitate trade, Nigeria being the biggest country in Africa, this will set the tone to tell Africa that we are ready to lead and we would indeed lead in trade and we would make sure that happens. \u201cBetween all central bankers in ECOWAS, we are already working on certain collaboration to make trade, payment and banking system integrate in such a way to set example on the AfCFTA,\u201d he added.\n\nThe central bank governor was optimistic that all the aforementioned initiatives would likely stimulate economic growth, probably higher that population growth, promote prosperity and increase output growth.\n\nEarlier, Emefiele reviewed the performance of the Nigerian economy between 2015 and 2019, he cited the devastating impact of the COVID-19 on the economy and listed various measures adopted by the fiscal and monetary authorities to support households and firms.\n\n\u201cOf course, we took a number of countervailing measures because we felt that there was a very big part responsibility on the part of government, talking about the fiscal and monetary authorities.\n\n\u201cWe saw weakness on the part of the fiscal, because the fiscal space was very narrow; the deficit was narrow and space to release money to catalyse the economy on the fiscal side was very slim. So, the monetary policy thought there was a need from our side to see what could be done,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe reiterated that the 5.01 per cent GDP growth recorded in the second quarter of 2021 was due to the base year effect, pointing out that the base year effect would have dissipated when the third and fourth quarters GDP figures would have been announced.\n\nHe, however, predicted a 2.86 per cent GDP performance for 2021.\n\n\u201cWe feel that some of the things we have done are showing results and so we are going to push very aggressively,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nMeanwhile, the CNPP has disowned the call by the PDP for Emefiele\u2019s resignation.\n\nReacting in Abuja, the Secretary General of the CNPP, Chief Willie Ezeugwu, in a statement, noted that the CBN Governor had not done anything to warrant the call for his resignation hence PDP does not enjoy the support of other opposition political parties in this call.\n\nThe statement by the PDP was curious because nowhere in the interview by Senator John Udoedehe did the National Secretary of the APC National Caretaker Committee mention Emefiele.\n\nAccording to Ezeugwu, it should be more concerning to the PDP that its top and leading members had been resigning in large numbers, \u201cdue to the unattractive nature of the party on the watch of the current National Working Committee of the Party rather it is chasing shadows when its house is consumed by an inferno.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian opposition parties are currently supposed to be undergoing internal healing and rebuilding so as to be well positioned to take over power in 2023 but the activities of the Uche Secondus led PDP has reduced the politics of opposition to child\u2019s play and possibly being for hire to operators of BDCs who are fighting the Governor of CBN for the policy to stop sale of forex to the BDC\u2019s.\n\n\u201cPDP has become a shadow of itself and fast turning into a briefcase political party if the likes of Uche Secondus and Mr. Kola Ologbodion are left in the strategic offices they presently occupy in the party.\n\n\u201cThey should be shown the way out and not join hirelings to make misguided calls the basis of which are laughable, baseless and cannot be substantiated,\u201d it added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Goldman Sachs, Trafigura predict $90, $100 per barrel\n\n*OPEC: Higher natural gas prices will have marginal impact on oil demand\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nOil prices extended gains yesterday riding higher on growing fuel demand and crossing $76 for the first time since July this year.\n\nThe rally was fuelled by huge United States crude inventories drawdown as well as production challenges in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nPrecisely, Brent crude, Nigeria\u2019s oil benchmark, rose nine cents, or 0.1 per cent, to $76.28 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up four cents, or 0.1 per cent, to $72.27 a barrel, after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed the country\u2019s crude stocks till September 17 fell by 3.5 million barrels to 414 million, the lowest total since October 2018.\n\nSeveral OPEC+ countries, including Nigeria, Angola and Kazakhstanhave struggled in recent months to raise output due to years of under-investment or maintenance work delayed by the pandemic.\n\nHowever, there have been assurances by the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva as well as the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, that the technical challenges were being fixed.\n\nBoth Nigerian oil industry leaders further noted that by the end of October or mid-November, the country would be able to meet its monthly allocation by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the country has written the cartel for a higher baseline.\n\nKyari recently said that as a resource-dependent nation, Nigeria was most comfortable with a price band between $50 to $60 per barrel.\n\nIn a sign of strong fuel demand as travel bans ease, East Coast refinery utilisation rates in the United States rose to 93 per cent, the highest since May 2019, the EIA data showed.\n\nHowever, before declining, Brent crude had hit $76.50 a barrel, the highest since mid-July on last week\u2019s massive crude stock draws worldwide, particularly of floating storage.\n\nOn its part, Goldman Sachs has predicted that Brent could reach $90 per barrel if the weather in the northern hemisphere turns out to be colder than normal this winter, which is a $10 per barrel more than its current forecast.\n\nThe call for higher oil prices would come on top of the already too-high natural gas prices, which have sunk some natural gas power providers in Europe as industry leaders, including the NNPC insist that the natural gas situation will have a spill-over effect on the oil market.\n\nThe projection is that with natural gas in short supply, there would be more focus on crude oil as one of the only viable alternatives since wind and solar power are proving insufficient at this time.\n\nAccording to Goldman, a colder winter in Europe and in Asia would have a profound effect on natural gas and oil demand, earlier this week, predicting that a colder winter could lead to 900,000 bpd in additional oil demand.\n\nMeanwhile, global commodity trading firm, Trafigura is maintaining its forecast for oil prices to potentially hit $100 per barrel late next year, despite the risk of short-term Covid-19 headwinds heading into the northern hemisphere winter.\n\nTrafigura predicted earlier this year that crude prices were likely to return to $100, something the company said could happen \u201cprobably towards the back end of next year, if conditions are right\u201d.\n\nThe recovering oil market poses a new kind of challenge for discipline in the OPEC+ group of producers, as, \u201cThose who want to produce more, can\u2019t, and those who can, don\u2019t want to,\u201d according to Trafigura.\u201d\n\nSigns of a tightening market were the result of an ongoing recovery in demand and the risk that high gas prices could have a knock-on effect on oil markets due to switching to fuels other than natural gas.\n\nOPEC members and allies known as OPEC+ are expected to meet early October to decide whether to allow more production or continue with its current 400,000 bpd addition which it earlier agreed upon in July.\n\nIn a related development, despite widespread belief that the ongoing crisis in the natural gas industry might hugely impact prices of crude oil, OPEC has said the effect will be marginal, given its own scenario analysis.\n\nIn a document obtained by THISDAY yesterday, titled: \u201cBrief on Potential Impact of Recent Higher Natural Gas Prices on Global Oil Demand,\u201d the oil producers\u2019 group, noted that the study was necessary given the recent rise in global natural gas prices, and the current low levels of natural storage in various hubs.\n\nVarious industry experts and institutions, including the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) recently made statements to the effect that the rising gas prices might lead to its substitution with other fuels, especially petrol, resulting in higher crude oil prices by $10, according to the national oil company.\n\nNatural gas serves as a fuel for industry, mainly for power generation in manufacturing, refining and petrochemicals and residential sectors, but the report focused only on potential implications for industry because of the technical limitations it poses for residents.\n\nIt noted that recently, natural gas spot prices have risen sharply in the United States to reach $5.17/mmbtu on 20 September, compared with $1.34/mmbtu a year ago, due to freezing weather seen in the first half of the year and supply disruptions due to extreme weather conditions, in particular Hurricane Ida.\n\nIn Europe, prices have also soared on myriad factors, including harsher winter season seen in the H1, 2021 , interruptions of supplies from Russia, concerns about the slow certification process of Russia\u2019s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Europe, lower-than-average storage levels, record prices for carbon emissions, and limited renewable power output.\n\nCompared with $4/mmtu a year ago in South-west Europe, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) prices have soared to $25.70/mmbtu as of 20 September, according to Energy Intelligence, while current natural gas prices in Europe are equivalent to $150/b of crude oil.\n\nThe in-house document showed that hikes in natural gas prices incentivises substitution to more affordable fuels, indicating that switching from natural gas to LPG was already taking place as evidenced by reports of some refineries already feeding their furnaces with refinery LPG instead of natural gas.\n\nOPEC stated that an important underlying assumption in its September 2021 market report is that weather conditions forecast for the upcoming winter months would be normal in line with the average of the past 20 years.\n\nHowever, it noted that assuming a harsher winter in the upcoming winter months, which is from October 2021 through March 2022, it will sustain natural gas prices at high levels and incentivise more fuel switching from natural gas to fuel oil.\n\nBut the cartel noted that switching is expected only in certain parts of Europe and Asia, where movement from gas-fired to oil-fired power plants in the power generation sector and from natural gas to heating fuel, might occur.\n\nShare this:

          "text": "*Says president\u2019s article roadmap for US international relations\n\nPeter Uzoho\n\nThe Founder of Rosslyn Group, a Washington-based government relations firm specialising in Africa, Mr. John Rosenberg, has lauded President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s August 15, 2021 article published in The Financial Times of London.\n\nSpeaking recently at 2021 US-Nigeria Investments Summit held in New York, a side event of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Rosenberg described that Buhari\u2019s article as a sensible roadmap for US international relations.\n\nThe Rosslyn Group founder, urged his audience at the summit to revisit the Buhari\u2019s article owing to its \u201cprofound recommendations\u201d for the United States in Africa, specifically concerning its approach to counter-terrorism.\n\nIn the article, president Buhari had stated that with the United States pulling out from Afghanistan and the subsequent fall of Kabul to the Taliban, Africa had automatically become the new frontline of terror and global militancy.\n\nHe had stated that for Africa to defeat the growing terrorism on its soil, it would require more than the United States military aid but the entire world coming together for its sake.\n\nBuhari had also stated that the outbreak of COVID-19 provided some form of oxygen for insurgents to sustain their hostilities globally, reiterated that Africa\u2019s fight against terror was the world\u2019s fight.\n\nIn the article, he had expressed optimism that Africa would defeat the terrorists, \u201cone highway, one rail link \u2014 and one job \u2014 at a time.\u201d\n\nThe article was coincidentally published the day Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, the global hub of America\u2019s terror war, fell to the Talibans.\n\nBuhari had said, \u201cThough some believe the war on terror winds down with the US departure from Afghanistan, the threat it was supposed to address burns fiercely on my continent. Africa is the new frontline of global militancy.\n\nBut, Rosenberg, in his presentation at the US-Nigeria Investments Summit, profusely highlighted the importance of the president\u2019s article, said Buhari\u2019s caveat regarding military departure causing terrorism threats to return was a lesson, not only for Afghanistan, but policy makers within Nigeria and the African continent.\n\nRosenberg served as a senior intelligence analyst in Afghanistan, as well as Washington lobbyist for the government in Kabul during the Donald Trump administration.\n\nHe also underscored Buhari\u2019s statement that \u201cAfrica is the new frontline of global militancy,\u201d and without a bedrock of security, the prospects for attracting foreign direct investment remain dim.\n\nEchoing Buhari\u2019s call for increased US cooperation with Nigeria in terms of technical assistance, shared intelligence, aviation and other assets, Rosenberg tackled those in Washington who believe that investment and security support in Nigeria is wasteful.\n\nDrawing upon his experiences in Afghanistan and other nations beset by terrorism, Rosenberg viewed the comprehensive partnerships laid out by Buhari as a sensible roadmap for US international relations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Over 300 suspects arrested by the Nigerian government for funding Boko Haram terrorists have been released, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nSaharaReporters had in April reported how over 400 persons were arrested by security agencies during a nationwide crackdown on the suspected financiers of terror in Nigeria.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nThe operation was said to have been approved by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2020.\n\nConfirming the report a few days later, Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) had said the Nigerian government embarked on \u201ca wider and far-reaching investigation\u201d into terrorism financing after the conviction of Boko Haram financiers in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nSee Also Politics Why Buhari Government Will Not Name Sponsors Of Boko Haram Now\u2014Justice Minister, Malami\n\nBut on Wednesday, Malami, who is in the United States as part of Buhari\u2019s entourage to the United Nations General Assembly, said his office had reviewed over 1,000 case files out of which 285 had been filed before the Federal High Court.\n\nMalami was reacting to public criticism over the secrecy surrounding the identities of the alleged financiers of Boko Haram as Buhari\u2019s government has shunned all calls to name the terror sponsors.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates recently listed the names of 38 sponsors of terrorism, which include six Nigerians.\n\nHowever, sources told SaharaReporters on Thursday that while Nigerians were clamouring for the identities of the terror sponsors to be released to the public, Malami had already facilitated the release of many of them after collecting bribes from the most powerful ones among them.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier on Thursday published a list of 45 names out of the 400 suspects said to have been sponsoring terrorists.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Names Of 45 Out Of 400 Suspected Boko Haram Sponsors Buhari Government Is Hiding From Nigerians\n\nBut according to a source, the 45 suspects are the \u201cinsignificant foot soldiers of terror financiers\u201d being detained by an ex parte order while others have been released.\n\nSaharaReporters exclusively obtained documents including an affidavit in support of a motion filed by the prosecution (Nigerian government) to seek the continued detention of the suspects at \u201cWu Bassey Barracks, Asokoro, Abuja for 90 days pending the conclusion of investigations by the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Intelligence Corps\u201d.\n\nThe affidavit deposed to at the Federal High Court Registry by a litigation officer in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Federation says: \u201cThe suspects were arrested by troops of Operation Lafia Dole in Kaduna, Kano, Niger, Borno, Lagos and Zamfara states in relation to terrorism activities in the country.\n\n\u201cOngoing investigation revealed that the suspects have links with the Boko Haram Terrorist Group. That the investigation is advancing and suspects have access to legal practitioners of their choice. That it is in the interest of justice that the suspects be remanded pending conclusion of investigation as there are chances that the investigation will be compromised if the suspects are released on bail. That the court has the power to grant the application.\u201d\n\nThose detained as earlier exclusively published by SaharaReporters include Saidu Ahmed, Ibrahim Sani Bello, Mustapha Musa Adamu, Abubakar Sadiq Garba, Hussein Adamu, Muhammed Sani Adam, Abdulrahman Ibrahim, Ghazali Yusuf, Yusuf Ali Yusuf, Abubakar Adamu Yellow, Zahuraddeen Bashir, Haruna Garba Garo, Ibrahim Aliyu Usman, Hassan Idris, Musa Emma, Alhashim Mohammed Almashim, Baba Samaila, Bulama Tahir, Abubakar Ali, Mohammed Ambare, Danlami Hassan Nadabo, Danladi Talle Inuwa, Bashir Ali, and Mansur Muhammad Usaman.\n\nOthers are Musa Tasiu Ya\u2019u, Auwalu Ali Alhassan, Sadi Saidu Abdullahi, Suraj Adamu, Muhammed Auwalu, Ismaila Abdullaziz Mohammed, Munzali Ashiru Gambo, Yazid Muhammad Usman, Nabil Zakari, Gambo Auwalu, Muhammed Abba, Bashir Idris Shuaibu, Mohammed Yahaya, Auwalu Ibrahim, Abdullahi Umar Usman, Dahiru Umar Mohammed, Abdullahi Mohammed, Abubakar Yahaya, Hussaini Lawali Idrisu, Ladann Ibrahim, and Nurudeen Gani Aliyu.\n\nA security source told SaharaReporters on Thursday that Malami ordered the release of the \u201cbig fish\u201d or prominent and powerful ones among the 400 suspects initially arrested after collecting bribes from them.\n\nThe source added that those being detained are \u201cinsignificant foot soldiers\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe arrested about 400 of them but he collected bribes from the most powerful ones and they have since been released. Yesterday (Wednesday), he claimed there were 275 of them left, in an interview he had in New York. Most of the 275 he mentioned have also been freed.\n\n\u201cSome powerful Northern Emirs intervened on their behalf. Only an ex parte order to detain were filed against these 45 persons before Justice Anwulika Chikere of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Unfortunately, she was a vacation judge and has now travelled.\n\n\u201cShe is retiring in about three months\u2019 time. Only about 45 names were submitted to her instead of 275 the Minister claimed yesterday. These are all the strategies being used by Malami who has already left the big terror financiers off the hook.\n\n\u201cThe 45 persons are insignificant foot soldiers of terror financiers. And if you check the documents very well, most of them have already filed fundamental rights challenge against the government and are billed to be granted bail anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThat Honorable Justice Anwulika Chikere handling the case was born on 28th December 1956, so she is bound to take a bow on December 28, 2021, which is just three months from now.\u201d\n\nAnd going by documents exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters, most of the suspects currently being detained have already filed Fundamental Rights challenges and are billed to be granted bail.\n\nThough the documents also contain a list of the names of 45 suspected sponsors of terrorism, there is nothing to show that any charges have been filed against them since their arrest.\n\nConfirming that even the suspects currently being held will also regain their freedom, another source said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that no one has been charged according to the documents; the ex parte filed contained zero evidence they carried out anything. They are billed to be granted bail.\u201d",
          "summary": "Over 300 suspects arrested by the Nigerian government for funding Boko Haram terrorists have been released, SaharaReporters has gathered.\nMalami was reacting to public criticism over the secrecy surrounding the identities of the alleged financiers of Boko Haram as Buhari\u2019s government has shunned all calls to name the terror sponsors.\n\u201cOngoing investigation revealed that the suspects have links with the Boko Haram Terrorist Group.\nThese are all the strategies being used by Malami who has already left the big terror financiers off the hook.\n\u201cThe 45 persons are insignificant foot soldiers of terror financiers.",

          "title": "Phishing scams are becoming more prevalent in African countries",
          "text": "\u201cThe 12 billion dollar scam\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the FBI nicknamed phishing in 2018; a name that reflected the estimated amount of money lost to the cyberattack globally between 2013 and 2018. In 2018 alone, about $1.2 billion was lost to phishing and in 2020, phishing scammers made over $1.8 billion\u2014 more than via any other type of cybercrime.\n\nAccording to RiskIQ, businesses across the world lose about $17,700 every minute to phishing attacks and top companies lose $25 per minute to cybercrime.\n\nPhishing, also called email-scam, is a method of trying to gather personal information by sending deceptive e-mails to target recipients. Phishing is one of the oldest internet scams, dating back to the \u201890s, and perhaps remains one of the most prevalent cybercrimes.\n\nThe goal of phishing is to fool victims into believing that the message is something they want or need. For instance, the message can be an invoice from a vendor, payment or account update request from the victim\u2019s bank; it could even be a grant/scholarship offer. But one thing phishing emails have in common with other forms of cyberattack is that every phishing email comes with a call to action that prompts recipients to download a link or file.\n\nOnce the victims supply their personal data, the attackers have unfettered access to their identity and proceed to engage in malicious activities such as making purchases with the victim\u2019s credit card or cleaning out their accounts.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPhishing is also widespread in Africa\n\nAcross the world, Nigerians are stereotyped as the highest perpetrators of internet scams \u2014especially email scams \u2014 and series of recent events and reports somewhat justify this stereotype. But this doesn\u2019t mean Africans aren\u2019t susceptible to phishing attacks.\n\nPhishing attacks are prevalent in the continents and individuals and businesses across Africa have fallen victims to phishing scams. Cybercriminals have become even smarter with their tactics, adapting to changing economic situations and embracing more sophisticated technology to lure people into clicking on things they should not.\n\nFor instance, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout throughout Africa has given rise to ample opportunity for cybercriminals to carry out several attacks that are hidden in what, at first glance, may appear to be relevant information.\n\nScammers, posing as WHO or other trusted health organizations, now send phishing emails to unsuspecting victims to offer things like a COVID-19 kit, Coronavirus relief package which include food and cash benefits, or Medicare benefits; then ask them to verify personal information like bank details. Google also said in April 2020 that scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to its 1.5 billion Gmail users every day.\n\nAn example of COVID-19 phishing email asking for a bitcoin donation\n\nAnother example of COVID-19 phishing email sent in disguise as the UK government\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, a global cybersecurity company using its deep threat intelligence and security expertise to protect over 400 million and 250,000 corporate clients against cyberattacks, spam constituted almost 30% of email traffic in South Africa and close to 35% in Kenya in H1 2021.\n\nOver a million phishing attacks were recorded in South Africa in the first half of 2021. In Kenya, over 600,000 phishing attacks were recorded, and its around 400,000 in Nigeria. That\u2019s a combination of over two million attacks in the first half of the year from the three biggest African markets.\n\nThis shows that phishing is also a significant threat in Africa. But the company said these numbers represent a reduction from the cyberattacks that were captured within the same period in 2020. South Africa witnessed a 17% decline; Kenya saw a 48% decline, and Nigeria recorded an 18% decline from over two million cases in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis decrease is in line with global trends and supports the decline that Kaspersky research identified happening through the course of last year already. Of course, this does not mean that organisations and consumers can ignore the risk of traditional cybercrime attacks or that phishing, as well as spam, are still not of significant concern across Africa,\u201d says Bethwel Opil, Enterprise Sales Manager at Kaspersky in Africa. \u201cInstead, people need to become even more aware of cybersecurity best practices and remain vigilant to protect their personal and business systems from the risk of compromise,\u201d\n\nHow businesses and individuals can protect themselves from phishing scams\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to stop scammers from sending phishing emails, there are certain ways to prepare and make sure individuals and businesses stop falling victims.\n\nOnce the characteristics of dubious emails have been understood and there\u2019s a consistent effort in looking out for them before taking any action, there\u2019s a high chance of beating phishing activities.\n\nIndividuals and businesses are advised to install relevant cybersecurity solutions on their devices, and in addition to that, they should consider the following tips:\n\nReview the email address of senders and look out for impersonations of trusted brands or people.\n\nAlways inspect URLs in emails for legitimacy by hovering over them before clicking\n\nBeware of URL that redirects and pay attention to subtle differences in website content: make sure the URL starts with https:// and not http://.\n\nGenuine brands and professionals generally won\u2019t ask recipients to divulge sensitive personal information. If an email prompts for such, the next thing to do is to investigate and contact the brand or person directly, rather than hitting reply.\n\nUse multiple email addresses, one for personal use and another for online shopping or social media.\n\nDo not rush or panic-react, scammers use such tactics to pressure their victims into clicking links or opening attachments.\n\nEnsure browsers and operating system software are up to date with the latest patches.\n\nUse anti-spam filters in addition to antivirus and Internet security solutions.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

The 1,200-square-meter hub in Abuja also served as a residential base for technology entrepreneurs on the continent selected to go through the VP accelerator programme.\n\nOver the past five years, Ventures Platform has changed its investment strategy from the accelerator model to become one of the leading early-stage funds in Africa while it spun off the innovation hub business, now managed by its subsidiary Ventures Park.\n\nWith the recent surge in startup fundraising and tech activity as well as an uptick in remote and freelance jobs in Nigeria, Ventures Park saw its community of active users nearly doubled from just over 100 in early 2021 to almost 200 at present. In response to the increase, the company has launched a bigger campus, in Abuja, to provide greater support to its community.\n\nNigeria has the highest number of startups in Africa, according to findings by fDi Intelligence of Financial Times, in collaboration with Briter Bridges. As of August, a report by Disrupt Africa showed that Nigerian startups accounted for the biggest share of the $1.1 billion funding the continent\u2019s tech ecosystem had attracted this year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s been almost two years since the Covid-19 pandemic began, yet remote work shows no signs of going away. The social distancing rules, public gathering restrictions, and other lockdown measures that were imposed to curb the spread of the virus forced companies across the world to adopt remote work options to keep their businesses running.\n\nThat reality has also played out in Nigeria. While most people in the country still work from physical offices amid the health crisis, a few companies, such as Andela, Paystack, and Buycoins, have fully embraced the work-from-home idea.\n\nBut there are significant barriers to the success or long-term adoption of remote work; such as Nigeria\u2019s inefficient power grid and irregular electricity supply as well as poor network connectivity and high internet costs. Nigeria ranks among countries with the most expensive data in the world.\n\nImage credit: Supplied by Ventures Park.\n\nA shared workspace at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja.

It has facilities such as private and shared offices, dedicated desks, restaurants, and spaces designed to host events, conferences, fun activities, and more.\n\nOn the walls of the new campus are displays of several contemporary Nigerian art, which help create a stimulating and stress-free work environment. \u201cAt Ventures Park, we believe fundamentally that the space people work in influences the kind of work they produce,\u201d Kola Aina, founder of Ventures Platform told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThe Chill Zone.

According to Aina, the \u2018multidisciplinary\u2019 nature of the community is \u201creally important to creating a vibrant ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe Garden of V-Den.

Image credit: Supplied.\n\nBut why Abuja, and not Lagos, which is the epicentre of tech activity in Nigeria and where Ventures Platform has a \u201cvery active\u201d community? Oguchi explains that the company believes that talent is everywhere, but opportunity isn\u2019t evenly distributed.\n\n\u201cIf everyone continued to focus on Lagos, we\u2019d miss out on talents in other parts of Nigeria,\u201d she said. \u201cWe chose Abuja to cater to the community and build the ecosystem here and since we launched, we\u2019ve seen real progress in tech activity.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aina, Ventures Platform, since its launch, has been deliberate about wanting to provide opportunities in Abuja and the broader northern region of the country. \u201cMany years later, the ecosystem in Abuja and northern Nigeria has grown significantly and we\u2019re proud to have been part of that process.\u201d\n\nVentures Park offers different free and paid membership plans for people looking to make use of the campus, including low-cost options from as low as \u20a61,500 ($2.7).\n\n\u201cWe understand how important it is for people to work with budgets,\u201d Oguchi said. \u201cCompanies can book a space for a two or three-hour meeting and we also have several membership plans for individuals and startups.\u201d\n\nThe training room at the new Ventures Park campus in Abuja.

          "title": "iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa",
          "text": "After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple has released the iPhone 13 series.\n\nDuring a virtual event on Tuesday, Apple announced that the iPhone 13 will come in four new models: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.\n\nWhat\u2019s new about the iPhone 13 series?\n\nWell, it looks very much like the iPhone 12 but two notable main updates were made to the phone\u2019s display and camera. The new phones will also run on the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system, iOS 15. They also come with larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 Terabyte storage), a new A15 Bionic processor, a smaller notch and new camera features.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThe iPhone 13 starts at $829 for 128GB, which is twice the storage the iPhone 12 started with; while the iPhone 13 Mini starts at $729 for 128GB of storage. The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max start at $999 and $1,099 respectively, for 128GB storage.\n\nIPHONE 13 SERIES US PRICES AND STORAGE\n\nPhone 128GB storage 256GB storage 512GB storage 1TB storage iPhone 13 Mini $729 $829 $1,029 NA iPhone 13 $829 $929 $1,129 NA iPhone 13 Pro $999 $1,099 $1,299 $1,499 iPhone 13 Pro Max $1,099 $1,199 $1,399 $1,599\n\nWhy the iPhone 13 series are more expensive in African countries\n\nOver the years, there\u2019s been a noticeable price difference for Apple products in African countries. So, TechCabal reached out to iPhone retailers in different African countries to find out when the iPhone 13 will be available and how much it\u2019ll cost.\n\nNigeria\n\n\u201cOf course, you can expect that since the iPhone will be available on September 24, we\u2019ll have it in Nigeria on or before October 1.\u201d Emmanuel Osho, CEO of Bodds IT and Apple certified technician told TechCabal. \u201cThe price will be about 30% higher because it\u2019s new and there\u2019s a lot of hype around it.\u201d\n\nDespite the increased margin on the iPhone, Osho expects that the new iPhones will still sell out fast. A positive effect of the people purchasing the new iPhone 13 is that they\u2019ll most times trade in their older iPhones, making room for other people to buy them at a more affordable price.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Nigeria, at an exchange rate of $1/\u20a6550, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about \u20a6593,000.\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, the iPhone 13 will reportedly be available from October 8 according to iStoreZA, an Apple premium reseller. Although the store hasn\u2019t revealed the prices, the iPhone 13 Pro 128GB is expected to go for around R23,499 ($1,640), while the iPhone 13 Pro Max 128GB could retail for around R25,999 ($1,815). This is a high price margin of over 50%, most likely influenced by the fact that an iPhone or iPod attracts 7% duties and 15% VAT in South Africa per Business Insider.\n\nYou can expect that the price of iPhones from other retailers to be around the same price range as the majority of Apple products sold in South Africa come through a sole distributor, Core Computer Group.\n\nKenya\n\nIn Kenya, TechCabal spoke to a Salute iWorld, an authorized Apple product retailer at Yaya Center, Nairobi.\n\nA representative of the retailer told us that they expect to have the iPhone 13 in their stores within the next two weeks.\n\nWhile he couldn\u2019t comment on how much it\u2019ll cost he mentioned that in general Apple products are charged a 16% import fee with an additional 6% added on for Value Added Tax (VAT). This is aside from the transportation cost and the profit margin that the retailer will add to arrive at a final price for the public.\n\nSo 30% increase in price in Kenya, at an exchange rate of $1/KSh110, means the iPhone 13 128GB will cost about KSh119,000.\n\nThe iPhone 13 looks like it offers a bit over its predecessor. But not so much that it\u2019ll compel many to upgrade. In the context of Africa, it brings up the question of whether the minor upgrades are worth paying at least an additional 30% \u2013 50% to get the new iPhone 13 in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa.\n\nAlexandria Williams contributed to this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt all levels, education in Nigeria is in dire need of intervention. On the supply side, there are more students or prospective students than there are schools. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), about 10.5 million children in Nigeria between the ages of 5-14 are out of school, and one in every five out-of-school children in the world is in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to a study of public and private schools in Lagos State by Elaine Unterhalter, a professor of education and international development at University College London, there are 1,200 primary school-aged children for every public school place available. With governments unable to provide adequate options for education in the country, individuals are picking up the slack.\n\nAccording to the National Universities Commission (NUC), there are more private universities (99) than state and federal universities (98) combined. However, with about 40% of the population living in poverty, the fees charged by these private schools are out of reach for many people.\n\nYet, not everyone who can afford to pay for a university education gets the opportunity. Between 2010 and 2015, only 26% of the ten million applicants to Nigerian universities gained admission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis situation has made room for tutorial centres that prepare students for university entrance examinations like the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB).\n\nSowing the seeds\n\nIn 2015, Jeremiah Godwin took the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination but did not make the required score to get admitted into the university. Having failed to get into school, he spent the next year at home. He discovered online marketing and, together with a friend, started reading about the subject.\n\nTheir first thought was to create a blog with hopes of making money from it. That never happened, but they were not discouraged. They kept on learning, and in 2017, Godwin\u2019s family relocated to the US, but he stayed in touch with his friend.\n\nTheir next venture was Buzz Visuals, a digital agency that created logos for businesses while helping them market their products using social media. This time, they had some success making about $1,000 monthly.\n\nStarting Stranerd\n\nIn 2018, while hanging out with a friend at a coffee shop in Cyprus, Godwin talked with a girl. Only a few weeks earlier, he had moved to the European country to study at Near East University. During the conversation, he discovered that she had some difficulties with calculus, a subject that he had aced as a student in Nigeria. He gave her some pointers on how to solve some problems.\n\nA few days later, he got a call from her saying that she was willing to pay whatever he wanted if he could tutor her to pass the course. He agreed, and she sent him a bunch of past questions.\n\nRealising he needed some help, he enlisted his friend, Timmy Salami, to solve the questions. Together, they were able to tutor the girl and made some money in the process.\n\nAt about the same time, Salami was trying to decide what to do, so he spoke to Godwin about tutoring students online. With guidance from Godwin, he created an Instagram page and started posting content. They named the page \u201cStranerd,\u201d a combination of the Italian word for extra and nerd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon, they were getting requests from students worldwide who needed help with their assignments, charging between $20 and $50 to solve problems. With time, requests started extending beyond math and calculus to subjects they had no expertise on, and so they hired more tutors, in the process becoming a bridge between the students and the tutors.\n\nThe most significant change would come in 2020, when they started receiving more requests from students in Nigeria. These students could not afford what they charged their clients studying in European and American schools. But they wanted to help.\n\nFirst, they researched available edtech solutions in Nigeria, but none of the options they saw was good enough. They were either unknown to the students who needed them or did not serve the demographic that reached out to the Stranerd team.\n\nDiscovering a need, they launched a web platform that caters to Nigerians at an affordable price. Currently, they serve students on both the website and social media. On social media, they charge about $5 for each question they solve, sell study materials, and connect students to tutors while taking a cut of the earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Stranerd website. Source: Supplied\n\nOn the website, which currently serves mainly Nigerian students, the startup employs a coin system to charge students. Coins sell from $0.99 (\u20a6408) for 300 bronze coins to $4.99 (\u20a62,056) for 50 gold coins.\n\nWith these coins, students can ask questions, access study tools and materials, or book sessions with tutors. In addition to using the coins to pay for services on the site, students can also redeem coins by answering questions.\n\nGodwin explains the reason for employing the coin system as opposed to a subscription model.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that the average Nigerian is not okay with paying a monthly subscription for a product or service, so we use the coin to make them pay for services as they use them.\u201d\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nThe startup has big plans to extend its offerings beyond tutorials. The goal, Godwin says, is to become a one-stop-shop for the Nigerian student\u2019s educational needs and possibly African students also. They also want to include connecting students to internships as well as providing study-abroad services to students. But first, the startup plans to build trust among the students before leveraging it to add more services.\n\n\u201cBy next year [2022], we\u2019re hoping to get a million users. Right now, on the platform, we have questions and tutors. We\u2019re hoping to bring in study groups and sessions.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that when the tutors come on the site, they create study materials that students can access whenever they like. The big vision is to become a company that the Nigerian student can trust with everything educational.\u201d\n\nStranerd also plans to add classes. Already the startup has partnered with two tutorial centres in Lagos with plans to add more in the future. For these tutorial centres whose reach is limited by physical classes, the value proposition is their ability to reach many more students than would typically walk in.\n\n\u201cWith classes, tutors can host their classes, maybe JAMB or JUPEB classes, and they can have students subscribe to the class, and they can teach them. We have already partnered with two in the Akoka area. And in the coming months, as we push more features to the site, we would partner with more people around Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSince launching in 2019, the startup has served almost 40,000 students in 11 countries, including Nigeria, United States, India, Pakistan, Cyprus, Germany, Indonesia, Brazil, France, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe website, which has run solely on revenue, already has 500 students after its August 2021 launch.\n\nGodwin reveals that the startup made a little over $2,000 in revenue in 2019 after launching towards the end of the year.\n\nIn 2020, spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, the startup reportedly generated $30,000 in revenue and has already done over $40,000 so far in 2021. It also has plans to raise money from investors having already applied to Y Combinator. Users can also expect an app release soon.\n\nGodwin is studying Computer Information Systems at Near East University, Cyprus, while Salami is studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Lagos. As students, running a business has been a bit challenging, and Godwin reveals that the biggest test, so far, has been adequately understanding the Nigerian market. The second biggest challenge has been funding.\n\n\u201cMoney is an issue. We\u2019re not so much, and with money, you can hire more people to speed up the work. But if there\u2019s any challenge, it would be understanding the Nigerian market.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the Nigerian market is not easy, and Nigerians relate differently with edtech startups. I think that\u2019s where most edtech people have it wrong, trying to replicate what people in America are using.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And according to the United Nations, September 23 every year is an opportunity to support and protect the linguistic identity and cultural diversity of all deaf people and other sign language users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe World Federation of the Deaf (WFD) estimates that there are more than 70 million deaf people worldwide and more than 80% of them are from developing countries.\n\nHow do people with hearing impairments communicate? Depending on the degree of severity, they use hearing aids, speech-to-text tools and sign languages to communicate.\n\nBefore yesterday, I thought there was just one universal sign language that every deaf person understood.\n\nHowever, studies show that there are over 300 sign languages in the world, and over 23 of them are used in Africa.\n\nInterestingly, technology is assisting people in Africa who have varying degrees of hearing loss.\n\nTo know how, please, read: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nOr watch the video: What does communication in a techy world mean for Nigeria\u2019s deaf people?\n\nReelFruit raises $3 million Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s dried fruit snack brand, ReelFruit, has announced a $3 million Series A round to expand production, increase product offerings, and double down on exports to the US and other international markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlitheia IDF led the round with $2m. Samata Capital and Flying Doctor Healthcare Investment Company also participated in the round.\n\nFounded in 2012 by Affiong Williams (CEO), ReelFruit is an agritech company that processes and distributes locally grown fruits. It claims to help communities by empowering fruit farmers by purchasing their raw materials.\n\nMore on its expansion plans, ReelFruit plans to build a new factory in Ogun State, Nigeria, to increase its monthly dried fruit production from 6 to 30 tonnes.\n\nIn its first year, the factory will employ over 200 people. With a larger supply of dried fruit, ReelFruit will develop new products for domestic and international markets.\n\nBy December 2021, the company plans to launch an eCommerce channel for direct US sales and open up more B2B opportunities, such as white-labelling and co-packing, to support the national drive toward import substitution.\n\nThe company believes local buyers will purchase dried fruit locally, reducing their reliance on imports.\n\nPaystack launches Apple Pay to help Nigerian businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaystack, an African fintech company that powers and processes payments for businesses, announced yesterday that Pay with Apple Pay is now available on its platform.\n\nWhat does this mean? Nigerian businesses will have access to millions of Apple Pay users across more than 60 countries where the payments service is available. And according to Paystack, it is the \u201cfastest, secure way for Nigerian businesses to accept international payments.\u201d\n\nLaunched in 2014, Apple Pay, Apple\u2019s mobile payments and digital wallet service, allows users to pay securely and privately on their iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macbooks.\n\nHow will it work? When a customer with Apple Pay buys from a Paystack merchant, they will see the option to checkout using Pay with Apple Pay. They can then proceed to pay using Touch ID or Face ID.\n\nThey can accept payments made through any of the Paystack-hosted commerce tools \u2014 Paystack Storefronts or Invoices \u2014 and through a variety of payment channels such as cards, mobile money, USSD, QR codes, and EFT.\n\nIs this familiar? Yes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up, I never had much contact with deaf people. Of course, that is to be expected as I didn\u2019t know any deaf people.\n\nIn later years, I would come to \u2014 unconsciously \u2014 associate being deaf with being poor. Why? I only saw deaf people while travelling through Nigerian roads to or from school or during village visits to see my grandparents.\n\nThey had on old clothes and would constantly thrust or \u2014 if the paper was too big \u2014 display a note asking you to give some money to the deaf people or an orphanage or a motherless baby\u2019s home. Interestingly, they were always smiling, and I always wondered why.\n\nDuring the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, I had to reconfigure my perceptions when I met a young girl who we will call Mary. Big brown eyes, small \u2014 at least for a five-year-old her \u2014 funny, smart, beautiful, silent \u2014 at first \u2014 deaf.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs I interacted with her, a lot of my misconceptions began to fall away. Poor? Nope. Beggar? Nope. Because she\u2019s hard of hearing, you have to speak really loud or use signs so she can understand.\n\nBut, I got really incensed after learning that her parents refused to acknowledge her deafness. They put her in a regular school with no access to sign language classes to help her communicate.\n\nFor people who aren\u2019t entirely deaf, like Mary, basic technology like a hearing aid or an implant would make it easier to communicate and understand people.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of Sign Languages we talked to members of the deaf community. You can choose to watch the video or read down, or both. Happy International Day of Sign Language. #WeSignForHumanRights\n\nNigeria\u2019s deaf community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\n\nAccording to Oluwaseun Sosanya, a sign language interpreter, tutor, and deaf advocate, the deaf community \u201cis a collection of people that share the same idea, belief, and culture, and use sign language to communicate.\n\n\u201cThe community includes the two categories of deaf \u2014 pre-lingual and post-lingual deaf \u2014 parents of the deaf, sign language interpreters, and all users of sign language.\n\n\u201cPre-lingual deaf are people born naturally deaf, who\u2019ve spoken no language. And the post-lingual deaf are people who were once talking and hearing but later became deaf as a result of illness or accident.\u201d\n\nUsing Sosanya\u2019s explanation, Mary is a pre-lingual deaf person.\n\nBut beyond this is the rich history and culture of the deaf people and those who have accepted and are proud of this identity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlaoluwa Bayonle, another sign language interpreter, says, \u201cIt is a community of people, I mean the deaf people and hard of hearing people, who have accepted their deafness, their inability to hear, and are proud of this identity. The community is established with a different culture from the hearing community.\n\n\u201cThe members of this community are the deaf people, the hard of hearing, the sign language users, and the friends of the deaf. The official language of this community is sign language.\u201d\n\nSign language is a huge part of the deaf community culture. It is the unique way in which the deaf and friends of the deaf communicate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\nFor the African deaf community, the prevalent sign language is the American Sign Language (ASL) which Andrew Foster \u2014 regarded as the Father of Deaf Education in Africa \u2014 brought into the continent.\n\nHe would go on to found West Africa\u2019s first School for the Deaf in Ghana and Nigeria\u2019s first, the Ibadan Mission School for the Deaf, in Ibadan, Oyo State.\n\nHowever, many African countries like Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Mali have created their own sign languages. Nigeria does have a sign language, but it is not officially recognised and as widely used as the ASL.\n\nInterestingly, there are currently over 300 recognised variations of sign language.\n\nOne thing I noticed is how accommodating and welcoming members of the community are. A fact which Seun Dosunmu, a disability inclusion advocate, echoes when he says, \u201cThe deaf community, the deaf persons majorly, are very accommodating and always willing to engage and participate in activities, especially when they are invited.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, they face a lot of stigmatisation and rarely is provision made for their inclusion.\n\n\u201cMany people do not consider inclusion, so they don\u2019t make interpreters available. And this is the major reason why there is a gap, and there is marginalisation as we have it.\u201d\n\nA tale of signs and inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor\n\nMary\u2019s parents believe her hearing issues stem from a spiritual problem and take her for deliverance sessions, hoping to drive away the demon of deafness.\n\nThis is very common in the African setting, where many people view deaf people as sick, retarded, or demon-possessed.\n\nAs Treasures Uchegbu, Convener and CEO SpeakingFingers, says while talking about the challenges deaf people face, \u201cCommunication/Information, attitudinal (words and behaviours) barriers which I refer to as the cancer of all challenges \u2014 referring to the deaf as dumb. Then that one about putting a leaf in the mouth which could be perceived as calling them goats.\n\n\u201cOr an average primary four child whom I asked \u2018Who are the users of sign language?\u2019 In response, he said, \u2018mumu people!!!\u2019 I\u2019m sure he got that from his immediate environment. So I ask if this young boy grows into a policymaker, will he make policies to cover \u2018mumu people?\u2019 Of course not.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, the Nigerian Federal Government passed the Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities (Prohibition) Act into law. The Act established the National Commission of Persons with Disabilities and includes several provisions such as accessibility aids in public places and better inclusion of the disabled in workplaces, among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman\n\nHowever, the curve is pretty steep. According to a 2018 study by Emmanuel Ihenchi Asonye and two others, about 23% of Nigeria\u2019s population are deaf people. Most of that number live below the poverty line, with little to no access to healthcare, education, and employment.\n\nAnd as Douglas Izuchukwu, President of the National Association of Deaf Students, says, \u201cthe biggest challenge, communication barrier.\u201d\n\nDosunmu recalls having to intervene in the case of a deaf person who had been living with tuberculosis for a while. After taking him to a specialist hospital, they faced another challenge, none of the doctors or nurses understood sign language, and there was no interpreter.\n\nThis inability to communicate is a common occurrence, leading to either an untreated patient or a wrong diagnosis. Thankfully, they were able to get an interpreter in time.\n\nIn so many ways, the capacity to communicate is hindered, and a lot of the time, privacy is compromised on the hill of interpretation.\n\nFor the hearing community, technology enhances communication. Social media networks like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and Discord serve to bring people together.\n\nA lot of this tech is mainly geared towards what the hearing community needs, with little to no thought, if any, for the needs of deaf people. Some, like the live-audio craze which began with Clubhouse, do not even have any provisions for them.\n\nBut, in some ways, technology is trying to bridge the communication gap.\n\nCommunicating in a tech-enabled world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRights\n\nAccording to Izuchukwu, \u201cTechnology is now doing well, trying. On YouTube, we have automatic captions, time to control the captions, and time to control how the speakers speak. That is what technology is doing. And again, Google Meet too has automatic captioning.\u201d\n\nBut he wants technology to do more.\n\n\u201cFor example, on WhatsApp, when someone sends voice notes, there should be a place on WhatsApp where one can click to turn on automatic captions, for deaf people to read and benefit. Same way it is on YouTube, I wish WhatsApp too has the feature. And the feature applies to other applications like Zoom and others.\u201d\n\nIzuchuwku, speaking from the perspective of a deaf person, really just wants inclusion.\n\nAnd technology has already done so much.\n\n1. The use of social media to spread awareness and advocate for more inclusion.\n\n2. Assistive technology like Speech-to-Text, which helps translation from spoken words into text.\n\n3. Hearing aids and cochlear implants, which enable deaf or hard of hearing people retain some part of all parts of their hearing ability.\n\n4. Mobile apps that provide sign language tutoring for beginners, such as the ASL American Sign Language and the Ghanian Sign Language app.\n\n5. Automatic captions on YouTube and Google Meet, which use artificial intelligence to automatically transmit what is being said during webinars or in online videos.\n\nThere have also been technology mishaps, such as the sign language hand glove that translates sign language into words. The deaf community believed it to be more accommodating of the hearing community without regard to the deaf people \u2014 who it was purporting to help.\n\nAlso, assistive technology like Speech-to-Text and automatic captioning have limits as they do not always provide an accurate translation, which is doubly worse in the African scenario.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown, Funmi Ogunro, Head of School, Friends of the Deaf Academy, says they had to move the school online, using WhatsApp and Facebook groups. Eventually, they received support from Gradely, a personalised e-learning platform for 300 students.\n\nDosunmu suggests that more people learn sign language or at the very least make more interpreters available in public places such as banks, hospitals, courts, etc. Some apps help people learn sign language on both Android and iOS stores. Although, there seems to be a dearth of Nigerian made or focused apps.\n\nHowever, despite technological advancements, deaf people still face discrimination and exclusion, especially regarding information. Dosunmu says that most deaf persons have little to no access to computers and do not even have smartphones. How then do they access the technology?\n\nInternational Day of Sign Language\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sign for human rights\n\nThe International Day of Sign Languages is observed annually on September 23 as part of the International Week of Deaf People.\n\nThis year, the World Federation of the Deaf has given daily themes for the Week \u2014 Monday, September 20 to Sunday, September 26.\n\nMonday: Cherishing Deaf History\n\nTuesday: Sustainable Deaf Leadership\n\nWednesday: Sign Languages for All Deaf Learners\n\nThursday: We Sign For Human Rights\n\nFriday: Intersectional Deaf Communities\n\nSaturday: Deaf Culture and Arts\n\nSunday: Human Rights in Times of Crisis\n\nEach theme represents an important topic in the deaf community, with inclusion as the central theme.\n\nBeyond their disabilities, deaf people are human beings who have rights \u2014 the right to fair treatment, employment, and the right to inclusion.\n\nWhat\u2019s common to Ludwig van Beethoven, Helen Keller, Thomas Edison, and Andrew Foster.\n\nDeafness and partial or complete hearing loss. But there\u2019s more. Despite their disability, considered a hindrance by many, they accomplished remarkable things.\n\nAnd Opeoluwa Sotonwa \u2014 a deaf Nigerian American attorney, disability rights advocate, and literary writer \u2014 has borrowed a leaf from these greats.\n\nBeing deaf is not a curse. The deaf should not be segregated. They shouldn\u2019t be made to feel stupid or unworthy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Speaking Fingers Network\n\nNGOs like Friends of the Deaf Foundation, Collaboration of Deaf and Hearing Adults (CODAH) Enterprise, and Speaking Fingers Network provide helpful resources like free hearing aids, including persons with disabilities in their programmes, build inclusive private schools, and provide life skills to support learning and development.\n\nHowever, in the search for inclusion, we all have a part to play. Among other things, we can design sign language learning apps, inclusive audio/video with subtitling and automatic captioning. It can, and should, be done.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Why benefits of rising oil prices keep eluding Nigeria",
          "text": "Nigeria is struggling to swing the current rally in oil prices in its favour due to the inability to attract investments for active exploration and perennial operational issues that have curbed production.\n\nIf oil prices remain bullish, as they currently are with Brent crude trading above $76 per barrel, the government earns more money and can fulfil its financial obligations.\n\nWhen it earns less, as it did last year when crude prices bottomed out, its financial capacity shrinks, sending the economy, which is reasonably dependent on government spending, to tailspin.\n\nBut the dynamics of oil is much deeper. Nigeria\u2019s crude oil production has been languishing at only two-thirds of its full capacity this year, especially many of its large oil fields in the Niger Delta.\n\nKey Nigerian grade, Forcados, had been disrupted for almost a month until Shell lifted the force majeure on loadings September 10. Industry sources say the suspension of exports was due to an oil spill near the Forcados terminal.\n\nOther Nigerian crudes such as Bonny Light, Escravos, and Qua Iboe have also faced production issues in recent months due to operational and technical reasons.\n\nThese developments have exposed the sorry state of Nigeria\u2019s oil industry, and the government\u2019s ability to use the sector as an engine to supply new jobs for Nigerians and improve the social and living standards of its over 200 million population, just like other petrol-dollar economies.\n\nDolapo Oni, an international oil and gas expert familiar with Nigeria\u2019s petroleum industry, says Nigeria\u2019s top 10 oil fields over the last decade have shed over 25 percent of output.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria fails to meet OPEC quota as oil price soars near $76 a barrel\n\n\u201cThese top oil fields were mostly replaced with many smaller oilfields, which were not fully optimised, therefore not sustainable,\u201d according to Oni.\n\nIndustry data have also revealed Nigeria\u2019s crude oil reserves declined by about 600 million barrels on the back of reduced investment in the last few years.\n\nInformation from the British Petroleum (BP) Statistical Review, 2021, indicated that between 2017 and 2020, Nigeria\u2019s reserves did not grow, but rather fell from 37.5 billion barrels to 36.9 billion barrels in 2020.\n\n\u201cWhen was the last time a 100kbd field came online in Nigeria?\u201d Oni asks.\n\nAccording to data from Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Nigeria self-reported crude output of 1.27 million bpd in August, down from 1.44 million bpd in July.\n\n\u201cThe sad twist to our above-ground issues is that we\u2019re likely to see $100 oil again soon and we might not enjoy it as much as if we had our 2.4 million bpd back,\u201d Oni says.\n\nAnalysts at multi-asset investment management firm Cardinal Stone say the oil sector weakness reflected lower oil production due to OPEC+ supply restrictions, depressed drilling activities and pipeline downtimes during the period.\n\n\u201cThroughout 2021, we\u2019ve struggled to achieve less than 1.3 million bpd, which is abysmal for a country depending on crude oil revenues to feed over 200 million people,\u201d Kelvin Atafiri who runs Cavazanni Human Capital Limited, an investment firm exposed to the oil and gas sector, states.\n\nTimipre Sylva, Nigeria\u2019s minister of state for petroleum resources, also admitted Nigeria\u2019s oil fields were struggling. He however claimed that this were due to technical problems from re-tapping reservoirs that had been shuttered to comply with the stringent OPEC+ cuts of the past 17 months.\n\n\u201cWe had some issues from shutting down the reservoirs,\u201d he told SPglobal, and \u201cwhen you shut down a reservoir, to restart it, sometimes there are challenges.\u201d\n\nHe noted that output could rebound to around 1.7 million bpd by November and 2 million bpd by the end of the year.\n\nThe minister told journalists on the side-lines of the Gastech 2021 conference in Dubai that Nigeria had requested a higher production quota under the OPEC+ accord, claiming that technical problems that had hampered its output would soon be resolved.\n\nBut rhetoric alone won\u2019t cut it. Most industry experts say Nigeria needs more proactive actions to fix technical or maintenance issues obstructing some of Nigeria\u2019s biggest oil fields from producing above normal levels.\n\nOther stakeholders say the passage of the new Petroleum Industry Act, which commercialises the operations of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), could provide an easier path to unlocking private capital that could have a positive effect on Nigeria\u2019s oil GDP.\n\nBut global rating agency, Fitch Ratings, says the impact of the newly signed Act will depend on details of implementation, and \u201cthe bill is unlikely to have a significant near- to medium-term impact on Nigeria\u2019s creditworthiness\u201d.\n\nFitch adds, \u201cWe expect the PIA could boost oil-sector investment, helping to stabilise the sector, which has long suffered from underinvestment, and potentially reverse the downward trend in oil production.\u201d\n\nWith public revenues at dangerously low levels and lower production output, stakeholders say the Federal Government must overcome its inertia, safeguard critical infrastructure, and pull out of the downstream oil sector to concentrate on its security and regulatory roles.",

          "title": "Nigerian banks increasingly tap CBN for cash as liquidity shrinks",
          "text": "Banks\u2019 borrowings from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) have jumped by more than three folds in the last six years as the lenders\u2019 ability to meet liquidity obligations shrinks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s deposit money banks borrowed N2.3 trillion from the apex bank\u2019s Standing Lending Facility (SLF), a line of short-term credit available for commercial banks, in April 2021. This is a 737 percent increase when compared with the N274.65 billion reported in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\n\u201cActivities at the standing facility windows showed predominance of the lending window over the deposit window due to tight liquidity in the banking system,\u201d the apex noted in its monthly economic report.\n\nYear-on-year, analysis of the CBN\u2019s report for April revealed that the amount the banks borrowed in the fourth month of 2021 was the highest since the CBN started publishing the data in 2015.\n\n\u201cBanks have to cover their positions to cover any gap left by the CRR debits,\u201d Ayo Ebo, senior economist/head, Research and Strategy, Greenwich Merchant Bank, said, linking the increase in banks\u2019 borrowings to the \u201cfrequent CRR debits by the CBN in recent times.\u201d\n\nIn a quest to moderate inflation amid efforts to maintain a stable exchange rate, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBN increased cash reserve requirement (CRR) to 27.5 percent for both merchant and commercial banks in January 2020. The standardised CRR was implemented alongside discretionary deductions.\n\nRead Also: CBN reiterates resilience, soundness of Nigerian banks\n\nBanks have had to suffer severe liquidity constraints in 2021 as CBN\u2019s mop-up activities via CRR debits that have weighed on financial system liquidity, a research analyst at United Capital, Ayorinde Akinloye, said.\n\n\u201cIn addition, Federal Government\u2019s borrowing activities have been fairly aggressive with the sovereign debt managers typically overselling debt instrument auctions, leaving a net deficit impact on system liquidity,\u201d Akinloye said.\n\nThe Lagos-based analyst believes the aforementioned forced banks to heavily rely on CBN\u2019s Standing Lending Facility window as they are able to borrow at accommodative interest rates to ease liquidity pressures.\n\nThe CRR is the amount the CBN debits from banks\u2019 accounts in compliance with its monetary policy objective of mandatorily keeping cash on behalf of banks. The amount is not available for banks to use.\n\nThe record-high cash reserve requirement of 27.5 percent by the CBN is cribbing the lenders\u2019 profitability, according to market analysts.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Nigeria has the highest reserve requirement in sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa, Kenya and Ghana all have CRR\u2019s of below 10 percent.\n\nAccording to Agusto & Co.\u2019s flagship 2021 Banking Industry Report, the industry\u2019s restricted cash reserves exceeded N9.5 trillion in 2020 and translated to an effective CRR of 37 percent.\n\n\u201cWe believe the elevated CRR level moderated the industry\u2019s performance and liquidity position during the year under review,\u201d research analysts at the Lagos-based credit rating agency said.\n\nExplaining how the CRR policy is affecting the banks\u2019 profitability, Agusto & Co. said the banks could have earned as much as N482 billion if the lenders had invested the cash they kept with CBN in a fixed income instrument.\n\n\u201cAssuming the sterile CRR was invested in treasury securities at 5 percent, N482 billion would have been added to the industry\u2019s profit before taxation. This would have increased the industry\u2019s return on average equity (ROE) by 11% to 31.6% in the financial year ended 31 December 2020.\u201d\n\nAmong other factors, the policy by the central bank that requires banks to keep the cash they could have used to grow their bottom line with the regulator may have also affected investors\u2019 appetite for the stocks of the Nigerian banks.\n\nA recent report by Bloomberg revealed that Nigerian banks were some of the cheapest stocks in Africa.\n\nFour of the five African stocks with the lowest price-earnings ratios among companies valued at $500 million or more are Nigerian lenders, data compiled by Bloomberg show: United Bank for Africa, Access Bank, FBN Holdings and Zenith Bank. Johannesburg-traded steelmaker, ArcelorMittal South Africa Limited completes the quintet.\n\nDespite the limited resources at the disposal of Nigerian deposit money banks, the lenders have continued to remain resilient as they reported a profit in the first half of 2021.\n\nNigeria\u2019s five tier-one banks, the country\u2019s biggest lenders, reported a combined 113.18 percent growth in their half-year profit to N371.1 billion in June 2021, from N174.08 billion in 2014.\n\nThe profit reported by the lenders in the first six months of this year is 5.12 percent higher when compared with the N353.02 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2020.\n\nThe performance was largely driven by a 15.4 percent increase in net interest income. The five lenders reported a net interest income of N757 billion in 2021, N101 billion more than the N656 billion reported in the corresponding period of 2020.",

Non supply of electricity has encouraged theft in the communities. At Asipa community, a shop was looted by thieves who took advantage of the darkness. This same problem had been reported in many areas in the local government.\n\n\u201cOur economic activities have been paralysed as people using electricity to do their daily works find it very difficult to transact their businesses and this need urgent attention so that the society will not become desolate. Ife-North has been known for peace but this absence of light has made it to be a lawless society where different people just come into the Local Government unchallenged at night. Our System Government and the IBEDC must make sure that positive step is taken before things go out of hands.\n\n\u201cPeople who deal in frozen food are suffering because there is no electricity to freeze their food and many of them have turned to debtors due to the damage of their wares like fish, turkey and meat of all kinds. Artisans like welders, hair dressers, electricians and all sorts of trades are suffering because if lack of electricity supply.\n\n\u201cWe have written several letters to the State Governor and the IBEDC, even to their main office in Ibadan but nothing has been done. We are imploring people in authority and Nigerian Government to stand up and assist us so that we won\u2019t continue to suffer,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, students of tertiary institutions and secondary schools, came out with banners of various inscriptions such as \u201cGovernor Oyetola, Come To Our Aid,\u201d \u201cIBEDC is Paralysing Our Economy in Ife North,\u201d \u201cWe Say No To Darkness,\u201d \u201cIBEDC, Bring Back Our Light,\u201d among others.\n\nThe students, led by Aduragbemi Ogunlola, urged the IBEDC to take urgent steps at restoring the electricity before it lead to mass mobilization for protest.",

          "text": "By Okey Onyenweaku\n\nAce banker and Group Managing Director of FBN Holdings, Urum Kalu Eke (UK Eke), has emerged winner of the prestigious Zik Prize in Professional Leadership Award for the year 2020 in recognition of his strides in the banking industry.\n\nAnnouncing the choice of Eke for the award at a virtual press conference yesterday, Prof Pat Utomi, chairman of the selection committee and member of the Board of Public Policy Research and Analysis Centre (PPRAC), organisers of the award scheme, said he was after a rigorous review process by the board.\n\nUtomi described Eke as a consummate Banker with close to 4 decades experience in Financial Services, Audit and Capital Market operations across various financial institutions, who is credited with helping develop First Bank businesses within the Public Sector, Retail and Private Banking Groups.\n\n\u201cHe is being celebrated for his unblemished record of service and enormous contributions to the development and growth of the African Financial services industry,\u201d he said.\n\nAn honour to whom it is due\n\nUtomi said Eke, 56, who has had nearly four decades in the banking industry, and continues to make tremendous impact, especially in his capacity as Managing Director of FBN Holdings, where he has led the institution on the part of profitability, is one of Africa\u2019s finest bankers whose records speak for \u201cso eloquently.\u201d\n\nUtomi\u2019s views are shared by many industry players who told Business Hallmark that the honour to banker is most deserving.\n\n\u201cIt is a very good choice and an honour well deserved. It is a recognition of professional excellence,\u201d said Mazi Okechukwu Unaegbu, author and former president of Chattered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cU. K Eke has done well as a banker. And as GMD of FBN Holding\u2019s, he has made his mark. Those who made the choice did a very good job. Rather than look for politicians who carry money about, they decided to honour someone who has contributed meaningfully to the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. David Adonri, Chief Executive Officer of Highcap Securities, no one else could have been more worthy of such recognition.\n\n\u201cUK Ekeh has done well. I remember at the time he took office, the bank faced very serious challenges, principal of which was the position of the non-performing loan which had set the bank on the part of losses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs there were statutory provisions that had to be made, the losses that accompanied this were such that the bank could not pay dividends. In fact, within that season, the dividends that the FirstBankGroup was barely able to pay to shareholders were not coming from the bank but the subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cIt is to his credit that he has been able to complete the management of those provisions for the bad loans exposure due to the overexposure of the bank to, most notably the petroleum industry. He has successfully written off those bad debts.\u201d\n\nEke who spent about 19 years in the defunct Diamond Bank Plc where he rose to the position of Executive Director, seeing to the bank\u2019s rapid growth to emerge one of the leading banks in the country within the period, eventually left for First Bank to serve as Executive Director, Public Sector, South before moving up to become the Group Managing Director, FBN Holdings Plc in January 2016.\n\nAt FBN Holdings, he has continued to prove his mettle. While the holding company had ended 2015 with gross earnings of N503 billion, it moved to N583.006billion in 2016, his first year as MD.\n\nGoing further, it was N598.184billion in 2017, and by 2018, it was N587.406billion and then N590.4 in 2019. In 2020, however, the impact of the pandemic caused a marginal 1.9 percent drop in the earnings to N579.4 billion.\n\nIn terms of profit, Eke\u2019s reign has also coincided with a period of rapid growth. FBN Holdings profit grew from N12.24billion in 2016 to N37.7billion in 2017, N58.23billion in 2018, N73.66billion in 2019 and N89.7 billion in 2020.",

          "text": "By OBINNA NWACHI\n\nThe job of managing the image and reputation of a company that many love to hate and others hate to love is no mean task. Very often, one leaves the job inheriting the \u2018enemies\u2019 of the company as personal enemies. Very rarely does one leave the job in a gale of accolades as Dr. Kennie Obateru is doing today from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) upon clocking the statutory retirement age of 60.\n\nObateru assumed office as the Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division of NNPC in March 2020 at a time when various countries across the world, including Nigeria, were going into lockdown to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. He quickly retooled the Division to be able to promptly respond to the challenges of the time. This saw the robust engagement of the Corporation\u2019s publics with the Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, leading the charge in clarifying the issues around production cuts, decline in crude oil sales and efforts to shore up revenues for the nation.\n\nApart from ensuring the vigorous implementation of the corporation\u2019s Transparency, Accountability and Performance Excellence (TAPE) through timely communication of NNPC\u2019s operations and activities, Obateru maintained an open-door policy which ensured prompt handling of all enquiries. This obviously resulted in a near-zero bad press for the NNPC in the one and half years he held sway as the chief reputation manager.\n\nSpeaking on Obateru\u2019s style and professionalism, the Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, stated that he owed the very cordial relationship his agency enjoys with NNPC to Obateru\u2019s engaging human relations skills. \u201cIt is with mixed feelings I learnt about Kennie\u2019s retirement. Kennie Obateru is a very tall man, taller in ideas but tallest in competence and integrity. He\u2019s a man of details, learns lessons from opportunities and from the ups and downs of life. We had a smooth working relationship with the NNPC during his tenure and it was all due to his style,\u201d he declared.\n\nStakeholders from across all sectors of the oil and gas industry who had the good fortune to encounter him in his long career that spanned 29 years across various subsidiaries and the Corporate Headquarters of the Corporation are all agreed about Obateru\u2019s excellent human relations skills. One of such is Sopuruchi Onwuka, the publisher of Oracle News who traced his first encounter with Obateru to his days at the Manager, Public Affairs Department, Port Harcourt Refining Company (PHRC), Port Harcourt, Rivers State. He described Obateru as a thoroughbred public relations professional and a perfect relationship manager who succeeded in getting the public to see NNPC through him.\n\n\u201cHe is down to earth in his dealing with people. He is polite and urbane. He doesn\u2019t talk down on you or force you to accept his point of view, he wins you over. Another thing I find particularly fascinating about Dr. Obateru is his ability to listen patiently and respond to issues no matter how busy he is. If his busy schedule makes it difficult to take your call and respond to your questions immediately, he will send a text message that he will get back to you, and he returns with answers,\u201d Onwuka stated.\n\nFrom colleagues and media practitioners who had to deal with daily in the course of his job, none could think of anything negative to say about Obateru as a person or his style as a reputation manager. A veteran energy journalist, Mr Olusola Bello, who related with him closely for years in the course of his job described Obateru thus: \u201cHe is a very competent public relations man, he knows his job. He is very accessible and always reaching out. In fact he has a way of drawing people close and taking them into confidence about developments in the industry. This style made it difficult for a lot of us to do stories that could impact on NNPC and its subsidiaries negatively because it would make you feel guilty that you are betraying your source\u201d.\n\nBello\u2019s submission holds the secret to the general positive reportage NNPC enjoyed throughout Obateru\u2019s tenure as the corporation\u2019s spokesman, a job for which he came fully prepared by virtue of his vast experience within the NNPC and the oil industry. Before his appointment as the Group General Manger, Group Public Affairs of the NNPC in 2020, he was the General Manager, NNPC London Office.\n\nHe joined the services of the Corporation in 1992 as an experienced hire and since then has held several key and strategic positions in the Public Affairs Division.\n\nHe was Manager, Public Affairs of the National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS), a corporate service unit of the NNPC between 2010 and 2015.\n\nPrior to that, he was Manager, Public Affairs Department, Port Harcourt Refining Company (PHRC) between 2008 and 2010 and was Manager, Media Relations in the Group Public Affairs Division from 2007 to 2008.\n\nDr. Obateru was Deputy Manager, Media Relations in GPAD between 2006 and 2007, and served as a team member in Project PACE-SMS, CP Core Process Teams between 2005 and 2006.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2005, he served as Supervisor, Budget & Planning in GPAD. He also doubled as Supervisor, Audio Visual, between 2000 and 2001. His versatility was brought to bear on the print side of the corporate communication business when he diligently served as Editor, NNPC News, a monthly publication of the Group Public Affairs Division from 1998 to 2000.\n\nBetween1993 and1998, Dr. Obateru was the Protocol Officer to the then Honourable Minister of Petroleum Resources. He cut his teeth in the Corporation as a Protocol and Consular Officer between 1992 and1993.\n\nHe is an alumnus of the Nigerian Institute of Journalism, Lagos; University of Ilorin and University of Stirling, Scotland, United Kingdom, where he obtained a Certificate in News Reporting, a B.A. (Hons) Performing Arts and an M.Sc. in Public Relations respectively.\n\nIn 2012, Obateru joined the doctoral club of eggheads when he was awarded a Doctorate Degree in Management (Honoris Causa) by the Commonwealth University, Belize.\n\nHe has attended numerous professional courses and conferences at home and abroad which included three (3) International Public Relations Association Conferences, five (5) World Petroleum Congresses (WPCs) and 15 OPEC Ministerial Conferences among others.\n\nDr. Obateru is a Fellow of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations, a Fellow of the Institute of Management Consultants, a member of the International Public Relations Association, a senior member of the Africa Public Relations Association as well as a member of the Nigeria Institute of Management.\n\nHis hobbies include Lawn Tennis, Table Tennis, reading and dancing. Dr. Obateru is happily married and his union is blessed with four children.\n\nDr. Obateru bows out after 29 years of meritorious service to the NNPC.\n\nObinna Nwachi, a public commentator and analyst, wrote in from Abuja.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

It involves a hole in the wall between the heart\u2019s lower chambers.\n\nPleading for assistance, Mrs Hannah Adekoya said she was referred to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, LASUTH, Ayike House. \u201cWhen I got to LASUTH, I was able to see a cardiologist. They gave me an appointment to come every three months.\n\n\u201cI used to go during the appointed time.\u201dLast month, they called and said the hole in my baby\u2019s heart could not be closed, that the baby is having VSD and that the hole is of moderate size. It can only be closed only through surgery. They told me the bill is N5 million.\u201d\n\nAnd with the option that the surgery could only be done at Babcock or abroad, Adekoya took her baby to Babcock to make enquiries.\n\n\u201cGetting there, we started all over; they did the echo test again and it still showed the same problem. Later they gave us the bill for the surgery, and that we have to do it within two months,\u201d lamented the mother.\n\n\u201cPlease I need Nigerians to assist me. I don\u2019t have a job.

          "text": "BENUE State Governor, Samuel Ortom has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of jettisoning the vision of the nation\u2019s founding fathers which was hinged on unity and oneness and instead is pursuing an ethnic agenda. Ortom said instead of bringing Nigeria together, the president had succeeded in dividing the country with intimidation and marginalization.\n\nThe governor, who said this yesterday in Enugu when he delivered a lecture at the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, organized by the NUJ Chapel titled \u2018Emerging Security Situation in the SouthEast: The Place of Good Governance,\u201d noted that Buhari has abused power by not giving equal appointments and recognizing federal character. He said he does not hate Buhari or the Fulani but must speak in the face of marginalisation, intimidation and selective injustice, pointing out that the constitution must be respected. Ortom said for Nigeria to move in the path of unity and oneness, the people of Eastern Nigeria should be provided with adequate infrastructure.\n\n\u201cEastern Nigeria deserves infrastructure and key appointments. Our founding fathers saw a vision of oneness and unity. \u201cThe present administration has instead employed intimidation. I, Ortom, will not keep quiet in the face of marginalisation,\u201d he said, adding that he wants peace anchored on justice to reign. Ortom said whereas former President Goodluck Jonathan never threatened or intimidated anybody, under President Buhari, intimidation of dissenting voices in a democracy has been the order of the day. He lamented that it was Buhari who pushed out Jonathan with intimidation that if he does not win in 2015 \u201cbaboons and monkeys will be soaked in blood.\n\n\u201cJonathan\u2019s government never intimidated anybody but today, never in the history of the country has Nigeria been divided as it is.\u201d Speaking on how bad things have degenerated under Buhari, Ortom said cost of goods and services had gone up to the extent that \u201cif nothing is done, a dollar will exchange for N1,000. Ortom, however, pleaded with Ndigbo not to destroy infrastructure in their place since what they are destroying belongs to them.",

          "text": "Exiled Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont has been detained in Italy on a Spanish arrest warrant.\n\nSpain has accused him of sedition for a breakaway independence referendum in 2017 that the courts ruled illegal.\n\nAt the time he was president of Catalonia but fled to Belgium after the vote. He lives there and sits as a member of the European Parliament.\n\nPolice were apparently waiting for him at Sardinia\u2019s Alghero airport and he is due in court in the coming hours.\n\nMr Puigdemont had travelled to the Mediterranean island for a Catalan folklore festival, his lawyer said.\n\nA judge in Sardinia will have to decide whether he should be released or extradited.\n\nThe 2017 referendum prompted Spain\u2019s deepest political crisis for decades, with the Catalan regional parliament declaring independence, and Madrid then imposing direct rule over the region.\n\nAfter Mr Puigdemont and two ministerial colleagues fled, Spain jailed nine other Catalan leaders for sedition for their role in the breakaway vote. They were pardoned by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez in June.\n\nMadrid failed in its court bid to extradite Mr Puigdemont and two ministerial colleagues and they were later elected to the European Parliament in 2019.\n\nAs MEP the Catalan ex-leader initially had immunity from prosecution but the Parliament voted to strip him of that last March. He appealed against the decision but in an initial ruling at the end of July the EU\u2019s general court said there was no immediate risk of arrest.\n\nThere are at least two question facing the Italian judiciary: the validity of the Spanish extradition request, and the powers of Italian judges when the case is yet to receive a ruling by the EU\u2019s top court.\n\nSpanish authorities say the European arrest warrant was \u201cnever deactivated\u201d. And Mr Puigdemont\u2019s lawyers say that no court within the EU can execute a European arrest warrant until a final ruling has been made.\n\nCatalonia\u2019s new president Pere Aragones \u2013 also a separatist \u2013 condemned what he called the \u201cpersecution\u201d of Mr Puigdemont.\n\nMr Puigdemont\u2019s arrest is uncomfortable for the Spanish government, says the BBC\u2019s Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid. The left-wing coalition in Madrid had just started engaging in talks with the Catalan government in an attempt to calm tensions and find a long-term solution to the crisis.\n\nThe Spanish government said in a statement: \u201cThe arrest of Mr Puigdemont corresponds to an ongoing judicial procedure that applies to any EU citizen who has to answer to the courts.\u201d\n\nHe should \u201csubmit to the action of justice like any other citizen\u201d, it added.\n\nCatalonia is one of Spain\u2019s richest, most distinctive regions and has enjoyed a high degree of autonomy. But many Catalans feel they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances too, in particular Catalonia\u2019s treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco.",

          "text": "The inequity of COVID-19 vaccine distribution came into sharper focus on Thursday as many leaders of African countries, whose populations have little to no access to the life-saving shots, stepped to the podium to speak at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nAlready, the struggle to contain the coronavirus pandemic has featured prominently in world leaders\u2019 speeches during the past few days \u2013 many of them delivered remotely because of the coronavirus itself. Country after country acknowledged the wide disparity in accessing the vaccine, painting a picture so bleak that a solution has at times seemed impossibly out of reach.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday pointed to vaccines as \u201cthe greatest defence that humanity has against the ravages of this pandemic\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, a great concern that the global community has not sustained the principles of solidarity and cooperation in securing equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is an indictment on humanity that more than 82 percent of the world\u2019s vaccine doses have been acquired by wealthy countries, while less than 1 percent has gone to low-income countries.\u201d\n\nHe and others urged UN member states to support a proposal to temporarily waive certain intellectual property rights established by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to allow more countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries, to produce COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nFor his part, Namibian President Hage Geingob slammed what he called \u201cvaccine apartheid\u201d, saying it was a pity that while people in some countries were at the stage of receiving booster jabs, people in other countries had yet to receive their first dose.\n\nThe United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Israel are among the countries that have begun administering boosters or announced plans to do so.\n\nAngola\u2019s President Joao Lourenco, meanwhile, said it was \u201cshocking to see the disparity between some nations and others with respect to availability of vaccines\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese disparities allow for third doses to be given, in some cases, while, in other cases, as in Africa, the vast majority of the population has not even received the first dose,\u201d Louren\u00e7o said.\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s President Emmerson Mnangagwa called on the international community to exercise \u201cenhanced multilateralism and a unity of purpose\u2019 in vaccine distribution.\n\n\u201cThe hording and inequitable distribution with the resultant uneven vaccination patterns across the globe is not acceptable,\u201d he said in a pre-recorded address.\n\n\u201cVaccine nationalism is self-defeating and contrary to the mantra that no one is safe until everyone is safe,\u201d added Mnangagwa.\n\nBenido Impouma, a programme director with the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) Africa programme, noted during a weekly video news conference that the surge in new COVID-19 cases is starting to ease in Africa \u201cbut with 108,000 new cases, more than 3,000 lives lost in the past week and 16 countries still in resurgence, this fight is far from over.\u201d\n\n\u201cFresh increases in cases should be expected in the coming months,\u201d Impouma said. \u201cWithout widespread vaccination and other public and social measures, the continent\u2019s fourth wave is likely to be the worst, the most brutal yet.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, during a global vaccination summit convened virtually on the sidelines of the General Assembly, President Joe Biden announced that the US would double to one billion doses its purchase of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 shots to share with the world, with the goal of vaccinating 70 percent of the global population within the next year.\n\nThe WHO has said only 15 percent of promised donations of vaccines \u2013 from rich countries that have access to large quantities of them \u2013 have been delivered.\n\nThe UN health agency has said it wants countries to fulfil their dose-sharing pledges \u201cimmediately\u201d and make shots available for programmes that benefit poor countries and Africa, in particular.\n\nBiden, earlier this year, broke with European allies to embrace waivers to intellectual property rights for the vaccines, but there was no movement on Wednesday towards the necessary global consensus on the issue required under WTO rules.\n\nWhile some non-governmental organisations have called those waivers vital to boosting global production of the shots, US officials concede it is not the most constricting factor in the inequitable vaccine distribution \u2013 and some have worried the waivers would mean little without the necessary production infrastructure to make the highly complex jabs.",

          "text": "Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele has called on Nigerians in the diaspora and other foreign investors to take advantage of the opportunities in the country.\n\nEmefiele insisted that despite the economic challenges, numerous investment opportunities with good returns abound in the country.\n\nThis is just as the Conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP) has disowned the call by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Emefiele\u2019s resignation.\n\nBut speaking at the US-Nigeria Investment Summit held in New York, on the sidelines of the ongoing United Nations General Assembly, Emefiele advised Nigerians in the diaspora to begin to consider investing in their nation.\n\n\u201cWhy am I here? I am here to convince those of you in the United States that it is time for us to begin to look back home. The opportunities are there. I know you would say: How do I access credit facilities? Sometimes you find that the difficulty in accessing credit may be a problem, but you can come and start from somewhere because of the numerous opportunities.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is that Nigeria is opening up and I can tell you that people all over the world are beginning to think of what they can do with Nigeria and not what they can do for Nigeria. We Nigerians must set examples by folding our sleeves and doing things for ourselves before we can expect others to support us. That is the word I have come with today, that we are determined to do it for ourselves,\u201d the CBN told his audience during his 36 minutes presentation.\n\nEmefiele pointed out that because of the desire to stimulate economic growth in the country, the country\u2019s economic managers recently went to the Presidency and advised the government to take some bold moves.\n\nHe listed some of the initiatives to include the ongoing repositioning of the Nigeria Commodity Exchange, the newly established Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria (InfraCo) and the upcoming Nigerian International Financial Centre (NIFC).\n\nHe explained: \u201cIn the agriculture sector, we found that the big problem we have is the movement of goods from farm to market. It is a logistics and transportation problem. We got approval from the Presidency to reposition the Nigeria Commodity Exchange which plays a pivotal role in the movement of goods from farm to market. Another important move is the creation of the Infraco. You all know that infrastructure has been a problem in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to set up a world class infrastructure to begin to see how to revamp Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure without placing a burden on the federal government. So, the question now is where do you (Nigerians in the diaspora) stand? We would like you to come join and work with us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe reiterated the resolve of the central bank not to allow cryptocurrency transactions in Nigeria\u2019s financial system, just as he expressed excitement about the central bank\u2019s digital currency, the e-Naira, which would be unveiled in few days\u2019 time.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, because of activities surrounding Nigeria\u2019s Independence celebration on October 1, the earlier planned launch of the e-Naira on same date would likely be rescheduled to October 4, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe central bank would not want the event to take the shine away from the Independence celebration,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be the first country in Africa to launch a digital currency. It is a novel idea because we think it will facilitate trade, Nigeria being the biggest country in Africa, this will set the tone to tell Africa that we are ready to lead and we would indeed lead in trade and we would make sure that happens. \u201cBetween all central bankers in ECOWAS, we are already working on certain collaboration to make trade, payment and banking system integrate in such a way to set example on the AfCFTA,\u201d he added.\n\nThe central bank governor was optimistic that all the aforementioned initiatives would likely stimulate economic growth, probably higher that population growth, promote prosperity and increase output growth.\n\nEarlier, Emefiele reviewed the performance of the Nigerian economy between 2015 and 2019, he cited the devastating impact of the COVID-19 on the economy and listed various measures adopted by the fiscal and monetary authorities to support households and firms.\n\n\u201cOf course, we took a number of countervailing measures because we felt that there was a very big part responsibility on the part of government, talking about the fiscal and monetary authorities.\n\n\u201cWe saw weakness on the part of the fiscal, because the fiscal space was very narrow; the deficit was narrow and space to release money to catalyse the economy on the fiscal side was very slim. So, the monetary policy thought there was a need from our side to see what could be done,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe reiterated that the 5.01 per cent GDP growth recorded in the second quarter of 2021 was due to the base year effect, pointing out that the base year effect would have dissipated when the third and fourth quarters GDP figures would have been announced.\n\nHe, however, predicted a 2.86 per cent GDP performance for 2021.\n\n\u201cWe feel that some of the things we have done are showing results and so we are going to push very aggressively,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nMeanwhile, the CNPP has disowned the call by the PDP for Emefiele\u2019s resignation.\n\nReacting in Abuja, the Secretary General of the CNPP, Chief Willie Ezeugwu, in a statement, noted that the CBN Governor had not done anything to warrant the call for his resignation hence PDP does not enjoy the support of other opposition political parties in this call.\n\nThe statement by the PDP was curious because nowhere in the interview by Senator John Udoedehe did the National Secretary of the APC National Caretaker Committee mention Emefiele.\n\nAccording to Ezeugwu, it should be more concerning to the PDP that its top and leading members had been resigning in large numbers, \u201cdue to the unattractive nature of the party on the watch of the current National Working Committee of the Party rather it is chasing shadows when its house is consumed by an inferno.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian opposition parties are currently supposed to be undergoing internal healing and rebuilding so as to be well positioned to take over power in 2023 but the activities of the Uche Secondus led PDP has reduced the politics of opposition to child\u2019s play and possibly being for hire to operators of BDCs who are fighting the Governor of CBN for the policy to stop sale of forex to the BDC\u2019s.\n\n\u201cPDP has become a shadow of itself and fast turning into a briefcase political party if the likes of Uche Secondus and Mr. Kola Ologbodion are left in the strategic offices they presently occupy in the party.\n\n\u201cThey should be shown the way out and not join hirelings to make misguided calls the basis of which are laughable, baseless and cannot be substantiated,\u201d it added.\n\nObinna Chima",

          "title": "Nigeria: Against Mood of the Nation, PDP Retains Chairmanship in South",
          "text": "As predicted by many and against the mood of the nation, the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), may have finally settled for its chairmanship to come from the South, paving way for a northern presidential candidate and dashing hope of those asking that the party fields a southerner to fly its presidential ticket.\n\nThursday night, at a long-winding meeting of its zoning committee, headed by the Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, the committee could not summon the courage to go with the mood of the nation. Instead, the party resolved to retain its chairmanship in the South of the country, ahead of its national convention slated for October 30 and 31, after majority\u2019s opinions supported the decision. What transpired in the committee meeting and ultimately, its outcome is seen as mission accomplished for norther members with presidential ambition.\n\nAlthough no official would speak on record about what transpired at the meeting, several, however, spoke on the condition of anonymity and confirmed the development.\n\nMindful of the sensitivity of the matter, the party leadership has also decided to delay the announcement of the outcome, using the period between now and next Thursday to calm frayed nerves and to also use the next few days to consult further as well as sell the majority opinion reached at yesterday\u2019s meeting to other members, who wanted the chairmanship to go to north.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the PDP was able to swing the idea, because a majority of those, who made up the committee were sympathetic to the aspirations of the northern presidential hopefuls, thus making the decision a lot easier for those in support of retaining the chairmanship in the south.\n\nA stakeholder, who pleaded anonymity and was opposed to the road being travelled by the PDP leadership, claimed that the eventual decision of the committee was not surprising, because they had simply worked to the answer, including through the composition of the zoning committee.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe outcome was not surprising, given that key members of the committee are either northern presidential candidates or are supporters of northern presidential candidates. They include the secretary and Aliyu Mohammed, who is a Saraki supporter; Muazu Aliyu Babangida, who supports Atiku openly; Ayodele Fayose, whose interest is not clear, but some believe he is eyeing the chairmanship; Sule Lamido, who is a candidate; Boni Haruna,who supports Atiku, Attahiru Bafarawa, and Baraje who support Saraki.\n\n\u201cThese members were nominated to please the said candidates, so, the outcome was supposed to be expected. Any talk that they are not zoning presidency to the region is a fallacy, because once you zone the chairmanship to the south, the presidency automatically goes to the north. That is the tradition. There is no way the chairman and the presidential candidates can come from same place.\u201d\n\nThe meeting had earlier run into a dilemma as there was an open division amongst members of the committee over the zoning of the office of the national chairman of the party, leading to the emergence of two different groups with different positions.\n\nNot surprisingly, however, while a group largely made up of northern members of the party preferred the south to produce the national chairman, some of their southern counterparts wanted a northerner to emerge the national chairman.\n\nUgwuanyi, after the meeting had clarified that his committee had no mandate to zone political offices such as the president or the vice President but strictly party offices.\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman of the PDP National Convention Organising Committee (NCOC) and Governor of Adamawa State, Ahmadu Fintiri, yesterday, hinted that over six thousand delegates were expected to elect new members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party at their October national convention.\n\nTHISDAY is reliably informed that at its meeting yesterday, attended by 25 northern members and 23 southerners, it was four regions against two, as all the northerners, THISDAY gathered, spoke in support of the chairmanship to be zoned to the South as well as maintain the status quo in terms of zoning of other NWC offices.\n\nThey were joined by seven South West members thereby reducing the votes of the southerners, who wanted the chairman to come from the North to 16 against the 32 that wanted the Status Quo to be maintained.\n\nThe South West leaders, who aligned with their northern members, because their zone was strongly bidding for the chairmanship, included a former deputy governor of Oyo State, Hon. Taofeek Arapaja; a former Minister of State for Federal Capital Territory, Chief (Mrs.) Jumoke Akinjide; former governor of Ekiti State, Mr. Ayo Fayose; a former Lagos PDP chairman, Hon. Deji Doherty; Senator Hosea Agboola, Senator Duro Faseyi and Hon. Rita Orji (from Lagos).\n\nIt was also decided that the party should suspend discussion on the issue of zoning of the presidential ticket as that was a bridge to be crossed when the time comes.\n\nTHISDAY gathered the chairman of the committee, Ugwuanyi, had allowed everybody two minutes each to speak and the majority spoke strongly in favour of retaining the status quo, a development said to be clear to all that a decision had been taken as far as the chairmanship of the party was concerned.\n\nInterestingly, the announcement of the decision of the Committee after the voting exercise was allegedly delayed deliberately till another meeting scheduled for Thursday September 30, 2021 in Abuja, for strategic reasons, including subduing likely tension as a result of the outcome and to secure the buy-in of others, who were unhappy.\n\nThe party leadership, THISDAY learnt, had decided to appeal to all members not to rock the boat as the decision over where to push the chairmanship was openly and transparently debated.\n\nThat, nonetheless, the adjournment, other sources claimed, was to allow for more consultations.\n\nThe meeting was attended by 47 out of the 48 members. The Southerners in attendance were 22 and the northerners were 25 members. While all the 25 northern members agreed that the national chairman should come from the south, their southern colleagues insisted that the national chairman must come from the north.\n\nA former Senate President and erstwhile Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, led the group that wanted the office of the national chairman zoned to the north.\n\nAnother source claimed it was agreed that whatever position there was before the meeting between the north and south should be retained but that the zones should decide what position would go where.\n\n\u201cThe office of the national chairman remains in the south, particularly, to the South West but remains subject to ratification, when we meet next Thursday September 30,\u201d a source said.\n\nThe two groups have emerged from within and outside the 48, originally 44 members, before four other members were added, bringing the committee membership to 48.\n\nThe first group, identified as the \u2018Maintain the Status Quo Group\u2019 wanted all the party offices to be retained in the geographical side to which they presently were. The second group called the \u2018Move Around Group\u2019 wanted all the posts presently in the South to be transferred to the North while the ones in the North should move southward.\n\nBy the calculation of the \u2018Maintain the Status Quo\u2019 group, the chairmanship of the party would be retained in the South while the National Secretary would move to the North. But the \u2018Move Around Group\u2019 wanted the next chairman of PDP to emerge from the North while the South produced the Secretary.\n\nAlso, while the \u2018Move Around Group\u2019 believed that zoning the chairmanship to the North would make the presidential ticket to be automatically zoned to the South, they insisted that the issue at hand was party position and whenever the party got to the point, where it had to nominate the presidential standard bearer, the matter would be resolved.\n\nThe \u2018Maintain the Status Quo\u2019 group held the opinion that the zoning committee should adopt the position of the Bala Mohammed Committee, which reviewed the performance of the party in the 2019 general election and declared that the presidential ticket of the party would be thrown open for aspirants from all the six zones.\n\nAnyim, who led the Move Around Group, had the support of some elements in the South-south and Southeast zones. The \u2018Maintain the Staus Quo Group, led by the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, had the buy-in of key leaders of the party across the Southwest, and the three zones in the North, making it four zones against the two of South-south and Southeast.\n\nAlso, a PDP governor from the North was said be supporting the former group, because he did not want a certain section of the North to produce the next President. But the Status Quo group enjoyed the support of another key governor from the South.\n\nThe \u2018Maintain the Status Quo\u2019 group has been anchoring its position on the fact that if the party did mass transposition from North to South and Vice versa in the zoning, then, it would defeat the argument that some members of the current NWC led by Uche Secondus were being removed from office, because of their performance in office. It was believed that a mass transposition system would make it obvious that the Secondus NWC was just a victim of politics.\n\n\u201cIf not for the issue of performance, which some leaders raised against the continuation of Secondus and his team, the members of the current NWC would have been eligible to seek second term. We are prevailing on them not to seek second term, because we believe they did not do well and that there is need for change of strategy, approach, injection of new hands and some energy, vigour and wisdom into the party. So, to make mass switch across geo-political divide will defeat the argument,\u201d the source said.\n\nAnother source, which condemned the \u2018Move Around Group\u2019 argued that, \u201cThis group consists of people, who want the presidential ticket zoned to their backyard. They are afraid of going across the country to canvass for votes and seek support that will give them a popular party mandate.\u201d\n\nUgwuanyi, while addressing newsmen after the closed-door meeting held at the Government House, Enugu, reiterated that, \u201cWe had a fruitful meeting and we adjourned to conclude next week,\u201d but earlier, he cleared the air that the committee had no mandate to zone political offices.\n\nHis words: \u201cOur Committee is strictly limited to the PDP National Executive Offices to be contested at the 2021 PDP National Convention scheduled for the end of October, 2021. We have no mandate to zone political offices such as President or Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Enugu governor maintained that the PDP remained the most credible platform to deliver good and accountable governance to Nigeria, adding that the work of the committee would contribute immensely \u201cin this deliberate search for National Officers of our Party that will help PDP achieve the lofty ideals and goals of our founding fathers.\u201d\n\nHe encouraged members of the committee to be frank, open and constructive in their proposals and debates, as well as exhibit consistency with the weight of their mandate.\n\n\u201cThe membership and leadership of this committee have been carefully selected as it is composed of very experienced, competent and eminent Nigerians, who are desirous of repositioning the PDP to play its role not just as the main opposition political party in Nigeria but to build a party that offers alternative policy proposals and hope to Nigerians that there is still light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Ugwuanyi said.\n\nMembers of the committee present at the meeting included the Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, who is the Deputy Chairman; the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mahdi Aliyu Mohammed, who serves as Secretary; former Presidents of the Senate, Senator Iyorchia Ayu and Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, and former Governors of Niger, Ekiti, Sokoto, Jigawa and Adamawa States, Dr. Muazu Aliyu Babangida, Ayodele Fayose, Attahiru Bafarawa, Sule Lamido, and Boni Haruna, respectively.\n\nAlso at the meeting were Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje, Kabiru Tanimu Turaki, Hon.

The chairman, the vice chairman and the secretaries are here. I\u2019ve given them directions. I\u2019ve given them a template as to what is expected of them and they will go back and adequately prepare and submit the report back to me in the next five days, after which the main committee will sit and approve.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, on the number of delegates expected, Fintiri said, \u201cWe are expecting over 6000 delegates by our new constitution and we\u2019re fully prepared for that. We\u2019re expecting everybody in every ward that is a delegate to attend the convention.\u201d\n\nSpeaking also on how far the party has gone in resolving the leadership crisis, the chairman of the convention committee explained that, \u201cWe are moving on, I\u2019m the chairman of the convention committee, you can see we are doing our work, and everybody is happy, everybody is participating. I don\u2019t seem to see any crisis in this party except the one that is coming from the journalist.\u201d\n\nThe convention had earlier inaugurated 15 various committees for the success of the convention, and amongst those named was a former Inspector General of Police, Solomon Arase as Chairman of Security committee; his deputy is a former Chief of Army Staff, Ishaya Bamayi.\n\nThe governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, was named chairman of the special committee.\n\nOther committee chairmen were Udom Emmanuel, Constitutional Amendment Committee; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Zoning Committee; Mohammed Bello Adoke, Screening Committee; Ike Ekweremadu, Screening Appeal Committee; and Ifeanyi Okowa, Accreditation Committee\n\nOther are Ahmadu Fintiri, Electoral (statutory) Committee; Godwin Obaseki, Publicity Committee; Bala Mohammed, Venue Committee; Mariya Waziri, Welfare & Entertainment Committee; Ibrahim Dankwambo, Transportation Committee; Darius Ishaku, Contact and Mobilisation Committee; Biodun Olujimi, Protocol Committee; Nuhu Zagbayi, Medical Committee; and Umaru Ibrahim Tsauri, Secretariat Committee\n\nThey were all expected to submit their report in five days time to the main convention committee.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",
