          "text": "Some Nigerians on social media have criticised the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on his medical trip to London as doctors\u2019 strike loom.\n\nBuhari\u2019s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, on Thursday disclosed that the President will on Friday proceed to London for \u201ca scheduled medical follow-up.\u201d\n\nHowever, Buhari leaves for London at a time of looming threats of industrial action from the National Association of Resident Doctors.\n\nNARD had on Thursday issued a fresh four-week ultimatum to the federal and state governments to address its demands including the payment of hazard allowances.\n\nTherefore, Buhari\u2019s scheduled medical follow-up has come with a lot of criticisms from Nigerians on Twitter.\n\nA tweep, @akinolaanthony4, wrote, \u201cMany Nigerians died because of the failed health care system, as they cannot travel abroad for treatments. They cannot even afford a dollar for their daily meals due to the level of poverty. This is a woefully failed government oiling Nigerians\u2019 heads with bad luck.\u201d\n\nAnother tweep @ dwaynecarterdon, referred to the President as a \u201cleader who does not patronize homemade (doctors) but forcing citizens to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t they bring the equipment into Nigeria, and the \u2018special\u2019 doctors fly in to see him? It will save taxpayers\u2019 money and also, the hospital can help other Nigerians with like ailments,\u201d @namdi95748363 suggested.\n\n@sasanni99 tweeted, \u201cYou all think these people care. During the campaign, they promised Nigerians London/American standard hospitals to save revenue. So do we even have Ghana standard now?\u201d\n\n@monnyx4 also tweeted, \u201cBuhari leaves for check up in the UK while health workers in his country are threatening to strike. I wonder the fate of the poor. Someone will come out and defend him for this irresponsible action, it\u2019s a pity\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat an irony! Clearly, no Nigerian doctor can treat Buhari,\u201d @imohrich exclaimed.",

          "text": "Gives reasons for non-implementation of Oronsaye Report\n\nBy Dirisu Yakubu\n\nDr Folasade Yemi-Esan (middle) Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, at the event\n\nPoor documentation and lack of understanding of procedures are some of the reasons for the delayed payment of death gratuities to next of kin of civil servants who died in active service, Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan said in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nDr Yemi-Esan who stated this at an event to mark the 2021 Nigeria Civil Service Week further noted that poor documentations make it almost impossible for insurance companies to pay death benefits, even when valid claims are made.\n\nThe Federal Government according to the Head of Service released over N2 billion last year for the payment of backlog of death benefits, noting that as a result, 594 beneficiaries have been paid.\n\nShe said: \u201cIf the documentation is not complete, insurance companies do not pay premiums. The insurance companies will not touch it. The letter of attestation is very important and in most cases, the next of kin don\u2019t know where to start from.\n\n\u201cFollowing the release of N2.5billion to pay back log of death benefits to the next of kin of deceased officers, as at today, the sum of N2, 468, 094,063.08 has been expended to settle 594 beneficiaries. The balance will be paid to other beneficiaries once the Office receives the requisite banks\u2019 attestation.\u201d\n\nThe Head of Service also chided desk heads in Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs, most of whom she said, lack sufficient knowledge of what is expected of them in the processing of death benefit claims.\n\n\u201cThis office does not receive letters from the families of the dead. It is the institution that writes to the Office of the Head of the Civil Service. Even the pension desk office in the MDAs do not understand the process but we are determine on bringing the desk heads together so that we can educate them. We want to get things done properly,\u201d she assured.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the far-reaching recommendations by the Steve Oronsaye Report of 2011, Dr. Yemi-Esan was asked what had become of the report, to which she responded thus:\n\n\u201cThe Steve Oronsaye committee was a Presidential Committee domiciled at the Head of Service. It was not a committee set up by Office of the Head of Service as some people are tempted to believe.\n\n\u201cI met with the Secretary to the Government of the Federation recently and truth is the Oronsaye Report is now outdated. It was put in place ten years ago and between then and now, a lot has happened.\n\n\u201cYes, MDAs need to be rationalised and the SGF will inaugurate two committees. One of the committee will look at the Oronsaye Report and the other one will look at what happened after the report. We will then harmonised and move on,\u201d she added.\n\nIn 2011, the then President Goodluck Jonathan set up the Presidential Committee on Restructuring and Rationalisation of federal government parastatals, commissions and agencies, with Steve Oronsaye as the chairman.\n\nThe committee went to recommend among others, the scrapping of some MDAs and the merger of some to free funds for the execution of capital projects by the federal government.\n\nIn terms of capacity training of federal civil servants, Dr Yemi-Esan said \u201ca total of 1,751 Officers on Salary Grade Levels 7-10 have been inducted from 2019 till date at the Public Service Institute of Nigeria, PSIN. We are currently strategizing to develop a virtual platform to fast track the training of backlog of officers,\u201d adding that under the Structured Mandatory Assessment-Based Training Programme, SMAT-P, \u201c1,546 officers have been trained between 2019 to date, including 159 officers trained by virtual means in March 2021. We are currently assessing the level of infrastructure at the MDAs level in order to facilitate the roll-out of the second phase of the virtual training.\n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s celebration is \u201cBuilding the Africa we want through embracing an African culture that underpins purpose-driven leadership in the face of crisis.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Hope family and work are fine?\u201d My guy later updated me on a global digital marketing and digital publishing company he has been busy building from the US.\n\n\u201cAlhamdulilah sir, we now want to strengthen our base in Nigeria, as we did in Philipines. And we\u2019d be glad to have you as our Consultant Country Director really.\n\nJust that we don\u2019t know how much you\u2019d want to bill us\u201d. Overexcited, yet taciturn, I started thanking Allah for His favours on the young man. Next, were flashes of expectations from a super-positive signal from God\u2019s own country, as you can guess. This my former student had smartly sold the lofty credentials of yours sincerely, to his fellow directors, as one of the pioneer teachers of Online Journalism in Sub-Saharan Africa, he later told me. At our maiden online meeting, he added: \u201cDr Akanni is also one the few journalism professors who still do regular media writing. Just do a Google search\u201d\n\nThe following week Abiodun Alade, who, by any known parameter, has also done fairly well and still holding a lot of promise, reinforced the pleasant commemoration kickstarted from the US. Until recently, when Alade was redeployed to Lagos as a regional editor by his employers, Media Trust, Alade had held the ace as the online editor of Daily Trust.\n\nPrior to that, the gangling, newly married young man had been online editor of Vanguard newspaper. These commanding operational positions Alade had held, have delighted me most immeasurably. Now that Alade is based in Lagos, he couldn\u2019t fathom not paying me a visit of appreciation. And it also happened in the second week of the month of my 20th year at LASU. Alade\u2019s visit wasn\u2019t done with empty hand. He brought me a teetotaler\u2019s wine to relish. That did the magical opening of the door for yet another flood of seamless congratulatory gestures.\n\nApart from those from fellow Linkedin \u2018citizens,\u2019 I have been particularly excited by the kind words of those I may call accidental mentees. One set of such mentees accrued to me as a consultant to a media reporting project of the African Resilience Network, ARN, of the US based Institute of War and Peace Reporting. My pan-Nigerian mentees on this project, six in all, comprised four males and two females and were all fantastic.\n\nThe mentorship duration was one exciting stretch of fun time. It afforded me the opportunity to share some bits of knowledge in a most informal way. I reckoned with these mentees as friends and colleagues\n\nOne of them had volunteered to work on how conflict had undermined people\u2019s compliance with COVID-19 protocols.\n\nHis site of focus was the recently bloody Ibarapa axis of Oyo State. The sponsors had anticipated a conflict-sensitive report. He was ready to do this and looked anxiously up to me for further guidance. I asked my mentee if he had read any of my recent opinion articles. No. Pronto, I reached for my article titled \u201cIbarapa Crisis in the Face of Media Abundance.\u201d \u201cAh, oga, I love this!,\u201d he later returned to massage my ego. That article was my own expert advisory to all stakeholders especially the authorities in Ibadan on what they should do once there\u2019s a troublous situation such as Igangan in Ibarapa area of Oyo State presented.\n\nMore importantly in this context, it availed this particular mentee of mine a veritable model. But conflict sensitivity was not all that they could learn from me. I went further to share with them assorted wits and secrets of free flowing prose learnt over the years. One of these is the ingenious literary discipline, though difficult, of avoiding colons in headlines or titles. \u201cReally?\u201d one of them queried with disbelief. After offering a convincing explanation, I then offered the examples of my last ten newspaper articles which could be easily accessed online. To register an enduring impact on my mentees on the ARN project, I tracked all changes on the copies I edited to enable them appreciate the dissimilarities between their submissions and what I returned to them.\n\nI had a similar mentoring experience at the instance of the Environmental Rights Action, ERA, a few years back. The bond between me and my ERA-supported mentees remains very strong and cordial. I have even had to recommend some of them for higher opportunities including postgraduate fellowships in Europe , United States and other parts of the world.\n\nAn enduring learner-instructor relationship isn\u2019t automatic.\n\nThe instructor or coach must have been convincing enough and always willing to politely respond to queries and to also tolerate comments, no matter how critical or harshly expressed. Relationships can always smoothen up with better appreciation from the two sides. There had been several cases of teachers grossly misunderstood by students initially, only to become their favorites in due course with increased maturity and perhaps better contextualization by either of the parties.\n\nThe opportunity to be a mentor isn\u2019t open to only teachers. Experienced professionals across sectors can attain the enviable status. Decades of professional practices endear bosses to their self-motivated subordinates, such that bosses become subjects of study leading to replication of details of their traits including mimicry as may possibly manifest in speaking manners and other visible conduct.\n\nFor me, virtually all the schools I have attended around the world have availed me with male and female mentors. I haven\u2019t found all my contemporaries at my previous and current workplaces any less resourceful. Across my journalism, and teaching careers for instance, distinguished playwright, public intellectual and former president of the National Academy of Letters, NAL, Olu Obafemi, who recently retired as a professor at the University of Ilorin, has registered the boldest imprint on me.\n\nAt a time the University of Ibadan and the then University of Ife were homes to the most visible public intellectuals and literary icons, Obafemi hoisted the flag of public intellectualism at Ilorin to my ecstatic admiration.\n\n\u201cNa only Ife and Ibadan students go dey tap from these media idols ni?,\u201d I often soliloquized. The thought had agitated my mind as a potential undergraduate. Apart from regularly contributing to The Guardian Literary Series of those days, ran by the peerless arts editor, Ben Tomoloju, Obafemi later made me have a better appreciation of the aphorism, \u201cnot how far but how well.\u201d He never believed in running a class for two full hours yet he never shortchanged us. Such was the love I had for my beloved supervisor (nicknamed by \u2018rascals\u2019 he taught after us as Antigone) that I could not imagine not being assigned to him for my long essay supervision. The guidance he availed me remains permanently fresh. \u201cYoung man, not being a woman, you are even free to see me at home\u201d he offered.\n\nMy career in journalism, bedrock of my performance as a development worker and an academic, has benefitted indescribably from the duo of veterans Najeem Jimoh and Liad Tella. Jimoh availed me the opportunity to cut my teeth in the practice but my career at The Punch was rather short. Even at that, my attachment to a most inspiring, ubiquitous \u201cStrato\u201d (short form of strategist) has however been lifelong.\n\nFormer students leader and one of the best editors The Punch ever had, Najeem Jimoh, is an extremely transparent human being you will love to relate with, on all matters. Tella, on the other hand, continues to be a beacon of professional guide and support along my career paths. Tella continues to endear himself to me as a most urbane (unlike ara Ibadan, apologies to Mummy Tella), supportive daddy with the never-ending mother-hen disposition to all his boys. Twice he got appointed to serve Hajj administering bodies, twice Tella integrated me as a volunteer for the most invaluable journeys in the life of any muslim. The Asiwaju Adinni of Iwoland, now the Chair of the Governing Council of the Federal College of Education, Iwo, now in his 70s, is relentlessly inclined to attracting self-motivated youngsters to career cultivation and development.\n\nMentoring deserves to be acknowledged for the special knowledge and skill values it generates across sectors and generations. I have also found it as a basis for the most seminal knowledge exchange! Hear this: The late MKO Abiola, accomplished media entrepreneur and politician had stated in one of his major interviews that he would rather see himself as the foremost giver in Africa, not the richest. With his giving, he sowed seeds which have yielded dividends far beyond what any prophet could have foreseen.\n\nThis ARN project is a classical example. Myself as well no fewer than four other mentors on the project- Dr Obi Chukwumba, Dr Arthur Martins Aginam and the promoter and founder of the International Center for Investigative Reporting, ICIR, Dayo Aiyetan-all happen to be alumni of the Concord Press titles published by the one-time foremost giver in Africa.\n\nW ho can argue that mentoring, isn\u2019t a strand of charity. May Allah increase His favours on MKO Abiola\u2019s soul and others who subscribe to giving in all forms.\n\nTunde Akanni, PhD, is an Associate Professor of Journalism based at the LASU School of Communication.

          "text": "By Frank Ikpefan, Abuja\n\nA coalition of civil society organisations (CSOs) has asked the National Assembly to reject the nomination of Lauretta Onochie as a national commissioner for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) because she is a British citizen.\n\nThe coalition noted that Ms Onochie\u2019s citizenship will undermine national interest and potentially threaten the independence of INEC.\n\nSpeaking for the coalition during a press conference in Abuja yesterday, a board member of YIAGA Africa, Ezenwa Nwagwu noted that Onochies\u2019s dual citizenship makes her fall short of the constitutional requirements for being appointed to that position as stated in Sections 156(1a) and 66(1a) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe nomination of Onochie, who is the Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Media, has triggered outrage with many calling on the president to withdraw the nomination on grounds that Ms Onochie is partisan and so it would be undemocratic for her to be appointed into such an office.\n\nPresident Buhari forwarded the name of Ms Onochie and five others to the Senate in October last year for confirmation as INEC national commissioner.\n\nThe other nominees are: Prof. Muhammad Sani Kallah from Katsina; Prof. Kunle Cornelius Ajayi, Ekiti State; Saidu Babura Ahmad, Jigawa; Prof. Sani Muhammad Adam, North Central and Dr. Baba Bila, North East.\n\nThe president, in a letter to the Senate, announced the appointment and sought the lawmakers\u2019 confirmation. The appointment had triggered outrage among Nigerians as many described it as unconstitutional.\n\nThe Senate President on June 9, directed the Senate committee on INEC headed by Kabiru Gaya to screen Ms Onochie and five other nominees.\n\nBut Nwagwu stated: \u201cFurther proof of Mrs. Onochie being a British citizen is contained in the fact that until recently, she was a full, card-carrying member of the British Conservative Party, even contesting elections for a councillorship position in Thames Ward in the London Borough of Barking and Degenham in 2010 as a member of the UK Conservative Party.\n\n\u201cThe fact of her dual citizenship and political activities in the UK raises major questions on her loyalty and commitment to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs a Nigerian and UK citizen, she is obligated to demonstrate loyalty to both countries. Therefore, her dual loyalty will undermine national interest and potentially threaten the independence of INEC.\u201d\n\nFounder of Albino Foundation, Jake Epelle, noted that Onochie, in her position as special assistant to President Buhari on social media, has built a partisan reputation by her biased and sometimes inflammatory comments on national issues and against perceived or imagined enemies of the Buhari administration.\n\nEpelle maintained that she is unlikely to be non-partisan, neutral and objective in her duties as an INEC National Commissioner if she is confirmed, adding that CSOs will be left with no option other than to seek legal redress.\n\n\u201cHer appointment as a national commissioner or in the leadership of INEC will gravely undermine the neutrality and impartiality of the Commission, and taint its credibility,\u201d Epelle said.\n\nHe added: \u201cSuch an appointment will undermine citizens\u2019 confidence in INEC, increase mistrust in the Commission and Nigeria\u2019s electoral process. It will also jeopardize the trust of other political parties in the Commission.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution requires that a nominee for the position of INEC National Commissioner must be a \u201cperson of unquestionable integrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Mrs. Onochie\u2019s actions on social media show that she lacks the required integrity to be appointed into such a sensitive position.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere are several documented evidence of written attacks, social media altercations and malicious, unfounded allegations against groups or individuals by Mrs. Onochie via her social media accounts.\u201d\n\nEpelle urged the Senate to reject the nomination of Onochie as INEC National Commissioner and ensure that due diligence is exercised in the confirmation of nomination into INEC.\n\nHe added: \u201cEnsure that nominees to positions in the Independent National Electoral Commission are individuals with impeccable character, unquestionable neutral inclinations, dispositions, and competence.\n\n\u201cWe also call on Muhammed Buhari to as a matter of urgency, withdraw the nomination of Mrs. Lauretta Onochie in the public interest and in furtherance of stated and repeated commitment to continue a legacy of a truly independent electoral commission that enjoys the trust and confidence of citizens and electoral stakeholders.\n\n\u201cUphold the federal character principle in re-nominating a non-partisan, neutral, and competent Nigerian to represent the South-South region as INEC National Commissioner.\n\n\u201cObserve the principle of diversity and gender inclusivity in nominating candidates who are non-partisan and competent as INEC National Commissioners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that as custodians of the Nigerian Constitution, the Senate will ensure that the Constitution is upheld in the appointment of National Commissioners.We firmly believe that the Senate will continue to nurture our democracy by protecting the sanctity of INEC and the credibility of our electoral process.\u201d",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nChief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, yesterday, debunked allegation by Islamic cleric, Sheik Ahmad Gumi, that soldiers were colluding with bandits, saying those harbouring such thoughts were hallucinating and needed their heads examined.\n\nHe also said the Federal Government is engaging retired senior military officers across the six geo-political zones to tackle security challenges like banditry, terrorism, armed robbery, pipeline vandalism, arms proliferation, herders-farmers clashes, violence by secessionist groups and other violent crimes.\n\nIrabor made this known at an interaction with retired senior military officers in the South West at the Headquarters of 2 Division of the Nigerian Army, Odogbo, Ibadan.\n\nOn Gumi\u2019s allegations, he said: \u201cAnyone who is hallucinating with the idea that the military or other security agencies are conniving, I think needs to have himself checked. Do you connive with someone to take your life? That of course is a question that should dismiss that kind of allusion any day. All you need to know is that yes, on daily basis, because of the technological tools available to everyone of us, it is not impossible that criminally-minded individuals may take advantage of these tools. That is the reason on daily basis, we are reassessing our operational engagements, to ensure that our engagements are intelligence-driven, and equally know that these bad elements, who live among us need be exposed.\u201d\n\nGumi on Wednesday alleged that bandits engaged in kidnappings and killing of victims in the North worked in collaboration with some security officers to facilitate the movement of arms across the border into the country for their use.\n\nBut the Army through its spokesman, Brig-Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, denied the allegation saying it was a calculated attempt to denigrate the military and embolden criminals.\n\nIrabor, however, said the country was under serious threat which necessitated the engagement of retired officers to assist in resolving security challenges, especially in regions where they live.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there are various security issues, and we have identified our retired colleagues, who have sold out to the unity, peace and progress of our nation. This speaks to their sense of patriotism and zeal. We believe that in their retirement, they would be better instruments of sensitisation of those who live around them on issues bordering on peace and security.\u201d\n\nIrabor said the visit to Ibadan was to interact with the retired officers to find out their observations and recommendations on how to improve security in the country.\n\n\u201cAfter the South West geo-political zone, we will go to other geo-political zones. I think that we can only leverage the wealth of experience that they have to be able to do this. That is why we are here. I believe it will be better for all of us at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nChief of Defence, Civil Military Cooperation, Rear Admiral Frederick Agu, admitted that insecurity in the country has risen to a level where the armed forces require variety of inputs from different stakeholders to combat it\n\nGeneral Officer Commanding (GOC), 2 Division, Nigerian Army, Major General Gold Chibuisi, commended the CDS for his wisdom in creating a platform to tap from wealth of experiences of retired senior officers with a view to finding a lasting solution to current security challenges confronting the country.\n\n\u201cI want to remind the retired senior officers that they have crucial roles in a time like this when the armed forces in Nigeria is fully engaged in combating emerging security challenges nationwide. These challenges range from armed robbery, banditry activities, violence by the Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists, pipeline vandalism, arms proliferation, kidnapping, and herders-farmers clashes, and continuous attacks on security personnel by violent secessionist groups. These problems have put the Police on the spotlight, and necessitated the deployment of the armed forces in almost all the states of the federation.\n\n\u201cThe precision with which hoodlums carry out their attacks call for concern by all loyal and patriotic Nigerians. Innocent souls have continued to be lost amid these crises, as well as valuable property, institutions, and infrastructure. No doubt, this growing insecurity has contributed to economic stress and joblessness. Thus, this forum provides a veritable platform.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), yesterday, reinstated its position that it was not after northerners but terrorists killing and maiming people in the South East.\n\nMedia and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, stated this in a statement where it debunked allegation by Sheikh Gumi that herdsmen were better off than Eastern Security Network (ESN) and IPOB.\n\nHe also accused Gumi of using his comments to blackmail IPOB in order to continue the military presence in the South East.\n\nThe cleric was quoted to have while comparing the two groups indicted IPOB for arson and killing while herdsmen were only kidnapping for ransom. But Powerful said there was no truth in the claim by Gumi.\n\n\u201cIn case the self-acclaimed Islamic cleric has forgotten, may we remind him that neither IPOB nor ESN is a terrorist organisation or killers like his bandit clients and allies. Spilling of blood is never part of our mandate. ESN is a child of necessity created for the defence of our ancestral land against terrorists and killer herdsmen wrecking havok across our communities. ESN is only defending our hapless mothers and sisters who have been raped, maimed and attacked without any justification by Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cSince December 2020 when ESN was set up by our leader, these vampires have been on the run because of the heat from our gallant operatives across Biafran forests. For Sheikh Gumi who never gave a hoot while killer herdsmen rampaged our communities to try to twist the fact now is not only a mischief, but an act of terror itself.\u201d\n\nPowerful insisted \u201cno northerner in any part of Biafra land can prove that he/she has at any time been attacked by IPOB or ESN. We are only chasing terrorists and bandits behind the killings and kidnapping for ransom in our land. Gumi should be ashamed that an Islamic cleric as he claims has suddenly become a mouthpiece for bandits and terrorists. Why Gumi has special interest in bandits and terrorists is an indication that he is a terrorist who has never shown any empathy to victims of other Nigerians.\u201d",
          "summary": "Irabor made this known at an interaction with retired senior military officers in the South West at the Headquarters of 2 Division of the Nigerian Army, Odogbo, Ibadan.\nOn Gumi\u2019s allegations, he said: \u201cAnyone who is hallucinating with the idea that the military or other security agencies are conniving, I think needs to have himself checked.\nIrabor, however, said the country was under serious threat which necessitated the engagement of retired officers to assist in resolving security challenges, especially in regions where they live.\nWe are only chasing terrorists and bandits behind the killings and kidnapping for ransom in our land.\nGumi should be ashamed that an Islamic cleric as he claims has suddenly become a mouthpiece for bandits and terrorists.",

          "text": "\u2022UN: 350,000 killed in North-east insurgency\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has expressed optimism that Nigeria will soon prevail over the current security challenges facing it.\n\nHe anchored his optimism on various efforts by the federal government to tackle insecurity, including the recent supplementary budget sent to the National Assembly for approval for the procurement of military hardware for the use of the military and other security agencies.\n\nOsinbajo, while hosting the Oluyin of Iyin Ekiti, Oba Adeola Ajakaiye, yesterday in Abuja rallied Nigerians to support the security agencies to ensure that Nigeria is safe.\n\nHe said: \u201cI can assure you that soon, the issue of insecurity will be a thing of the past, and that we will all live in peace and prosperity in this country.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the supplementary budget seeking approval for funds to enhance the capacity of the military and other security agencies is part of the concerted efforts of the federal government to beef up its response to the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe president has recently constituted a committee that will look at the whole security infrastructure with a view to looking at the needs of the military, as well as the police and security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe result of that is a bill before the National Assembly, a supplementary bill. The purpose of that bill is to present some of the needs of the military, as well as of security agencies in order to be able to beef up our response to the security challenges.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also stressed the need for traditional rulers, local and state governments to collaborate with the federal government to tackle insecurity.\n\n\u201cAny country with this number of security challenges must respond as robustly as possible. But it is also important to bear in mind that it takes a combined effort of all of us, at the local government level, state and federal levels; all of the levels; we need to come together to tackle this issue of insecurity,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, even as the federal government is concerned about the security challenges, and will continue to ramp up efforts towards improving security nationwide, community efforts are also vital in tackling the issue from the roots.\n\nHe stated that at the level of community there is a need to take decisive action, as most of the security issues occur at the community level.\n\nOsinbajo expressed happiness that his guest has set up a committee in his domain to tackle insecurity \u201cand that you\u2019ve been able to contain the menace that we see in different parts of the country in your community.\u201d\n\nHe added that the federal government will support the community in tackling its challenges, and is also working with the Ekiti State Government on dealing with insecurity, as well as various issues.\n\nIn his remarks, Ajakaiye thanked Osinbajo for granting his delegation audience and listening to their demands, including support for the establishment of a Federal University of Medical and Health Sciences in the community.\n\nHe said: \u201cAgain, as a community, we have come to appreciate you (Vice President) for your diligence, hard work, commitment and loyalty; and that, we from the South-west are very proud of you. We want to assure you that we are very much in support of you. From our own end, we are doing a lot to ensure that the menace of insecurity will not remain in our domain.\u201d\n\nUN: 350,000 Killed in North-east Insurgency\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) yesterday put the death toll from the ongoing conflict with terrorists in the North-east at about 350,000 people as of the end of 2020.\n\nIt, however, projected that should the insurgency continue till 2030, the fatalities could rise to over 1.1 million.\n\nAccording to a UNDP\u2019s report on the impact of the insurgency in the North-east region presented yesterday at a virtual meeting by the Country Director, Mr. Mohammed Yahaya, at least 35,000 people have so far been killed directly by the insurgents, with 350,000 said to have died indirectly as a result of the crisis.\n\nOn the socioeconomic impact of the crisis on states in the region, the report said $27.8 billion had been lost in GDP, plunging at least 1.4 million people into poverty.\n\nThe report showed that at least 1.8 million children in the North-east are not enrolled in schools as a result of the conflict.\n\nThe UNDP said: \u201cThe full human cost of the war is much greater.\n\n\u201cAlready, many more have died from the indirect effects of the conflict.\u201d\n\nIt cited damage to agriculture, water, trade, food and healthcare.\n\nChildren younger than five accounts for more than nine out of 10 of those killed, with 170 dying every day, the UNDP added.\n\nIf the conflict continues to 2030, more than 1.1 million people may die, the agency stated.\n\n\u201cDestruction and displacement have set back development in the region by decades, and continued conflict will only further scar the region,\u201d the UNDP said.\n\nThe report said since 2009, the devastating conflict in the North-eastern Nigeria has directly resulted in the deaths of approximately 35,000 people as a consequence of insurgency.\n\nThe report warned that indirect deaths, including disease and hunger resulting from the conflict\u2019s physical and economic destruction, already far outnumber those from direct causes.\n\nThe report: \u2018Assessing the Impact of Conflict on Development in North-east Nigeria\u2019 added that critical aspects of progress and development, including GDP, poverty, malnutrition, infant mortality, education, water availability and sanitation, may not return to pre-conflict levels even by 2030.\n\nUNDP stated that more than 90 per cent of conflict-attributable deaths are of children under the age of five.\n\nThe report said physical and economic destruction wrought by the insurgency had dismantled already fragile health and food systems.\n\nAccording to it, less than 60 per cent of health facilities in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States are fully functional, while a quarter are either completely destroyed or non-functional.\n\nThe report also lamented that attacks from insurgency have also led to massive internal displacement, with more than 1.8 million Nigerians displaced in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States, while the vast majority (nearly 1.5 million) are located in Borno.\n\nThe study also showed that in addition, 1.8 million students were out of school in 2020, and without increased investment in development efforts, the average Nigerian in the North-east would have lost a full year of education by 2030.\n\nThe statement, however, acknowledged that Nigeria has made great strides in retaking and stabilising large areas of the region, stressing that continued investment in development from both national and international stakeholders is needed.\n\n\u201cWithout continued investment in development as a long-term solution, the protracted conflict in north-east Nigeria will continue to impact other parts of the country and the entire Sahel region.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for international partners and national stakeholders to ensure that funds are invested not only on life-saving and humanitarian needs but also on mid-and long-term development priorities in order to enable Nigeria to achieve the SDGs and attain the AU 2063,\u201d the report quoted UNDP Resident Representative, Yahaya, as saying.\n\nThe report noted that to overcome the conflict, development efforts need to be focused on the stabilisation of affected areas through a community-level approach that enhances physical security and access to justice, rehabilitation of essential infrastructure and basic service delivery as well as the revitalisation of the local economy such as market stalls, schools and police stations.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Opposition to PIB grows with Shell\u2019s rejection of proposals on gas sector\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has said the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic increased global debt by $24 trillion, taking it to $281 trillion during the crisis.\n\nSpeaking at the 135th meeting of the Economic Commission Board (ECB) of OPEC, the cartel\u2019s Secretary-General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, urged member countries to be wary of the inflationary effect of their borrowings as the $24 trillion is more than the United States annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nBarkindo spoke just as the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) may, again, run into troubled waters this month as Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) yesterday opposed the passage of the proposed legislation in its present state, seeking a review of its provisions on the gas sector.\n\nBarkindo also reiterated his earlier position that oil demand will hit pre-pandemic levels by the fourth quarter of 2021 to exceed 99 million barrels per day.\n\nThe meeting of the ECB, the organisation\u2019s statutory economic think-tank, which meets in advance of the ordinary meetings of the OPEC conference, focused on reviewing the conditions of the global oil market, emerging trends related to the oil industry, including demand, supply and stock movements, as well as the recovery prospects for the world economy.\n\nBarkindo highlighted the contributions of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) of participating countries, which continue to support the global oil market through voluntary production adjustments in the interest of market stability.\n\nOn OPEC forecast for demand recovery, Barkindo stated that the market optimism was a reaction to the more than 2.4 billion vaccine doses that have now been administered globally.\n\nAlso, there are signs that the international community is ramping up its support to developing countries to help bolster their acquisition of life-saving vaccines.\n\nHe said these efforts were drawing the world closer to bringing the pandemic under control, and thereby helping accelerate the global economic recovery, as the latest market developments point to much better conditions and improved prospects.\n\nOn market fundamentals, Barkindo stated that in terms of the global economy, the GDP growth forecast has risen from 4.4 per cent in November 2020 to 5.5 per cent in June 2021.\n\nHe added that an upward momentum into the second half of the year is being expected.\n\nHe restated his earlier forecast that China and the US will see the lion\u2019s share of growth in 2021, with China\u2019s economy expanding by 8.5 per cent and the US by 6.4 per cent.\n\nAccording to him, India, despite having to confront a devastating second-wave of COVID-19 infections is still forecast to achieve a growth of 9.5 per cent.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe forecast for world oil demand has decreased from 6.2 mb/d in November 2020 to 6 mb/d in June 2021. The outlook for later this year looks especially promising with demand slated to exceed 99 mb/d in the fourth quarter. This prospect would bring us back close to pre-pandemic levels.\u201d\n\nHe stated that there are now encouraging signs that the worst of the pandemic is over, but warned that it is too early to jump to conclusions, especially with uncertainties surrounding mutations.\n\nBarkindo said meanwhile, debt levels in major economies continued to rise, fuelled by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus programmes, with government debt levels, after the COVID-19 lockdowns, reaching their highest to date in both advanced economies and emerging market economies.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe absolute amount of global debt has increased by more than $24 trillion over the course of the pandemic \u2013 this is more than the annual GDP of the US. World debt now stands at $281 trillion, comparing to the annual world GDP of around $80 trillion. With this in mind, the risk of rising inflation in the months to come will need to be closely monitored.\n\n\u201cLooking at the world oil supply, non-OPEC supply growth was revised down from 0.9 mb/d in November 2020 to 0.8 mb/d in June 2021. The main drivers for 2021 supply growth are anticipated to be Canada, Brazil, China and Norway, while US liquids supply is now expected to only grow by a marginal 0.03 mb/d y-o-y.\u201d\n\nHe expressed optimism that the return of Iranian production and exports will happen in a transparent and orderly fashion, supporting the deal by OPEC+ countries on ongoing efforts to rebalance the oil market and promote market stability.\n\nBarkindo also lauded the conformity to the production adjustments by member countries, which he puts at 114 per cent in April.\n\nOpposition to PIB Grows as Shell Kicks over Bill\u2019s Position on Gas Sector\n\nMeanwhile, Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) may, again, run into troubled waters this month as Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) yesterday opposed the passage of the proposed legislation in its present state.\n\nThe company stated that the bill, if passed as it is, could throw the gas sector into more crisis and further stunt the growth of the sector, which the country is banking on for much of its revenue as the world moves towards cleaner sources of fuels.\n\nDuring the week, reports indicated that the bill, which has spent over 15 years in the National Assembly, may not be passed this month as promised by President of the Senate, Dr Ahmed Lawan, as key stakeholders pushed for final alterations to some specific parts of the document before it becomes law.\n\nSpeaking during an online forum organised by the British Nigeria Chamber of Commerce (NBCC), Managing Director of SNEPCo, Mr. Bayo Ojulari, called for a conference of all stakeholders, to be called by the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, to resolve the differences.\n\nThemed: \u201cGas Economy: Maximising the Potential,\u201d the programme was overseen by the NBCC oil and gas group and attended, among others, by the Managing Director of the chamber, Mr Kayode Falowo, and Managing Director, Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited, Mr Tony Attah.\n\nOther speakers at the event were the President of the Nigeria Gas Association (NGA) and Managing Director, Shell Nigeria Gas (SNG), Mr. Ed Ubong, and Gas Portfolio Manager, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Mr. Yemi Famori.\n\nOjulari stated that the PIB as it is today is not enabling enough and not fully aligned with the direction that Nigeria has articulated around the \u201cDecade of Gas\u201d as propagated by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe called for a further review of the PIB to ensure that it delivers and contributes to the ambition that Nigeria has set for itself to be in the class of Qatar and Australia whose economies are largely run on revenues from gas.\n\nAccording to him, with the condition set for exportation of gas resources by companies operating in the sector, the proposed petroleum governance bill will stifle competition.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe terms and prices of gas development, especially for deep non-associated gas, need to be more competitive. Today, it is actually looking worse than it is in the current environment and that\u2019s an area that has not enjoyed a level of emphasis.\n\n\u201cToday, the PIB does not do any justice or to help to unlock the huge potential that we have in the non-associated gas environments. With the potential of gas to power our economy, the focus should be more on competitive discuss that will stimulate gas.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the version of the PIB that we have is not sufficient and will not enable us to incentivise investors to unlock the huge non-associated gas that we have.\u201d\n\nIn the domestic gas space, Ojulari said the PIB required the fulfilment of domestic gas obligation as a condition to export gas, which potentially puts long-term export gas supply at risk.\n\nHe added that the country needs to move away from the \u201cunproductive\u201d debate about satisfying local need before shipping gas abroad.\n\nHe called for a delicate balancing between the political drive and the business needs of the PIB, saying that many of those who discuss the matter are approaching it from the point of emotions, rather than reality.\n\nHe added: \u201c A lot of people who talk about the gas business in the gas value chain come from the emotional side. But emotion does not create a business, emotions do not attract investors, emotions do not sign contracts.\n\n\u201cSo, I will say that while we recognise those emotional elements, we need to create a platform where the companies and the entities that have these resources will come together in a conference facilitated by the minister of state and let us have that conversation.\u201d\n\nHe stated that everybody is currently doing the economics of the gas sector from their own point of view, and there\u2019s no consensus on the way forward for the gas sector in the PIB.\n\nHe wondered why the NLNG model was not adopted since it has been tested to be workable, explaining that there is sufficient gas resource that will meet both domestic and gas export.\n\nIn his remarks, Attah stated that energy has always been in transition, adding that there should be no surprise about the current talks about renewables.\n\nWith 7.8 billion persons on earth and an additional 2.8 billion by 2050, he said the world would always require energy to function, while gas will continue to be relevant.\n\nAccording to him, the energy of the future must look at the sustainability of the environment and which does not emit massive carbon like coal, oil and others.\n\nHe stated that gas is cheaper and could be either a transition or destination fuel, adding that a future without gas is almost inconceivable.\n\nBill to Be Laid Tuesday\n\nMeanwhile, President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, has assured the nation that the PIB would be laid on Tuesday by its joint committees on the bill.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the moment, we are dotting the i\u2019s and crossing the t\u2019s on the PIB; the Petrol Industry Bill, and by the grace of God, our committees, the joint committees, will finish their work on it by the end of the week, hopefully. The reports would be laid on Tuesday in both chambers. This is what we have planned and this is what we\u2019re working towards.\u201d\n\nHe also said much work had been done on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill and it would be passed before the National Assembly proceeds on its annual vacation next month.\n\n\u201cWe also have some work to do on the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill. Our committee in the Senate and indeed, in the House have worked jointly and we have very little to do really, to get the reports and considered in the two chambers.\n\n\u201cWe expect that we\u2019ll do that before we go on our annual summer recess, which comes up on the 15th of July, by the grace of God. \u201cSo, before we go on summer recess, we should be able to pass the Electoral Act (amendment) Bill,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly will also work on the confirmation of nominees for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) commissionership as well as passing the 2021 Supplementary Appropriation Bill sent to it last week by the president.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nThe Delta State Government yesterday called for the speedy reconstitution of the board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to avert the 2016 experience when the resurgence of militancy plunged Nigeria into recession.\n\nThe Deputy Governor, Dr. Kingsley Otuaro, while featuring yesterday on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, described the non-constitution of the board as a flagrant abuse of the commission\u2019s Act.\n\nHe said the situation was doing more harm than good to the oil-rich region.\n\nHe described as untenable, the assurance of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, that the board would be constituted after an ongoing forensic audit.\n\nOtuaro also allayed fears of a political storm in the state over the zoning arrangement for the governorship position, saying the issue would be resolved at the right time.\n\nHe said the non-constitution of the board of the NDDC could trigger militancy in the region following the recent ultimatum issued by the Ijaw Youth Council and oil communities\u2019 rights activist, Chief Government Ekpemupolo, known as Tompolo.\n\nHe stated that following Tompolo\u2019s ultimatum, Akpabio had engaged in wide consultations in the region.\n\nOtuaro said he was part of the consultative meetings and was also very much aware of the fact that consensus reached in the inner meetings was that the board would be constituted at the close of this month.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe expectation of all those who are involved in that critical engagement is that the board will be constituted at the close of this month.\n\n\u201cIf there is anything to the contrary, Senator Akpabio knows exactly what to do. He has to reach out because any gap in the circumstance will be misconstrued for something else.\n\n\u201cAnd for us in Delta State Government, we don\u2019t want a repeat of what happened in 2016 that boxed us up into a recessionary period, where there was a resurgence of militancy in the region. And then we observed the breaches of critical oil and gas facilities where the Trans-Forcados 48-inch line was breached and production output was cut.\u201d\n\nHe said the position of the state government was in tandem with the position held by critical stakeholders in the region.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have a strong opinion that the long delay and the non-constitution or the substantive board of the NDDC is a flagrant abuse of the Act, establishing the NDDC.\n\n\u201cThat is the position of the Delta State Government and like you have said, the NDDC cannot be like a sole proprietorship business, because it is not meant to be so.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that South-south governors met and in their resolution, they affirmed that the board should be constituted immediately.\n\nThe governors, he said, also recommended that financial receipts in favour of the NDDC should be lodged in an escrow account, adding that this was borne out of the fact that the sole proprietorship leadership \u2013 the interim leadership of the NDDC is unknown to the NDDC Act.\n\nHe stated that the recent visit by Akpabio to the region for consultation had calmed frayed nerves as the government may not have contained the likely unwholesome situation that would have arisen.\n\n\u201cThe recent spate of ultimatums given by the Ijaw Youth Council and some other critical stakeholders, including that of Government Ekpemupolo, is also in tandem with the position of the Senator Ifeanyi Okowa-led government and that of the South-south governors and that of PANDEF led by Chief EK Clark,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the state government was thankful to God that Akpabio, \u201cesteemed and distinguished for his transformation agenda while he was governor Akwa Ibom State had cause to come to the Niger Delta region to consult with the critical stakeholders and I\u2019m thankful to God that he came.\u201d\n\nOtuaro added that if the minister had sat in his office, there would have been some unwholesome scenes in relation to the ultimatum that they had given.\n\n\u201cSo I want to say that it is the expectation of the critical stakeholders that the board should be constituted,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the position that the board would be constituted when the government is done with the forensic audit, is untenable against the backdrop of the fact that the board can be constituted and the forensic audit can be going on.\n\nOn the rising tension over zoning of the governorship position and the recent dissolution of the cabinet by Okowa, the deputy governor said the situation would be resolved at the right time.\n\nHe added that he reserved the right to run for the governorship election but was non-committal over whether or not he would run in view of the zoning arrangement in place.\n\nHe stated that it was within the powers of his boss to effect a change of cabinet.\n\n\u201cFirst, it is within the powers of the Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, to dissolve his cabinet and reappoint those he feels very strongly that can help us deliver on a stronger Delta Agenda, because that truly is our agenda, one that truly is stronger and more secured Delta State for tomorrow.\n\n\u201cSo, that is in the exercise of his power and there\u2019s no problem about that and we are happy with it and I think the people are also happy with it.\n\n\u201cAs to the questions you have thrown up with regards to contesting or indicating interest, zoning and all of that, I don\u2019t want to get myself into all of that. I am a Deltan; I am a Nigerian, like any other person. So, we all have the rights to aspire to elective positions. I have the right to aspire within the context of the law. I can aspire. But it is not my place to tell you if I want to,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the zoning of the governorship seat to South, North or Central Senatorial Districts, are all politics.\n\nOtuaro stated that the leadership of the state, especially the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will look into what is fair and just for the people of the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Whenever we have to approve any loan, we have to insist on the details of what projects will be funded by those loans. We\u2019ll have to look at the conditions that are attached to the loans; they must be favourable conditions before we approve and we will be up to date with our oversight to ensure that what we have approved is directly deployed and on those projects that we have also approved for implementation. So, we will not be frivolous and will not take it lightly to just approve any loan\u201d.\n\nHe, however, supported the idea of government sourcing loan to execute projects, saying the revenues are not available while Nigerians cannot be taxed further.\n\nHe added: \u201cOur options are really very limited as a country. First, we don\u2019t have the necessary revenues, Nigeria is poor, we shouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves. Nigeria is not rich, given the circumstances we live in, given the challenges we have; our resources are so low, our revenues are so low and therefore the option of not doing anything, just to sit because we have no money, we shouldn\u2019t go for infrastructure development is not even an option worthy of consideration. You cannot keep the economy stagnant.\n\n\u201cTwo, you cannot, in my view and judgment, tax Nigerians further for you to raise the money for infrastructure development. Other countries do that, but we have serious situation across the country, so you cannot put taxes on people.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Chiemelie Ezeobi\n\nA 21-year-old undergraduate of the University of Lagos, Chidinma Adaora Ojukwu, has narrated how she stabbed the Chief Executive Officer of Super TV, Mr. Usifo Ataga, to death in the Lekki area of Lagos State.\n\nShe spoke at the Lagos State Police Command headquarters in Ikeja yesterday after she was paraded as a suspect by the state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu.\n\nOdumosu said Chidinma was arrested at her parents\u2019 residence in the Yaba area of the state on Wednesday night.\n\nThe suspect, who was paraded at the Lagos State Police Command headquarters in Ikeja, confessed to the crime, adding that the scuffle that led to his death was because the deceased had allegedly forced her for another bout after several rounds of sex.\n\nThe 300-level student of Mass Communication was said to have stabbed him severally during the scuffle, tied him up and left him to bleed to death.\n\nShe then proceeded to take his ATM cards, his phones and laptop.\n\nThe suspect formatted the laptop and sold it at Computer Village before the police arrested her.\n\nChidinma said she had been in a romantic relationship with Ataga for about four months before the ugly incident.\n\nThe suspect said she and Ataga were \u201chaving fun\u201d when an argument broke out and she stabbed him twice.\n\n\u201cWe were in the lodge smoking. He was trying to make advances on me. I was tired and he became violent on it. I let him have his way. Towards afternoon, he ordered roofies. We took it together and ate food. He became high. I was still not happy with the first one (sex) that we had. So, I was staying on my own, smoking and drinking. He, too, was on his own.\n\n\u201cHe came to me and I was like I am not happy with what he did. I was like, \u2018You don\u2019t help me, you don\u2019t assist me with anything, you are just playing with me around\u2019. He was like, \u2018Take my ATM and withdraw what you want\u2019.\n\n\u201cHe later became violent trying to get to me and I was resisting and defending myself. At some point, he hit my\n\nhead on the wall and I also retaliated.\n\n\u201cAt some point, he was chasing me around the kitchen cabinet. I took a knife and stabbed his neck. I approached the door and he followed me. I stabbed him twice on the neck side. I threw the knife to the bed and he was going for it but I also went for\n\nit.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe dragged the knife with me and it broke and he fell on the floor.\u201d\n\nThe undergraduate also disclosed that after stabbing the late CEO, she withdrew N380,000 from his account using his ATM card.\n\nOdumosu said efforts were ongoing to apprehend and cause other culprits involved in the heinous crime to face the full weight of the law and justice done in the matter.\n\nAccording to him, the suspect had conspired with others, now at large, to murder Ataga.\n\nHe said part of the exhibits recovered were one drivers\u2019 licence, complimentary cards, Access Bank Statement of Account and one Nigeria International Passport with No.B50010434 belonging to the suspect, one fake driver\u2019s licence bearing Mary Johnson with the suspect\u2019s photograph.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Some All Progressives Congress (APC) chairmanship candidates in Lagos state local government council poll in July are currently enmeshed in different certificate forgery scandals.\n\nThe candidates include Princess Surah Olayemi Animashaun of Epe Local Government Area (LGA), Kevin Oluwaseun Gabriel, formerly known as Kelvin Luchiano of Apapa LGA, and Kafayat Layeni of Ojodu Local Council Development Authority (LCDA).\n\nThe credentials of Funmilayo Mohammed of Apapa Iganmu LCDA, Hamed Salawu of Shomolu, and Olarunde Folorunsho of Olorunda LCDA are currently being investigated as there are questions to be answered.\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters showed that Surah, who is being sponsored by Oba Kamorudeen Animashaun, the Oloja of Epe Kingdom presented a fake West Africa Examination Council (WAEC) certificate despite claiming to have graduated from a Nigerian university.\n\nIt was gathered that the Epe APC candidate submitted two different statements of results to the Tola Kasali- led screening committee of the party on 24th May, 2021, and the Department of State Services on 27th May, 2021.\n\nThe two statements of results carried Surah\u2019s name and the same year, 1991, but with different inputs.\n\nSaharaReporters further learnt that the APC candidate refused to present the original WAEC certificate 30 years after taking the examination.\n\nSurah also failed to submit a National Youth Service Corps certificate or exemption letter to prove she served or was exempted.\n\nKafayat, the APC candidate in Ojodu LCDA, sponsored by the House of Representatives member representing Ikeja Federal Constituency, James Faleke also presented a fake certificate.\n\nThe result in which she claimed to have grade C6 in English Language, C5 in Government, C4 in Economics, C4 in Mathematics, D7 in Biology, C5 in Commerce, and C3 in Accounts have been denied by WAEC.\n\nAlso in Apapa LGA, Kevin who is being backed by Mr Tunde Balogun, the APC party chairman in Lagos state presented a fake National Examination Council (NECO) certificate, claiming he took the examination in November 2008 at over age 40 at the Command High School, Araromi-Obu, Ondo state.\n\nAccording to a letter obtained by SaharaReporters, the school did not conduct any NECO external examination in November 2008.\n\n\u201cI stated clearly that the above school mentioned does not have a center for NECO External candidates and that the school does not conduct NECO external examination in November 2008. Therefore the school dissociates herself from any fraudulent practices,\u201d a letter signed by the Vice Principal, Academic on behalf of the Principal read.\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters, an APC chieftain said urgent action has to be taken so that the party does not lose some seats by fielding these dubious candidates.\n\nHe said, \u201cCurrently, investigations are ongoing in areas like Apapa Iganmu with Funmilayo Mohammed, Shomolu with Hamed Salawu and Olarunde Folorunsho of Olorunda LCDA as these areas are likely to be affected as well.\n\n\u201cThe issues of these false documents are not limited to just the chairmen and their deputies, councillors in some local governments too are involved in the mess. The case of Toheeb Shokunbi, a councillor in Ikorordu Central, and very many are scattered all over the state.\n\n\u201cOne wonders why the APC did not do a thorough and proper verification process before fielding these candidates. APC must now act fast as the opposition parties are well equipped with all the evidence of these malpractices and are waiting to use it to their advantage should the need arise.\u201d\n\nDOCUMENTS: Lagos Chairmanship Candidates for All Progressives Congress Party in Messy Certificate Scandals.... by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nNew Document by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "SEC approves Chaka as first licensed stock trading app in Nigeria",
          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "From Konga to mPharma, logistics for health products is growing in Africa",
          "text": "\u201cPeople order drugs on Jumia?\u201d\n\nThat was the reaction from the most ardent online shopper I know. She buys running shoes, mom jeans and hair products but doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would buy drugs online. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for her to buy ingestible medicines on the same website she shops for underwear.\n\nBut a search under Jumia\u2019s \u2018medications & treatments\u2019 tab reveals syrups, nasal sprays, and pain relief capsules. At the bottom of their healthcare page, a blurb assures visitors that products listed on the website are from \u201cvarious trusted brands that will meet your health needs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, African e-commerce marketplaces are venturing into the delivery of health care products as part of a strategy to broaden their value to customers.\n\nThese platforms are part of a broader crop of innovators at an interesting intersection of healthcare and logistics on the continent. Going by recent data, this sub-sector has grown over two years.\n\nAt least 61 companies are using tech for health distribution across sub-saharan Africa, a growth of over 100% in the number of active players (28) captured in 2018. That\u2019s according to a report by Salient Advisory, an Africa-focused healthcare consultancy.\n\nThese health logistics companies include e-commerce players like Jumia, Copia and Konga, and also core health startups like mPharma, Lifestores Pharmacy, Chekkit and Sproxil. Salient\u2019s report focuses on companies delivering over-the-counter products, hence it does not include LifeBank which specializes in blood and oxygen products.\n\nMost of these companies are in Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya with only 6 spotted in the francophone region. 31% of the companies surveyed were founded within the last two years and 62% operate in a single African country.\n\nSnapshot of innovators in the health products distribution space in Africa. Source: Salient Advisory.\n\nSalient categorizes the landscape of companies into three groups by the type of service they deliver: consumer-facing companies, producer-facing companies and product data companies.\n\nThe first group of companies (like Drugstore.ng) deliver over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as virtual patient care to individuals. Provider-facing ones serve healthcare businesses either by delivering to them, hosting an online marketplace, providing inventory management tools (an example here is Lifestores Pharmacy) and/or offering financing.\n\nThe third group offers data related services like product analytics and drug authenticity verification. An example in this category is Chekkit, a verification technology startup that was recently accepted into Google for Startups accelerator programme for 2021.\n\nTraditional e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Copia and Konga are able to play in the consumer and provider-facing buckets. Because of their presence in multiple African countries, all three companies surpass the combined reach of other direct-to-consumer startups in the health product distribution space.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing can accelerate access to medicines and have an incredible impact on public health,\u201d says Yomi Kazeem, one of the authors of Salient Advisory\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to Konga\u2019s co-CEO Nick Imudia, the e-commerce company\u2019s plan to deliver health products started shortly after they were acquired by the Zinox Group three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe started building warehouses and logistics assets to enable us to reach every local government area in the country,\u201d Imudia says to TechCabal.\n\nKonga.com is a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies can list health products like medicines. Konga delivers orders from those pharmacies to individual consumers.\n\nBut beyond fulfilling orders to individuals, Konga plans to go bigger by working on bulk orders between pharmacies and businesses or government agencies, Imudia says. That will require some investments on infrastructure for cold distribution and ensuring warehouses are of the right temperature.\n\nSalient Advisory\u2019s report notes that \u201cclear and harmonised regulations\u201d could boost this entry of e-commerce players into the health products distribution space.\n\nKonga has two licenses to directly distribute products for drug manufacturers and import drugs from the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Imudia says. But he clarifies that Konga will not act as a pharmacy by selling drugs directly to consumers \u2013 but will rely on its marketplace platform that allows merchants to sell on Konga.com\n\nHow big can this new business line be for Konga? Imudia declines to share what health products logistics currently contributes to Konga\u2019s overall business. But he believes it will be \u201ca major part\u201d of Konga\u2019s business in the future.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D-printed school opening in Malawi\n\nLearning disabilities and assistive technology\n\nGoogle\u2019s delay in blocking third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nWorld\u2019s first 3D-printed school opens in Malawi\n\nPhoto credit: Nairametrics\n\nWhat happened? LafargeHolcim, a French-Swiss multinational company that manufactures building materials, has announced the world\u2019s first school built using 3D printing (3DP).\n\nHow did it happen? Dedicated to accelerating the provision of affordable housing in Africa, 14Trees, a LafargeHolcim and Colonial Development Corporation (CDC) Group joint venture, deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to build the school in Malawi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy did it happen? Since one of Malawi\u2019s biggest education reforms \u2014 free primary education \u2014 in 1994, there has been a decline in infrastructure, among other things. Hence, LafargeHolcim attempts to alleviate infrastructural problems with 3D printing.\n\nIncredibly, the school\u2019s wall was printed in 18 hours, unlike conventional buildings, which require months to complete. Also, learning began on Monday, June 21, 2021.\n\nSound familiar? Maggie Grout, Founder of Thinking Huts \u2014 a nonprofit organisation that makes education accessible via 3D printed schools \u2014 partnered with humanitarian-driven technology company, Hyperion Robotics, and San-Francisco-based architectural design agency, Studio Mortazavi, to launch a 3DP school in Madagascar between December 2021 and March 2022.\n\nI think I find watching how a 3D building is made therapeutic. But, of course, it has its downsides.\n\nMore to come? LafargeHolcim plans to scale up the technology across Africa. There may be projects in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nLearning disabilities (LDs) and assistive technology (AT)\n\nPhoto by Wulan Sari on Unsplash\n\nJust two questions before you proceed: What are learning disabilities? How many people do you know with learning disabilities?\n\nMany people in Africa cannot answer these questions. And just like mental health disorders, it\u2019s safe to say that many of them believe a learning disability is not an African issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA good time to revisit this: Global Wellness Day: Protecting mental health with technology\n\nWhy should you care? It is almost impossible to tell how many people in Africa have LDs because there is inadequate data on them.\n\nAlso, some people with LDs are unaware of their situation, leaving them undiagnosed. As a result, their families are not well informed about providing the necessary care and support.\n\nHistorically, they have been attributed to witchcraft, stupidity, or dumbness. But, of course, that\u2019s erroneous because LDs are neurological disorders that affect how children and adults receive and process information. They do not affect intelligence but one or two cognitive processes related to learning.\n\nWhile a learning disability has no known cause, it is believed to be linked to premature birth, maternal illnesses, and complications during childbirth, reducing oxygen supply to the child\u2019s brain. In some cases, they are hereditary.\n\nAlthough there is no cure for LDs, technology has made learning easier for people with learning disabilities.\n\nAssistive technology (AT) can influence decoding, word recognition, reading fluency, and reading comprehension. It also offers reading, writing, studying, and organisational support for children with LDs.\n\nWhile AT helps people with learning disabilities to live healthy, independent, and productive lives, people with LDs need support from family, friends, classmates, and co-workers to reach their full potential.\n\nTo know how AT is helping children with LDs and the unique case of Africans with the condition, read this.\n\nGoogle delays plan to block third-party cookies in Chrome\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nAnother announcement? Google has said that it will delay its plans to block third-party cookies in the Chrome browser until 2023, a year later than planned.\n\nWhile browsers like Safari and Firefox have already begun blocking third-party tracking cookies, I think Google\u2019s implementation may require finesse because its move will be significant to the ad industry.\n\nWhy the delay? Google said that the decision to block cookies in mid-2023 would be dependent on its engagement with the United Kingdom\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nIf Google fails to cut off third-party cookies, it might be criticised by regulators, privacy advocates, advertisers, and publishers for not protecting user privacy.\n\nWhat is Google doing concerning that? The company is developing Privacy Sandbox \u2014 its new privacy technologies \u2014 out in the open web.\n\nYou saw that coming, didn\u2019t you? Google claims that the Privacy Sandbox will help web technologies that protect people\u2019s privacy online and give companies and developers the tools to build thriving digital businesses to keep the web open and accessible to everyone.\n\nGoogle plans to remove support for third-party cookies in two stages: from late 2022, Chrome will give the advertising industry and publishers nine months to migrate their services, and in late 2023, Chrome will phase out support for third-party cookies within three months.\n\nIn case you missed it:\n\nMTN plans to invest $1.5 billion to boost broadband access in Nigeria.

Today, the social media giant claims 300 million people visit 1.2 million Shops monthly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Facebook isn\u2019t halting its eCommerce strides there.\n\nAugmented reality and artificial intelligence\n\nImage source: Facebook\n\nThe social media giant is investing heavily in augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to make the shopping experience realistic.\n\nExplaining, Facebook says, \u201cwe\u2019re helping shoppers find new products, and with AR experiences, we\u2019re helping people visualise items before they buy.\u201d\n\nThe social media platform believes that the shopping experience begins with visual discovery making these innovations logical.\n\nAR is a visual technology that enables computer-generated imagery to interact with the real world through a camera.\n\nThis could be a potential solution for the \u201cwhat I ordered vs what I got\u201d problem. TechCabal, reveals this to be one of the factors impeding eCommerce growth in Africa.\n\nWith Facebook\u2019s new product, shoppers can try on a dress in the comfort of their homes before making a purchase.\n\nAI will also help shoppers discover new products based on what they like. Per Facebook, the technology would recommend similar products once a shopper taps on a product they want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe AI will act as a store attendant, giving shoppers more options based on what they like. And with a single tap, customers will get similar options.\n\nWhile these new features will enhance the shopping experience, Facebook is now able to collect more data from users through their cameras and get more specific data on their preferences.\n\nAlso, Facebook Shops is coming to WhatsApp soon.\n\nThis new update means users can use the messaging app as an online store.\n\nMeanwhile, the new feature will not be available for Whatsapp users globally. However, while Facebook did not indicate which countries will enjoy these products, it said, \u201cSoon, we\u2019ll give businesses in select countries the option to showcase their Shop in WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nHow will it work?\n\nIt is not clear how the new feature works on the messaging app.\n\nOn Instagram and Facebook, people can find Shops on a business page through ads or stories. A collection of the products the seller offers is displayed, and customers can then place an order.\n\nAlthough WhatsApp reportedly has 2 billion global users, reach is limited to people known personally.\n\nThis could be a way the company is pushing revenue generation on the messaging app. In December 2020, WhatsApp gave an ultimatum for users to accept updated privacy policy. While the policy still stands, Facebook is not forcing users to accept it.\n\nThis could be a subtle way to bring back the policy and introduce targeted ads on WhatsApp.",

          "text": "The first 3D-printed school, a partnership between Holcim and CDC Group, has been unveiled in Malawi\u2019s Salima district.\n\nReportedly printed in just 18 hours, the school was officially handed over to the Kalonga village community in Salima district, and students started lessons on June 21.\n\nMiljan Gutovic, Region Head of Europe, Middle East and Africa at Holcim Group, said, \u201cI am very proud of how our colleagues at 14Trees have deployed cutting-edge 3D printing technology to solve such an essential infrastructure need. Now that we\u2019ve proven the concept in Malawi, we look forward to scaling up this technology across the broader region, with projects already in the pipeline in Kenya and Zimbabwe.\u201d\n\nJuliana Kuphanga Chikandila, Primary Education Advisor and a representative of the Director of Education, Youth and Sports in Malawi, revealed that the Salima district needs approximately 50 schools to meet the demand in the region as she expressed her belief that the new school would ensure that students who had left as a result of unavailable infrastructure would return.\n\nThe lack of infrastructure needed to teach students is a major challenge in most countries with low literacy rates. In Malawi, for example, UNICEF estimates that there is a shortage of 36,000 schools. Using conventional materials, it would take 70 years to bridge this gap, but 14Trees claims that it could take as little as 14 years with 3D printing.\n\nIn January 2021, Thinking Huts, a non-profit organisation, announced plans to build what would have been the world\u2019s first 3D-printed school in the summer of 2021-2022 (December to March). Going by this development, it is a title they can no longer claim.\n\nHowever, this points to what could be a game-changer for education in Africa. Unlike conventional buildings, with 3D printing, schools can now be built in days instead of months and at less cost. Building infrastructure is one reason many African children are out of school, and 3D printing could provide a way out. But this could come at a cost.\n\nExisting research on the effects of 3D printing on humans suggests that particles which form as materials are melted are small enough that they could be dangerous to the lungs. There is a growing body of evidence that points to its harmful effects, although more research is required.\n\nWhile 3D printing could be good for education, should we be cautiously optimistic if it becomes a big deal?",

          "text": "Despite the ban on the use of motorcycles as a means of human transportation in major cities in Nigeria, foreign investors are still able to sniff untapped opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s transport and motorcycle industry.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the motorcycles usually imported from India, China, Indonesia, and Japan contributed N416 billion to the total imports in 2020, this is however a 14 percent drop from the N486 billion it contributed in the same period of 2019. The drop may be attributed to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn 2018, it achieved N204 billion, which represented an increase of 183 percent from the N72 billion realised in 2017; although data for the second quarter of 2017 was not available.\n\nAn example of manufacturers looking to tap into this market is Hero MotoCorp, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of motorcycles and scooters, which has made investments to tap from Nigeria\u2019s $153 million two-wheelers industry through its specially made-for-Nigeria motorcycle named Hunter.\n\nThe Indian manufacturer recognised an active market in Nigeria which required specific conditions, as the machine offers multiple benefits of modern technology, best mileage, longer engine life, and a comfortable long seat at an attractive introductory price.\n\nThe machine also has a metallic bash plate protecting the engine on rough roads, a combi-lock to protect it from theft, and tyre pressure monitoring indicator (accessory) to prevent deflation and puncture while on rugged terrains. Furthermore, it has an industry-first 12-month or 75,000km Engine Warranty.\n\nBeyond the production of machines for Nigerian conditions, the company affirms that it is looking to grow its presence in Nigeria through the establishment of various outlets.\n\nRead Also: Manufacturers urge enabling policies, actions to drive economic growth\n\nAnil Sahgal, managing director, Automotive Division, Kewalram Chanrai Group, the exclusive distributor of Hero MotoCorp in Nigeria, says while they focus on satisfying consumers, the company aims to significantly increase its presence in the Nigerian market\n\n\u201cHero MotoCorp is also planning to have almost forty outlets in twenty towns across Nigeria and will have a pan-country presence through dealers and parts distributors. In addition, an extensive network of over five thousand trained technicians pan-Nigeria will ensure easy access to service and parts for all customers. Powerful Ride, Smart Technology, Unmistakably Stylish,\u201d he states.\n\nIn recent years, the importation of motorcycles in Nigeria has been significantly driven by rising urbanisation, growing youth population, and increased businesses and investment.\n\nThis also presents an opportunity for more investors to come in as the Nigeria Two-Wheeler Market report by Market Research reveals that the sector has a promising future in the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria two-wheeler market is projected to surpass $153 million by 2023. Growing demand for two-wheelers in Nigeria has been backed by their higher fuel efficiency and easy manoeuvrability.\n\n\u201cMoreover, their affordability coupled with rising prices of passenger cars are further anticipated to contribute to the growing demand for two-wheelers in Nigeria over the next five years,\u201d the report states\n\nEconomic experts believe that the coming of Hero will reduce the country\u2019s unemployment rate, which currently stands at 33 percent and in the same vein boosts economic activities through the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment.\n\nFollowing the ban on the use of motorcycles as a means of human transportation in Lagos, the most populated and the busiest city in Nigeria, the ingenuity of Nigerians was piqued and this resulted in a boom in the logistics services industry.\n\nWith a minimum of N700 and a maximum of N3,000, depending on the location, urgency, and package, people can easily send and receive products in less than 24 hours. The sector has become increasingly competitive with the increase in the number of entrepreneurs, particularly online vendors.\n\nAlthough motorcycle imports have increased despite the ban, this has simply fuelled activities in the logistics industry. This has also prompted manufacturers of motorcycles like Hero MotoCorp to still see limitless opportunities in the Nigerian market.\n\nGoldStein Market Intelligence in its Nigeria Two-Wheeler Market report reveals that as of 2019 Nigeria held the position of the second biggest market in Africa\u2019s two-wheeler industry; hence it has captured the attention of Chinese and Indian manufacturers\n\n\u201cNigeria represented the second-biggest offer in the African Two-Wheeler Market in 2019, this was due to insufficient public intra-city transport framework, expanding monetary action and rising interest for last-mile conveyance purpose,\u201d it states\n\nThe report also projects that the industry is also expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.31 percent.\n\nDespite the huge demand for motorcycles, Nigeria relies on the importation of Completely Knocked Down (CKD) parts from Asian countries, which are assembled in the country.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Thursday launched the online Portal for the continuous voters registration exercise nationwide.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu made the disclosure at the national headquarters of the Commission in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the chairman, the register of voters is at the heart of democratic elections, stating that \u201ca good register of voters is a precursor to a good election. For this reason, the registration of voters is a major function of the Independent National Electoral Commission under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended)\u201d.\n\nHe noted that, \u201cIn exercising its powers under the law, the Commission undertook a fresh registration of eligible voters with every General Election until 2011 when the first reliable biometric register of voters was compiled. Thereafter, the Commission embarked on intermittent registration of voters on the eve of major elections. However, in April 2017, this Commission for the first time began the implementation of registration of voters on a continuous basis as provided in the Electoral Act. As a result, 14,283,734 new voters were added to the register by the time the process was suspended in August, 2018 in order to prepare for the 2019 General Election\u201d.\n\nThe chairman also said that, Monday 28th June 2021 remains sacrosanct, as the registration of voters will commence in full nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe are now ready to resume the CVR on Monday next week. We have acquired all the equipment for the exercise, updated our registration software and planned for the deployment of 5,346 staff to the 2,673 registration centres nationwide. Among the equipment for the exercise is a new registration machine called the INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED). This device is built around the concept of a Tablet computer and will replace the lap-top based old Direct Data Capture Machine (DDCM)\u201d.\n\nHe also noted that in the Commission\u2019s determination to serve Nigerians better during the CVR, and in response to repeated calls by stakeholders, the Commission is introducing a dedicated portal for online registration. The idea is for intending registrants to commence the process online by filling the forms and uploading their pictures and required documents, and then make an appointment on the web portal for a date and time to visit an INEC State or Local Government Area (LGA) office to give their fingerprints and complete the registration. In addition, those who are already registered as voters can carry out all the other activities such as transfers, correction of personal details and replacement of damaged or defaced Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) online. We hope that through this portal, we shall reduce overcrowding at our registration centres, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, make the registration processes generally easier, thereby giving Nigerians a pleasant electoral experience.\n\nThe exercise according to the Commission will be carried out continuously over a period of at least one year thereby, providing enough time for the Commission to reach all the nooks and crannies of the country. \u201cNo eligible Nigerian will be disenfranchised, the chairman noted.\n\nThe chairman also allayed the fears expressed by some Nigerians that many citizens may be disenfranchised by the new digital arrangement pointing out that, the Commission is aware that not all Nigerians have computers, smart phones, access to the internet or residing in urban and sub-urban areas. Some citizens may also have one form of disability or another to make it impossible for them to register online.\n\nThe Commission, Yakubu said is also aware of its responsibility under the law to provide every eligible Nigerian the opportunity to register irrespective of where they live or other circumstances of life. \u201cI wish to assure you that in addition to the online registration portal, there will be some 2,673 centres where citizens can register physically nationwide\u201d, he added.\n\n...",

The abuse of narcotics has incapacitated the workforce of organizations and ruined communities and societies.\n\n\u201cIt has brought about family disintegration, decimated the capacities of our youths and given rise to all types of crimes such as insurgency, terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, rape and violent extremism, which has fallen nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dynamism of the drug problem has made it imperative for us to continue to deepen our knowledge and understanding of this deleterious conundrum in this regard,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that the drug war cannot be won without the collaboration of all stakeholders, stating, \u201cWe need the cooperation of all and sundry: We owe Nigeria the duty of ensuring that drug abuse and trafficking do not thrive among us.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "SPECIAL REPORT: Inside Delta community which existence is threatened by flooding",
          "text": "Morgan Agidi, 84, stood at the eroded shore of Abari creek, gesturing as he spoke about the havoc flooding has wreaked on the living and the dead in his community.\n\n\u201cMost of our (late) fathers, their bones are now in the river. When they die, we bury them but erosion carries them away into the river,\u201d the octogenarian said.\n\nAbari is one of the communities on the bank of the River Niger in Patani Local Government Area of Delta State. The town is on the verge of becoming a historical reference with the yearly flood gradually washing it into the river.\n\nAccording to a research paper by Adaku Echendu, the erosion is caused by the Niger Delta coastal flood, which has left no fewer than three million persons displaced.\n\nIt is estimated that the town loses about five to six houses and farmlands to the flood annually.\n\nThis leaves many in the town and other coastal areas with only the option of relocation from the area or taking temporary accommodation with the few whose structures are yet to be impacted.\n\nA study has shown the havoc that the Niger Delta coastal flood causes annually. Climate change vulnerability is a major issue of urgent policy attention among poor coastal regions.\n\nThe Nigerian Environmental Study /Action Team (NEST) reported that sea-level rise and repeated ocean surges will not only worsen the problems of coastal erosion but will increase the problem of floods, the intrusion of seawater into freshwater sources and the ecosystems. These will affect agriculture, fisheries, and general livelihoods.\n\nA prediction in 2007 by the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says rising global temperatures will contribute to an upsurge in several floods, drought, glacier melt, and sea-level rise.\n\nIn developing countries, the pressure is expected to intensify especially on land and water resources, disrupt agricultural production and threaten food security.\n\nThe treasurer of Abari town, Peremobowei Dakromoh, said erosion is an age-long problem, which he grew up to understand as a norm.\n\n\u2018Normally, human beings die before houses. But in this community, houses die before human beings,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, in his late twenties, Mr Peremobowei said his family members had been victims of the disaster. Stretching his hands in the direction of the waterside and snapping his fingers, Mr Dakromoh said the house his late father built was swept off by erosion.\n\nHe said the government has turned a blind eye to the plight of the residents.\n\n\u201cAbari community is the first ward of Patani local government but \u2018we no know if we be part of this Nigeria,\u201d he lamented in pidgin English.\n\nDifficulties with farming, business\n\nMr Peremobowei said the main occupations of the residents are farming and fishing, but farmers and fishermen have problems taking their products to markets outside the community because there are no motorable roads.\n\nAccording to him, farmers now take their goods to the nearest market through wooden or engine boats, which he said adds between N7,000 and N10,000 to their transportation cost.\n\n\u201cThis could be half the value of the whole farm product, resulting in little or no gain,\u201d he added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIzon-Ebi Gobagha is the secretary of the town\u2019s association. He said moving crops from the farm to the nearest village for sale is even harder when the flood comes.\n\n\u201cSometimes the floods scare many farmers because sometimes our boats sink,\u201d she said.\n\nThe community\u2019s youth association chairman, Ogbotobo Godday, said farming activities have drastically reduced in the community.\n\n\u2018This community used to produce about 3,600 tonnes of yam every year, but there is nothing to write home about the figure anymore. It is frustrating.\u201d\n\nA young farmer, Ogboteh George, said the flood has dealt badly with farmers in Abari.\n\n\u201cIt (flood) has affected us so badly; so much that youth outside the community can be seen owning houses, owning okada, owning cars but we in this community have nothing.\n\n\u201cEven at our farms, when we plant our crops, they get flooded within a year, killing our crops. We are so sad about this, to be very honest,\u201d Mr Ogboteh said.\n\nHospitals, others affected\n\nIt is not only the economic endeavours that are suffering, other parts of peoples lives are also affected in the community.\n\nThere is no functional health centre or hospiral in the community and ill residents have to seek help from neighbouring communities.\n\n\u201cWe are begging the government to come and help us because we are suffering. Imagine people who are sick, before we call a boat from the nearest community, the person would have died. In short, I want to believe we are not part of the local government in Delta State. They forget us in every aspect of development,\u201d Mrs Gobagha said.\n\nSimilarly, Mr Peremobowei said, the educational sector in the town has also been affected.\n\nHe said teachers often reject posting to the community, \u201cbecause there are no motorable roads and most of them are afraid to travel by water.\u201d\n\nNDDC intervention and failed government efforts\n\nThe National President of Abari Union, Peter Pibowei, said the community had made a series of appeals since 2012 to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and other government agencies for the construction of shorelines and motorable roads. He said the appeals were all ignored.\n\nAlso, a former Chairman of Patani Local Government Area, Perez Omoun, said he had written articles, letters, and recommendations to the state and federal governments on the problems of Abari.\n\nNDDC, which was set up to address infrastructure deficit and other developmental challenges of the region, has made little impact in the region.\n\nAccording to the commission\u2019s website, in 20 years, the NDDC has awarded over 9,445 projects in the Niger Delta region. It awarded a few projects in Abari too, as shown in the table below.\n\nPROJECT YEAR AWARDED PROJECT CONTRACTOR PROJECT STATUS Construction of Home Economics, Fine Art & ICT laboratory at Abari Patani LGA, Delta state May 07, 2013 ACTIONWORKS LTD Not started Construction of Cottage Hospital in Abari, Patani L.G.A, Delta state May 31, 2012 SHADY BRIGGS NIG.

Till today, nothing has been done,\u201d he said.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES later found out that the feasibility study was assigned to Yemi Fasuyi, a consultant working for the commission.\n\nSpeaking with PREMIUM TIMES, Mr Fasuyi confirmed that in 2018, the NDDC sent him to conduct a feasibility study of the area to include \u2018the length, sea depth and pilling of shorelines.\u2019\n\nHe revealed that the report of the study with its cost has been on his desk since 2018 because \u201cwe are still debating it.\u201d\n\nMr Fasuyi said he was not sure if the shoreline contract had been awarded. But he added: \u201cEven if they want to start construction, another feasibility study needs to be taken because every year, the shore keeps collapsing and the sea depth keeps deepening.\u201d\n\nResidents of Abari lament the attitude of the government to their plight.\n\n\u201cSince I came to this town 40 years ago, we have been pleading with the government to help the town,\u201d Mr Agidi said.\n\n\u201cThey promised us heaven on earth, that they were going to help us and that we should show them where they were going to put their materials. When they came, they arranged all their materials and left. Till today, we have not seen them again,\u201d Mr Agidi said.\n\nOladapo Soneye, the spokesperson of the Nigeria Conservation Foundation, said there is a need to evacuate the area before any action is taken.\n\n\u201cThe first thing to even rescue the situation is evacuation,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking residents to a safer place because there is no way they may get help immediately and even if it is immediately, it will still take a while before any result.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Mr Soneye recommended that infrastructure like \u201cgroynes which interrupt water flow, strong solid shorelines and canals\u201d be built to manage the situation.\n\nMr Soneye further warned on the future of communities in coastal areas experiencing floods.\n\n\u201cIf actions can be taken by the government and corporations on time, we can save the situation but if nothing is done, these communities in coastal areas will disappear into the water with people being displaced. In like 20-30 years from now, you won\u2019t hear anything about these communities,\u201d he warned.\n\nSupport for this report was provided by the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ) through funding support from Ford Foundation.",

The insurance companies will not touch it. The letter of attestation is very important and in most cases, the next of kin don\u2019t know where to start from.\n\n\u201cFollowing the release of N2.5billion to pay back log of death benefits to the next of kin of deceased officers, as at today, the sum of N2, 468, 094,063.08 has been expended to settle 594 beneficiaries. The balance will be paid to other beneficiaries once the Office receives the requisite banks\u2019 attestation.\u201d\n\nThe Head of Service also chided desk heads in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) most of whom she said, lacked sufficient knowledge of what is expected of them in the processing of death benefit claims.\n\n\u201cThis office does not receive letters from the families of the dead. It is the institution that writes to the Office of the Head of the Civil Service. Even the pension desk office in the MDAs do not understand the process but we are determine on bringing the desk heads together so that we can educate them. We want to get things done properly,\u201d she assured.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the far-reaching recommendations by the Steve Oronsaye Report of 2011, Dr. Yemi-Esan was asked what had become of the report, to which she responded thus: \u201cThe Steve Oronsaye committee was a Presidential Committee domiciled at the Head of Service. It was not a committee set up by Office of the Head of Service as some people are tempted to believe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI met with the Secretary to the Government of the Federation recently and truth is the Oronsaye Report is now outdated. It was put in place ten years ago and between then and now, a lot has happened.\n\n\u201cYes, MDAs need to be rationalised and the SGF will inaugurate two committees. One of the committee will look at the Oronsaye Report and the other one will look at what happened after the report. We will then harmonised and move on.\u201d\n\nIn terms of capacity training of federal civil servants, Dr. Yemi-Esan said, \u201ca total of 1,751 Officers on Salary Grade Levels 7-10 have been inducted from 2019 till date at the Public Service Institute of Nigeria, PSIN.\n\n\u201cWe are currently strategizing to develop a virtual platform to fast track the training of backlog of officers,\u201d adding that under the Structured Mandatory Assessment-Based Training Programme, SMAT-P, \u201c1,546 officers have been trained between 2019 to date, including 159 officers trained by virtual means in March 2021.\n\n\u201cWe are currently assessing the level of infrastructure at the MDAs level in order to facilitate the roll-out of the second phase of the virtual training.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s celebration is \u2018Building the Africa we want through embracing an African culture the underpins purpose-driven leadership in the face of crisis\u2019.\u201d",

          "text": "Amidst daunting challenges facing Nigeria, the General Superintendent, Deeper Life Bible Church, Pastor William Kumuyi, Thursday, urged Nigerians to connect to God for divine intervention.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nKumuyi made the call in his message titled, \u2018Super Living Through Divine Connection\u2019 as he begins a six-day crusade in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, which is broadcast via zoom and other social media platforms reaching millions of participants across the 36 States of the federation and rest of the world.\n\nThe clergyman, who has been concerned with the spiritual, physical, health, emotional and economic challenges of Nigerians amid the COVID-19 pandemic, declared that past disappointment, defeat, labouring without progress, will be taken away from their lives if they connect to God, who has all solutions to man\u2019s challenges.\n\nThe crusade continues to June 29, 2021, and many participants connected via social media platforms as some came to the venue of the programme at the Regional Worship Centre of the Church, Kado in Abuja, where Kumuyi is ministering live to the the world.\n\nHe said: \u201cSuffering came with sinning against God. That is why there is so much suffering in the world. Today, the Lord wants to repair all that is broken down. Only come back and reconnect to Him.\n\n\u201cYou will reconnect and your life will never remain the same. You can begin to think about the freedom, power and authority the angels enjoy, and God made it so that we can enjoy the good life He planned for us. The glory and honour are coming back. The Lord will cleanse and change you, and all you lost will be restored to you.\n\n\u201cHe also made all things: sickness, suffering, oppression, calamities, etc. to be under your feet. By divine connection, from tonight, there will be a restoration of all that God planned for you originally.\u201d\n\nThe former university don turned clergy stressed that sin is an instrument used by the devil to influence people to do evil and achieve his aim of destroying human lives and all good things that would bring peace and development.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe added that sin is the spiritual challenge of man that generates physical and moral decays in the society even as he, therefore, appealed to Nigerians to connect with God, and the expected divine intervention individually, family, nationally, and socio-economically will come but through absolute repentance from all sin.\n\n\u201cYou can invite sin with one finger but at the end, ten fingers will not be enough to remove them. Many people commit sin today and they feel they are alright. We are saying tonight that when you are in sin, you are not alright.\n\n\u201cThe Lord is your Redeemer, He will save you from all troubles and problems. He knows where your goodness, prosperity, satisfaction and sufficient supplies are, and He will lead you to them as you connect to Him. After giving you all these goodness, at the end, He will take you to heaven.\n\n\u201cWhen God calls you to repentance, you have to come to Him and do away with all those things which cause disconnection, chief of which is sin,\u201d Kumuyi added.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "text": "President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan has explained that it is necessary for Nigeria to continue to borrow to fund critical projects.\n\nLawan said that it has become imperative for the Federal Government to continue to borrow responsibly to fund critical projects because Nigeria is poor.\n\nLawan disclosed this on Thursday while briefing State House correspondents following a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja.\n\nHe believes it is not reasonable for the Federal Government to tax the people more in the face of the present economic condition, adding that the country\u2019s infrastructure must be developed.\n\nHe said, \u201cYou can\u2019t, in my view and judgement, tax Nigerians further for you to raise the money for infrastructural development; other countries do that, but we\u2019ve serious situation across the country.\n\n\u201cSo, you can\u2019t put taxes on the people. The only option left is for us to borrow responsibly, utilise prudently and economically, and ensure that the projects are self-sustaining; that they can pay back the loan.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur options are really very limited as a country. First, we don\u2019t have the necessary revenue; Nigeria is poor, we shouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves. Nigeria is not rich given the circumstances we live in, given the challenges we have.\n\n\u201cOur resources are so low, our revenues are so low; therefore, the option of not doing anything just to sit (because we\u2019ve no money, we should not go for infrastructure development) is not an option worthy of consideration. You cannot keep the economy stagnant,\u201d Lawan added.\n\nLawan while giving the assurance that the National Assembly would give legislative approval to the Executive loan request to fund the 2021 Appropriation Act before it embarked on a recess in July said Nigeria has no other choice than to borrow money and the option of private-public partnerships and Internally Generation Revenue (IGR) was not worthy of consideration.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to assure Nigerians here is that we are not going to be frivolously supporting or approving loans for the Executive arm of government; whenever we have to approve any loan, we will insist on the details of the funding to look at the conditions that are attached to the loans and they must be favourable conditions before we approve.\n\n\u201cThe other option is probably private partnership \u2013 you need to create the environment to attract investors to come into your country. Because of the security challenges we face today, not many investors would like to come to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn fact, even those inside Nigeria may not like to invest properly in the sector of infrastructure development,\u201d he said.",

Local government is created with the ultimate goal of bringing government closer to the grassroots. It is aimed at accelerating development at the bottom-levelled tier through the holistic participation of the local population. Several people have decried how the third tier of Government has been deprived, denied and dragged down by the other superior tiers in Nigeria. I make bold to say that these power differentials and asymmetry that have accounted for reasons why those at the grass roots have continued to entirely suffer with no access to their deserved democratic dividends.\n\nDespite the popular endorsement of local government as a potent system to mobilize people for local participation in governance, what we have seen so far is that the state governments have taken over the statutory functions of the local government. Local governments now suffer from paucity of fund resulting in inability to cater for their basic responsibilities. As an authority in local government administration in Nigeria, It is necessary I join align my voice with others that for our local government to be efficient in administration and free from the unbridled interference \u2013 perhaps its hijack \u2013 by the state governments, there should be a clinical review of the constitution to make local governments truly autonomous especially on the issues of fiscal powers, functions and responsibilities.\n\nI opine strongly that the local government should be empowered to own the discretion and right to manage its resources by itself, just like the state government and Federal Government, the second and first tiers of government. The recent attempt by the House of Representatives to delist the local government as the third tier of government is not only shocking, disappointing, but in the eye of the sane public bereft of logic. It was as though in the minds of the proponents of the delisting, the third tier constitutes the bulk of the challenges Nigeria is faced with, hence the urgent need for its delisting or eradication. For the records, 52.68 per cent of the FAAC distribution goes to the Federal Government, 26.72 per cent goes to the state governments, while the remaining 20.60 per cent for the local government is also hijacked by the state government, therefore leaving the local Government at the mercy of the State Government.\n\nThis is plus the fact that the state governments enjoy other means of funding. From the finance act 2020, 14 per centg goesto the Federal budget, 1 per cent to the Federal Capital Territory, 4 per cent to the Federal Inland Revenue Service being the Collector, and 50 per cent go to the State Government, 35 per cent to the local government. The 35 per cent for the local government is also hijacked by the state government. This should bother every right-thinking Nigerian. Ideally the Local Government is supposed to be the delivery authority on Pre- primary, primary, adult and vocational education, agricultural and national resource development, primary health care, water systems, town planning, environment and public sanitation comprising the refuse collection and disposal, cemeteries and crematoria, slaughterhouses among other areas. Also parks and open spaces within the locality. It is very unfortunate, to say the least that almost all of these core duties of the local government have been taken over by the state government. The local government has been paralysed, and no wonder there is increase in crime since every criminal is from a locality. I hold a strong view that the effort of the state governments and local governments are supposed to be complimentary. The reason most minor roads are bad in Nigeria, even in Lagos, is because the Local Government System is near zero in capacity and competence.\n\nThe performances up and down the ladder are what is required for a working democracy that will allow everyone to benefit from its dividends. The National Union of Local Government Employees\u2019 Leadership was absolutely right when it warned the House of Representatives not to even entertain a debate of such matter, let alone giving it serious consideration. What we need an amendment of the constitution that will grant autonomy, more importantly the financial autonomy, to the Local tier, proscribe the State Independent Electoral Commission and allow local government elections to be conducted at the same time as the general elections. The present system that empowers the governors to principally direct the affairs and decide what happens at the local government level needs to be abolished. Whether politically, or in any other sense, it won\u2019t still be correct to continue this way.\n\nIt has not worked and no matter how we try, it will never work. This current provision of the constitution which allows the state government to provide for the establishment, structure, composition, finance and functions of local councils ridicules the expected autonomy the local government administrators should ordinarily enjoy since their decisions and relevance are determined by their governors. What we have today as chairmen of local governments are special assistants to their various governors on community mobilisation with no executive power to really make things work for the progress of their local councils. In granting a local council autonomy, the State Joint Local Government Account where monthly allocations are paid into should be split, with each tier receiving and absolutely responsible for the distribution of its resources (allocation).\n\nRather than debate how the Local Government system would be delisted as a tier of government in Nigeria, the National Assembly is hereby advised that what is necessary is the amendment of the constitution to clearly establish the three tiers of government and declare the local government as an autonomous unit of the federation and clearly spell out the powers and functions of the local government. Until greed crept in through the governors, the three tiers of government were designed to complement one another in the delivery of dividends of democracy to the citizenry.

          "text": "Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily announced Wednesday it will print its final edition after authorities arrested staff and froze its assets using a sweeping new national security law, silencing the city\u2019s most China critical media outlet. The decision is the latest blow to Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms and deepens unease over whether the international finance centre can remain a media hub as China seeks to stamp out dissent. Small crowds gathered outside the paper\u2019s headquarters on Wednesday evening, shouting messages of support and shining mobile phone lights as journalists put together the swansong edition. Reporters said they planned to print one million copies overnight \u2014 a staggering number given Hong Kong\u2019s 7.5 million population.\n\n\u201cI have tens of thousands of words in my heart but I am speechless at this moment,\u201d Ip Yut-kin, chairman of the paper\u2019s parent company Next Digital, told AFP. Apple Daily has long been a thorn in Beijing\u2019s side, with unapologetic support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement and caustic criticism of China\u2019s authoritarian leaders. Those same leaders have used a new security law to bring about its rapid demise. Owner Jimmy Lai, currently in jail for attending democracy protests, was among the first to be charged under the law after its imposition last year. But the final chapter of the 26-year-old paper was written over the last week when authorities deployed the security law to raid the newsroom, arrest senior executives and freeze its assets. That last move crippled the paper\u2019s ability to conduct business and pay staff.\n\nOn Wednesday, Apple Daily announced its closure \u201cout of consideration for the safety of its staff\u201d. Its website will go offline overnight. Some 1,000 people have lost their jobs. The government-run science park that hosts the paper\u2019s headquarters also chose Wednesday evening to announce that the company was in breach of its lease and that legal steps were being taken to seize the building. \u2018Chilling\u2019 \u201cHong Kongers lost a media organisation that dared to speak up and insist on defending the truth,\u201d eight local journalist associations said in a joint statement, as they called on colleagues to dress in black on Thursday. British foreign secretary Dominic Raab accused Hong Kong\u2019s authorities of spearheading a \u201cforced closure\u201d of the paper, describing it as \u201ca chilling demonstration of their campaign to silence all opposition voices\u201d.\n\nChina imposed its security law on Hong Kong last year after the city was convulsed by huge and often violent democracy protests. The prosecution of Apple Daily was sparked by articles and columns that allegedly supported international sanctions against China, a view now deemed illegal. Lai, chief editor Ryan Law and CEO Cheung Kim-hung have all been charged with colluding with foreign forces to undermine China\u2019s national security and remanded into custody. On Wednesday Yeung Ching-kee, one of the paper\u2019s top columnists, was arrested on the same charge. The decision to freeze Apple Daily\u2019s assets also laid bare the sweeping powers now at the disposal of Hong Kong authorities to pursue any company deemed to be a national security threat.\n\nMultiple international media companies have regional headquarters in Hong Kong, attracted to the business-friendly regulations and free speech provisions written into the city\u2019s mini-constitution. But many local and international outlets are questioning whether they have a future there. \u201cEvery journalist in Hong Kong now has a metaphorical gun pointed at their heads,\u201d Sharron Fast, a lecturer at the University of Hong Kong\u2019s journalism school, told AFP. \u201cWhen the result of your writing can lead to lifetime imprisonment -\u2013 you are being censored. Apple will not be the last \u2014 just the latest.\u201d First trial Hong Kong has plunged down an annual press freedom ranking by Reporters Without Borders, from 18th place in 2002 to 80th this year. Mainland China languishes at 177th out of 180, above only Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea. China and Hong Kong\u2019s authorities have hailed the security law for successfully restoring stability after the 2019 demonstrations and said media outlets must not \u201csubvert\u201d the government.\n\nAuthorities initially said the law would only target \u201ca tiny minority\u201d. But it has radically transformed the political and legal landscape of a city that China promised would be able to keep key liberties and autonomy after its 1997 return. On Wednesday the first trial under the new law got under way for a man accused of riding a motorbike into police officers. His trial is not being heard by a jury in a major departure from Hong Kong\u2019s common law traditions. His case is unusual because he is the only Hong Konger so far charged under the security law with an explicitly violent act. More than 60 people have now been charged under the law, including some of the city\u2019s best-known democracy activists, but their offences are related to political views or speech that authorities have declared illegal.",
          "summary": "Reporters said they planned to print one million copies overnight \u2014 a staggering number given Hong Kong\u2019s 7.5 million population.\nApple Daily has long been a thorn in Beijing\u2019s side, with unapologetic support for Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement and caustic criticism of China\u2019s authoritarian leaders.\nBritish foreign secretary Dominic Raab accused Hong Kong\u2019s authorities of spearheading a \u201cforced closure\u201d of the paper, describing it as \u201ca chilling demonstration of their campaign to silence all opposition voices\u201d.\nChina imposed its security law on Hong Kong last year after the city was convulsed by huge and often violent democracy protests.\n\u201cEvery journalist in Hong Kong now has a metaphorical gun pointed at their heads,\u201d Sharron Fast, a lecturer at the University of Hong Kong\u2019s journalism school, told AFP.",

          "text": "President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has explained why it is important for the Nigerian government to continue to borrow responsibly to fund critical projects in the country.\n\nHe believes it is not feasible for the government to tax the people further in the face of the present economic situation and the nation\u2019s infrastructure must be developed.\n\nThe Senate President made the remarks on Thursday while briefing State House correspondents after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cYou cannot, in my view and judgement, tax Nigerians further for you to raise the money for infrastructural development; other countries do that, but we have serious situation across the country.\n\nSo, you cannot put taxes on the people. The only option left is for use to borrow responsibly, utilise prudently and economically, and ensure that the projects are self-sustaining; that they can pay back the loans,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Lawan added, \u201cOur options are really very limited as a country. First, we do not have the necessary revenue; Nigeria is poor, we should not deceive ourselves. Nigeria is not rich given the circumstances we live in, given the challenges we have.\n\n\u201cOur resources are so low, our revenues are so low; therefore, the option of not doing anything just to sit (because we have no money, we should not go for infrastructure development) is not an option worthy of consideration. You cannot keep the economy stagnant.\u201d\n\nInvestors Not Willing\n\nHe gave the assurance that the National Assembly would give legislative approval to the Executive loan request to fund the 2021 Appropriation Act before it embarked on a recess in July.\n\nThe lawmaker reiterated that the 2021 Supplementary Bill would also go through final consideration before the recess to fast-track the government\u2019s procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and military hardware to tackle insecurity.\n\nWhile stressing the need to borrow funds, he stated that the Legislature would not just support or approve loans for the executive.\n\nThe Senate President noted that this would be done only after investigating the implementation of such loans through oversight functions to ensure that they were directly deployed for intended projects.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria has no other choice than to borrow money and the option of private-public partnerships and Internally Generation Revenue (IGR) was not worthy of consideration.\n\nSenator Lawan said, \u201cWhat I want to assure Nigerians here is that we are not going to be frivolously supporting or approving loans for the Executive arm of government; whenever we have to approve any loan, we will insist on the details of the funding to look at the conditions that are attached to the loans and they must be favourable conditions before we approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other option is probably private partnership \u2013 you need to create the environment to attract investors to come into your country. Because of the security challenges we face today, not many investors would like to come to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn fact, even those inside Nigeria may not like to invest properly in the sector of infrastructure development,\u201d he said.",

This is a problem that needs to be solved urgently and we are communicating this very clearly to our international partners on behalf of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cRecently, we were encouraged by the swell of contributions and pledges from major nations into COVAX.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRich nations of the world are showing greatly increased recognition that there must be more supply produced and it must be distributed much more fairly, and they are becoming active in solving this,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib disclosed that the U.S. government has also reconfirmed its donation of 80 million doses by the end of this month.\n\n\u201cThese supplies and other large donations of vaccines to COVAX that are now planned will enable COVAX to supply new consignments to Nigeria and other nations who need vaccines now,\u201d he added.",
          "summary": "The Federal government has announced an extension of the deadline for second dose of COVID-19 vaccine.\nAccording to Faisal Shuaib, Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development, the administration of the second dose of the vaccine was supposed to end on June 25.\nAccording to him, a total of 2,099,568 people have been vaccinated with their first doses, while 1,005,234 have received their second doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as of 24th June 2021.\nHe said, \u201cYou would recall that the initial closing date for second dose administration was 25th of June, 2021.\nEven though we have extended the timeline for the second dose administration until 5th of July 2021.",

          "title": "Russia Mandates Vaccinations for Some as Virus Cases Surge",
          "text": "They tried grocery giveaways and lotteries for new cars and apartments. But an ambitious plan of vaccinating 30 million Russians by mid-June still has fallen short by a third.\n\nSo now, many regional governments across the vast country are obligating some workers to get vaccinated and requiring the shots to enter certain businesses, like restaurants.\n\nAs many Western countries lift coronavirus restrictions and plan a return to normal life after mass vaccinations, Russia is battling a surge of infections \u2014 even though it was the first in the world to authorize a vaccine and among the first to start administering it in December.\n\nDaily new cases have grown from about 9,000 in early June to about 17,000 on June 18 and over 20,000 on Thursday, with Moscow, its outlying region and St. Petersburg combining for about half of all new infections.\n\nOfficials have blamed Russians\u2019 lax attitude toward taking necessary precautions and the growing prevalence of more infectious variants. But perhaps the biggest factor is the lack of vaccinations.\n\nOnly 20.7 million people, or 14% of its population of 146 million, have received at least one shot as of Wednesday, and only 16.7 million, or about 11%, have been fully vaccinated.\n\nExperts say those numbers are due to several factors, including the public\u2019s wariness of the rushed approval and rollout of the Sputnik V vaccine; an official narrative that Russia had tamed its outbreak; criticism on state TV of other vaccines as dangerous; and a weak promotional campaign that included incentives such as consumer giveaways.\n\nIn light of the surge, at least 14 Russian regions \u2014 from Moscow and St. Petersburg to the remote far-eastern region of Sakhalin \u2014 made vaccinations mandatory this month for employees in certain sectors, such as government offices, retail, health care, education, restaurants, fitness centers, beauty parlors and other service industries.\n\nMoscow authorities said companies should suspend without pay employees unwilling to get vaccinated, and they threatened to temporarily halt operations of businesses that don\u2019t meet the goal of having 60% of staff get at least one shot by July 15 and both shots by Aug. 15.\n\nAs of Monday, all Moscow restaurants, cafes and bars will admit only customers who have been vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19 in the past six months, or can provide a negative coronavirus test from the previous 72 hours. City officials also limited most elective hospital care to those who are fully vaccinated or can provide tests showing they have antibodies to fight the infection.\n\nThe moves seem to be an act of desperation by authorities.\n\n\u201cThey backed themselves into a corner, they have no choice now,\u201d said Judy Twigg, a political science professor specializing in global health at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\n\u201cThey overhyped this vaccine so that people didn\u2019t trust it. Then they took a series of measures that were clearly attempted to make it seem as though the government had everything under control, the pandemic was no big deal. \u2026 And now they\u2019re in this situation, not surprisingly, where low vaccination rates have left an opening for the delta variant to come in,\u201d she said.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted Thursday the vaccinations in Moscow were \u201cvoluntary,\u201d because those refusing to get the shot can still seek a different job.\n\nThe governor of the southern region of Krasnodar, home to the Black Sea resort of Sochi, said hotels and sanitariums will only accommodate vacationers with a negative coronavirus test or a vaccination certificate starting July 1. As of Aug. 1, only vaccinated individuals will be admitted.\n\nThe mandates have drawn mixed responses, with some saying they are welcome if they prevent closures of businesses, while other say it\u2019s unclear how employers can persuade those who don\u2019t want the shots.\n\n\u201cMost restaurateurs believe that vaccination is necessary,\u201d said Sergei Mironov, founder of a restaurant chain and vice president of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers. \u201cBut it is necessary to create (the right) conditions for the vaccination (drive).\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are too many rumors, and even doctors say different things,\u201d and convincing younger employees to get vaccinated is especially difficult, he said.\n\nTatyana Moskalkova, the government\u2019s human rights commissioner, said the unvaccinated have cited discrimination by employers, with threats of dismissal or withholding bonuses.\n\nAt a TV awards ceremony Tuesday, popular actor Yegor Beroyev wore a yellow star akin to those worn by Jews under the Nazis in World War II, and he spoke of \u201cwaking up in a world where (COVID-19 vaccination) became an identification mark of whether you are a citizen, \u2026 will you be able to visit institutions and events, will you enjoy all the benefits and rights.\u201d\n\nAs proof of vaccination for entering a restaurant, customers must visit a government website and get a QR code, a digital pattern designed to be read by a scanner.\n\nRestaurant owners won concessions Thursday when Moscow agreed the QR codes aren\u2019t needed for the next two weeks at establishments with outdoor terraces, and underage customers won\u2019t have to provide documentation if accompanied by their parents.\n\nStill, the situation for many restaurants \u201cis hard and will be harder by the day,\u201d Mironov said.\n\nIn Moscow, online searches for fake inoculation documents increased shortly after the mayor announced mandatory vaccinations, social anthropologist Alexandra Arkhipova told an online lecture on vaccine hesitancy.\n\nPolice quickly cracked down, launching 24 criminal cases last week against sellers of fake vaccination certificates. Still, several accounts offering the bogus documents could be found easily on the Telegram messaging app this week.\n\nThe number of such offers has grown about 19% every month since March, said Evgeny Egorov, digital risk protection analyst at Group-IB, a Singapore-based cybersecurity company. In mid-June, Group-IB found at least 90 active offers, he said.\n\nThe independent pollster Levada Center said polls show about 60% of Russians are unwilling to get vaccinated.\n\nLevada director and sociologist Denis Volkov said the vaccination mandates could change the minds of many because it\u2019s a clear signal from the government that the shots are necessary.\n\n\u201cI often hear (from respondents) that they wouldn\u2019t do it, are afraid and so on, but if there are restrictions, and it is required for travel, state services, or at work, then yes,\u201d Volkov said.\n\nIt could be starting to change attitudes. Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova said the average vaccination rate across Russia has almost doubled in the past week, and long lines have been seen at pop-up vaccination clinics in Moscow shopping malls.\n\nA demand for vaccines could also lead to shortages. As of mid-May, just over 33 million doses were produced in Russia, and a significant amount was exported.\n\nSeveral regions have reported supply problems this week, but Peskov said those were \u201ctemporary logistical difficulties.\u201d",

          "text": "The World Bank on Thursday reiterated its call for both state and the federal governments in Nigeria to adopt policies that would increase non-oil revenue.\n\nIn a presentation Thursday during a webinar titled: \u201cOptions to Raise Revenue in Time of Crisis,\u201d Senior Public Sector Specialist at the World Bank, Mr. Rajul Awasthi, listed measures which included enhancing excise rates; implementing the electronic money transfer levy as contained in the Finance Act; rationalising tax expenditures; and reforming key tax statutes at the federal level, as measures that could help improve revenue collections for Nigeria\u2019s weak economy.\n\nOther measures, which Awasthi advised the country to adopt in the long-term, are improving revenue from cross-border transactions and other international tax measures as well as enhancing internally generated revenue.\n\nHe also advised both the state and the federal governments to embark on property tax reforms by updating or completing property records.\n\nThe World Bank official stated that Nigeria is Africa\u2019s biggest economy, but presently, the country has the lowest tax-to-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio of just 4.5 per cent.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe all know that revenues are essential to provide ensure services, provide security and deliver critical services. But what has happened is the COVID-19-related slowdown and the very low crude oil prices really took the economy into recession and revenues plunged in 2020.\n\n\u201cNow, given that this is a time of crisis, we really have to calibrate our policy response to ensure that we don\u2019t endanger investment, jobs and growth. That was the critical underlying policy imperative that we kept in mind in crafting these suggestions.\n\n\u201cYou cannot increase again, the rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) and Company Income Tax (CIT). Those kinds of reforms are out of the question. But there is a lot of potential in Nigeria for what we call low-hanging revenue yielding fruits.\n\n\u201cFor example, increasing \u2018Sin Taxes.\u2019 The Finance Act 2020 provided for a levy on electronic transfer that hasn\u2019t yet being implemented. There is a revenue potential there. There is also a need to rationalise tax expenditure. That means evaluating the tax expenditure to see which of them are actually fulfilling the policy objectives for which they were put in place. If they are not, then you get rid of them because they are only draining revenues.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank estimated that if the aforementioned measures are adopted, the country\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio could go up to seven per cent within three years, generating an additional N10 trillion in non-oil revenue.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria has one of the lowest rates on alcohol and cigarette.\n\nHe added that the amount being charged by the country as excise duty on cigarette is even lower than the ECOWAS average.\n\n\u201cSo, we estimate that if Nigeria adopts same rate of excise that Kenya adopted, the country can raise significant revenue. These are \u2018sin\u2019 goods; so taxing them will also be good from the health perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stressed the need to remove loopholes in Nigeria\u2019s tax administration as well as ensure better tax compliance.\n\nAwasthi said: \u201cAccording to our analysis, you can double non-oil revenues with minimum disruption of the economy. We (the World Bank and IMF) are working with the tax administration agencies to strengthen capacity and improve the ability to enforce compliance.\n\n\u201cIn terms of property tax reform, we are working with the states to ensure that property registers are updated, laying a strong foundation for them, so as to improve revenues from property taxation. Obviously, this will not impact the poor because they do not have large properties.\n\n\u201cOn Personal Income Tax, this is where the states have to take actions by bringing in revenue-raising measures through better access to data so as to improve tax compliance.\u201d\n\nThe multilateral institution also estimated that Nigeria loses about N3.1 trillion in VAT leakages.\n\nThe estimate of VAT revenue loss covers both VAT policy choices and compliance gaps, it added.\n\nThe World Bank stated that the country has much greater revenue potential from VAT than currently being achieved.\n\n\u201cGiven no input tax credit (ITC) on capital goods, Nigeria embeds VAT in capital investment that impacts all sectors. Capital investment is key to productivity gain; an efficient VAT stimulates such investment.\n\n\u201cBut, a significant amount of Nigeria\u2019s current VAT revenue likely comes from taxation of capital investment, so this reform will have a significant revenue impact,\u201d it added.",
          "summary": "The World Bank on Thursday reiterated its call for both state and the federal governments in Nigeria to adopt policies that would increase non-oil revenue.\nHe also advised both the state and the federal governments to embark on property tax reforms by updating or completing property records.\nThe estimate of VAT revenue loss covers both VAT policy choices and compliance gaps, it added.\nThe World Bank stated that the country has much greater revenue potential from VAT than currently being achieved.\n\u201cBut, a significant amount of Nigeria\u2019s current VAT revenue likely comes from taxation of capital investment, so this reform will have a significant revenue impact,\u201d it added.",

          "text": "The head of the British Olympic Association (BOA) says the organisation is still \u201ctrying to convince\u201d some athletes to have the Covid vaccine before Tokyo 2020 starts next month.\n\nChief executive Andy Anson said \u201cwell over 90%\u201d of British athletes will have two vaccine doses by the Olympics. But he also admitted \u201cthere are individuals who didn\u2019t want to be vaccinated\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to convince them it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cPeople have got the right to choose, and we have to respect that. But it\u2019s not necessarily that helpful.\u201d\n\nIn a wide-ranging and exclusive interview with The Sports Desk podcast, Anson said the BOA had been running a \u201cmammoth programme of vaccination of the whole entourage, well over 1,000 people\u2026 because that will lessen the risk\u201d, but there had been challenges.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some difficulties with some athletes who have been travelling around the continent,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that nearly everyone will have at least one dose. We\u2019ll keep trying right until the last minute.\u201d\n\nThe Olympics were postponed for the first time in their history in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and are set to go ahead on 23 July, despite significant opposition from the public and medical experts in Japan.\n\nOrganisers insist they will be safe and secure, but the vaccination roll-out has been slow.\n\nCoronavirus case numbers have been falling since May, when there were more than 6,000 a day across Japan, and a state of emergency in Tokyo has been lifted.\n\nIn the host city, experts have said the daily infection rate should be below 100 in order to hold the Games safely.\n\nHowever, the city\u2019s health authorities reported 619 new infections on 23 June, and the average for the last seven days is 423 new cases a day.\n\nThe BOA is sending a team of more than 370 athletes to the event.\n\nAnson said the 18,000-bed athletes\u2019 village in Tokyo will be \u201cprobably the toughest environment in sports at this time\u201d.\n\n\u201cEleven thousand athletes basically sharing one dining hall, that\u2019s the challenge.\n\n\u201cSo we are putting in place very strict protocols along with the organisers to make sure, to the fullest extent possible, we follow the rules of isolation, distancing, and just keeping in our own \u2018semi bubbles\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe will eat together \u2013 we won\u2019t be mixing in the village like people normally would. So that\u2019s the tough bit. But we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve got enough people around from a medical perspective to make sure that environment is as safe as it possibly can be.\u201d\n\nThis week two Ugandan athletes tested positive after arriving in Japan despite being fully vaccinated.\n\nWhen asked if he feared similar cases involving British athletes, Anson said: \u201cI\u2019d be a little naive if I said there weren\u2019t going to be.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to plan that there will be cases\u2026 we anticipate that and when there are cases, we manage them properly.\n\n\u201cBut clearly there is that risk that people test positive.\n\n\u201cBeing vaccinated gives you a chance to get out of any quarantine environments earlier.\n\n\u201cI think we all know that this pandemic is a very difficult thing to manage.\u201d\n\nAthletes suspected of having Covid will be sent to the village\u2019s \u2018fever clinic\u2019, and could be moved to an \u2018isolation hotel\u2019 if a positive case is confirmed, ruling them out of their events.\n\n\u201cThe athletes are very aware of the risks, because they\u2019ve been competing and some have seen colleagues miss competition,\u201d said Anson.\n\n\u201cWe have some brilliant people who are very focused on mental health and wellbeing. But it won\u2019t be easy if it happens.\u201d\n\nAnson confirmed that Team GB athletes would not need to quarantine for six days on arrival in Japan after the UK was added to to Japan\u2019s travel \u2018red list\u2019 because of rising cases of the Delta variant.\n\n\u201cWe got in contact with the IOC and said that would be completely unfair. And they acknowledged that straight away,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey came up with this plan for Team GB, where for three days after arrival we won\u2019t be able to train or mix with athletes from other nations. But that\u2019s fine, because the vast majority of our athletes are going to the preparation camp which is our own environment.\u201d\n\nDespite the restrictions, Anson believes athletes will still be able to enjoy the Olympics.\n\n\u201cOne of the messages that came to us very early on from the athletes was, \u2018please don\u2019t make this the Covid Games for us. We want to see this as the Olympic Games. It\u2019s our chance to shine.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo we as an organisation are obsessing about the impact of Covid. We\u2019re trying to take all of that weight off the athletes\u2019 shoulders so they can go out there and compete and enjoy it without worrying about all this other stuff. So I think they can be fun.\n\n\u201cThere are some sad things \u2013 the fact the athletes have to leave the village within two days of competing and then come home means they won\u2019t be able to watch their fellow athletes.\n\n\u201cFriends and family were the one group we were trying to push back on to see if they would be allowed in the country. But the Japanese government, rightly probably, took the decision there were no international visitors.\n\n\u201cSo that is a shame, but we will make it as positive an environment as possible.\u201d\n\nDespite fears the Games may trigger a surge in coronavirus infections, up to 10,000 Japanese fans will be permitted at venues.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bigger and better than the Olympics for uniting the whole world. Yes, it\u2019s going to be tough, and different,\u201d said Anson.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m absolutely convinced it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got the chance to lift the whole country and actually the world, and it could be an amazing experience.\u201d\n\nAnson admitted that cancellation of the Games would have meant a \u201cvery difficult situation for the BOA\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd that would have been replicated all around the world, not just for national Olympic committees, but for international federations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been about greed. It\u2019s been about the financial sustainability of the whole sporting landscape.\u201d",
