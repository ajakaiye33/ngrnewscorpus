I want the Governor to realize they are making a mistake.\n\n\u201cI have been on this issue for quite some times. This invasion has been on and these herdsmen are all over the forests.\n\n\u201cAt a time we thought it was Boko Haram, we didn\u2019t know that Fulani herdsmen were capitalising on the fundamentalist insurgency and brutality.\n\n\u201cAnd that is why we see a nexus of operation between ISWAP, Boko Haram and Fulani herdsmen.\n\n\u201cThey work singularly, individually and they work collectively.

The state wants to appreciate you for finding time to come at this hours of grieve.\n\n\u201cThis is like a dagger drawn to our heart, and it is an assault on our psyche. The psyche of those of us in the South-West and Western Region.\n\n\u201cI think they think they can create some fears in us but they made a mistake because this will make us more fierce in our condemnation of their actions.

Even some have been killed by these criminal elements always described as unknown gunnmen or bandits.\n\n\u201cGod will never come down to defend us from the sinister and prey of these evil-minded and blood-thirsty monsters. He has endowed us with brain and knowledge of what to do to survive as a people in all situations.\n\n\u201cAnd we want to assure our people that we are not going to fold our arms and allow these people to operate freely and unchecked on our God-given land. But we need the cooperation of the people and our traditional rulers to play our part as traditionalists, who are prepared to combat these aggressive crooks the way our forefathers did to their forebears.\u201d\n\nThe traditionalists lamented the non cooperation of many traditional rulers, particularly in Yoruba land to work with them to secure their domains and by extension promote and protect the tradition and culture of their people to which they have sworn to uphold.\n\nAccording to them, the monarchs are carried away by their \u201cnewfound\u201d religious faiths and, therefore, could not maintain a spiritual balance required of them as royal fathers to their subjects.\n\nThe traditionalists, who maintained that the assailants should not be seen as Moslems but as terroirists, asked the Yoruba people to put aside their religious differences and come together to fight a common cause for posterity.",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primary may have come and gone but the Pandora Box of intrigues, cutthroat politicking, predictions, counter-permutations, and upsets that all characterized the contest linger on.\n\nThe emergence of former Lagos governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, proved political pundits, online and social media polls wrong. Like a soldier, he displayed gallantry by defeating all comers to win the presidential ticket of the party at the Eagle Square, Abuja.\n\nMany congratulatory messages have continued to pour in for him. But in all of these, the former Lagos governor made a striking point saying Buhari showed that he is trustworthy by not endorsing any of the presidential hopefuls.\n\nRecall the President had during an interview on Channels Television last year revealed that he actually had an anointed successor but he would not unveil the person for the fear that such an individual could be \u201celiminated.\u201d\n\nBuhari, last week also urged governors of the ruling party and other stakeholders to allow him to choose his successor. All of these birthed fears and issues between the North and the South.\n\nBut in the end, all of these controversies were laid to rest after an elective process was conducted. Tinubu said: \u201cHe (Buhari) promised the entire country and the world that he will build a legacy of transparency and consistency, the legacy of level playing ground for all the candidates, that he will be committed to democratic principles and values and he did so.\n\n\u201cHe did not endorse anybody, he did not impose anybody, and he did not at any time attempt to tinker with the process of this election to favour one tribe or the other. He was steadfast, trustworthy, dependable, and a great leader.\n\n\u201cIt is not my victory that is important, it is the process and management of that election that gave it to President Muhammadu Buhari,\u201d Tinubu said.\n\nBuhari in his response urged APC governors to work for the victory of Tinubu, saying the success story of the party at the 2015 and 2019 polls should be repeated in next year\u2019s election.\n\nAPC National Chairman Abdullahi Adamu said, \u201cTinubu is the collective project of the party\u201d.\n\nThe President, in a letter to Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) chairman, Kebbi State Governor Atiku Bagudu, described Wednesday\u2019s shadow poll as the most competitive and peaceful in national history.\n\nWith his emergence as the party flagbearer, political observers argued that if any presidential election is held today, Tinubu, by the account of his political experience and antecedents, would emerge victorious.\n\nTinubu, reputed for his political shrewdness and unbeatable strategy, was the first in APC to openly declare his presidential interest. He reached out to delegates earlier than the others and covered more grounds. In all of the last-minute intrigues and horse-trading, The Nation had tipped Tinubu to win the presidential ticket of the party due to a number of factors including nationwide recognition, reach, structure, support, endorsements, mass appeal, track record as governor of Lagos State, rich experience in both the private and public sectors. Alas, the projection is vindicated.\n\nWith this strategic feat, Tinubu \u2014 the Asiwaju of Lagos, Jagaban Borgu, and \u201cLion\u201d of Bourdillon \u2014 aptly fits into the description of the \u201clast man standing\u201d among his peers after the Fourth Republic was inaugurated 21 years ago.\n\nYear after year from 1999 to this moment, Tinubu has remained a strong factor in defining the outcomes of elections not just as a kingmaker but as a regent.\n\nInterestingly, Tinubu\u2019s cult of followers keeps expanding. He has mentored politicians across the country, many of who became governors, senators, House of Representatives members, or were elected or appointed through his support.\n\nHis political allies especially the intimidating circle of experienced grassroots politicians, mobilisers of voters, formidable political network, and propensity for deal-making all contributed to Tinubu\u2019s victory.\n\nAt the contest, many were greeted with the shock of bigwigs stepping down their aspirations for Tinubu. The immediate past Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio; former Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Dimeji Bankole; Governor of Jigawa State, Abubakar Badaru; senator representing Ondo North Senatorial District, Prof. Ajayi Boroffice, and Uju Ohanenye pledged their support to Tinubu.\n\nIn the end, Tinubu polled 1,271 votes to defeat 13 other presidential hopefuls, with Rotimi Amaechi, former minister of transportation, coming a very distant second after scoring 316. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo got 235 while Senate President Ahmad Lawan, the proclaimed consensus candidate of Abdullahi Adamu, APC national chairman, polled 152.\n\nThe magnitude and depth of the celebration which greeted the announcement of Tinubu as the winner, explains the unifying influence which he has become on his party.\n\nIn writing the history of the hard-fought political battles and well-deserved electoral victory, Tinubu\u2019s name would be engraved in the pages.\n\nTinubu will slug it out with Atiku Abubakar (Peoples Democratic Party; Dumebi Kachikwu (African Democratic Congress); Prince Malik Ado-Ibrahim (Young Progressives Party); Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso (New Nigeria Peoples\u2019 Party) and Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP).\n\nOthers are Prince Adewole Adeboye (Social Democratic Party (SDP); Omoyele Sowore (African Action Congress); Kola Abiola (Peoples\u2019 Redemption Party); Peter Umeadi (All Progressives Grand Alliance); Dan Nwanyanwu (Zenith Labour Party); Christopher Imumolen (Accord Party) and Maj. Hamza Mustapha (Action Alliance).\n\nAs the countdown to 2023 begins \u2014 a year that many pundits have predicted to be a decisive year in the historical evolution of the Nigerian nation, it presents a remarkable opportunity for Nigerian citizens to make a critical decision.",

          "text": "By \u2018Dare Odufowokan, Assistant Editor; and Gbenga Omokhunu, Abuja\n\n\u2022 PDP committee to meet South-South, Southeast caucuses\n\n\u2022 Competence, knowledge of economy may determine APC pick\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are racing against time to pick their presidential running mates ahead of next Friday\u2019s deadline handed down by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nAlhaji Abubakar Atiku who was elected PDP\u2019s flag bearer two weeks ago and APC\u2019s Asiwaju Bola Tinubu who emerged as candidate last Tuesday have been brainstorming with the hierarchy of their party on their prospective deputies and the parameters for selecting them.\n\nBoth candidates, party sources said yesterday, are laying emphasis on competence and ability by their would be running mates to attract votes.\n\nWhile Atiku has already constituted a committee to complement his own effort in the search for a running mate, Tinubu is continuing consultations with groups and individuals for advice.\n\nParty sources told The Nation yesterday that the two major factors that will be critical in Tinubu\u2019s choice of running mate are competence and a deep knowledge of the economy.\n\n\u201cAs you well know, Nigeria\u2019s biggest challenges right now are the economy and security. So what the APC candidate requires is a vice presidential candidate with a sound understanding of the economy; someone who can help drive the economic agenda of the government, the main trust of his (Tinubu\u2019s) manifesto,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nThe APC governors are to be actively involved in the search, Bayo Onanuga, spokesman for the Tinubu Campaign Organisation, said earlier in the week following the candidate\u2019s meeting with the governors.\n\n\u201cWhen Tinubu met the Progressive Governors at their forum, he told them that they are going to be the people who will pick his running mate,\u201d Onanuga said.\n\nTinubu\u2019s running mate has to be from one of the North West, North Central or North East.\n\nThe committee set up by Atiku in the PDP met twice during the week at a location in Abuja. Our correspondent also gathered from reliable sources that the committee may have resolved to meet with the South-South, Southeast caucuses of the party in continuation of consultations that will ensure that a popular choice emerge as the Vice Presidential candidate of the party.\n\n\u201cThe presidential candidate of our party is from the North East. Naturally, his running mate will be selected from one of the southern zones.\n\n\u201cIt is true that some groups and individuals are already lobbying to be considered for the slot. The search is on as we intend to pick the very best person that will further brighten our chances to win the election,\u201d said one source.\n\n\u201cA committee has been set up to lead the way in the search for our Vice Presidential candidate. We are going to consider a lot of factors in making this all important choice in the interest of the party.\n\nRead Also: 13 candidates ready for 2023 presidential poll\n\n\u201cMeetings and consultations are ongoing. In fact, the committee will be meeting the South-South, Southeast caucuses of our party soon as part of the consultations,\u201d the source added.\n\nAtiku has already consulted with PDP governors and members of the party\u2019s Board of Trustees (BoT) on the issue. Governors Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State are said to be lobbying for the position.\n\nTheir aspirations have divided the PDP Governors Forum, sources said, and spoke of the need to get it done as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are in a hurry to end the consultations and announce a candidate as soon as possible. The tension being generated is not healthy for the party,\u201d a member of the BoT said.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the party, Debo Ologunagba, hinted that the PDP may announce its vice-presidential candidate next week.\n\nHe declined to mention names of possible candidates but admitted that some people and interests were lobbying for the ticket.\n\nCAN warns against Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) yesterday advised the two leading political parties to shun the temptation of going for a Christian/Christian or Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket in 2023.\n\nThe association in separate congratulatory messages to Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the APC, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar of PDP and Mr. Peter Obi of Labour Party (LP), urged religious balance in their choice of running mates.\n\nNational Secretary of CAN, Mr. Bade Daramola, said: \u201cWe do not subscribe to Christian/Christian ticket or Muslim/Muslim ticket. Politicians can talk politics but we have stated our view long before now. Any party that tries same religion ticket will fail. This is not 1993. Even when we have joint Muslim/Christian ticket, the church still goes through hell.\n\n\u201cOnly God knows the number of Christians that have been killed in the last seven years with no one apprehended or prosecuted.\n\n\u201cImagine how bad it will be if we have two Muslims in power. The extant Nigerian Constitution promotes religious balance. So, if any political party wants to try Muslim/Muslim ticket, it\u2019s at its own peril. CAN is only forewarning, but will make a categorical statement in the event our warning is not heeded.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai: We should de-emphasise religion\n\nHowever, Kaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai said the issue of competence should override religious considerations.\n\nAsked for his opinion on the issue of Muslim-Muslim ticket on Channels Television yesterday, El-Rufai said: \u201cI have no problem with that. Nigerians should de-emphasise religion. Competence should be the keyword.\u201d\n\nCiting Kaduna State as an example, he said: \u201cWhen I picked a fellow Muslim as my running mate in 2019, people said I would lose the election but we won with a landslide.\n\n\u201cI have Christians as friends, but the issue of religion should not be a factor in politics.\n\n\u201cIf Bola Tinubu decides to go for a Muslim-Muslim ticket, so be it; we\u2019ll support him.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai also yesterday revealed how President Muhammadu Buhari refused to dictate how delegates from his state should vote at the APC presidential primaries.\n\nSpeaking on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, El-Rufai said President Buhari told the delegates to \u201cvote their conscience.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn many of our states, the delegate votes were divided,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kaduna State governor added: \u201cBefore I went to address the Kaduna delegates for the last time, I went to the President and I asked him, have you decided on who we should vote for? He said, I told you, go and vote for any of the five (candidates selected by APC governors)\n\n\u201cI said, Mr President, the Kaduna delegates are your delegates, you are going to retire and live in Kaduna. So you can tell me who you want out of the five, and the President said \u2018I want all five\u2019.\n\n\u201cI said what then should I tell Kaduna delegates? He said, tell them to vote their conscience; they are representing 10 million people in Kaduna State. It\u2019s a heavy responsibility, and they should discharge it and pick the best candidate.\n\n\u201cNow I don\u2019t know how the Kaduna delegates voted, but the feedback I got after the voting is that most of them voted for Asiwaju, some voted for Amaechi and some voted for Professor Yemi Osinbajo.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja And Tunde Thomas, Lagos\n\nAs leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, are in a dilemma over the choice of a Vice Presidential candidate, some northern governors are pushing for a Muslim-Muslim ticket. Sources revealed that the governors are insisting that Tinubu selects either a serving or former governor from the core North as his running mate in order to get massive support against the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nTinubu was elected candidate of the party at APC special convention last week in Abuja. Northern governors of the party had massively supported his candidacy at the presidential primary, which enabled him to defeat other contestants, including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan and former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, among others.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nSaturday Sun gathered that northern governors are making overtures to Tinubu to pick one of them, which means the party would have a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cThe northern governors are pushing him to make a choice from among them or former governors. In fact, that was why they worked against the consensus arrangement that could have produced a northern candidate. Had there been a consensus candidate, which was to have come from the North, none of the governors, either serving or former, would have benefitted from that arrangement. Knowing that a Southern candidate will make way for any of them to become vice president, they worked for that,\u201d a source stated. Two governors being considered, Saturday Sun gathered, are Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna State and Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, governor of Kebbi State. Also being mentioned is Alhaji Kashim Shettima, former governor of Borno State.\n\nIt was learnt that while the Muslim-Muslim ticket looks tempting, the Tinubu camp is looking at the implications.\n\n\u201cTinubu\u2019s supporters know that although a Muslim-Muslim ticket could favour him, it would give the North something to refer to, if in future they decide to push for North-North ticket,\u201d the source. A chieftain of APC, who spoke to Saturday Sun on the development, said that in fairness to those fronting members of the Governors Forum, judging by the critical roles they played in the emergence of the candidate, they actually deserve an offer of first refusal to bring the running mate.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne of the governors should actually be the most viable option for consideration as the running mate, but almost all of them are of the Islamic faith. The only one that is a Christian, the governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, may not have actually worked for Tinubu\u2019s emergence.\n\n\u201cThe governor of Borno State, Babagana Zulum, is one person any right-thinking person can route for, but it can only fly if our party has settled for a risky Muslim/Muslim joint ticket. Another governor who worked for Tinubu is Abduallahi Ganduje of Kano State. He can command the Kano voting population, but the same religious inclination will still be a serious factor. I am sure you heard Asiwaju pay glowing tribute to the Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, in his acceptance speech. One could safely conclude that he is also in consideration, but he falls into the same category like others.\n\n\u201cThe governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, could also be considered, but apart from the fact that he is a Muslim, it is doubtful if he actually worked for Asiwaju or Chibuike Amaechi,\u201d the chieftain said on condition of anonymity.\u201d A member of the national leadership of the party, who admitted the precarious situation facing the ruling in picking a running mate, argued that the party may sacrifice those primordial sentiments if they must shop for a running mate to withstand the Atiku threat.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cno matter the colouration you want to give it, we may be left with no option than to settle for a Muslim/Muslim joint ticket. You see, where we can get a serious and reliable Christian as running mate should be in the North Central.\n\n\u201cHowever, beyond the fact that our national chairman, Abdulahi Adamu is from that zone, going far north remains the most viable option for us. We need a political heavyweight from the North East especially, or North west to neutralise whatever force Atiku might provide.\u201d\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has warned that a Muslim-Muslim ticket would not work in today\u2019s Nigeria. CAN, in a statement by its General Secretary, Joseph Daramola advised Tinubu to pick a Christian running mate from the North, while the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, should pick a Christian running mate from the south. CAN also advised Peter Obi of the Labour Party to choose a Muslim from the North as running mate.\n\nCAN said: \u201cAnything contrary means that the leadership of these political parties do not bother about the unity of Nigeria. And also, those who are planning a Muslim/Muslim ticket should find out the outcome of the MKO Abiola and Kingibe ticket in 1993\u201d, warning that \u201cif they try Muslim/Muslim ticket this time round, the outcome will be disastrous because our fault lines are very visible.\u201d\n\nThe fears among the promoters of the Muslim-Muslim ticket is that only a core northern Muslim would guarantee massive votes among the predominantly Muslim population in the North, which could be decisive during elections.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "The National President of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Alhaji Abdullahi Bello Bodejo has called on the Federal Government to replicate for them what it did for the people of the Niger Delta by creating the Ministry of Fulani Herders Affairs. He said the creation of such a ministry would be a major panacea to ending the perennial clashes between pastoralists and farmers in the Middle Belt and other parts of the country.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, the leader of the Fulani socio-cultural group, who threatened that his group would drag anyone or group that accuses the herdsmen unjustly to court, also explained that the recent Interactive Policy Dialogue and Cultural Day Festival recently hosted by his group in Abuja was meant to bring the Fulani together and seek a permanent solution to the seemingly intractable conflict between herdsmen and farmers in many parts of the country.\n\nPeople say you are doing well for the Fulani. What informed this Interactive Policy Dialogue and Cultural Day Festival you put up last week in Abuja?\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nWe Fulani believe that Nigerian is one. Since I started leading the Fulani under the umbrella of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, my intention has been to unite all the Fulani, so that they can speak with one voice, for the Fulani to know themselves, and the downtrodden to know their prominent people. It is also for others to value the Fulani. All the violence taking place here and there was not supposed to happen \u2013 the herdsmen, farmers\u2019 clashes, kidnappings. It was an opportunity to tell my Fulani brothers that if they have a hand in these kidnappings and violence, that they should stop it and embrace peace. Whenever any kidnapping or and violence takes place, people would be calling on the Fulani as being responsible. This is propaganda to give the Fulani people a bad name. That is why we brought many people; some are not even Fulani, they delivered papers. We have collated the papers and came out with a communiqu\u00e9 which we are going to give the federal and state governments. If they follow our advice, all these problems would die down. Over 10, 000 Fulani gathered in one place to discuss their future. This is the first time of such gathering by our people.\n\nWe invited our brothers: professors, doctors, those from different professional backgrounds, and those that are into pastoral business, educationists, people who know about grazing reserves, religious leaders, security agencies, emirs and everyone said his own part. There were also delegations from outside the country. About 16 countries participated in the programme. It could have been more except that some have flight challenges. Niger, Chad, Cameroun, Togo, Benin Republic and others came, and we discussed the problems of the Fulani internationally and what problems they face in their various countries. We wanted to compare the challenges of Fulani from country to country. If they don\u2019t have problems in their various countries, we wanted to know the reasons, and if there were problems, then we would team up to solve them. You can see Fulani crossing borders from Chad to Nigeria, Togo to Benin, etc. We are trying to solve their problems. After the dialogue at the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, we went and address the masses, over 10,000 of them, at the Miyetti Allah Headquarters, Maliya Cattle Market, on Abuja-Keffi Expressway, Abuja. We spent two days with them, advising them. I don\u2019t want any Fulani man to have any problem with anybody in this country and also, I don\u2019t want anyone to have problem with any Fulani in this country. I watched one video by some Biafra boys or other people, saying that Fulani from African countries gathered in Nigeria to plan jihad. That is not true. Fulani already have their religion, which is jihad; what other jihad are they talking about? Miyetti Kautal Hore does its programme openly. This programme we had, we brought in some people who were not Fulani; the Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyeama delivered a paper and asked us to give him about 100 Fulani boys to train. We don\u2019t have any hidden agenda.\n\nYou said if the government implements the suggestions arrived at during the meeting that there would be no problem. What were some of the suggestions?\n\nFirstly, there are so many Fulani in this country and they are making great contributions to the growth and the development of this country. With our cows, we are very high contributors to national revenue from individual Fulani cattle owners and these people have so many cows and that is why we are asking that they be given a place to settle; create grazing reserves for them in order for them to stay in one place. If you want them to keep moving from one place to the other, that would be creating endless problems. We want the Fulani children to go to school and be educated. So, schools and hospitals should be built at such reserves. We want the Federal Government to create Ministry of Fulani Herdsmen Affairs as you have the Ministry of Niger Delta to handle herdsmen affairs. There should be a solution for all these clashes.\n\nAre you sure that if the Federal Government implements your resolutions, these herders, farmers clashes will come to an end?\n\nDefinitely, the implementations of these resolutions will go a long way to stop these crises.\n\nWhy is it that some people always accuse the Fulani as responsible where most kidnappings and killings take place?\n\nThere is so much propaganda and gang up against the Fulani to demean and diminish the Fulani. This is not fair. That was one of the things that the dialogue was out to address, and we want people to stop that.\n\nPeople say that the Fulani herdsmen are the bandits. What is your reaction?\n\nEvery tribe in this country has good and bad people. You can\u2019t call all the herdsmen bandits and you can\u2019t say all herdsmen are terrorists. If a member of your tribe was involved in crime, does it mean every member of your tribe is a criminal? You cannot demonise every member of a tribe by profiling them as criminals just because of the criminal activity of one member of the tribe.\n\nHerdsmen are not the bandits; they are the highest victims of banditry and terrorism. The bandits are killing them in large numbers. So, how can anybody say herdsmen are bandits? It is not good. This profiling is not fair.\n\nPeople accused herdsmen of being responsible for the attack last Sunday on a Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, where scores of worshippers were killed and other injured. What is your reaction against this weighty accusation?\n\nWhat relationship has a Fulani man with the church? All of them are Muslims. I don\u2019t think any Fulani would go and attack a church. For what? People making such accusation just wanted to tarnish our image. People have been calling me and I\u2019m tired of answering the question. How can any Fulani attack a church? How many attacks have happened and they would accuse the Fulani and in the end it would be seen that Fulani were not involved? I don\u2019t think the Fulani would have carried out the attack. It is for the Commissioner of Policed to unravel. You are not the commissioner of police or a security agent, but you stay in your house and concluded that Fulani herdsmen carried out the attack. What evidence do you have for you to come up with such heavy allegations? This talk is nonsense. Those talking like that are the enemies of Nigeria and Nigerians; they are out to cause trouble. It is just like giving a dog a bad name in order to kill it. But we can never allow it to continue. We can no more allow people to continue to accuse the Fulani unnecessarily. We shall begin to sue anybody or group who drags the name of Fulani in the mud or accuses us of what we didn\u2019t do or what he doesn\u2019t have the evidence of. So, mind what you say about the Fulani. If you must accuse us of any crime or criminal activities whether in the social media or the traditional media, make sure you have your evidence, which you will prove in the court. This propaganda is enough.\n\nConsidering your numerical strength, are you going to bring it to bear to determine who wins the presidential election next year?\n\nWe have large numbers. We are yet to decide on who to support. When the time comes, we shall take the decision. This country has to make progress; so we need progressive-minded people. We will tell our members the person to vote for, and by then we must have studied the candidates and their programmes. The programmes must be the ones that favour us. We have already united towards this and are waiting for the candidate. Such a candidate must not come in the name of religion or tribe; he must be ready to see everybody as one; and carry everybody together.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

The source, who is close to one of the governors that is on the panel, said the committee is likely to complete its assignment this weekend or early next week.\n\n\u201cAs you know, the party has set up a committee to shop for a vice presidential candidate.

The two are now searching for running mates.\n\n\n\nCAN and NOSCEF\u2019s caveats are coming on the heels of a similar one by the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, to the APC against a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket, saying Nigerians are still conscious of ethno-religious factors in politics.\n\n\n\nBut Governor Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna State stressed yesterday that competence should determine his party\u2019s choice of presidential running mate instead of religion.\n\nOn the same day, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo declared his readiness to give total support to Tinubu, towards winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\n\n\nCAN, in the statement signed by its National Secretary, Joseph Bade Daramola warned the two leading political parties to bury the thought of Christian/Christian or Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe want to unequivocally state that it is a threat to the fragile peace and unity of Nigeria,\u201d said CAN.\n\nIt urged all political parties to ensure that the balance of both religious practitioners is considered in the choice of running mates for the presidential candidates.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe do not subscribe to Christian/Christian ticket or Muslim/Muslim ticket. Politicians can talk politics but we have stated our view long before now. Any party that tries same religion ticket will fail.\n\n\u201cThis is not 1993. Even when we have joint Muslim/Christian ticket, the church still goes through hell. Only God knows the number of Christians that have been killed in the last seven years with no one apprehended or prosecuted.\n\n\n\n\u201cImagine how bad it will be if we have two Muslims in power?

CAN is only forewarning, but will make a categorical statement in the event our warning is not heeded.\n\n\n\nCAN said, \u201cthe Presidential running mate of APC presidential flag bearer, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu should be a Christian from the North, Atiku\u2019s running mate should be a Christian from the South while Obi should choose his own among the Muslims from the North\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnything contrary to the above means that the leadership of these political parties do not bother about the unity of this entity called Nigeria. Those who are planning Muslim/Muslim ticket should also find out what was the outcome of MKO Abiola and Kingibe ticket in 1993. If they try Muslim/Muslim ticket this time around, the outcome will be worse because our fault lines are very visible.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no party that has no great, good and patriotic Christians who can preside over the affairs of this nation not to talk of being the Vice President as some mischievous people are trying to say. If merit and competence are used as yardsticks, we have many qualified Christians in all the 774 Local Government Areas of this country,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nCAN said its leadership had tried in vain to get President Muhammadu Buhari to break the monopoly or dominance of the security architecture with people of same faith.\n\n\u201cWe are all seeing the outcome now. It is obvious that the Nigeria of today is different from that of 1993. Our politicians should stop flouting the Constitution by respecting the North and South dichotomy and religious factor. To those arguing that people do not care about the religions of their leaders once they are competent and credible, we dare APC to pick its Presidential running mate from the South and PDP pick its own from the North and see what follows.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen the late sage, Papa Obafemi Awolowo picked Chief Mrs Oyibo Odinamadu, a fellow Christian and Southerner, as his runningmate in 1979, we all know the consequences of his performance in the North. Our politicians should be doing what will unite us instead of what will further polarise the country,\u201d it said.\n\nNorthern Christian Elders Oppose Muslim VP\n\nThe Northern Christian Elders Forum also sounded a note of warning that the country\u2019s diversity should be taken into consideration by Tinubu and Atiku while choosing their running mates.\n\nNOSCEF in its Democracy Day message to the nation, signed by its President, Ejoga Inalegwu, cautioned that Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian tickets would be insensitive.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe therefore appeal to all patriotic presidential candidates to avoid manipulative but dangerous and insensitive tickets that will further polarize the nation along religious lines when Nigerians are looking forward, with great expectations for a new dawn, come 2023; a new era and government devoid of politics of exclusion, discrimination and injustice.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the parties therefore, make efforts to meet the deadline for the submission of their presidential and vice-presidential candidates, NOSCEF wants to again appeal to political parties to be sensitive to the mood of the nation, the religious diversity of our people and show patriotism by avoiding any action that will throw up our lines of divide, merely to win elections rather than steps that will unite our nation.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want to believe that anyone with the credentials to rule this nation from 2023, should be sensitive enough and not be a candidate that would take us back to our religious divides, through the instrument of Christian/Christian ticket or Muslim/Muslim ticket. We do not expect any patriot to, by so doing, again open the wounds for our past bitter religious divides.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need, as a nation, a united front to forge a new Nigeria, that will bring people together across religious divides because we do not lack quality across the religious and regional divides,\u201d it insisted.\n\nThe frontline group said that politicians should make deliberate efforts at avoiding playing the religious cards through such tickets and not turn around to accuse those who condemn their unpatriotic action as the culprits.\n\nBabachir: Muslim-Muslim Ticket Dead on Arrival\n\nA former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, has warned the APC against allowing a Muslim as running mate to its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, who is also a Muslim.\n\nLawal, who spoke on a television programme on Thursday pointed out that Nigerians are still conscious of ethno-religious factors in politics.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, Tinubu would have been running mate to the President Muhammadu Buhari, when the latter became the candidate of the APC in 2014 but for the discouragement of a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThere are concerns that Tinubu, a Muslim, might be forced to pick a Muslim running mate from the North for political prpose.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if it was time for northern Christians allegedly marginalised to be placated with the nomination of one of them as Tinubu\u2019s running mate, Lawal said, \u201cI will answer this question in a roundabout way. A political party is in the business of winning elections and to win elections you need to get the votes to beat your opponents. The way I see it is that in choosing your vice-president; that must be paramount in your mind. You can have the best ticket but if you don\u2019t win elections, it is a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, whatever candidate we are going to choose, we will bear in mind that that vice-president will contribute to winning that election. How does he (or she) continue? It is either he (or she) is popular and can bring in the votes or he (or she) can bring the money that will help our logistics in getting out the votes, so we can win the elections.\n\n\u201cBut then, there is also the requirement that you want to run a united country; you want to run a country where you don\u2019t he friction in the society \u2013 peaceful, settled and everybody goes about their business.\n\n\u201cTo that extent, you must factor in Nigeria\u2019s peculiarities in politics. That is why, for example, in recognition of these peculiarities, the northern governors and the majority of us in the North felt that the presidency ought to shift to the South.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not a requirement in the Constitution that it has to shift. There is no zoning. But it is so we can have a country that is united; that everybody can go about their business in a peaceful environment.\n\n\u201cIt could have been possible for a northern (presidential) candidate to emerge. But then, you would know that running the country in that manner would have the southern part of Nigeria (to be) hostile to that government. So, we allowed it to shift.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, extending that consideration to the Muslim-Muslim ticket, I have lived among the Christians and I know that among the Christians, the question of a Muslim-Muslim ticket is a no-go area. It is dead on arrival. Buhari himself, even at that time, had to drop this present presidential candidate (Tinubu) because of the tension of a Muslim-Muslim ticket. And we have not seen anything in the country that has changed significantly to allow that to happen.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, it has worsened. The religious divide has increased. Tribal divisions have increased. Regional divisions have increased. So, it would be a good thing if APC would settle for a Muslim-Christian ticket because we know (that the) PDP, that is what they would do.\u201d\n\nEl-rufai: Competence Vital, Not Religion\n\nEl-rufai, who was asked to react to the clamour for Christians as running mates of the leading presidential candidates for 2023, declared that competence should be vital in the selection, not religion.\n\nThe Kaduna governor, who spoke on a television programme declared: \u201cYou are asking the wrong person because I don\u2019t look at people from the lens of Muslim Muslim or Christian Christian. Most of my friends are Christians.\n\nIt was Tunde Bakare, a Pentecostal pastor that invited me to CPC, not President Buhari. I don\u2019t think the business of governance has to do with religion, I think we should look for the best person for the job, let\u2019s look for competence, capacity. I am the wrong person to ask because in my state I looked and chose my deputy as a Christian woman. This fixation of Nigerians with religion is worrying.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo: I Will Support Tinubu to Win in 2023\n\nOsinbajo yesterday declared his readiness to give total support Tinubu, towards winning the presidential election in 2023.\n\nHe also emphasized that he remains committed to the dream of a new Nigeria.\n\nThe Vice President, who spoke in Abuja at the campaign office of The Progressive Project (TPP), a coalition of support groups that backed him for the presidential race, pledged his personal support for the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 elections.\n\n\n\nThe Vice President, who came a distant third in the party\u2019s presidential primary on Wednesday, recalled the personal letter he wrote to Tinubu Thursday congratulating him on his victory at the party primary.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cin that letter, I said to him that the dream of this country, the dream of a new country remains alive and well. And I want you to know in your hearts that we are democrats when we participate in a contest and the results are announced.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo matter what those results may be, we abide by them because there is only one process for democrats, whether that process is good or bad, there is only one, and we have gone through that process.\n\n\u201cAnd in that process, a winner has been adjudged, but that does not kill the dream of the great future. We will support our party; we will support the flagbearer of our party because we know that the other side is not even worth considering. So, we will support the flagbearer of our party, we will do everything we can.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Vice President described the clamour for a new Nigeria as a movement.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis movement is a movement within a party also, we are not doing something that has not been heard of before. What is new is that we have a firm belief that a new Nigeria is possible and it is possible through us who are here.\u201d\n\n\n\nOshiomhole: Tinubu\u2019s Victory a Reaffirmation of His Capacity\n\nA former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole has described the victory of Tinubu as a reaffirmation of his much-acclaimed unique capacity.\n\n\n\nOshiomhole in a statement issued yesterday said the Presidential candidate of APC represents a movement.\n\nHe noted that he had no doubt that Nigerians, no matter their political persuasions, would readily recognize his unique abilities and accept him as the right person needed at this momentous time, to lead this nation and transcend all extant challenges.\n\n\n\nOshiomhole said: \u201cThis victory is a reaffirmation of your much-acclaimed unique capacity to headhunt, mobilize, motivate and empower the best minds, irrespective of their tribe or religion, and use their combined creative efforts to translate your vision into reality.\n\n\u201cThis is a key asset of leadership that you possess, which over the years has differentiated you from others and positioned you well above your contemporaries.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou represent a movement, a force, full of energy and radiating hope of a brighter future to come, when Nigerians hand over to you the baton of leadership, which you are well prepared for and ready to accept with all its attendant responsibilities.\u201d\n\nSouth-West APC Congratulates Tinubu, Promises 90% of Region\u2019s Votes\n\nThe APC in the South-West under the chairmanship of Isaac Kekemeke has congratulated Tinubu on his election as the presidential candidate of the party in the 2023 election.\n\n\n\nThe South-West APC in a statement yesterday by its Publicity Secretary, Ayo Afolabi, said Tinubu\u2019s victory was a proof of his popularity and acceptability all over the country.\n\nThe party said it believed Tinubu\u2019s emergence would translate to victory at the poll and it would bring about the massive turnaround needed by the country.\n\nThe party also assured Tinubu of its resolve to deliver 90 per cent of the region\u2019s votes during the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cWithout doubt, your election demonstrated an overwhelming support from Nigerians across the geo-political zones which was a clear indication that Nigerians want you as their next president.\n\n\u201cThe APC in the South-West stands by you in every step you take in the journey to the Presidency, and we like to assure you that we will deliver the votes of the South-West in not less than 90 per cent of total registered voters in the region.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are one with our governors, National Assembly members, State Assembly members, local governments and indeed all leaders and members of our great party within the South-West region at this movement.\n\n\u201cWe send you our hearty congratulations, and we pray that this will be the beginning of a turnaround for Nigeria in terms of security, economic development, infrastructural upgrading, agric development and housing for the entire population of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe appeal to all Nigerians to stand up and be counted in this noble movement to build on the legacies of President Muhammadu Buhari which will put Nigeria in its proper place in the comity of great nations.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Aims to make APC guber candidate unelectable\n\n*In retaliation, APC nudges PDP\u2019s flagbearer with EFCC\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nGovernor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State yesterday ordered the prosecution of the immediate past governor of the state, Rotimi Amaechi and the 2023 governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Tonye Cole, over their alleged involvement \u201cin the illegal sale of a number of state government\u2019s assets and disappearance of $50 million from the state\u2019s account without proof of where it was deployed.\u201d\n\n\n\nWike gave the order after swearing-in three new commissioners at the Government House, Port Harcourt.\n\nThe Rivers State Governor had in 2015 set up a Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate the activities of the Amaechi administration and the panel thereafter indicted Amaechi, Cole and some others for corruption.\n\n\n\nWike directed the state\u2019s new Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Zaccheus Adangor, to commence prosecution of the two men and the others immediately.\n\nHowever, analysts are of the view that the drive to prosecute Amaechi and Cole is aimed at making the APC governorship candidate unelectable.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce Cole is put on trial, and obviously will be convicted, his drive to become Rivers State governor ends,\u201d said the analysts.\n\n\n\nYesterday, Wike told his new Attorney General: \u201cYou\u2019re at a critical period where people want to know what the state is going to do with the Judiciary Panel of Inquiry after the Supreme Court judgement on it. Luckily, you came at the right time when we had preferred criminal charges against the former governor (Amaechi), Sahara Energy\u2019s Tonye Cole and the rest of them.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, you are coming at the right time to take over the matter and to make sure it is prosecuted diligently. I don\u2019t want to hear excuses. Let the people see what happened to our money. The world will see how $50 million from our account was moved to a company without nothing to show whether there was a business.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe governor had last month stated that he may file charges against the former Minister of Transportation, following the Supreme Court judgment that dismissed Amaechi\u2019s appeal to frustrate investigation into activities of his administration.\n\n\n\nWike, who spoke during a media parley in Abuja, said the judgement had vindicated the Rivers State Government.\n\nBack then, he promised to meet with leaders of Rivers State to decide on whether to commence criminal prosecution of Amaechi and Cole, over the alleged sales of some valued state assets and diversion of state funds.\n\nThe governor said those whose fate would also be decided included the state\u2019s former Commissioner for Transport, George Tolofari.\n\n\n\nHe explained that on his assumption of office in 2015, the state government set up Judicial Panel of Inquiry to investigate the activities of the Amaechi\u2019s administration.\n\n\n\nWike said: \u201cThe judicial panel was mandated to investigate the sale of the 150 Mega Watts gas turbine in Omoku, Afam 360 MW Gas Turbine, Trans-Amadi 136 MW Gas Turbine and the 75 MW Gas turbine in Eleme; Monorail Project; the sale of Olympia hotel; and non-execution of the contract for the construction of Justice Karibi-Whyte hospital after the Amaechi administration paid $39.2m to the contractor.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Wike yesterday stated that the attempt by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to arrest the state\u2019s PDP governorship candidate, Siminalaye\n\nFubara, would not be accepted, saying that the state government would not hesitate to charge the anti-craft agency for contempt.\n\nWike also directed Adangor to write a strong worded protest letter to the EFCC over the alleged harassment of Fubara.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the protest letter is predicated on the recent attempted arrest by officers of EFCC on Fubara, who he noted before his emergence as the PDP governorship candidate, had served as the Accountant General of Rivers State.\n\n\n\nWike said the era of impunity and flagrant disobedience to the rule of law is gone and his administration will not accept such action by EFCC.\n\n\n\nHe explained that before now, the Rivers State government had gotten a subsisting court judgment against the EFCC that it cannot investigate the state finances or its officers.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, there is also another judgment against EFCC by the PDP governorship candidate to enforce his fundamental rights, which has not been set aside.\n\n\n\nAnalysts are also of the view that the opposition APC in Rivers State are in retaliation, going after Fubara with EFCC, to also make him unelectable.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He said the APC project was far from over \u201cand we need all of you to come together to ensure our progressive journey to peace and prosperity is sustained.\u201d\n\nThe letter read, \u201cI was pleased to see how you were very professional and efficient in handling the sensitive political position of Chairman Progressives Governors Forum.\n\n\n\n\u201cYour commitment in pursuit of equity and fairness speaks volumes in the cooperation displayed by APC governors. This, indeed, demonstrates the camaraderie that brought us together over eight years ago.\n\n\u201cThe party primaries were peacefully conducted and the delegates have selected the candidate to carry the APC flag in the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, as a patriotic APC member and stakeholder, I trust that you will come together to work with our candidate to win the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cIn the past seven years in government, we have achieved a lot. However, we have a lot more to do. The APC project is far from over and we need all of you to come together to ensure our progressive journey to peace and prosperity is sustained.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur candidate, His Excellency, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is no stranger to you. He is our friend and brother. We know his commitment, his track record, and his capacity to lead our party to success. So, now is the time for all of us to come together and march forward, as we did in 2015, to a convincing APC victory.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working closely with APC governors to support Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu and all our APC candidates to success in 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile I wish our great party success in the 2023 elections, please, accept the assurances of my consideration and personal regards.\u201d\n\nBuhari played host to Tinubu, Thursday night, at the State House, Abuja. He received the presidential candidate at his official residence about 8.30pm.\n\n\n\nThe former Lagos State governor, who emerged victorious at the APC presidential primary in Abuja on Wednesday, was accompanied on the appreciative visit to Buhari by the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Oando Oil Plc, Wale Tinubu.\n\nTinubu was at the villa to thank the president for his support and successful hosting of the APC presidential primary. He vowed to sustain Buhari\u2019s legacies if elected president.\n\n\n\nCommending Buhari for helping to ensure a level playing field for contestants at the primary election, Tinubu said, \u201cHe promised the whole country and the world that he will build a legacy of transparency and consistency. Legacy of a level playing ground for all the aspirants. He will be committed to democratic principles and values. And he did so.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t endorse anybody, he didn\u2019t impose anybody, he did not, at any time, attempt to tinker with the process of this election to favour one tribe or the other. He was steadfast, he was trustworthy, he was dependable, he was a leader.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his selling point ahead of the 2023 election, Tinubu said he was clear-minded on his mission and possessed a wealth of experience from both the private and public sectors. He said he was \u201cready to hit the ground running same day and not mess up the legacy of progress and honesty that is left behind for me and handed over to me by President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nAdamu, NWC Members Pledge to Work Hard to Deliver Tinubu\n\nThe National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), led by the national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, visited the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, to congratulate him and give assurances that the party leadership would work diligently to deliver him as president.\n\nAdamu said during the visit, \u201cWe are here visiting you to join you in thanking God for giving you to us and to all Nigerians, by making you the presidential flag bearer of our party for the 2023 election.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have come a long way; you have seen it all. I can tell you that we have a commitment beyond description, a commitment to deliver you as president. Our party has spoken loud and clear, and delivering the will of the people, our delegates have given you the mandate to lead.\n\n\u201cWe are all now your soldiers. We will follow you to the nooks and crannies of this country. We will not rest on your oars until we have delivered you as president.\u201d\n\n\n\nThanking the chairman and members of the NWC, Tinubu said, \u201cI am honoured by this visit. We are all members of the same party, and as such, belong to the same progressive family. I appreciate your visit, I truly feel as if I am with family members.\n\n\u201cI want to thank everyone of you individually and collectively. You have formed a very dynamic team in a short period of time. You have sent jitters to other parties that our party remains united, and you must continue to live up to expectations.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, as I have done throughout my campaign, I assure you that I am ready to reciprocate and vindicate our efforts in making the ultimate sacrifice: relentless public service to our beloved nation.\n\n\u201cWe have begun a new story of greatness, prosperity in the history of our nation. You helped me to complete the introduction; we must now work together to etch the substance of the book itself. Our book will not be complete until you have delivered me as president.\u201d\n\n\n\nTinubu described the APC national chairman as a straightforward, focused, and courageous man, whom he had worked together with as a fellow-governor in 1999.\n\nThe former governor stated, \u201cI thank you and I reiterate my commitment to the greatness of our party. We must work together, we must not let our enemies, who want to divide us, succeed. We must not allow it. Almighty Allah will crown our work with success as we embark on the journey to a greater Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmong the NWC members who joined the chairman on the visit were Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Abubakar Kyari; Deputy National Chairman (South), Chief Emma Eneukwu; National Secretary, Senator Iyiola Omisore; National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Felix Morka; National Organising Secretary, Alhaji Sulaimon Argungu; National Woman Leader, Dr. Betta Edu; and National Youth Leader, Mr. Dayo Abdullah Isreal.\n\nOthers were National Vice Chairman (South-west), Dr Isaac Kekemeke; National Vice Chairman (South-south), Chief Hon. Victor Giadom; and National Vice Chairman (North-east), Comrade Mustapha Salihu.\n\nNorthern APC Governors Visit Tinubu, as Search for Running Mate Begins\n\nSome members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Northern States Governors Forum, yesterday, paid a visit to the presidential candidate of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu, in Asokoro, Abuja.\n\nThe northern governors, who visited Tinubu, included governor of Kebbi State and Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Abubakar Atiku Bagudu; Governor of Kastina State, Aminu Masari; Kano State Governor, Abdulahi Ganduje; Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya; Plateau State Governor, Simon Lanlong; and Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello.\n\n\n\nAlthough the purpose of the visit was not made public, sources said it might not be unconnected with the search for a running mate for Tinubu.\n\nAlready, there were speculations that the ruling party might settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nIt was gathered that the meeting, which was held behind closed-doors, was centred on a possible running mate to Tinubu in the 2023 election.\n\n\u2018Tinubu, APC Leadership to Choose Acceptable Running Mate\u2019\n\nFormer deputy governors, who were members of APC, assured that the leadership of the ruling party, as well as the presidential candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu, would choose the vice presidential candidate that would best serve the interest of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nChairman of the Forum of former Deputy Governors of Nigeria and former Deputy Governor of Edo State, Lucky Imasuen, at a press conference yesterday in Abuja, wondered why people were already speculating whether the ruling party would settle for a Musilm-Muslim ticket.\n\n\n\nImasuen said, \u201cWhy are we crying foul, when there is no smoke? I will tell you without any hesitation that the man we have chosen is a leader. When you choose a leader, you choose him to represent the people.\n\n\u201cHimself (Tinubu) and the party leadership, you can rest assured that they will bring the best vice presidential candidate that will best serve the interest of Nigeria. So, just be patient. I can\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s going, because I\u2019m not the candidate and I\u2019m not the national chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe forum stated that the emergence of Tinubu as the standard-bearer of the party had sent jitters to the camp of the opposition party, which had realised the irreversible error they committed by choosing a presidential candidate against the mood of the nation.\n\nOsinbajo: Tinubu\u2019s Sterling Contributions to Democracy Stand Him Out\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo congratulated Bola Tinubu on his emergence as presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), stressing that his contributions to Nigeria\u2019s democracy and its progress stand him out.\n\n\n\nIn a congratulatory message dated June 9, 2022 and personally signed by him, the vice president, who came a distant third in the presidential primaries, enjoined all APC members to close ranks and work towards the success of Tinubu in the February 2023 presidential poll.\n\n\n\nThe vice president stated in the letter, \u201cI congratulate Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his victory at our party primaries and his emergence as the presidential candidate and flag bearer of our great party, the APC, for the forthcoming 2023 presidential election. I also congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari and all leaders of the APC for a successful Special Convention and Presidential Primary.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor many decades, our flag bearer has shown passion, patriotism, courage and determination in the cause of nation building. His sterling contributions to our democracy and its progress stand him out. His wealth of experience will certainly be critical in our party\u2019s continued efforts to attain a more secure and prosperous Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo all members of our great party, regardless of who you voted for at the primaries, we must now unite behind our presidential candidate and flag bearer to ensure victory for our party in the 2023 elections. As true progressives, we must remain strong and united in pursuing our collective vision as a party towards building a country that can provide a decent life and livelihoods for all our people.\u201d\n\n\n\nJonathan Congratulates Atiku, Tinubu, Obi, Other Parties\u2019 Presidential Candidates\n\nFormer President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, congratulated the presidential candidate of PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, that of APC, Bola Tinubu, and their counterpart in the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi, as well as those of the other parties on their emergence as their parties\u2019 standard-bearers.\n\nJonathan also appealed to the political parties participating in the 2023 general election to base their campaigns on issues and shun violence during the electioneering.\n\n\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president urged the candidates to run campaigns devoid of rancour and divisiveness, and utilise the opportunity to promote peace and unity.\n\nJonathan commended the candidates for their interest in leading the country, which he described as a demonstration of their commitment and belief in the progress of the nation.\n\n\n\nNoting that Nigeria was at a critical junction in its march to nationhood, as it grapples with security and economic challenges, Jonathan said the 2023 elections presented an opportunity to renew the dreams of the founding fathers and revitalise the economy.\n\n\n\nHe charged the candidates to, in their campaigns, eschew violence and acts that could encourage any form of bloodletting or exacerbate the national fault lines. He said it was the responsibility of all political leaders to strive to de-escalate the tension in the country.\n\n\n\nJonathan also reminded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the security agencies of their responsibilities, stressing that the significance of the 2023 election, imposes on them a historic burden to continue the process of deepening the reforms of our electoral system.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Afenifere urges Buhari to fish out perpetrators\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Fidelis David in Akure\n\nThe federal government, yesterday, gave an update on last Sunday\u2019s killing of 40 worshippers at St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, saying the Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) masterminded the dastardly attack.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, gunmen, again struck in Sabo area of Ondo town, in Ondo West Local Government Area of the state and have killed six men.\n\nBut a Pan-Yoruba Socio-Cultural Group, Afenifere, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari, to fish out perpetrators of last Sunday\u2019s terror attack at St. Francis Catholic Church.\n\n\n\nBriefing newsmen on Thursday at the end of the National Security Council meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, said security agencies had been directed to go after the perpetrators of the act and bring them to justice.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the motive of the terror group was believed to be pitting Nigerians against each other and making it appear as ethno-religious war.\n\n\n\nWhile noting that the ISWAP\u2019s imprints had been determined in the attack, he said arrests were yet to be made, and that, there was no ethnic agenda, urging Nigerians to unite and defeat the terrorists.\n\n\n\nHis words: \u201cThe National Security Council, has just risen from its meeting today, which reviewed, very critically, all aspects of security situation in the country and came up with conclusions, commending the efforts of the military and other security agencies in mitigating the insurgency, particularly, in the Northeast, where the fundamentalists there have been weakened, degraded and equally in the Northwest, where the bandits are equally weakened, and the Northcentral, where we\u2019re engaged with pockets of bandits.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe council is quite concerned about the violent attack in Owo, Ondo State, and has been able to locate the perpetrators of that horrendous attack. From all indications, we are zeroing in on ISWAP, the Islamic State for West Africa.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not an ethnoreligious thing, the animals in ISWAP wanting attention, recognition, are suspected to have launched that attack. We have directed all the agencies concerned to go after them and bring them to justice\u201d.\n\nAregbesola said the Council was also concerned about killings in the name of blasphemy and has directed the security agencies to go after perpetrators of two incidents that occurred in Sokoto State and Abuja recently.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are equally concerned about the spate of attacks in the name of blasphemy. The police have been directed to mobilise, identify and preempt all those involved in the blasphemy attacks in two areas of the country, namely Sokoto and Abuja, of recent. The assurance is that we are committed to maintaining law and order and providing adequate security for Nigerian citizens.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, THISDAY has learnt that the attack on the Sabo area of Ondo town, in Ondo West Local Government Area of the state, happened in the wee hours of Wednesday.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that the victims had been buried since Wednesday while one of the victims, who survived the attack was still receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in the state.\n\nEyewitness said the gunmen stormed the area on motorbikes around 12:30am and opened fire on innocent roadside petty traders.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cThey came to our area (Sabo) on motorbikes and each was carrying three gunmen. All of a sudden, they started shooting people, who were mostly Suya and tea vendors. A J5 bus driver, who was on transit and stopped to eat was the first victim. They killed a guardsman and another shopkeeper, who was trying to lock up his shop and run away from the assailants.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey again gunned down two young men, who were eating noodles at a Mai Shayi store. That makes five victims in Sabo alone. Again, they struck another area called Iba, where they also shot dead another man,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\n\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer in the state, Funmilayo Odunlami, confirmed the development but said it was an armed robbery case, not a reprisal attack, stressing that the victims involved in the failed robbery were from Yoruba, Igbo and Northern extraction.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Command wishes to state clearly that there was no reprisal attack on the Hausa Community at Sabo area in Ondo town or any part of the state as purported by war mongers.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, 7th of June, 2022, there was an attempted robbery on a J5 vehicle with plate no MKA \u2013 469 YJ carrying Onions and Potatoes coming from Zaria enroute Ore, had a stop over at Ondo town and was attacked by men of the underworld around 0110hrs .\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the cause of this attempt, the robbers shot the driver, while the motorboy escaped with bullet injury, a motorcyclist alongside the pillion and a passerby were also hit by stray bullets,\u201d noting that investigation had since commenced and effort was ongoing to arrest the assailants.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police, Ondo State Command, Oyeyemi Oyediran, urged the people of the state to remain calm and disregard the fake news, as the rumour mongers are out to stir unnecessary chaos and disrupt the peace of the state. This is also to warn the peddlers of this fake news to desist as the Command will not fold its arms and let them shatter the peace being enjoyed in the state,\u201d the PPRO added.\n\n\n\nIt was against these developments that Afenifere, yesterday, paid a condolence visit to Ondo State Governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), in Akure, the state capital.\n\n\n\nLed by its national leader, Ayo Adebanjo, in company with other members, Adebanjo commiserated with the governor, the Olowo of Owo, the Catholic church and the poeple of the state over the ugly incident, even as he referred to the governor as a true son of Yoruba race, saying his courage in establishing Amotekun corps was typical of a true Yoruba man.\n\n\n\nThe Afenifere leader, particularly, commended Akeredolu for doing his best to secure not only the state but the South-West region, adding that the security situation in the Southwest could have been worse, but for the establishment of the Amotekun corps.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe elections we are going into will be an exercise in futility if we don\u2019t change the constitution. We want state police and restructuring before the elections. So, change the constitution before moving further,\u201d Adebanjo insisted.\n\n\n\nHe saluted the courage and stance of the governor on issues of national importance, saying Akeredolu has always demonstrated that he was a politician with a second address.\n\nThe Afenifere leader insisted on the change of the constitution to give the country a people\u2019s constitution and equal opportunity to all.\n\n\n\nHe said Nigerians were currently suffering under what he called \u201cmilitary imposed fraudulent constitution\u201d.\n\nThe group, however, donated N1.5m to the church and victims of the attack.\n\nSpeaking, Akeredolu appreciated them for visiting and, noted that his administration would not back down on its Anti-open Grazing Law.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we have suffered is not just gruesome, for me it is like an annihilation, because these animals in human\u2019s skin did not come to kidnap, because they picked nobody. They did not come to steal, because they took no Kobo. But they came to maim and kill. So, that is why we have never minced words to say they are terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have been reading the news, and I think this incident is the most internationalised incident in Nigeria ever. Today, the Pope is talking and tomorrow the House of Common is debating, everybody is talking. I have got calls from many people, I have gotten letter from the US Embassy and others. Everybody is worried, I\u2019m worried myself.\n\n\u201cIf we were at war, it was not possible for us to lose 40 people in a day, because we would all be armed and face each other. If you visit the hospitals, one will feel even worse. I have been to all the hospitals over and over, there is no way the visit will not bring tears to your eyes,\u201d the governor added.\n\n\n\nOther Afenifere leaders with Adebanjo included the deputy national leader, Oba Oladapo Olaitan; former Governor of Ogun State, Chief Gbenga Daniel; former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief Olu Falae; Tunji Alapinni, Sola Ebiseni, and Korede Duyile, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Despite court cases of alleged massive frauds hanging on his neck, former Governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu was on Wednesday officially declared the presidential candidate of the party.\n\nTinubu polled 1,271 votes at the election which was held at Eagle Square, Abuja.\n\nFormer Rivers State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi trailed with 316 votes, while Vice President Yemi Osinbajo garnered 235 votes.\n\nSenate President Ahmed Lawan and Governor Yahaya Bello polled 152 and 47 votes respectively.\n\nChecks by SaharaReporters revealed that the fraud cases against Tinubu dated as far back as 1998, raising questions about how the former governor struggled to delay the axe of the law.\n\nOn February 18, 2009, SaharaReporters obtained original copies of a judgment in the case of United States versus Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in which Tinubu was charged (along with other defendants) in a case of massive drug trafficking and money laundering.\n\nThis judgment directly relates to (and further documents) the SaharaReporters report of September 16, 2008 \u2013 How US Federal Agents successfully Linked Tinubu to Drug Trafficking Ring in Chicago.\n\nThe United States of America, by its attorney, Michael J. Shepard, United States Attorney for Northern District of Illinois, for its verified complaint of forfeiture, stated that \u201cBeginning as early as 1998, Adegboyega Mueez Akande, with others operated an organisation which distributed white heroin, a controlled substance under Title 21 of the United States Code.\n\n\u201cThis distribution operation was conducted on a large scale and the proceeds of the operation substantial.\u201d\n\nThe judgment was that the court ordered: \u201cthat the funds in the amount of $460,000 in account in the name of Bola Tinubu represents proceeds of narcotics or were involved in financial transactions in violation of 18 U.S.C ss 1956 and 1957 and therefore these funds are forfeited to the United States.\u201d\n\nAfter protracted litigation in which Bola Tinubu claimed that the monies legitimately belonged to him, his wife, Oluremi Tinubu, and his surrogate mother, one Alhaja Mogaji, Bola Tinubu finally opted for a stipulated settlement with the US government.\n\nAccording to the settlement order dated September 15, 1993; Hon. Judge John A. Nordberg ordered that the sum of $460,000 held by Bola Tinubu in the First Heritage Bank account be forfeited to the United States Government.\n\nA bigger scandal was uncovered in 2018 when Alpa Beta, a consultancy owned by Bola Tinubu, was caught at the centre of a N100 billion fraud, tax evasion, and money laundering petition written by Mr. Dapo Apara, its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAccording to Apara\u2019s petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Alpha Beta \u201chas become an avenue for official corruption of government officials, a conduit pipe for massive money-laundering scheme, tax evasion, among other vices.\u201d\n\nIn the petition, sent on his behalf by Adetunji Adegboyega ESG, his solicitors, Apara said: \u201cOver the years the company is being protected and shielded by some powerful politicians and people in the society which made them to always boast of being untouchable, but our client, feeling the need not to keep quiet again and strengthened by his belief in the fact that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari is keen on fighting corruption, which has been the bane of our country, is of the firm belief that it\u2019s time to expose and open the can of worms called Alpha Beta Consulting.\u201d\n\nAlpha Beta first became known when it was appointed as a consultant to the Lagos State Government, arguably its first client, under the tenure of Babatunde Fowler as the Chief Executive Officer/Executive Chairman of the Lagos State Board of Internal Revenue from 2005 to 2014.\n\nThe company got the appointment when Tinubu was Governor of Lagos State. The speculation, which has yet to dissipate since then, is that Tinubu completely owns or is a major shareholder in the company.\n\nIn the same vein, the state has also never denied claims that the company takes about 10 percent of the internally generated revenue of Lagos, estimated in 2016 to be about N40 billion every month.\n\nThe court process was still ongoing when on October 27, 2020, hoodlums burnt the documents during the riotous #EndSARS violence in the state.\n\nThe court papers stating charges brought against Tinubu, his tax consultancy firm, Alpha Beta Consulting, by Apara were burnt, according to claims by Tade Ipadeola, Apara\u2019s lawyer.\n\n\u201cEverything in Igbosere High Court got burnt including the registrar\u2019s copy of our application. In fact, the whole building was burnt to ashes. So, we will have to file again. The registry has been moved to Ikeja.\n\n\u201cWe may have to file the case afresh at the Ikeja High Court but we have not yet been instructed to do so,\u201d he said on October 27, 2020.\n\nApara had claimed in the documents that Tinubu, suspiciously diverted N22,360,000,000 and $4,396,063 from the firm\u2019s account to that of Vintage Press Ltd, publisher of The Nation Newspaper.\n\nIn a writ of summons marked LD/7330GCMW/2020 deposed at a Lagos High Court, Apara, who claims to own a 30 per cent stake in the company, alleged that the former governor reneged on certain agreements reached in the past about the management and control of the consulting firm.\n\nOther fronts used by Tinubu, according to the former Alpha Beta boss, are Olumide Ogunmola and Tunde Badejo.\n\nIn his statement of claim, Apara said during a review of the company\u2019s account, he discovered that huge sums of money earned by the company over the years were not reflected in its account.\n\nHe also revealed how Tinubu used the Osun State governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, as a front for the establishment of the firm.\n\nAlpha Beta Consulting was awarded a contract by the Lagos State Government when Tinubu was governor of the state after a recommendation by a committee comprising the then Attorney-General of Lagos State, Prof Yemi Osinbajo (now the Vice President of Nigeria); Mr Wale Edun, then Commissioner for Finance; and a former Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Yemi Cardoso.\n\nThe firm was subsequently given exclusive rights to collect taxes on behalf of the Lagos State Government and was believed to receive about 10 percent commission from the revenue it collected for the state.\n\nHowever, pro-transparency groups and opposition politicians had constantly alleged that Tinubu owned Alpha Beta even though his name was not on any of the company's documents.\n\nHowever, both Tinubu and Alpha Beta denied the allegations.",

We are hopeful he will soon be apprehended to face the full wrath of the law.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile calling for an overhaul of the hospital security in a bid to address the development, the doctors equally demanded for \u201cprovision of able bodied, educated, age-appropriate, and well-equipped security personnel at strategic points like Accident and Emergency Unit, Children\u2019s Emergency Unit, Newborn Special Care Unit and all the major wards and clinics in the hospital.\u201d\n\nOther demands are; Provision of emergency security hotlines for hospital staff, mounting of posters and flyers at strategic points in UNTH stating the consequences of assaulting a health worker on duty.\n\n\u201cComportment forms shall be provided to be signed by the patient\u2019s relatives before admission of patients; provision of adequate lighting (solar preferable) at all corridors and corners of the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe ARD warned the general public \u201cto desist from assaulting any doctor, health worker and in fact any staff of the hospital,\u201d stressing that \u201cany grievance should be channeled via the appropriate quarters.\u201d\n\n",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says its officials didn\u2019t monitor any primary organised by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom state.\n\nMike Igini, resident electoral commissioner (REC) for Akwa Ibom, disclosed this in a report dated May 27, 2022, and submitted to the commission on the conduct of primaries in the state.\n\n\u201cWe wish to report that the APC governorship primary scheduled to hold on Thursday, May 26, 2022, at the Sheergrace Arena, Nsikak Eduok Avenue, Uyo, did not hold because the APC primary election committee did not come to the venue and did not hold the primary in any other venue monitored by the commission,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cThe Resident Electoral Commissioner, the Commissioner of Police and the State INEC Monitoring Committee were present at the venue for the duration earlier stated, but left at about 10:30pm after the Chairman of the Primary Election Committee notified the REC on phone that they would not come to the venue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEqually, the APC State Chapter Executives and the entire State Delegates were at the venue but the primary election did not hold because of the failure or refusal of the primary election committee to come to the designated venue.\u201d\n\nWith the June 9 deadline for primaries now gone, the implication is that APC has no candidate for the 2023 governorship election in Akwa Ibom.\n\nSpeaking to TheCable on Saturday, Igini said the commission was later informed of another primary which held at a different venue, but added that INEC officials didn\u2019t monitor the exercise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is not INEC that conducts party primaries. We only monitor. It is the APC that said they could not do the primary, so we said okay. By the time we woke up in the morning, they said at some location, they have done governorship primary. We are not aware of it; we didn\u2019t monitor it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHaving said they have done so, we are required to write our report. That report is what we wrote and submitted to Abuja.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, despite the \u201cmultitude of delegates\u201d present at the Sheergrace Arena, the APC election committee said they would not conduct the exercise there.\n\nAfter hours of back-and-forth over which venue was the approved place for the exercise, the APC primary election panel was said to have eventually gone to one Obot street venue for the primary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAkan Udofia, who recently defected to the APC from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was announced as the party\u2019s governorship candidate on May 27 \u2014 but INEC maintained that its officials didn\u2019t monitor that exercise.\n\nThe development comes amid leadership crisis in the party over factions loyal to Godswill Akpabio, former minister of Niger Delta affairs, and John Akpanudoedehe, former national secretary of the APC caretaker committee.\n\nIn October 2021, parallel congresses were held in the state, which produced two sets of executives \u2014 one led by Stephen Ntukekpo and the other by Austin Ekanem, with the former said to be loyal to Akpabio, and the latter backed by Akpanudoedehe.\n\nIn February 2022, when Abubakar Sani Bello, Niger governor, took over as acting national chairman of the caretaker committee, Ekanem was sworn in as the party\u2019s state chairman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after, a federal high court in Abuja nullified the swearing-in of Ekanem and recognised Ntukekpo as the party chairman.\n\nFollowing the development, Akpanudoedehe filed a suit seeking a stay of execution and he also appealed the judgment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, in April 2022, Abdullahi Adamu, APC national chairman, swore in Ntukekpo as the chairman of the party in Akwa Ibom, despite an appeal court ruling ordering the parties involved to maintain status quo pending determination of the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, Akpanudoedehe, who had also sought the party\u2019s governorship ticket, has dumped the APC and is now the governorship candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

With Karny, a bookkeeping app it acquired last year in August, Chari has now made and announced 3 successful acquisitions in 10 months.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cThe secret of a successful expansion is to build a local team that masters local market dynamics,\u201d said Chari\u2019s CEO Ismail Belkhayat who co-founded the startup with his wife Sophia Alj (COO) in 2020. \u201cThe real challenge is to convince local entrepreneurs to join forces with Chari to grow faster.\u201d\n\nLast year, in an interview, Belkhayat told TechCabal that the goal is to be the market leader across francophone Africa. Today it makes its first major foray and vouches to \u201ccontinue to surround ourselves with young and ambitious entrepreneurs from francophone Africa to build together a pan-African giant of FMCG and financial services distribution.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2021 by Ali Ouattara and Amidou Diarra, two former managers at Glovo and PepsiCo, Diago operates exclusively in Abidjan, the capital city of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and one of the biggest French-speaking cities in Africa.\n\nChari said in a statement that Ouattara and Diarra, who had initially sought funding and market and tech advisory before choosing to exit to the Moroccan, will remain CEO and COO, respectively. The duo will oversee local business growth before expanding footprint to other Sub-Saharan countries\u2014Chari\u2019s overarching goal.\n\n\u201cDiago\u2019s entire team will receive Chari\u2019s full support functions,\u201d said Chari\u2019s VP of international expansion Cyrille Jacques. \u201cChari\u2019s Casablanca back office will help the Diago team in setting up operations, IT tools, and customer service.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a new trend of African startups getting into both local and international mergers and acquisitions (M&A), especially cross-regional deals. Just last month, a Nigerian autotech startup Autochek travelled up north to acquire Moroccan KIFAL Auto. Now, Chari is acquiring a West African startup.\n\nBelkhayat said the company is currently raising a big series A. If Belkhayat\u2019s 2-year-old startup, with just about $7 million funding, has already made 3 acquisitions and is operational in 3 countries\u2014Morocco, Tunisia, and now Cote d\u2019Ivoire\u2014who knows what he\u2019d do with the \u201cbig series A\u201d when it finally closes?\n\nShare this article",

The warm welcome our team has received from artists, local partners and stakeholders is a strong indicator for us moving forward. Boomplay is committed to contributing to the dynamism of the Ivorian music industry\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no available data on the growth of the Ivory Coast\u2019s music streaming industry, several of its artists have risen to prominence in the past few years due to an increase in streaming services. For example, French singer-songwriter Kikimoteleba rose in Spotify\u2019s ranks when his hit single Tigini exceeded 15 million streams. Others have also been thrust into the spotlight on social media; the Nigerian remix of Aboutou Roots La Blessure, for instance, have been used in thousands of videos across the internet.\n\nThe role these streaming services play in democratising income for Ivorian artists cannot be understated especially as many artists depend of live performances for their income. Guy-Constant Neza, an Ivorian label manager at Believe Digital told Lemonde that 80% of Ivorian artists\u2019 income comes from live performances. Streaming platforms, according to Neza, provide \u201ca double awareness among our artists, of both the limits of the existing model and the opportunities that streaming offers.\u201d\n\nWith the launch of Boomplay, Ivorian artists now have access to 70 million active users on a platform where they\u2019ll be paid per stream/purchase.\n\nThe company has a freemium model similar to YouTube where users can play music for free but with ad intermissions, or pay for an ad-free version.\n\nAccording to Director of Artist and Media Relations, Tosin Sorinola, \u201cThis physical presence extends Boomplay\u2019s mission to promote local talent by providing them with a platform and resources within and outside of the service, which enables them to reach a wider audience of music lovers across the continent. We are delighted to provide a transparent service which ensures that artists get due revenue from their music streaming.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), has announced plan to introduce the Unstructured Supplementary (USSD) code as part of steps to improve the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\n\nKingsley Obiora, CBN deputy governor made the disclosure at the IMF African Department Speakers Series held virtually on Friday, according to NAN.\n\nThe series was focused on \u201cCBDC and Private Digital Payments in Kenya and Nigeria: Challenges and Opportunities for Sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nNAN recalls that the CBN inaugurated the CBDC, also known as the eNaira, on Oct. 25, 2021, aimed at making financial transactions easier and seamless for every strata of the society.\n\nObiora said the introduction of the USSD code became necessary to improve financial inclusion in the country and to ensure people without smartphones could still transact on the eNaira platform.\n\n\u201cWe have made serious progress in the last seven to eight years because when the current governor resumed in 2014, one of the pillars of his vision was to significantly improve financial inclusion.\n\n\u201cSo at the time, we were at 48 per cent of our population within the financial system and given several policies that he conceived and implemented, we are almost at 70 per cent.\n\n\u201cThat still leaves us with about 30 per cent of our population out of the financial system and we believe the CBDC can help reduce that number even more.\n\n\u201cA lot of people might not have smartphones but that is essentially the next step of our improvement in the CBDC, to introduce the USSD code, so those that do not have smartphones can still transact,\u201d Obiora said.\n\nThe CBN deputy governor said that the barrier to entry on the CBDC platform was low, which made it possible for everyone with a Bank Verification Number (BVN) to be onboarded into the eNaira platform in a few minutes.\n\nObiora said the value of the country\u2019s digital payments grew from 324 billion dollars in 2008 to about 2.4 trillion dollars presently, adding that Nigerians were now used to digital payments.\n\n\u201dAs you know, within the continent we have one of the largest Fintech companies, Futterwave, Paystack, etc, \u201c the apex bank boss added.\n\nHe said that the CBDC had significant benefits for Nigeria, which was why the CBN decided to introduce it.\n\nObiora listed the benefits to include rapid financial inclusion, reducing the cost of processing cash, enabling direct welfare payments to citizens, and reducing the informal economy.\n\nOthers are improving tax collection, boosting cross-border trade and remittances, reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of payments and just endearing economic growth in general.\n\nHe, however, listed some of the key risks to introducing the CBDC to include banking sector disintermediation, operational risks of knowing that there is non-stop service, cyber security risks, internet disruptions and financial literacy.\n\nObiora said that Nigeria was doing well based on a PwC report, which showed that Nigeria was number one in terms of adoption, adding that the CBN would keep growing and improving on the system.\n\nSpeaking on adopting cryptocurrency in Nigeria, the deputy governor said for now it would not become part of the country\u2019s financial system because of the volatility that it could create for the system.\n\nCommenting on the high cost of food and fuel in Nigeria caused by the war in Ukraine, he said that the problem was more political than economic.\n\nAccording to him, we hope that world leaders will sort this out as quickly as possible because ordinary people who have no egos and did not cause this problem are the ones that are suffering the most.\n\n\u201cWithin Nigeria what we are seeing is that farm gate food prices have either stabilised or reduced, whereas in the market it actually has increased.\u201d\n\nObiora said a lot of the problems with rising food inflation were due to logistic problems and the issue of higher prices of fuel and transportation.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to deal with that by investing a bit in a commodity exchange so that they can stabilise prices.\n\nHe said, \u201cwithin the monetary policy committee, rates will be raised at least to signal that we will continue to keep an eye on inflation and stand ready to do whatever it takes to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAccording to the moderator, Mr Abebe Selassie, Director, African Department, IMF, the series is a platform where Africa\u2019s pressing economic policy issues are discussed and organised by the IMF\u2019s African Department.\n\nSelassie said the series provided an opportunity for policymakers, academics, and analysts to offer their perspectives on economic and policy issues relevant to the IMF\u2019S African constituency, NAN reported",

          "text": "An Igbo group, the Association of South East Town Unions (ASETU), has accused Igbo delegates of betraying the presidential aspiration of the South East geopolitical zone at the primaries of political parties.\n\nThe group also condemned the denial of the region of the presidential tickets of both the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party, describing the situation as a glaring case of marginalisation.\n\nThe National President, ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe, who spoke on Friday in Enugu during a media briefing, said the outcome of the primaries confirmed the region\u2019s cry over the years concerning the marginalisation of Ndigbo within the Nigerian polity.\n\n\u201cOur fear is that this ugly incident has graduated to the terrible state of alienation. For us, there can be no better time to ensure that Igbo man deservedly becomes the President of Nigeria than now,\u201d Diwe said.\n\nHe stated that going by the constitutions of the major political parties, they were expected to zone the presidency to the South this time, adding, \u201cIn the South, also South-East has to be the automatic beneficiary, being the only zone that has not had a shot at the exalted position of the President or Vice-President since the democratic dispensation that started in 1999.\n\n\u201cThe South-West would have had the President for eight years and Vice-President for eight years by May 29, 2023; the South-South had the President for six years and the Vice-President for two years, leaving the South-East with none. It is only equitable, just and fair that the South-East produces the next President of Nigeria, which begins with all the political parties fielding Igbo presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo made such a concession to the Yoruba in the past. But the deep rooted hatred for Ndigbo by other tribes in Nigeria has played out, hence the ruling APC and the PDP refused to cede their presidential tickets to the South-East.\u201d\n\nHe regretted that despite the cry over the injustice and marginalisation by groups both in the South-East and other regions, they had continued.\n\n\u201cWe, however, doff our hats for Igbo aspirants, particularly Dr Ogbonanya Onu, and others for their courage and boldness in speaking out against injustice meted to the South-East during their speeches at the primary elections,\u201d Diwe added.\n\nThe ASETU President stated that the parties\u2019 primaries also exposed the real saboteurs in Igbo land, adding, \u201cThese are the South-East delegates, who were chosen to represent Ndigbo, but went there to fester their nests. They practically sold out their Igbo brothers and voted for aspirants of other regions, obviously because of money.\n\n\u201cRecords showed that the five South-Eastern states had about 389 delegates/votes in the case of the APC. Of this number, Ebonyi State had 39 delegates; Imo, 100; Anambra, 100; Abia, 100; and Enugu, 50 votes. But shamefully, only 40 votes from this number went to South-East aspirants. It is important to mention that 39 out of the 40 votes came from Ebonyi State delegates.\n\n\u201cGovernor David Umahi of Ebonyi State got 38 votes, while Dr Ogbonanya Onu had one vote. The other one vote went to Emeka Nwajiuba. The question is, who did the other Igbo delegates of the South East vote for? Certainly, contestants from other zones.\n\n\u201cIt is for this patriotic reason that ASETU therefore thumbs up all the delegates from Ebonyi State for making the Igbo proud. They did not sell out nor allow their reasoning to be swayed by pecuniary interest. They are the true sons of their forefathers. They have made the Igbo Hall of Fame with appropriate rank and designation.\u201d",

          "title": "APC Presidential Primary: How We Settled For Tinubu \u2013 El-Rufai",
          "text": "Kaduna State governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, yesterday gave an insider account of how former Lagos State governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu emerged as the presidential flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress.\n\nHe also lashed back at those kicking against a Muslim running mate for Tinubu, describing them as irresponsible people.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTinubu had polled 1,271 votes to defeat 13 other presidential aspirants at a keenly contested primary which was concluded on Wednesday.\n\nRevealing some of the factors that led to Tinubu\u2019s emergence as the party\u2019s presidential candidate, El-Rufai said governors of the North West geopolitical zone met before the primary and decided to support the most sellable aspirant knowing the North East would follow.\n\nEl-Rufai who spoke on Channels TV last night said he repeatedly asked President Muhammadu Buhari to name his preferred candidate among the five that were presented to him by state governors but the president insisted on letting delegates decide.\n\n\u201cI went to the president for the last time before Kaduna delegates voted and I asked, \u2018tell me who your anointed candidate is because you are still going to live in Kaduna after your tenure\u2019. Then he said to me, \u2018Let delegates vote their conscience; I have no anointed candidate\u201d, the governor noted.\n\nThe Kaduna governor also explained why northern APC governors insisted on power shift to the southern part of the country.\n\nThe governors had on Monday ordered the presidential aspirants from the region to withdraw from the presidential race and allowed their Southern counterpart to proceed with the process.\n\nEl-Rufai said his colleagues took the decision based on the principle that power should return to the South after the Buhari administration.\n\nHe stated: \u201cIt was based on principle and after eight years of President Muhammadu Buhari. It is only fair for the APC to zone it to the South. There is no written agreement but there was an understanding during the formation of the APC. Some of us were therefore terrified when some unserious contenders wanted to contest.\u201d\n\nConfirming a plot by some northern stakeholders to retain power in the region following the emergence of Atiku Abubakar as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, El-Rufai noted that the plot failed because the governors resolved to adhere to the party\u2019s motto of fairness.\n\nHe continued: \u201cWhen we saw moves by some governors and the Senate president, we got worried because we had a principle based on the party\u2019s motto of fairness. As a region, we must adhere to our words and we had to come out unanimously which the President supported.\n\n\u201cRight from the outset, Yahaya Bello made it clear he wanted to run but we didn\u2019t take it seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the PDP picked a northerner should not change our stance on fairness. I was told to pick the form but declined in the spirit of fairness. How I wished the PDP zoned to the South also.\n\n\u201cWe had to meet the president after reports about Lawan\u2019s candidacy emanated. We told President Buhari that we will support anyone insofar they are from the South which he considered regarding a five-name list. He checked the names and he ratified them ahead of the primaries.\u201d\n\nOn the protest against Muslim/Muslim ticket, the governor dismissed suggestions that he was in the race to become running mate to the former governor of Lagos State as mere speculations.\n\nInstead, he said what Tinubu needed at the moment was the space to pick a vice presidential candidate.\n\nAsked if it was appropriate for the APC to go into the election with a Muslim- Muslim ticket, he said irresponsible people were trying to inject religion into politics and governance.\n\nHe noted: \u201cYou are asking the wrong question because I don\u2019t look at people from the lense of Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian. I don\u2019t think the business of governance has to do with religion. I think we should look for the best person for the job.\n\n\u201cI am the wrong person to ask because in my state, I picked a very competent, qualified woman as my running mate in the 2019 election. Just because she happens to be a Muslim, people are calling it Muslim-Muslim ticket. And they said we were going to lose. We did it and we won overwhelmingly.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai said the fixation of Nigerians with religion instead of competence and capacity is sad and pathetic.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe way the media and irresponsible people are trying to inject religion into politics and governance is sad and pathetic. It will not take Nigeria anywhere.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at a crossroads. We face very serious dangers in security, economic meltdown and all people are concerned with as far as who will be president, vice president is religion. It is not religion that will solve our problems. It is the people who are competent and capable that will address Nigeria\u2019s problem, unite this country and put it on a progressive path.\u201d\n\nCAN Rejects Muslim-Muslim Ticket\n\nBut the Christian Association of Nigeria yesterday rejected Muslim-Muslim presidential tickets by the APC and other major political parties in the country, saying it would be a threat to the fragile peace and unity of Nigeria.\n\nIn a statement issued by its national secretary, Joseph Bade Daramola, CAN noted that with the country\u2019s challenges and its trajectory, it is imperative for the nation\u2019s political parties not to further polarise the country by settling for Christian-Christian or Muslim-Muslim presidential tickets, warning that the outcome would be worse.\n\nThe statement titled, \u2018Christian Association of Nigeria Rejects Proposed Muslim/Muslim Presidential Ticket in 2023\u2019, noted: \u201cThe Christian Association of Nigeria has once again warned the leading political parties to bury the thought of Christian/Christian or Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket in 2023. We want to unequivocally state that it is a threat to the fragile peace and unity of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe congratulate the Presidential Candidates of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party, the Labour Party: Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and Mr. Peter Obi respectively, including other parties that are participating in the forthcoming Presidential election.\n\n\u201cCAN urges that a balance of both religious practitioners be considered in the choice of running mates of the presidential candidates. We do not subscribe to Christian/Christian ticket or Muslim/Muslim ticket. Politicians can talk politics but we have stated our view long before now.\n\n\u201cAny party that tries same religion ticket will fail. This is not 1993. Even when we have joint Muslim/Christian ticket, the church still goes through hell. Only God knows the number of Christians that have been killed in the last seven years with no one apprehended or prosecuted.\n\n\u201cImagine how bad it will be if we have two Muslims in power? The extant Nigerian Constitution promotes religious balance. So, if any political party wants to try a Muslim/Muslim ticket, it\u2019s at its own peril. CAN is only forewarning but will make a categorical statement in the event our warning is not heeded.\n\n\u201cThe Presidential running mate for the APC presidential flag bearer, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu should be a Christian from the North, Atiku\u2019s running mate should be a Christian from the South while Obi should choose his own among the Muslims from the North.\n\n\u201cAnything contrary to the above means that the leadership of these political parties do not bother about the unity of this entity called Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThose who are planning Muslim/Muslim ticket should also find out what was the outcome of MKO Abiola and Kingibe ticket in 1993. If they try Muslim/Muslim ticket this time around, the outcome will be worse because our fault lines are very visible.\n\nTinubu Visits Yahaya Bello\n\n\u201cThere is no party that has no great, good and patriotic Christians who can preside over the affairs of this nation not to talk of being the Vice President as some mischievous people are trying to say. If merit and competence are used as yardsticks, we have many qualified Christians in all the 774 Local Government Areas of this country.\n\n\u201cIn the ongoing dispensation, CAN leadership cried in vain to ask President Muhammadu Buhari to break the monopoly or dominance of the security architecture with people of the same faith. We are all seeing the outcome now. It is obvious that the Nigeria of today is different from that of 1993. Our politicians should stop flouting the Constitution by respecting the North and South dichotomy and religious factors.\n\n\u201cTo those arguing that people do not care about the religions of their leaders once they are competent and credible, we dare APC to pick its presidential running mate from the South and PDP pick its own from the North and see what follows.\n\n\u201cWhen the late sage, Papa Obafemi Awolowo picked Chief Mrs Oyibo Odinamadu, a fellow Christian and Southerner, as his running mate in 1979, we all know the consequences of his performance in the North. Our politicians should be doing what will unite us instead of what will further polarise the country.\u201d\n\nPresidential Candidate Continues Reconciliatory Moves\n\nMeanwhile, the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, yesterday continued his process of reconciliation with presidential aspirants who slugged it out with him at the just concluded presidential primary of the party.\n\nBello was one of the contestants defeated by Tinubu in the contest to clinch the APC\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nTinubu visited Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello, and former Transportation minister Rotimi Amaechi on Friday.\n\nThe APC standard bearer had on Thursday evening paid an unscheduled visit to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nHe met with President Muhammadu Buhari before proceeding to Osinbajo\u2019s Aguda House residence in Aso Villa.\n\nYesterday, the former governor of Lagos State visited Governor Bello, asking him to support his campaign to improve the lives of Nigerians.\n\nTinubu arrived at Bello\u2019s Abuja residence in the company of former APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.\n\nSpeaking during the visit, Tinubu stressed the need for unity to provide a better, prosperous future for Nigerians.\n\nHe said, \u201cTo all of you, I say thank you; you\u2019ve done a good job. If the mood reflects the day, I will spend the night here. I say thank you very much for donating a befitting office for us to continue to struggle,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will use our intellectual inquisitiveness, build a nation of sound minds, sound people, elevate our people, and extract them from poverty.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to be in abject poverty in this country. We are brilliant people. Let us wear the uniform of can-do; the mind of those people who have built other nations, particularly people from this age.\n\n\u201cYou are the owners of today, tomorrow and thereafter. It will be your grandchildren that will drive the nation after you have gone. The prayer is that we will leave a united, prosperous nation for you.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Governor Bello donated his campaign office to Tinubu\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nIn response, Tinubu thanked the governor for the gesture, even as he promised to work for the party and country\u2019s unity.\n\nAlso, the presidential candidate last night paid a visit to another APC presidential aspirant, Amaechi, in Abuja.\n\nDetails of the meeting with Amaechi were still sketchy at the time of filing this report.",
          "summary": "Kaduna State governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, yesterday gave an insider account of how former Lagos State governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu emerged as the presidential flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress.\nInstead, he said what Tinubu needed at the moment was the space to pick a vice presidential candidate.\nThe statement titled, \u2018Christian Association of Nigeria Rejects Proposed Muslim/Muslim Presidential Ticket in 2023\u2019, noted: \u201cThe Christian Association of Nigeria has once again warned the leading political parties to bury the thought of Christian/Christian or Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket in 2023.\nBello was one of the contestants defeated by Tinubu in the contest to clinch the APC\u2019s presidential ticket.\nAlso, the presidential candidate last night paid a visit to another APC presidential aspirant, Amaechi, in Abuja.",

          "text": "Despite the outcome of the results of the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said he only lost the battle and not the war.\n\nOsinbajo, who spoke yesterday in Abuja at the campaign office of The Progressive Project (TPP), a coalition of support groups that backed him for the presidency, noted that he remains committed to the dream of a new Nigeria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA statement by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, quoted the vice president as also stating that he would support the PC presidential flag bearer, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nThe VP who was received by a large crowd at the TPP office in Abuja described the clamour for a new Nigeria as a movement.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis movement is a movement within a party also, we are not doing something that has not been heard of before. What is new is that we have a firm belief that a new Nigeria is possible and it is possible through us who are here.\n\n\u201cWe went to the convention, and the results showed us clearly that we lost, but it is only a battle; it is not the war. There are battles ahead, but we will win the war for a new Nigeria. I have no doubt in my mind that we will win that war for a new Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat is why our movement for a new Nigeria must remain strong and firm. And we will do everything to keep our movement strong and solid\u201d.\n\nAccording to the vice president, despite the result of the APC presidential primary, \u201cthe dream of a new country remains alive and well.\n\n\u201cWe will have at the back of our minds, that what you have started in the various movements, coming into one, is the seed that will birth a new nation. You and I know the time has come and we will devote everything to it.\n\n\u201cI am committed and will remain committed to that dream (of a new Nigeria), for as long as you are willing and recognize that we have not yet written the story of this country, we have not yet completed the story of this country. As a matter of fact, the story has just begun, this movement has just started.\n\n\u201cA new Nigeria has only just started, and everywhere across this land, it will be clear to all that a new Nigeria has been born. Once the genie comes out of the bottle, you cannot put it back. The word has been spoken; it cannot be taken back: it is time for a New Nigeria,\u201d Osinbajo added.\n\nPledging support for the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 elections, Osinbajo recalled the personal letter he wrote to Tinubu yesterday congratulating him on his victory at the party primary.\n\n\u201cIn that letter, I said to him that the dream of this country, the dream of a new country, remains alive and well. And I want you to know in your hearts that we are democrats when we participate in a contest and the results are announced.\n\nContinue To Champion Nigeria\u2019s Devt, Youths Tell Osinbajo\n\n\u201cNo matter what those results may be, we abide by them because there is only one process for democrats, whether that process is good or bad, there is only one, and we have gone through that process.\n\n\u201cAnd in that process, a winner has been adjudged, but that does not kill the dream of the great future. We will support our party; we will support the flagbearer of our party because we know that the other side is not even worth considering. So, we will support the flagbearer of our party, we will do everything we can,\u201d he said.\n\nThanking Nigerians at home and abroad, including the Osinbajo support groups, for the overwhelming support for his presidential bid, the VP noted: \u201cWhen we started this race, I never believed that we would have so many young men and women who would believe so passionately in the cause of a new Nigeria.\u201d\n\nDolapo Osinbajo Consoles Husband\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs Dolapo Osinbajo has consoled her husband, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, after he failed to win the presidential ticket of the APC at Eagle Square, Abuja, on Wednesday.\n\nThe vice president lost the APC presidential ticket to his benefactor and former governor of Lagos, Bola Tinubu.\n\nIn an Instagram post on Thursday, the vice president\u2019s wife wrote: \u201cOluyemi.. Oluleke.. Omoluabi.. Omo oko.. Oninu ire.. Oniwa Pele.. Oniwa tutu\u2026 Ologbon.. Olododo.. Alaanu.. I\u2019m proud of you!\u201d\n\nSome 26,000 people liked the post with 3,000 others making comments of encouragement, including Segun Awolowo who responded with the #so proud.\n\nCommenting, Oseunayo wrote: \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of him. He did not win the primaries, but he did not lose his honour and integrity. I salute his steadfastness. God bless him forever.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo has since congratulated Tinubu on his victory saying \u201cfor many decades, our flagbearer has shown passion, patriotism, courage and determination in the cause of nation-building.\n\n\u201cHis sterling contributions to our democracy and its progress stand him out. His wealth of experience will certainly be critical in our party\u2019s continued efforts to attain a more secure and prosperous Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo all members of our great party, regardless of who you voted for at the primaries, we must now unite behind our presidential candidate and flagbearer to ensure victory for our party in the 2023 elections,\u201d the VP stated.\n\nAtiku Hosts Forum Of Former PDP Governors\n\nMeanwhile, the presidential candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, on Thursday hosted the forum of former governors of the party at his residence in Abuja.\n\nThe former vice president, in a post on his Instagram page late on Friday, described the meeting as pleasant and refreshing.\n\nHe said, \u201cSteadily, the PDP is gearing for a phenomenal campaign ahead of the 2023 general election with a united front. The responses from all the stakeholders that I have met with reinforce the belief that as one, we can get it done.\u201d\n\nNo official statement was however made on the focus and outcome of the meeting. The media was also not invited.\n\nReactions to his post were however mixed. While most were encouraging messages, at least one asked him to pick his running mate from the South East, and a few asked him to step down for Peter Obi, candidate of the Labour Party.",

I am of Ngas extraction, my parents , Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Sitkukka are both business owners in Jos. Bent on following their footstep, I established Awtik Beautifiers Centre where I train girls to be self sufficient and financially independent , hence, liberating them from the shackles of poverty. In fact, my Centre, Awtik Beautifiers , is one of the best in Jos town with the state of art equipment for hair making, make -up, nails fixing , footcare and many others.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEDUCATION\n\nI obtained my primary education from Betel private school, Jos, thereafter, I proceeded to COCIN Secondary School, Dadin Kowa , Jos.\n\nThereafter, I proceeded to the University of Jos, where I obtained Bsc in Economics, my choice was based on my interest in business. I also grabbed Master Degree in Economics from the same University last year.\n\nCAREER\n\nIt all started back then in the University of Jos where I developed myself to be financially different from my peers. I learnt trade that enabled me became an entrepreneur today and have this, trained and employed others. All thanks to the one year mandatory NYSC programme initiative of the federal government through which I went a step further to develop my skills in the area of beauty and skin care.\n\nIt\u2019s important to mention that my journey started way back from school because with my sister, raised money for our personal effects . So when I returned from service, I got a grant, and opened Awtik beautifiers centre and here we are today.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n\nSo far, I have trained 300 girls who are self sufficient and financially independent to take care of themselves and their siblings. These girls are contributing to the growth and development of their immediate communities as well as the state IGR through the taxes they pay.\n\nCHALLENGES\n\nGetting the people of like minds to work with me. My reasons are that setting good aspirations and visions without the input of people to support the vision would amount to failure. Getting the right people to support and help you grow to an enviable height is mostly the challenge . The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic added to the slow pace of business too.\n\nMENTOR\n\nI have two mentors, my sister who taught me discipline in business, and Tara Fela-Durotoye, who is also into beauty business. I learnt a lot from her. She\u2019s my major inspiration. Although my sister and my parents have been strong pillars of support in my walk to self actualisation, on my part, I attended quite a numbers of trainings. I did training on Astra and I here in Astra and in Jos as well to acquire the techniques that stands me out today.\n\nINSPIRATION\n\nMy background drives me to strive to engender peace, wealth , and progress in the society and humanity.\n\nI am the fourth child in a family of 10 children borne by very poor parents. We were so poor that we couldn\u2019t even afford clean water for drinking. It was so bad that we had to source for unclean and unsafe water which we used to boil before we could drink. So I just wanted to change the narrative. To achieve my dream of changing my family\u2019s identity, and bettering the lives of other poor families remains my inspiration\n\nFEAR\n\nI have three major fears. One has to do with failure. Then I also struggle with the fear of losing my parents before making it in life, hence, motivation to being financially independent. I also fear for those girls out there doing nothing except prostitution.\n\nWHAT DIFFERENTIATES YOU FROM OTHER WOMEN\n\nI am always on top of my job. I always upgrade myself and make sure to apply current technique and global best practices to help me stay afloat in the competitive market. My clients\u2019 satisfaction is my utmost priority.\n\nI am continuously to work better in my field. I want to have branches and organise frequent trainings for girls who are willing to impact on the society . I have full faith in God and anything I become is because he is with me. However, we all have our goals in life and we pray to God to make life easy for us and around us.\n\nREGRETS\n\nI really don\u2019t have any regret because I grew up in a Loving family, surrounded by loved ones. I am grateful to God and them. So, in a nutshell I have no regrets. My business has boosted standard of my living .\n\nFUTURE PLAN\n\nLike I said earlier, I strive to grow and expand to the nooks and crannies of this country to motivate young ladies to be completely financially independent.\n\nYes, I want to open branches in Abuja and other States because my business is open to all category of people. So we don\u2019t look at how influential you are. We are always available to serve everyone in the society.\n\nADVISE FOR WOMEN\n\nMy advice to the girl child is for them to get something doing so that they can be self sufficient and be independent. Marriage will come at the right time. They should not just be idle and be hoping that a man will come and solve their financial troubles and whatever.\n\nProstitution isn\u2019t the way out but hardwork. They should stand up for themselves . Women should be able to pursue their careers with regards to education and business .\n\nAnyone discouraging women from being independent , does not want their progress because when when you empower one woman , you have empowered a nation which is a popular saying. While it\u2019s important for a woman to be broad minded and be well educated, in the absence of support , as goal getters , we should build ourselves, grow and be financially independent to avoid disrespect, harassment and all of that.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR CALL TO BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\nI don\u2019t want any loan but if I can get grant fine. Or if the government can sponsor young girls to be trained and then support them with grants, that will be a good development. I have over 50 girls that I have trained that are doing very well now. I monitor what they are doing on social media. So people came all the way from Adamawa, Kaduna to be trained here in Jos on monthly basis. In the make up session alone, we have large trainees.",
          "summary": "Bent on following their footstep, I established Awtik Beautifiers Centre where I train girls to be self sufficient and financially independent , hence, liberating them from the shackles of poverty.\nCAREERIt all started back then in the University of Jos where I developed myself to be financially different from my peers.\nACHIEVEMENTSSo far, I have trained 300 girls who are self sufficient and financially independent to take care of themselves and their siblings.\nThen I also struggle with the fear of losing my parents before making it in life, hence, motivation to being financially independent.\nFUTURE PLANLike I said earlier, I strive to grow and expand to the nooks and crannies of this country to motivate young ladies to be completely financially independent.",

          "text": "Ismaila Mustapha, also known as Mompha breached the terms of his bail by procuring a new passport and travelling to Dubai on 11 April, EFCC prosecuting counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo has told the Ikeja High Court.\n\nOyedepo made the startling information known on Friday to Justice Mojisola Dada, in whose court, Mompha, with his company Ismalob Global Investment Limited, was standing trial.\n\nThe Instagram celebrity and businessman was arraigned by the Lagos Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on January 12, 2022.\n\nOyedepo noted that though the defendant was granted bail, investigation showed that he had another passport apart from the one he submitted to the court as part of his bail conditions, thereby not fully complying with the court\u2019s order.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have it on good authority that the defendant has a passport issued in Abuja on the 4th July 2021 to expire on the 30th June 2031.\n\n\u201cArmed with this passport, the information we have from our partners is that, on the 11th of April, 2022 via Emirates Airlines, the defendant flew from Ghana to Dubai.\n\n\u201cThat passport was not the one that was submitted to this Honourable Court.\u201d\n\nThe defence counsel, Gboyega Oyewole, SAN, however, responded that such facts ought to be presented on oath.\n\nJustice Dada, upon seeing the soft copy of the data page of the said passport, held that the name, photo and signature of the defendant on it were the same with the ones on the passport submitted to the court for the bail and also noted that it was \u201ca serious issue\u201d.\n\nThe defendant, who was shown the soft copy in open court, however, denied it was his passport.\n\nConsequently, Justice Dada held that \u201cthe bail of the defendant is temporarily revoked until the issue of the passport is resolved.\u201d\n\nOyewole, however, pleaded with the Court for one week for him to investigate it, noting that it was the Immigration Service that could speak to the existence of the passport in a case where another passport existed.\n\nJustice Dada granted the prayer of the defence and also released the defendant to the defence counsel.\n\nJustice Dada of the Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja, Lagos, adjourned till June 16, 2022, further hearing in the case.\n\nMompha was arraigned on eight counts bordering on conspiracy to launder funds obtained through unlawful activity, retention of proceeds of criminal conduct, laundering of funds obtained through unlawful activity, failure to disclose assets and property, possession of documents containing false pretence and use of property derived from unlawful act.\n\nOne of the counts reads: \u201cIsmaila Mustapha, Ahmadu Mohammed (at large) and Ismalob Global Investment Limited, sometime in 2016, in Lagos, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, conspired amongst yourselves to conduct financial transactions to the tune of N5,998,884,653.18 ( Five Billion Nine Hundred and Ninety-eight Million Eight Hundred and Eighty-four Thousand Six Hundred and Fifty-three Naira Eighteen Kobo) with the intent of promoting the carrying on of specified unlawful activities to wit: Obtaining by false pretence.\u201d\n\nHe pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d to the charge.\n\nAt Friday\u2019s sitting, which was fixed by the Court for \u201cdefinite final report\u201d on the plea bargain being explored by both parties, the prosecuting counsel, Oyedepo, informed the Court that an agreement was drafted and sent to the defence.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe defendant informed us that they needed five days to enable them execute the terms, and we thought that they were working with utmost sincerity of heart.\n\n\u201cApparently from their disposition, it appears that the decision of the defendant is for us to go head-on with the prosecution of this matter.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging that the prosecution sent a draft plea bargain to the defence, the defence counsel, Oyewole, said: \u201cThe day before we took the last date, the prosecution sent us a draft plea bargain on the very day.\n\n\u201cAt the last date, my Lord, a day before coming before your lordship was when they sent the draft to us.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely important for me to state that a man will not, because of peace, plead guilty to what he has not done. I have always cooperated with the prosecution, and I am not averse to accelerated hearing.\u201d\n\nResponding, Oyedepo stressed that the prosecution was not \u201cdesperate for anything\u201d and was not interested in putting pressure on the defendant to agree to any plea bargain.\n\nOyedepo added that the EFCC was not the only agency \u201con this matter\u201d.\n\nThe case was adjourned till June 16, 2022.",

The PDP spokesman, Debo Ologunagba, confirmed the setting up of the committee to The PUNCH last night.\n\nIt was gathered that the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, and his Delta State counterpart, Ifeanyi Okowa, had intensified lobby of the PDP stakeholders as part of moves to clinch the post.\n\nOn his part, the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on Thursday, began the search for his running mate with a meeting with northern governors.\n\nAs Tinubu met northern governors, the Independent National Electoral Commission on Thursday gave parties June 17 deadline to submit the names of their presidential candidates and running mates.\n\nThe commission had on May 27 extended the deadline for parties to conduct primaries from June 4 to June 9.\n\nIt also fixed June 17 as the deadline for parties to submit lists of their candidates.\n\nAt the PDP primary held on May 29, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, who emerged as the presidential candidate, polled 371 votes while his closest challenger, Wike, came second with 237 votes.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tinubu defeated aspirants including a former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and the Vice-President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nOn the efforts to reconcile the aspirants who lost during the primaries, the party said a reconciliation process was ongoing.\n\nIt was gathered that Wike and Okowa had reached out to their fellow governors as part of efforts to clinch the post.\n\nA close source to Wike told The PUNCH that the governor was in Abuja lobbying to be named Atiku\u2019s running mate.\n\nThe source stated, \u201cThe governor is not in town as we speak.

          "text": "Nigerian American Chamber of Commerce (NACC) Abuja Chapter has called on all Shippers to take advantage of the window provided by the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Programme to boost trade between Nigeria and the United States of America\n\nThe Executive Secretary of NACC Abuja Chapter, Mr. Ayo Salaam disclosed that Nigerian companies have not taken advantage of the AGOA because they export mainly oil to the United States.\n\nThe AGOA forum is one of the key components of U.S African strategy that focuses on increasing the United States Trade and Investment in Africa as a mechanism for job creation within the continent.\n\n\u201cThe AGOA project initiated by the United States of America in 2000 was to help develop trade and facilitate exporting over 6000 goods into America with no tariff. The trade agreement primarily set up to simulate the African economy covered 15 years, and has since elapsed in 2015. However, Nigeria and other countries on the programme have been given a second chance when the programme was extended by another 10 years\u201d, he said.\n\nMr. Salaam added that it is only exporters that can liberate Nigeria from the present economic slavery through focus on exportation of non-oil products.\n\n\u201cIt is good for the citizens to know that economic independence is as important as political independence.

          "text": "The Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room (Situation Room), a coalition of Civil Society Organisations, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to extend the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise.\n\nThe current CVR exercise is scheduled to end on June 30.\n\nBut the CSOs believe \u201ccitizens have now intensified their efforts in registering for their Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC).\n\n\u201cThere have also been several appeals by Nigerians to INEC to extend the registration exercise to enable them register to obtain a PVC. Situation Room has received reports of large crowds at the INEC offices across the country.\n\nREAD ALSO: INEC Records \u2018Unprecedented Surge\u2019 In PVC Registration, To Deploy More Machines\n\n\u201cThere were lots of complaints while the pre-registrations were open on the online voters\u2019 portal, that confirmed scheduling was not observed by officers at many INEC offices leading to people being treated as walk-in registrants and asked to queue to supply the same details already provided online.\n\n\u201cWhile we note some registrants wait for last minute to meet deadlines for registration, it is also worthy to note that there have been several complaints of inadequate manpower and equipment in INEC offices, thus making it difficult to have a seamless registration process. This has led to delays and restiveness of citizens waiting to register in long queues.\n\n\u201cSituation Room is further concerned that many Nigerians will be discouraged and disenfranchised if the exercise proceeds in this manner. In addition, INEC is yet to cover many of the rural communities in this process thereby excluding citizens who may be far away from the INEC LGA offices.\n\n\u201cThe attention of Situation Room has been called on several posts by citizens on Twitter reporting the conduct of INEC officials across the country. In Amawbia, Awka-South LGA \u2013 Anambra State, prospective voters were asked to sweep the INEC office before being attended to or leave if they refused. In Nnewi North Local Government, another report states that the sum of 1,000 Naira is being collected for voter registration. In Aba North LGA, workers have not been to work for four months.\n\n\u201cSituation Room calls on INEC to check conduct of their staff nationwide, properly coordinate the ongoing voter registration exercise and restrain the chaotic situation in many registration centres nationwide. If the process is managed properly and seamlessly, every eligible citizen will be captured. S 9(6) of the Electoral Act 2022 which allows for voter registration to go on till ninety days to the general elections means that INEC still has room to extend the CVR exercise.\n\n\u201cSituation Room commends the traders in Alaba International Market, Ojo in Lagos State who shut down the market to register for their PVCs and dispelled the thugs who came to disrupt the process. Citizens should not be subject to this kind of attack in the process of carrying out a constitutional right. We call on the Nigeria Police to investigate the incident and make arrest of perpetrators to prevent this incident from repeating itself in other locations where registrants are gathered.\n\n\u201cSituation Room therefore urges eligible citizens who are yet to register not to be deterred and to take advantage of the ongoing CVR exercise to do so. For those who registered between July 2021 and December 2021, Situation Room calls on them to go to INEC\u2019s Office at the Local Government Area where their polling unit is located to collect their PVCs.\n\n\u201cRemember, it is your right to vote!\u201d",

          "text": "The governorship candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji and five candidates of other political parties have called for a peaceful conduct of the June 18 election in the state.\n\nThey made the promise while participating in a Town Debate in Ado Ekiti.\n\nThe candidates, at the town hall debate was organised by Daar Communications in collaboration with Nigeria Civil Society Situationroom, UKaid and Foreign & Commonwealth Office called for a free, fair, and credible electoral process, and collectively condemned attempts by any politician to engage in electoral malpractices that may cause unrest in Ekiti, during or after the gubernatorial elections.\n\nThose who participated in the debate are; Mr. Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Engr. Olusegun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Bashorun Reuben Famuyibo of the Accord Party (AP) and Erelu Kemi Elebute-Halle of the Action Democratic Party, ADP. Others are Hon Bisi Kolawole of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and Dr. Wole Oluyede of the African Democratic Congress (ADC).\n\nSpeaking on why he signified his intention to run for the state\u2019s highest office, Oyebanji said having garnered experience in the art of governance and administration in the state for 11 years and occupied various offices, including that of Secretary to the State Government, he was sure he had the necessary wherewithal to pilot the affairs of the state.\n\nOyebanji, a former University lecturer also cited his participation in the activities of the Committee that fought for the creation of Ekiti State, where he served as Secretary, as an experience that gave him a deep insight into what the founding fathers of the state aspired to achieve with Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cI have been a lecturer, I have been a player in the banking sector, I have served the state government for 11 years and I have served on the board of a Federal Government agency as Chairman, Governing Board, Citizenship and Leadership Training Centre, Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development (June 2009 \u2013 Dec. 2010). Besides, I read a lot and I have passion for books on development, the global economy, African socio-economic movements and books that deal with strategies for growth. At an early age I was involved in the drafting of the Master Plan for Ekiti State. That was during the build up to the creation of the state and I think this will help very well in building on what successive administrations have done,\u201d he stated.\n\nSpeaking further, Oyebanji took the audience through his manifesto titled; \u2018Together with You\u2019 where he itemized his six point agenda which include, Youth Development & Job Creation, Human Capital Development, Agricultural & Rural Development, Infrastructural & Industrialization, Tourism & Culture and Governance.\n\nUnder governance, the APC candidate said he would design a sustainable programme to clear outstanding salary and pension obligations and ensure full compliance with the contributory pension scheme policy going forward. He also emphasized his determination to provide logistic and equipment support to existing security agencies.\n\nSpeaking on the need for Ekiti people to ensure a peaceful election, Oyebanji said the exercise should not be a do or die affair, adding that he didn\u2019t pray for shedding of blood of any Ekiti indigene as a result of election violence.",

          "text": "The costs of gas, food and other necessities jumped in May, raising inflation to a new four-decade high and giving American households no respite from rising costs.\n\nConsumer prices surged 8.6% last month from 12 months earlier, faster than April\u2019s year-over-year surge of 8.3%, the Labor Department said Friday.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, prices jumped 1% from April to May, a steep rise from the 0.3% increase from March to April. Much higher gas prices were to blame for most of that increase.\n\nAmerica\u2019s rampant inflation is imposing severe pressures on families, forcing them to pay much more for food, gas and rent and reducing their ability to afford discretionary items, from haircuts to electronics. Lower-income and Black and Latino Americans, in particular, are struggling because, on average, a larger proportion of their income is consumed by necessities.\n\nAt the same time, inflation has shown some signs of moderating, and economists expect it to decline this year, though not by very much. Some analysts have forecast that the inflation gauge the government reported Friday \u2014 the consumer price index \u2014 may drop below 7% by year\u2019s end. In March, the year-over-year CPI reached 8.5%, the highest such rate since 1982.\n\nHigh inflation has also forced the Federal Reserve into what will likely be the fastest series of interest rate hikes in three decades. By raising borrowing costs aggressively, the Fed hopes to cool spending and growth enough to curb inflation without tipping the economy into a recession. For the central bank, it will be a difficult balancing act.\n\nSurveys show that Americans see high inflation as the nation\u2019s top problem, and most disapprove of President Biden\u2019s handling of the economy. Congressional Republicans are hammering Democrats on the issue in the run-up to midterm elections this fall.\n\nInflation has remained high even as the sources of rising prices have shifted. Initially, robust demand for goods from Americans who were stuck at home for months after COVID-19 hit caused shortages and supply-chain snarls and drove up prices for cars, furniture and appliances.\n\nNow, as Americans resume spending on services, including travel, entertainment and dining out, the costs of airline tickets, hotel rooms and restaurant meals have soared. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has further accelerated the prices of oil and natural gas. And with China easing strict COVID lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere, more of its citizens are driving, thereby sending oil prices up even further.\n\nGoods prices are expected to fall in the coming months. Many large retailers, including Target, Walmart and Macy\u2019s, have reported that they\u2019re now stuck with too much of the patio furniture, electronics and other goods that they ordered when those items were in heavier demand and will have to discount them.\n\nEven so, rising gas prices are eroding the finances of millions of Americans. Prices at the pump are averaging nearly $5 a gallon nationally and edging closer to the inflation-adjusted record of about $5.40 reached in 2008.\n\nResearch by the Bank of America Institute, which uses anonymous data from millions of their customers\u2019 credit and debit card accounts, shows spending on gas eating up a larger share of consumers\u2019 budgets and crowding out their ability to buy other items.\n\nFor lower-income households \u2014 defined as those with incomes below $50,000 \u2014 spending on gas reached nearly 10% of all spending on credit and debit cards in the last week of May, the institute said in a report this week. That\u2019s up from about 7.5% in February, a steep increase in such a short period.\n\nSpending by all the bank\u2019s customers on long-lasting goods, like furniture, electronics and home improvement, has plunged from a year ago, the institute found. But their spending on plane tickets, hotels and entertainment has continued to rise.\n\nEconomists have pointed to that shift in spending from goods to services as a trend that should help lower inflation by year\u2019s end. But with wages rising steadily for many workers, prices are rising in services as well.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

          "text": "The congressional committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riots kicked off public hearings on Thursday with graphic video and chilling testimony from witnesses, laying out a case against former Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Democratic-led committee presented videotaped testimony showing that close Trump allies, including his own daughter Ivanka, rejected his false 2020 election fraud claims.\n\nThe congressional committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riots kicked off public hearings on Thursday with graphic video and chilling testimony from witnesses, laying out a case against former Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Democratic-led committee presented videotaped testimony showing that close Trump allies, including his own daughter Ivanka, rejected his false 2020 election fraud claims.\n\nCapitol police officer Caroline Edwards was one of two in-person witnesses who testified Thursday, the first of six congressional hearings intended to illustrate how Trump\u2019s repeated claims of voter fraud incited the deadly riot by his supporters on January 6.\n\nShe described hours of grueling hand-to-hand combat with Trump supporters who barged into the Capitol that day.\n\nCAROLINE EDWARDS: \u201cWhat I saw was just a war scene\u2026 There were officers on the ground. They were bleeding. They were throwing up. I saw friends with blood all over their faces, I was slipping in people\u2019s blood.\u201d\n\nThe committee also screened part of Trump\u2019s incendiary speech immediately before the attack, in which he redirected his supporters\u2019 anger at Vice President Mike Pence, who was at the Capitol that day overseeing the congressional certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election win.\n\nThe committee further showed how even some of the people closest to the former president did not believe or support his voter fraud claims, including former Attorney General William Barr, and Trump\u2019s daughter and adviser Ivanka.\n\nWILLIAM BARR: \u201cAnd in that context, I made it clear I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff, which I told the president was bullshit.\u201d\n\nIVANKA TRUMP: \u201cI respect Attorney General Barr so I accepted what he was saying.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Liz Cheney, one of two Republicans on the committee, also noted that multiple Republican congressmen later sought pardons from the White House for what she said was their role in trying to overturn the election.\n\nMeanwhile Trump, who is considering another White House run in 2024, lashed out at the committee of quote \u201cpolitical hacks\u201d after Thursday\u2019s hearing and stood by his voter fraud claims.\n\nFour people were killed during the January 6 riots, which also caused millions of dollars in damage to the Capitol. More than 100 police officers were injured, while one officer died the following day.",
