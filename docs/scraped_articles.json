          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nOver one billion people aged 12 to 35 years risk losing their hearing due to prolonged and excessive exposure to loud music and other recreational sounds, the World Health Organisation has said.\n\nGovernments, WHO noted, should begin to address the challenge of excessive exposure to loud music in the communities, warning that it has devastating consequences on the physical and mental health of people.\n\nThe WHO made the call in a statement issued ahead of the 2022 World Hearing Day, adding that young people are more at risk of hearing loss as a result of loud music because they are more exposed to it.\n\nThe global health agency says it has issued a new international standard for safe listening at venues and events, noting that this standard applies to places and activities where amplified music is played.\n\n\u201cMillions of teenagers and young people are at risk of hearing loss due to the unsafe use of personal audio devices and exposure to damaging sound levels at venues such as nightclubs, bars, concerts and sporting events,\u201d said WHO\u2019s Director for the Department for Noncommunicable Diseases, Dr. Bette Mikkelsen.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe risk is intensified as most audio devices, venues and events do not provide safe listening options and contribute to the risk of hearing loss. The new WHO standard aims to better safeguard young people as they enjoy their leisure activities.\u201d\n\nThe Global standard for safe listening at venues and events, WHO said, highlights six recommendations for implementation to ensure that venues and events limit the risk of hearing loss to their patrons while preserving high-quality sound and an enjoyable listening experience.\n\nThe six recommendations are a maximum average sound level of 100 decibels; live monitoring and recording of sound levels using calibrated equipment by designated staff; optimizing venue acoustics and sound systems to ensure enjoyable sound quality and safe listening; making personal hearing protection available to audiences including instructions on use.\n\nOther recommendations are access to quiet zones for people to rest their ears and decrease the risk of hearing damage, and provision of training and information to staff.\n\nThe new standard was developed under WHO\u2019s Make Listening Safe initiative which seeks to improve listening practices, especially among young people, drawing on the latest evidence and consultations with a range of stakeholders including experts from WHO, government, industry, consumers, and civil society.\n\nThe UN body noted that while exposure to loud sounds causes temporary hearing loss or tinnitus, prolonged or repeated exposure can lead to permanent hearing damage, resulting in irreversible hearing loss.\n\nWHO encourages governments to develop and enforce legislation for safe listening and raise awareness of the risks of hearing loss.\n\nIt also urged the private sector to include WHO\u2019s recommendations for safe listening features in their products, venues, and events.\n\n\u201cGovernments, civil society and private sector entities such as manufacturers of personal audio devices, sound systems, and video gaming equipment as well as owners and managers of entertainment venues and events have an important role to play in advocating for the new global standard,\u201d said Dr Ren Minghui, WHO Assistant Director-General.\n\n\u201cWe must work together to promote safe listening practices, especially among young people,\u201d WHO said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Folashade Balogun: Showcasing African Fashion Globally",
          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nThe launch of her fashion brand House of SOTA, about six years ago, saw Folashade Balogun boldly stamp her arrival on the Nigerian and international fashion scene.\n\nDiscovering her creative flair earlier in life, Shade as she\u2019s simply called did not follow her gift, until, after a stint in the oil and gas sector. Launched with the aim to promote African clothing globally, House of SOTA designs depicts a rich African cultural heritage, influenced by African and western fashion. With stores in the US and different cities across Nigeria, she services a diverse range of clients addressing their needs both domestically and internationally, while feeding the diaspora market with the much sought-after African wears.\n\nShe shares with Allure her passion and love for the African brand, her very humble background, and breaking new grounds.\n\nYou recently celebrated; Black History Month with the launch of your spring collection. Does it have any correlation with Black History Month in the US and the UK? What does it mean to you?\n\nYes, it does. Actually, Black History Month is celebrated in America, Canada, and the UK in October. It is all about celebrating us, our historical background, and a more formal time, to remember and honour those who came before us. It is a very significant event for me because; I believe we should celebrate ourselves as Africans. If we don\u2019t celebrate ourselves nobody will.\n\nI have been in this business for the past six years. We have a store in America, and over the years, I found out that white Americans love our brands, what we do, and what we wear. As a matter of fact, the Kaftans that our men wear here are called African suits, and I have white clients who come to my shop to buy them.\n\nAs blacks, we do not appreciate what we have. I took it upon myself to always rock African attire whenever I am travelling, and whenever these people see me in my Ankara, they are like, \u201coh wow, this is so beautiful\u201d. Two years ago, I was wearing one of my designs made with adire and aso oke, I was on a flight from Orlando to Las Vegas when I stood up to use the toilet, the air hostess followed me to the toilet, just to appreciate what I was wearing. She asked where I got it from, I told her it was from me, she went on-site and bought it. If these people want to be us, and we are trying to be like them, then I think something is wrong somewhere. So Black History month for me is so significant. I love what we have and I have to celebrate Africa proudly. I do not believe that any other foreign brand is better.\n\nSo what is it like running a business in Nigeria and the US, how would you compare both, market-wise?\n\nLots of bills, believe me, we are really enjoying in Nigeria. In America, you have to pay your tax, you have to pay your rent, you have to pay lots of bills but, guess what; the market is there. That is what has kept us going. People love what they see, they love what we are selling. However, it has not been easy, especially with the exchange rate.\n\nSo how do you deal with the exchange rate issue?\n\nAs I said, it is not easy but we try to strike a balance.\n\nWhere do you get inspiration for your designs?\n\nSometimes, it could be around me, when I see someone, for instance, what you are wearing is a beautiful style, and it could be nice in Ankara or Aso-ebi, then I could twist it a bit. Sometimes I could be watching a movie and I get an idea. My inspiration comes from anywhere and everywhere. So it is just a gift from God.\n\nWhat do you love about being a designer?\n\nI love the fact that I make people happy, and comfortable with what they wear. Most of our designs are casuals, but even in our casuals, you look chic and trendy. Anywhere I walk into, even if it is a birthday, or a wedding, party there is always a wow factor. Again when people say they love what I am are wearing, that makes me happy. I love putting smiles on people\u2019s faces.\n\nWhat could be the most uncomfortable about the job?\n\nI don\u2019t like it when I am trying to make a client happy and the client would not have it or just refuses to be happy. You know that there are some clients that are like that. They complain about everything. That is why most of the time, we don\u2019t do bespoke. I only make bespoke for people very close to me, people who understand what we do. I prefer you to go to our store to pick what you want, with that; we don\u2019t get to have problems.\n\nBefore fashion you were into oil and gas, why did you leave oil and gas for fashion?\n\nI am still into oil and gas. I have a filling station. The oil and gas industry is not really as lucrative as when I started. When I started oil and gas, it was very profitable. But right now, a lot has changed. Again, it is about following my passion. I have a strong passion for fashion and decided to fulfill my dream.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you, especially coming from two different ethnic groups?\n\nI speak Yoruba and Igbo very well. My mother is from Ondo State, while my father was from Imo state. He died during the war. He was a naval officer. My mother single-handedly, trained all of us.\n\nAnd what in your upbringing informed the woman you are today?\n\nGrowing up was very tough, it wasn\u2019t easy because I lost my father early. And in those days, the Igbos were very strict with their widows. When a husband dies, they strip the woman naked, they take everything away from her and she is left alone. That was the same thing that happened to my mother. So my childhood wasn\u2019t really interesting, we were all living in a one-room apartment and she had to do so many things, just so she could take care of us. She used to sew. She has a chemist, she is still alive. My mom is very creative too, and she loves fashion too. I can say I got that from her, looking at her then as a teenager, inspired me a lot. I grew up in Mushin, and I must say that the Mushin in me is really helping me. It is good to be street-wise. When you are streetwise even when you are facing any challenge you look at it as one of those things. My upbringing has really impacted my life greatly.\n\nWhat is the most memorable thing that comes to mind anytime you remember growing up in Mushin?\n\nHmm\u2026 we lived in a one-room apartment where we didn\u2019t have access to a proper toilet, and those were very interesting times. I tell my children that when we send them abroad to school, it\u2019s a privilege, it\u2019s not as if they are entitled to it. So, I let my children know all these. I tell them, to go out there and work hard like their lives depend on it. And that has really paid off, because all my children made first class, and are doing well today, thanks to God. My upbringing really gave me a different view of life.\n\nHow do you cope with work and family?\n\nWhen I first started my business, it was a bit challenging because I had to do school runs, go to the depot, then; my filling station was in Seme, before I had one in GRA. Now my kids are all grown up. I am a grandmother of two. All my kids are graduates, my first son is happily married with two daughters, my second son is here with me, my third son is a pilot in the US, and he is flying already. My only daughter graduated in 2020, she is a psychologist working in the US. I have four children, three males, and a female.\n\nWhat is your perception of the fashion industry in Nigeria today?\n\nI must say we are doing very well.\n\nWhat, in your opinion, are some of the ways African fashion designers can be supported so that they can become global businesses?\n\nThe government needs to support us financially. African fashion is really out there, and globally people love what we are doing. We are very creative in Nigeria, but we need the government\u2019s support in every way. Apart from finance, they should put the right structures in place, so we can have ease of doing business like our counterparts in other countries, and be able to mass-produce. When this is done, a time will come when you can walk into a shop and buy a Nigerian-made dress off the rack like in western countries. It is achievable.\n\nWhat is your eventual dream for House of Sota?\n\nMy dream for House of Sota is for the brand to become like Zara. That is why we are opening outlets in different parts of the continent.\n\nI want the House of Sota to live after me. When I am gone, there will still be House of Sota, just like some of the popular international brands that we don\u2019t know who owns them.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you relax?\n\nWhen I am flying, I relax on the flight, I love travelling a lot. If I am not in Lagos, I am in Abuja, if I am not in Abuja, I am in Owerri, or in the US. I love travelling a lot.\n\nWhere in the world is your favourite holiday destination?\n\nI do not really go on holiday. I can\u2019t remember the last time I went on vacation, maybe on a business trip because even when I am in the US, it is not a vacation. Throughout the Christmas and New Year holidays, I was working, setting up the second store. On Christmas day, in the US, we went to the motherless babies home and gave out blankets and food. In Lagos, we normally do orphanages. So I can\u2019t remember the last time I went on vacation.\n\nSo what lessons have you learned about life?\n\nA lot; don\u2019t look down on people, be friendly, be nice. When my children were young, I trained them not to look down on people, but to be nice. Even if that person is a beggar, be nice, because that beggar might be a billionaire tomorrow. You never can tell.\n\nCREDITMakeup Artist: Kabire for @kamanismakeover\n\nHairstylist: Destiny for @pdhairconvenient\n\nFashion Stylist: Funmi Lefevre\n\nPhotographer: Bamiyo Iselema Emina\n\nClothes by House of Sota",

          "text": "Words By \u2013 Yemisi Suleiman\n\nThe launch of her fashion brand House of SOTA, about six years ago, saw Folashade Balogun boldly stamp her arrival on the Nigerian and international fashion scene.\n\nDiscovering her creative flair earlier in life, Shade as she\u2019s simply called did not follow her gift, until, after a stint in the oil and gas sector. Launched with the aim to promote African clothing globally, House of SOTA designs depicts a rich African cultural heritage, influenced by African and western fashion. With stores in the US and different cities across Nigeria, she services a diverse range of clients addressing their needs both domestically and internationally, while feeding the diaspora market with the much sought-after African wears.\n\nShe shares with Allure her passion and love for the African brand, her very humble background, and breaking new grounds.\n\nYou recently celebrated; Black History Month with the launch of your spring collection. Does it have any correlation with Black History Month in the US and the UK? What does it mean to you?\n\nYes, it does. Actually, Black History Month is celebrated in America, Canada, and the UK in October. It is all about celebrating us, our historical background, and a more formal time, to remember and honour those who came before us. It is a very significant event for me because; I believe we should celebrate ourselves as Africans. If we don\u2019t celebrate ourselves nobody will.\n\nI have been in this business for the past six years. We have a store in America, and over the years, I found out that white Americans love our brands, what we do, and what we wear. As a matter of fact, the Kaftans that our men wear here are called African suits, and I have white clients who come to my shop to buy them.\n\nAs blacks, we do not appreciate what we have. I took it upon myself to always rock African attire whenever I am travelling, and whenever these people see me in my Ankara, they are like, \u201coh wow, this is so beautiful\u201d. Two years ago, I was wearing one of my designs made with adire and aso oke, I was on a flight from Orlando to Las Vegas when I stood up to use the toilet, the air hostess followed me to the toilet, just to appreciate what I was wearing. She asked where I got it from, I told her it was from me, she went on-site and bought it. If these people want to be us, and we are trying to be like them, then I think something is wrong somewhere. So Black History month for me is so significant. I love what we have and I have to celebrate Africa proudly. I do not believe that any other foreign brand is better.\n\nSo what is it like running a business in Nigeria and the US, how would you compare both, market-wise?\n\nLots of bills, believe me, we are really enjoying in Nigeria. In America, you have to pay your tax, you have to pay your rent, you have to pay lots of bills but, guess what; the market is there. That is what has kept us going. People love what they see, they love what we are selling. However, it has not been easy, especially with the exchange rate.\n\nSo how do you deal with the exchange rate issue?\n\nAs I said, it is not easy but we try to strike a balance.\n\nWhere do you get inspiration for your designs?\n\nSometimes, it could be around me, when I see someone, for instance, what you are wearing is a beautiful style, and it could be nice in Ankara or Aso-ebi, then I could twist it a bit. Sometimes I could be watching a movie and I get an idea. My inspiration comes from anywhere and everywhere. So it is just a gift from God.\n\nWhat do you love about being a designer?\n\nI love the fact that I make people happy, and comfortable with what they wear. Most of our designs are casuals, but even in our casuals, you look chic and trendy. Anywhere I walk into, even if it is a birthday, or a wedding, party there is always a wow factor. Again when people say they love what I am are wearing, that makes me happy. I love putting smiles on people\u2019s faces.\n\nWhat could be the most uncomfortable about the job?\n\nI don\u2019t like it when I am trying to make a client happy and the client would not have it or just refuses to be happy. You know that there are some clients that are like that. They complain about everything. That is why most of the time, we don\u2019t do bespoke. I only make bespoke for people very close to me, people who understand what we do. I prefer you to go to our store to pick what you want, with that; we don\u2019t get to have problems.\n\nBefore fashion you were into oil and gas, why did you leave oil and gas for fashion?\n\nI am still into oil and gas. I have a filling station. The oil and gas industry is not really as lucrative as when I started. When I started oil and gas, it was very profitable. But right now, a lot has changed. Again, it is about following my passion. I have a strong passion for fashion and decided to fulfill my dream.\n\nWhat was growing up like for you, especially coming from two different ethnic groups?\n\nI speak Yoruba and Igbo very well. My mother is from Ondo State, while my father was from Imo state. He died during the war. He was a naval officer. My mother single-handedly, trained all of us.\n\nAnd what in your upbringing informed the woman you are today?\n\nGrowing up was very tough, it wasn\u2019t easy because I lost my father early. And in those days, the Igbos were very strict with their widows. When a husband dies, they strip the woman naked, they take everything away from her and she is left alone. That was the same thing that happened to my mother. So my childhood wasn\u2019t really interesting, we were all living in a one-room apartment and she had to do so many things, just so she could take care of us. She used to sew. She has a chemist, she is still alive. My mom is very creative too, and she loves fashion too. I can say I got that from her, looking at her then as a teenager, inspired me a lot. I grew up in Mushin, and I must say that the Mushin in me is really helping me. It is good to be street-wise. When you are streetwise even when you are facing any challenge you look at it as one of those things. My upbringing has really impacted my life greatly.\n\nWhat is the most memorable thing that comes to mind anytime you remember growing up in Mushin?\n\nHmm\u2026 we lived in a one-room apartment where we didn\u2019t have access to a proper toilet, and those were very interesting times. I tell my children that when we send them abroad to school, it\u2019s a privilege, it\u2019s not as if they are entitled to it. So, I let my children know all these. I tell them, to go out there and work hard like their lives depend on it. And that has really paid off, because all my children made first class, and are doing well today, thanks to God. My upbringing really gave me a different view of life.\n\nHow do you cope with work and family?\n\nWhen I first started my business, it was a bit challenging because I had to do school runs, go to the depot, then; my filling station was in Seme, before I had one in GRA. Now my kids are all grown up. I am a grandmother of two. All my kids are graduates, my first son is happily married with two daughters, my second son is here with me, my third son is a pilot in the US, and he is flying already. My only daughter graduated in 2020, she is a psychologist working in the US. I have four children, three males, and a female.\n\nWhat is your perception of the fashion industry in Nigeria today?\n\nI must say we are doing very well.\n\nWhat, in your opinion, are some of the ways African fashion designers can be supported so that they can become global businesses?\n\nThe government needs to support us financially.

When I am gone, there will still be House of Sota, just like some of the popular international brands that we don\u2019t know who owns them.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you relax?\n\nWhen I am flying, I relax on the flight, I love travelling a lot. If I am not in Lagos, I am in Abuja, if I am not in Abuja, I am in Owerri, or in the US. I love travelling a lot.\n\nWhere in the world is your favourite holiday destination?\n\nI do not really go on holiday. I can\u2019t remember the last time I went on vacation, maybe on a business trip because even when I am in the US, it is not a vacation. Throughout the Christmas and New Year holidays, I was working, setting up the second store. On Christmas day, in the US, we went to the motherless babies home and gave out blankets and food. In Lagos, we normally do orphanages. So I can\u2019t remember the last time I went on vacation.\n\nSo what lessons have you learned about life?\n\nA lot; don\u2019t look down on people, be friendly, be nice. When my children were young, I trained them not to look down on people, but to be nice. Even if that person is a beggar, be nice, because that beggar might be a billionaire tomorrow.

          "text": "For every marriage that burns and fizzles out quickly, there is a famous celebrity couple that seems to be in it for the long haul. Despite all the menaces associated with celebrity unions, there are still a couple of them especially in the movie industry, who, have gotten a hang of their relationship, are enjoying blissful marriages.\n\nStill, in the spirit of Valentine, we celebrate some of Nollywood celebrity couples, whose marriages have endured and who, remain an inspiration to the rest of us.\n\n\n\nMercy and Odi Okojie\n\n\n\nNot many gave Nollywood star actress, Mercy Johnson\u2019s marriage to Prince Odi Okojie a chance, back in 2011. Her marriage to her heartthrob then was immersed in so much controversy that almost ruined the actress\u2019s thriving career.\n\nTen years on, however, the Nollywood superstar and her husband remain devoted to each other and have become the envy of many. The flame is still going strong, as recent photos of their 10 years anniversary prove.\n\nWhile celebrating their 10th year anniversary in 2021, the actress took to her social media handle to reaffirm her love for her husband, saying she would walk the path with him over and over again.\n\nIf you are wondering why their love is growing stronger as they get older, Mrs. Okojie stated that their marriage has been 10 years of grace, love, forgiveness, understanding, sacrifice, tolerance, patience, respect, and friendship.\n\nThe marriage is blessed with four children.\n\nOlu and Joke Jacobs\n\nThis Nollywood power couple has been married for over 30 years, and still going strong. They met in the 80s on Olu Jacobs\u2019s return to the country from England. In an interview with a major newspaper, Olu Jacobs had said that the moment he set his eyes on Joke Silva, he knew she was his wife.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe were having a management meeting for a play, Wole Soyinka\u2019s Jero Metamorphosis when a young lady walked in. Immediately she walked in, something inside me told me that she was going to be my wife and I told the people around me that I was going to marry her. That was in 1981. In 1986, we got married.\n\nSince then, the couple has been inseparable. They have blessed our screens with their talent, starring either as a couple or antagonists, in a variety of notable films over their impressive career. They are the oldest couple in Nollywood and have successfully debunked the myth that celebrity marriages never last.\n\nGloria and Norbert Young\n\n\n\nThe love bug bit these two at the audition of Gloria\u2019s first movie, Glamour Girls, where Norbert was also a member of the movie cast. The Veterans, Gloria and Norbert Young who got married in 2002 and celebrated their 18th marriage anniversary last year, are one of the oldest celebrity couples in the Nigerian film industry. While they live a drama-free and rather private life, their love for each other is pretty obvious. Gloria, who shot into limelight by playing Doris in the movie Glamour Girls, has hinged her stable marriage on friendship, her husband\u2019s sense of humour, maturity, as well as understanding and her playfulness. According to her, though their marriage had its ups and downs, they always found a way around resolving their differences. On his part, the actor, famous for his diverse roles in TV sitcoms says his wife is a quality human being and is very resourceful. \u201cShe is beautiful and very helpful. She is my friend.\u201d These two accomplished actors have continued to remain relevant in the industry while demystifying loveless celebrity marriages and breakups in Nollywood.\n\nOmotola and Mathew Ekeinde\n\nOmotola Jalade met her husband, Captain Matthew Ekeinde, in 1994 at the Solid Rock Church, Iyana Ipaja, while she was just 16 years old. They got married two years later in a court ceremony in 1996. They later had the most talked-about white wedding ceremony, conducted on board while flying from Lagos to Benin in 2001. Years in the spotlight haven\u2019t come between the Nollywood A-list actress and her pilot husband, with whom she has four children. For 25 years now, Omosexy as she is fondly called has been able to hold her family together without many scandals. In recent years, the talented actress has been showing off her husband and children on social media to the admiration of her fans and followers.\n\nLast year on March 25th, the couple celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary. The mother of four posted some lovely photos and penned these words to her husband.\n\n\u201c25 Years Strong! Happy Marriage Anniversary to us.\u201d\n\nThe couple is no doubt a strong support system for each other and has given us reasons to believe in love.\n\nRichard and Jumoke Mofe-Damijo\n\nWhen TV star girl, Jumobi Adegbesan hooked up with the hottest bachelor in Nollywood, Richard Mofe-Damijo, not a few thought the relationship would see the light of day. Twenty years down the line, the lovebirds who got married in the year 2000, and are blessed with four children, are not only together, but waxing stronger in their love.\n\nThe Veteran actor who has starred in a variety of notable films over his impressive career, has in recent times, flaunted his love for his wife on his social media handle. The legendary actor has reiterated often that he owes his wife a debt of gratitude because she took a setback for him when they got married. \u201cShe was already a television personality people love and she could have been anything she desired to be, but she said to me, I am going to stop, get met a regular job, I don\u2019t want to be a celebrity and I said why, she said one person in the family is enough, you stay there and do your thing, and let me take care of the home front.\u201d He wrote on his Instagram handle.\n\n\u201cIf that is not love, at the highest level of personal sacrifice then, I don\u2019t know what it is, and so you can\u2019t have a partner like that and you won\u2019t step up in things you do. And, I am far, far, far from being perfect, but blessed with an almost perfect wife that would do anything for me.\u201d\n\nHis success as a father and career-wise he says, is just because he\u2019s blessed with an amazing wife.\n\nOmoni and Nnamdi Oboli\n\nWe have always admired star actress and producer, Omoni Oboli and her husband Nnamdi. They share some kind of facial resemblance and come across as siblings rather than husband and wife. While she may be successful in her career, she has equally drawn attention for being one of the celebrities who have proven that a celebrity marriage can last long. Omoni met her husband, Nnamdi Oboli, at a movie location in 1996. The pair got married in 2000, four years after they met: she was only 21 years old while her husband was 29. The rest, like they say, is history.\n\nTwenty one years on, blessed with three sons, Gozi, Chizi, and Tobe Oboli, the couple has continued to grow stronger in their marriage and love for each other.\n\nSo what is the secret of this lasting love? While chatting with an online platform, Omoni revealed that from the onset, she and her husband decided that divorce was not in the cards. She noted that their resolution was borne out of the fact that no sin is unforgivable. It\u2019s a person who decides whether or not to forgive an erring offender. Nnamdi has been supportive of his wife\u2019s career and also doubles as her manager. He is also a producer and has co-produced with his wife, blockbusters such as; Being Mrs. Elliott and Render to Caesar. While celebrating their 21st-anniversary last year, the actress took to her social media handle to reaffirm her love for her husband and commitment to their marriage. The union has continued to be a source of inspiration to young and aspiring couples.",

          "text": "Market women, business operators as well as transporters in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, have raised the alarm over what they called \u2018persistent and mindless\u2019 taxation by the state government.\n\nThe multiple levies, according to the traders, have had a negative impact on their businesses, noting that some have shut down especially petty trading.\n\nSome of them who spoke to DAILY POST revealed that different revenue collectors such as officials of the state revenue service, Akwa Ibom State Environmental Protection and Waste Management Agency (AKSEPWMA), Ministry of Environment and Mineral Resources, local government council etc, go about collecting money ranging from sanitation, signpost, development rate, shop rate to public health which is nothing less than N5,000 each.\n\nThis was after payment of a certain sum to the Inland Revenue Service for registration of business premises.\n\nOne Mfon Ebreso, who sells waterleaf at the popular Akpanadem market, Uyo, told our correspondent that they pay levies three times every day to those officials who are always hostile to the poor market women explaining that they pay N1500 in the morning as soon as they open their wares; N100 in the afternoon and N150 in the evening.\n\nShe lamented the hostile attitude of the collectors saying that anybody who was reluctant or refuses to pay would have her goods seized or destroyed as the case may be.\n\nAccording to her, \u201dWhat we suffer in this market is a constant levy. Those village people who bring waterleaf to sell in the morning market must pay N1500, those selling Mfi(periwinkle) pay N1000, if you don\u2019t pay, those boys will not allow you to open your market (wares).\n\n\u201cIn the afternoon, they will collect N100 while in the evening it is N150. All tickets in the market are N250 every day apart from the N1500 those people who come for bush market pay. Sometimes those boys, who call themselves Udom boys, will come and say, give me N3000, if you don\u2019t, they will put your wares in the gutter, you will not see them again.\u201d\n\nAlso, those selling at the plaza, the hub of activities in Uyo metropolis, have their fair share of over taxation, as a trader, Ugonna Maxwell told our correspondent that most of the officials compel them to pay some levies at a smaller amount without issuing any official receipt to them.\n\nWhen an entrepreneur in the state, Jeremiah Ukpe was contacted, he described continuous multiple taxations as a bane to business growth in the state, especially the upcoming businesses.\n\nHe noted that some of them would demand negotiations or payment of items, not within their jurisdiction such as signage pasted on a building even as he called for training and retraining of the genuine officials\n\nAccording to him, \u201cTaxation now in Akwa Ibom is back to back, FIRS will come, Environment will come, PHEDC will come, AKSEPWMA will come, local government officials will come.\n\n\u201cThe stress of paying for everything is just too much. Even signage on the building, they will ask you to pay taxation, in my case I said no, you pay when it\u2019s on government open land. Sometimes if you argue with those officials they will know that you know their tricks, the next thing they will say is, bros, let\u2019s negotiate.\n\n\u201cThey will come to my space and said pay for cleaning, sanitation, without giving me a refuse bin, from different Ministries, and when you check in the receipt you find out it is different companies, sometimes I asked if it is Ministry of Environment, why this company\u2019s name written on the receipt, they always insist that they are from the government. They are extorting people and still call themselves government.\n\n\u201cEven those from the PHEDC are not left out, the estimated bill is quite outrageous. I\u2019m not afraid of taxation, but let me pay to the right people and to the right source. Payment should be documented in the system and notification of payment sent to the client either through email or SMS.\n\n\u201cGovt should do something about people who move into peoples business premises to extort them, if you are a real agent please be very legal and civil.\u201d\n\nAlso, the president of Keke Owners/Riders Association (KORA) in Akwa Ibom, Comrade Jeremiah Jackson, during the recent empowerment of members decried the level of multiple taxations on members against the state government prescribed unified tax payment system.\n\nJackson said, \u201cNURTW impounds our members\u2019 tricycles, particularly those who come from Ikot Ekpene, asking them to buy emblem and tickets against the state-approved unified ticket. The operation of an unknown task force impounding our members\u2019 tricycles at Ikot Ekpene motor park is illegal and not known to the state government.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, minibus drivers also pay heavily to different unions and to the state government.\n\nInvestigation revealed that minibus operators pay as much as N500 per day against the usual N200 approved by the Ministry of Transport in Akwa Ibom on all routes.\n\nA minibus operator, who spoke under anonymity, said, \u201dInitially, we used to pay N100 before it was moved to N200 by the MOT. But we are paying N500 and most of us are driving these buses under \u2018hire purchase\u2019 we want the State government to intervene. The suffering is too much.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman, AKSEPWMA, Hon. Prince Ikim has said most persons collecting the levies are not government officials, adding that the agency has started clamping down on them.\n\nHowever, the Chairman of the State Revenue Service, Mr Okon Okon, who was accused of being behind the act, has refused to react to a letter sent by journalists to seek his comment for over three weeks.",

          "title": "Three lessons for Africa from the Ukraine-Russia crisis",
          "text": "As the bombs of Russian SU-57 fighter jets are challenged by the screeching of Ukrainian Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, Africa can gain significant insight into major power competition. The three lessons for Africa from the Ukraine-Russia crisis are domiciled in the diplomatic, security and strategic competition of the United States and Russia in Ukraine.\n\nFirst, Africa realises that diplomacy is an inconvenient barrier to the unilateralism of major powers. Russia portrays itself as the anti-colonial middleman on the African continent keen to support African nations through alternate multilateral frameworks like Brics. Brics is the international body bringing together the emerging powers of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.\n\nWhat the Ukrainian crisis has shown Africa is that Russia still has designs of re-establishing its colonial-style domination of its former republics like Ukraine. Russia is not the benign middleman pursuing altruistic goals on the continent. It will put its national interests at the centre of its foreign policy in Ukraine and on the African continent.\n\nThis includes aggressively pursuing unilateralism in invading a sovereign country such as Ukraine while ignoring alternate multilateral frameworks like Brics in engaging with diplomatic challenges. The protests to Russia\u2019s actions from Brazil, South Africa, India, and China did nothing to dissuade it from invading Ukraine.\n\nNeither did the condemnation from African non-permanent members of the Security Council such as Kenya, Ghana, or Mali. Protests from the chair of the African Union Macky Sall and the chair of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Malamat were also ignored. When push comes to shove, major powers like Russia will unapologetically pursue their national interests unilaterally with no regard for multilateral diplomacy. Might trumps right.\n\nIn the security space, the war in Ukraine has shown Africa that the post 9/11 international world order is a loose and tenuous multi-polarity. The triumphalist hubris of George Bush\u2019s New World Order in the early 1990\u2019s has been replaced by regional players that bandwagon with the US, hedge against the US or are co-opted by American power.\n\nIn Ukraine, Africa also sees there is a limit to the expansion of American power. \u201cNew Wars\u201d fought in failing states such as Somalia, Afghanistan, Yemen, or Syria have dampened the appetite in Washington to participate in military intervention and nation building. This has resulted in emboldening emerging powers such as Russia to re-establish their power in their neighbourhoods like Ukraine, but also to expand their influence in new theatres around the world.\n\nThese include Sudan, Madagascar and Libya. Russia on its part has not only been aggressive in its own back yard in Ukraine but has also extended its strategic influence in Africa. Exchanging the provision of public goods such as security for lucrative mineral rights. Diamonds and gold mining in the Central African Republic and bauxite, a critical ore in the manufacture of aluminium, in Guinea.\n\nRussia\u2019s aggressive expansion includes the use of mercenaries such as the Wagner Group in Ukraine, Chad, Mali and the Central African Republic. Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin leads the Wagner group. Ukraine illustrates that mercenaries provide plausible deniability in the Donbas region much like their roles in Sub Saharan Africa.\n\nLast, in the strategic realm, Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine illustrate to Africa that major power competition results in weak nations suffering. Weak states suffer the brunt of the destruction when major powers play dangerous strategic games.\n\nUkraine is unfortunate to find itself as the playfield for great power rivalry of the US and its allies on one hand, and the Russians on the other. The fact that Ukraine is not considered a core strategic interest that the US is ready to fight for in confronting Russia militarily, is an ominous sign for African nations. Many African nations have even weaker national institutions, militaries, and border controls than Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to this, Ukraine shows that major powers will take unilateral action in protecting their national interests irrespective of geographic location. In Eastern Europe today, it is the Russians, in Libya it was the Americans, in Syria, it is a contest between the US and Russia.\n\nThese three lessons learned in Ukraine should advance the cause for Africa to advocate multilateral frameworks centred on consensus, cooperation and compromise in creating a rules based international order where might is not always right.",

So, it is important they do the right thing from the beginning so that whatever the committee presents can be approved by the Federal Executive Council.\u2019\u2019\n\nNgige also said the meeting fixed a timeline of six weeks for the new committee set up by the education ministry to round up everything on the conditions of service.\n\nHe noted that on the issue of University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) for the payment of salaries, the meeting mandated a joint committee to conduct an integrity test on the platform in conjunction with neutral experts.\n\nThe joint committee has ASUU, the National Universities Commission, and the National Information Technology Development Agency as members.\n\n\u201cWe told them to conclude the test by March 8. If they conclude, we are expected to work on it within six weeks,\u2019\u2019 Ngige said.\n\nASUU had agitated the adoption of UTAS to pay varsity lecturers\u2019 salaries in preference to the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System insisted upon by the Federal Government.\n\nNgige said there was no problem with the issue of Earned Academic Allowances, apart from the reconciliation of payments made in tranches to the university system.\n\n\u201cOnce we conclude the reconciliation, if the Federal Government is in arrears on any tranche, the finance minister will look for money to pay; even though the Federal Government does not have money.\n\n\u201cEarned allowance is an allowance for excessive workload. Last year, it was paid based on the rule of the thumb theory of 10 per cent of total personnel cost.\n\n\u201cThis year, we have told the National Universities Commission to put up a committee and within the next three weeks, come up with a figure that will be sent to the finance minister.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think, we are on course, ASUU should go to their members, show them offers made to them by government so that they can call off the strike,\u2019\u2019 Ngige said.\n\nEarlier, the President of ASUU, Emmanuel Osodeke, said members, students and Nigerian people want to see an action from the government.\n\n\u201cThe education sector in Nigeria is in crisis and money is being lost at the primary, secondary and tertiary education levels,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe noted the quantum of money that ought to have been used to fund education in Nigeria was being lost to other countries.\n\nOsodeke, therefore, called for a declaration of emergency in the sector to solve the problem.",
          "summary": "Former student union president of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Esedere Abraham, said the protest would continue until ASUU calls off the strike.\nHe said students should not be made to suffer for any problem between ASUU and the Federal Government.\nNANS Vice Chairman, Ondo State chapter, Shittu Folarin, said the students wanted to ensure this would be the last action by ASUU.\nThe joint committee has ASUU, the National Universities Commission, and the National Information Technology Development Agency as members.\nEarlier, the President of ASUU, Emmanuel Osodeke, said members, students and Nigerian people want to see an action from the government.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nNigerian women have threatened to occupy the National Assembly until all gender bills in the constitution amendment exercise are reconsidered.\n\nIn a virtual press conference on Tuesday night attended by over 200 civil society organisations and the media, Dr. Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, lawyer and rights activist, demanded an urgent meeting with the leadership of the National Assembly to reconsider the gender bills.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nShe said Nigerian women would also use the #NigerianWomenOccupyNASS; #BreakPoliticalBias and #BreakConstitutionBias to push the demands on social media.\n\nAkiyode-Afolabi, who described what happened at the National Assembly on Tuesday as sad, said women would no longer take the discrimination against them lying low.\n\nShe said the protest would also take place across the various states of the federation, but the outcome of meeting with the leadership of the National Assembly would determine the shape of what would happen at the state levels.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nShe urged the media to support the women, saying the mobilisation had started with several women and organisations within and outside Abuja overwhelmingly backing the protest.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cNigeria women are disappointed and aggrieved at the actions of the 9th National Assembly (NASS) today Tuesday March 1, 2022 when they denied women the opportunity of inclusion and representation in governance by voting against the gender bills.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cNASS has spoken loud and clear that they do not want progress for society, for mothers, aunties, sisters, wives, and for daughters. It is particularly sad that in a month globally dedicated to celebrating women worldwide, our NASS has chosen to deny women basic human rights. These are rights enjoyed by every Nigerian except women. The proposed gender bills in the 5th Constitution Alteration Bills that were all rejected are Bills targeted at addressing the current gender imbalance across the legislative arm of governments across the country whilst reducing the under-representation of women in political office. The men of the 9th NASS have reinforced the discrimination and political bias against women as enshrined in the 1999 constitution by denying citizenship to a foreign-born husband of a Nigerian woman. (While it allows Nigerian men\u2019s foreign-born wives to be awarded automatic citizenship), denying Nigerian women indigeneity through marriage, denying 35 per cent appointed positions for women and settling for 20 per cent, denying women affirmative action in party administration and leadership, denying specific seats for women in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe men of the 9th NASS by their actions have taken us backwards. Their actions undermine the importance and relevance of women\u2019s contribution to the governance of Nigeria including the key role women play to bring victory to political parties in elections at all levels across the country. They also voted against diaspora voting!\n\n\u201cNigerian women therefore demand that all gender bills be reconsidered. Ultimately, our demands will benefit not just women but Nigeria as a whole. \u201cMore women in governance will only bring progress, and respect for Nigeria in the committee of nations. We cannot, in 2022, be negotiating the rights of women and the sanctity of the dignity of girls. We call on the National Assembly to re-present these Bills as a matter of urgency and ensure that they are passed.\u201d",

          "text": "Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has commenced move that would pave the way for the extradition of the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, to answer to fraud allegations in the United States of America.\n\nKyari, a once celebrated officer of the Nigerian Police, is currently enmeshed in various criminal allegations for which he has previously won many accolades for fighting.\n\nFollowing the arrest and imprisonment of Abass Ramon aka hushpuppi over a $1.1milion wire fraud and Ramon\u2019s alleged implication of Kyari, who was then Commander of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), the United States had requested for the extradition of Kyari to tell his alleged level of involvement in the crime.\n\nHowever, months after the extradition request, Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr Abubakar Malami (SAN) has now disclosed that the federal government has filed an application for the extradition of Kyari before the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nMalami stated that the application which followed a request by the diplomatic representative of the American embassy in Abuja, was filed under the Extradition Act and it is marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022.\n\nOnly recently the AGF while speaking on a television programme, assured that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration would extradite the once \u2018supercop\u2019to the United States to answer to the fraud charge filed against him, hushpuppi and four others of if the government was convinced to do so.\n\nSpeaking on the extradition application, the Minister said it was \u201cfor the surrender of Abba Kyari, who is a subject in a superceding three counts indictment\u201d.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction that the offence in respect of which Kyari\u2019s surrender was being made was not political nor was it trivial.\n\nMalami added that the request for the surrender of Kyari was not made to persecute or punish him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions but in good faith and the interest of justice.\n\nHe said Kyari, \u201cif surrendered, will not be prejudiced at his trial and will not be punished, detained or restricted in his personal liberty, by reason of his race, nationality or political opinions\u201d.\n\nMalami explained that having regard to all the circumstances in which the offence was committed, it will not be unjust or oppressive, or be too severe a punishment, to surrender him.\n\nMalami said he was also satisfied that Kyari had been accused of the offence for which his surrender was sought.\n\nHe noted that there was no criminal proceeding pending against Kyari in Nigeria for the same offence.\n\nAlthough the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) had last week obtained a court order to detain Kyari for two weeks, they are yet to file charges against him.\n\nKyari was arrested by the Police on February 12 and handed over to the agency for investigation over allegations bordering on hard drug syndication.\n\nIn April 2021, a jury filed an indictment against Kyari with the approval of the US District Court and demanded Kyari stand trial for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering and identity theft.\n\nConsequently, the American embassy requested for Kyari \u2019s extradition saying, \u201con April 29, 2021, based on the indictment filed by the Grand Jury and with the approval of the United States District Court for the Central District of California, a Deputy Clerk of the court issued a warrant of arrest for Kyari.\n\n\u201cThe arrest warrant remains valid and executable to apprehend Kyari for the crimes with which he is charged in the indictment.\n\n\u201cKyari is wanted to stand trial in the United States for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, and identity theft.\n\n\u201cKyari is the subject of an indictment in case number 2:21-cr-00203 (also referred to as 2:21-mj-00760 and 2:21-cr-00203-rgk), filed April 29, 2021, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Oil Price Surges Above $113 as OPEC Keeps Supply Unchanged",
          "text": "\u2022Nigeria gets 1.735m bpd allocation for April, petrol scarcity persists\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\nCrude oil price yesterday continued its upswing as Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark crude, rose above $113 per barrel for the first time in close to eight years. This was as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) resolved to continue the addition of a measured volume of 400,000 barrels per day, agreed with its allies, OPEC+, in August last year.\n\nThe producers\u2019 group, which decided on the quota for member countries for April, allocated Nigeria 1.735 million barrels per day as its production for next month. But it remains doubtful whether Nigeria would be able to meet its allocation for the month, having consistently, for close to a year, been unable to supply the global market with its required volume.\n\nLast month alone, the country recorded a deficit of over 300,000 barrels per day, even though the total quantity of oil it drilled for that month, roughly 1.4 million bpd, was its best in several months.\n\nThe increasing crude oil price also implies that the controversial subsidy payments in the country would rise when the computation for this month is done, since the pump price of petrol in Nigeria, which does not refine a drop of the product, has a positive relationship with the international crude oil prices.\n\nAlthough by now, Nigeria should be saving as much as $50 per barrel that it sells, the reverse appears to be the case, as the cost of under-recovery continues to soar.\n\nIn January 2022 alone, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited claimed that it expended N210.38 billion on petrol subsidy.\n\nFurthermore, due to the challenge, last month, the oil company failed to remit any money to the federation account, a development that would definitely hamper the ability of sub-nationals to meet their financial obligations.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari recently asked the National Assembly to approve the N2.557 trillion budget for petrol subsidy in 2022.\n\nHowever, aside Brent, which exceeded $113 per barrel, recording over 7.69 per cent hike at the time of writing this report, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the United States benchmark, also surged to $111.24 per barrel, with about 7.57 per cent increase.\n\nIt came as Russia\u2019s flagship crude oil, which was offered for sale at a record discount, got no bidders, the latest indication that trading of oil from the country\u2019s western ports is grinding to a halt.\n\nBut despite the tightening global oil market, OPEC yesterday resisted pressure from the United States and some of its allies to increase supply, although prices were already under pressure before the Russia invasion of Ukraine last week.\n\nThough the United States and other member states of the International Energy Agency (IEA), in a bid to cool prices, announced a strategic oil reserve release, so far it has done little to tame rampaging oil market prices.\n\nDespite calls to ramp up production, OPEC alliance kept additional output at 400,000 barrels per day.\n\nHowever, it did not come as a surprise to those who followed activities of the oil cartel closely, since the producer group had insisted that supply was not the problem. OPEC alone accounts for around 40 per cent of the world\u2019s oil supply.\n\nA release after the 26th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting, concluded yesterday, explained that the market remained balanced and did not need further distortions. It noted that following the conclusion of the 26th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting, the current oil market fundamentals and the consensus on its outlook \u201cpointed to a well-balanced market\u201d.\n\nOPEC stressed, \u201cThe current volatility is not caused by changes in market fundamentals, but by current geopolitical developments.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cThe OPEC and participating non-OPEC oil-producing countries decided to: reaffirm the decision of the 10th ministerial meeting on 12 April 2020 and further endorsed in subsequent meetings, including the 19th ministerial meeting on 18 July 2021.\n\n\u201cIt reconfirms the production adjustment plan and the monthly production adjustment mechanism approved at the 19th ministerial meeting and the decision to adjust upward the monthly overall production by 0.4 mb/d for the month of April 2022.\n\n\u201cOPEC reiterates the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and to the compensation mechanism taking advantage of the extension of the compensation period until the end of June 2022.\u201d\n\nThe Sanusi Barkindo-led organisation stated that compensation plans should be submitted in accordance with the earlier agreed procedure, and it scheduled its next meeting for March 31.\n\nPetrol Scarcity Persists\n\nHowever, in spite of the deteriorating fuel supply situation across the country, the NNPC yesterday said it currently has over 1.7 billion litres of the product in stock.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES), which entered its fourth day yesterday, Group Managing Director, NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, told journalists that the situation was being worsen by motorists who are buying more than they require.\n\nThe NNPC boss noted that loading across the nation was now taking place 24 hours a day, explaining that the company has enough volume to meet the country\u2019s current demand.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure Nigerians that we have adequate supply of petroleum products. Currently, we have over 1.7 billion litres of petrol, both marine and land, and that also means that we have capacity to load from all depots.\n\n\u201cWe have several loading points in all depots. This will ensure that spaces (gap) created by panic buying, which is what you are seeing in the fuel stations, today will be filled,\u201d he stated.\n\nKyari argued that typically, people in the kind of situation Nigeria had been confronted with, would ordinarily buy in excess of what they need, opining that additional supply would resolve address the situation. \u201cI am very sure very soon, you will see relief on this,\u201d he assured.\n\nHe emphasised that neither the government nor the NNPC had any plan to adjust the pump price or ex depot prices of petrol, and therefore called on marketers to sell at the prices approved by government.\n\nHe stated that the NNPC was engaging the unions in the industry and have agreed that NNPC and the midstream/downstream authority will carry out necessary sanctions on anyone found doing underhand business.\n\n\u201cWe have no shortage in the country, cars are taking longer to buy. We sincerely apologise for the pain but we will get out of this soon,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged motorists to trust the NNPC that it has adequate supply in-country, stating that the panic buying remains the problem. \u201cLet them make sure they don\u2019t buy what they don\u2019t need because when they come back, they will still find petroleum products,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GMD said soon the directive not to sell petrol in jerry cans would be relaxed, noting that the decision was taken to ensure safety in the filling stations and to avoid overcrowding.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that those who will ordinarily buy N3,000 are buying N13,000\u201d, he said, adding that it was slowing down the system.\n\nKyari noted that although supply disruptions cannot be stopped totally, recovery time remains very critical. According to him, the NNPC was working with the security agencies to ensure that black marketers stop inflicting hardship on Nigerians.\n\nEarlier, while speaking during the main programme, the NNPC GMD noted that for over 50 years, investment in the oil and gas industry had been stifled because the right framework was absent.\n\n\u201cThis is an energy company and enabler, a company for all of us. But more importantly, the company that is expected to support energy security.\n\n\u201cAnd that can\u2019t work except we collaborate and have the right climate. I\u2019m sure all of us are aware of the struggles that we\u2019ve had, getting the right kind of fiscal and regulatory framework in place to make sure that companies perform in the best manner possible and in the best business environment that is possible.\n\n\u201cIn reality, we have struggled with fiscal change, getting the right environment for business since 1967. That means that we have frozen our environment for close to 50 years, that we haven\u2019t changed essentially for close to 50 years.\n\n\u201cAnd whether intended or not, that took its impact and took its toll. And it\u2019s very visible in our recent history, in the sense that in the last 10 years, investment inflows into Sub Saharan Africa and our country was probably about $3 billion to $5 billion.\n\n\u201cIn reality, we have done nothing. And the reason is very simple: You don\u2019t have the right fiscal structure, you don\u2019t have the right climate, regulatory stability, and the right framework where people can predict what will happen next.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why the cumulative effect is that that\u2019s under-investment, there\u2019s lack of growth. And of course, it produced some other results. Part of it is that many of our partners now in all their ramifications, nobody invested substantially, even for new projects.\n\n\u201cMany of these structures now, when you look at them, you think you are in the war front, and also many of them look like museums. And I think they\u2019re not designed to function, even in the best of companies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that with the passage of the new legislation, which he said was resisted in the past because people did not want to lose influence and control, there is now an opportune moment to turn things around.\n\nWith the new law , which has made the NNPC a commercial company that will deliver dividend to its shareholders, Kyari assured that the company would take off fully in July of this year.\n\n\u201cThe combination of this means that this company must operate in the world class standards, must be fully automated, must imbibe transition and must recognise the necessity for energy transition,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe stated that the company was shopping for the right partners, noting specifically that Nigeria\u2019s gas resources must be developed as a transition fuel.\n\nSpeaking on the topic: \u201cData to Barrel\u201d Chief Executive, Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Agency (NURPC), Gbenga Komolafe, said the industry must acquire big data, to explore, capture, develop, produce hydrocarbon, and monitor reservoir performance and surveillance in real time.\n\nHe explained that the upstream industry was facing challenges that require the need for mass data in high-precision reservoir modelling and surveillance.\n\n\u201cConsequently, superb computing power, high-performance storage capacity, powerful and integrated mapping applications are required to be able to turn big data into barrels and value for money.\n\n\u201c Hence, the key challenge for service providers in producing oil companies is to demonstrate the value that gathering additional data will bring to the asset. So, it is not just about gathering more data, but equally about the Value of the Information (VOI) from the data gathered,\u201d he argued.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Lawan, Omo-Agege, some APC senators endorse Adamu for national chairman\n\n\u2022Party leadership yet to meet on Electoral Act, says Akpanudoedehe\n\n\u2022Sheriff: I\u2019m not aware Buhari is endorsing Adamu\n\nHammed Shittu in Ilorin and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAhead of its March 26 national convention, the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has begun to set machinery in motion for the exercise. The latest move was the constitution of an eight-member committee on the zoning of party offices, headed by Kwara State Governor Abdulrahaman AbdulRazaq. National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John Akpanudoedehe, disclosed this in a statement, yesterday.\n\nHowever, Akpanudoedehe hinted, in a telephone conversation, that the leadership of the ruling party had yet to meet over the Electoral Act recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nBut as the convention team readied to get the ball rolling, principal officers of the Senate and some senators of the ruling party, led by President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, his deputy, Omo-Agege said they had endorsed the candidature of Senator Abdullahi Adamu (Nasarawa West) for the office of National Chairman.\n\nNonetheless, former Governor of Borno State and frontline chairmanship aspirant, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, said he was not aware of the alleged endorsement of Adamu by Buhari as the next national chairman of the party.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kwara State, a chieftain of APC and Pro-Chancellor of the Federal University, Dutse, Jigawa State, Hon. Benjamin Issa Ezekiel, said one of the chairmanship aspirants from the North-central geopolitical zone, Malam Saliu Mustapha, remained the state\u2019s \u201cunity candidate\u201d for the office of APC chairman.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said, in the statement, \u201cThe National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, has approved the appointment of the Party\u2019s Zoning Committee for the forthcoming National Convention.\u201d\n\nHe named other members of the committee to include Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, who will serve as deputy chairman of the zoning committee. Professor Etim Nyong, Dr. MB Shehu, Mustapha Salihu, Senator Teslim Folarin, and Mr. Sadeeq Sule-Iko Sami were named members of the committee, while Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Nkem Okeke, would serve as Secretary.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said the committee was expected to submit its report on March 7.\n\nBut some senators endorsed Adamu during a meeting held at the Senate wing of the National Assembly complex on Wednesday evening, with the ranking senator in attendance.\n\nThe APC senators, numbering about 10, were said to have resolved to back Adamu in his bid to become the party\u2019s national chairman at the forthcoming national convention slated to hold in Abuja on March 26. Sources told THISDAY that the senators also agreed to engage other stakeholders, including some of the chairmanship aspirants, on the need to drop their ambitions and support the chairman of Senate Committee on Agriculture to emerge as chairman of the ruling party.\n\nOne of the aspirants, who is also a serving senator, Sani Musa (Niger East), attended the Wednesday meeting. But THISDAY could not confirm if he had agreed to drop his ambition and support Adamu.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the senators took a group photograph, with Adamu flanking the senate president on the right\n\nThose present at the meeting included Ovie Omo-Agege; Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi; Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu; Deputy Chief Whip, Senator Sabi Abdullahi; and Senator Jubril Barau.\n\nOthers in attendance were Senators Bello Mandiya and Opeyemi Bamidele.\n\nAlthough it was widely believed that Buhari had expressed his preference for Adamu as the consensus candidate for national chairman, THISDAY had reported that APC stakeholders from the South-east pushed for the office of National Secretary, while the South-west, where the office was originally zoned, was still divided over the party position.\n\nDuring a meeting with the president, APC governors agreed that all the previous positions in the party held by members from the North-west would now go to those from the South-east; all positions that were held by those from the North-east would go to those from the South-west; and all positions previously held by members from the North-central would automatically go to those from the South-south. This meant that the positions of national secretary and chairman had been dealt with.\n\nBut, with the setting up of zoning committee by the party, stakeholders would be on the look out for possible changes in the zoning formula, even though a governor, who preferred anonymity, recently told THISDAY that the zoning formula in circulation was not sacrosanct.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, however, told THISDAY in a telephone chat that the party was currently focused on conducting the convention.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe have a leader of the party, which is the president. We have stakeholders, governors, senators, House of Representatives members, former governors \u2013 it is all embracing. They are critical, legally empowered. We have to consider a number of issues.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to meet on the Electoral Act. Don\u2019t forget it was signed over the weekend, this is a new week. But we are very focused on the convention.\u201d\n\nAsked if the party would be able to conduct its zonal congresses, convention, and primaries between April 4 and June 3, the secretary said he wouldn\u2019t want to pre-empt the leadership of the party.\n\nHe added, \u201cLet me not pre-empt the leadership of the party. Let me not speak as an individual. I\u2019m only holding this position in trust for everybody. I speak the decision of the caretaker committee. The convention is on course.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, another party source informed THISDAY that the reason Akpanudoedehe wanted to remain secretary of the party was to make it easier for him to get the Akwa Ibom State governorship ticket.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cHe (Akpanudoedehe) wanted to remain secretary and contest for governor. But the governors took the secretary to South-west and it is micro-zoned to Oyo State. Buni wants to be Vice President. Namani (Ken) wants to be governor.\u201d\n\nSheriff: I\u2019m Not Aware of Buhari\u2019s Endorsement of Adamu\n\nFormer Governor of Borno State and frontline national chairmanship aspirant of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, said he was not aware of the purported endorsement of a former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, by President Muhammadu Buhari as the next national chairman of APC ahead the March 26 convention of the party.\n\nSheriff stated this while addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, saying the leadership of the party has not communicated to the aspirants that one of them has been endorsed.\n\nThe former lawmaker, however, added that if the president, as the leader of the party, anointed anybody, he would withdraw from the race and stand by the decision.\n\nSheriff said it became imperative to address the press due to some concerns of party faithful regarding the alleged decision and position of the president as well as the party leadership with respect to the national chairmanship.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOf late, I have been inundated by insinuations and rumours that President Muhammadu Buhari has zoned and endorsed a candidate for this all-important position in our party\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I am not aware of any official statement or position by Mr. President on endorsement of any particular candidate or/and zoning of the chairmanship position of our great party.\n\n\u201cMr. President and, indeed, the party is yet to issue a formal statement on these issues. I am in the race for the national chairmanship position of our party APC, because of my strength of character, capacity and competence. My intentions are clear and explicitly for public good rather than self-interest.\u201d\n\nThe former governor said as a loyal party member, he would abide by the decisions of the president at any time he made an official position known. Sheriff said he had unequivocal confidence in the president\u2019s capacity to make the right choice for the growth of the party.\n\nWhile stressing that he was committed to working with anyone to reposition the party towards a resounding victory in 2023 general election and beyond, Sheriff said, \u201cOur guiding principle will be the party\u2019s constitution and manifesto, and I will be committed to it. On Mr. President\u2019s decision, I stand.\u201d\n\nEx-Kwara Speaker Declares Mustapha State\u2019s Unity Candidate\n\nA chieftain of APC and Pro-Chancellor of the Federal University, Dutse, Hon. Benjamin Issa Ezekiel, said the chairmanship aspirant of the party from Kwara State, Malam Saliu Mustapha, was the state\u2019s \u201cunity candidate\u201d for the office.\n\nThe 49-year-old Mustapha is said to be the youngest of the aspirants vying for the position of the APC national chairman, with experience as former National Deputy Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressives Change.\n\nHe is a long time ally of Buhari right from the latter\u2019s days in the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) through to the CPC.\n\nEzekiel, who is also a former Speaker of the Kwara State House of Assembly, spoke in Ilorin on the sideline of a Personality Public Lecture organised in Mustapha\u2019s honour by the Postgraduate Students Association of Nigeria, University of Ilorin chapter. He stressed that if elected, Mustapha would solidify the party on the strength of his goodwill with the various tendencies in the party.\n\nEzekiel said, \u201cMustapha enjoys the blessings of all tendencies in the APC in Kwara State. Mustapha has a history of a cordial relationship with virtually all major stakeholders of the party, starting with Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq.\u201d\n\nThe former speaker also said the senators representing the state and the two ministers from the state, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and Senator Gbemisola Saraki, among others, supported Mustapha\u2019s aspiration.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe only reason why Mallam Saliu Mustapha is the only candidate contesting from Kwara State is because of his goodwill at home. He is not only loved by the community and traditional leadership of the state, which led to his elevation as the Turaki of Ilorin, he is also very well respected by the political class, especially, within the progressive family.\n\n\u201cThis is unlike other states in the North-central, where there are multiple candidates from the same state. Niger and Nasarawa are ready examples. So, among all the contestants from the North-central, he is the only one with the most formidable state backing that cuts across all interest blocs. This is why we are appealing to the president to pull his weight behind Mustapha, who, incidentally, has been his long time ally.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Panel gets one week to amend 2022 budget\n\nSunday Aborisade\n\n\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, yesterday urged President Muhammadu Buhari to transmit a bill to the National Assembly to amend the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). Lawan stated this before he referred the president\u2019s request for the amendment of the 2022 Appropriation Act to the Committee on Appropriation, after the bill scaled Second Reading.\n\nThe senate president said the request seeking an amendment to the PIA would enable the National Assembly to extend the subsidy regime in the petroleum law to be in line with the president\u2019s request for an additional N2.557 trillion to cover fuel subsidy in the 2022 budget from July this year.\n\nThe present subsidy regime was expected to elapse in June 2022, in accordance with the provisions of the PIA.\n\nBuhari, in a letter to the National Assembly dated February 10, 2022, had requested the legislature to make an additional provision for N2.557 trillion to fund petrol subsidy in the 2022 Budget Framework from July this year.\n\nLawan mandated the relevant Oil and Gas Committees of the National Assembly to engage the executive on a bill to amend the PIA to align with the president\u2019s request.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is an opportunity for me to speak to the issue of the executive sending a request for the amendment of the Petroleum Industry Act to extend the provision of the fuel subsidy, which is also requested in the amendment of the 2022 Appropriation Act.\n\n\u201cThe Act itself says something else, that there will be no subsidy. If we approve subsidy in the 2022 Appropriation Act Amendment Bill, then it means we have to extend the period in which government will provide subsidy up to the point this subsidy we approve (N2.557 trillion) would last. So, there is need to come up with the request for amendment.\n\n\u201cOur Gas and Oil-related Committees should work with the executive side of government to get that sorted as soon as possible, so that what we do is appropriate, and is lawful and legal.\u201d\n\nThe bill seeking to amend the 2022 Appropriation Act scaled Second Reading in the senate on Tuesday.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North), requested Senate approval for N106,161,499,052 for capital expenditures and N43,870,592,044 for recurrent without increasing budget deficit.\n\nBuhari had accused members of the National Assembly of inserting their projects in the 2022 budget at the detriment of those initiated by the executive arm of government. He had, therefore, asked the federal lawmakers to amend the 2022 Appropriation Act passed by the National Assembly in December 2021.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Some female employees of telecommunications company, MTN Nigeria, have accused the company's Chief Sales and Distribution Officer, Adekunle Adebiyi, of sexual harassment and other gross misconducts.\n\nIn a series of emails and documents sent to MTN Group\u2019s headquarters in South Africa between April 2021 and February 2022, the female employees, who hid their identities and only described themselves as \u2018The Anonymous Whistle Blowers\u2019, accused Adebiyi of being a sexual predator in the habit of using his position in the company to sleep with young female employees.\n\nMTN Nigeria Building\n\nThey also accused him of threatening such women with sacking if they fail to give in to his demands.\n\nThe aggrieved employees also alleged that Adebiyi had been using his position to plant family members and friends in key units of the telecommunications company even when such persons clearly lacked the requisite educational qualification and skills to occupy such roles.\n\nThe whistleblowers also accused the Chief Sales and Distribution Officer of inflating contracts, receiving kickbacks and inventing false sales figures to deceive the company's management and continue to keep his coveted role.\n\nAccording to the employees, Adebiyi, despite his gross misconducts and acts of corruption and sabotage against MTN Group, had the full backing of MTN Nigeria Chief Executive Officer, Karl Toriola, and other top officers in the company.\n\nIn some of the emails sent to Nerisha Singh, General Manager, Forensic Services, of MTN Group, by \u2018The Anonymous Whistle Blowers\u2019 and seen by SaharaReporters, the aggrieved employees said, \u201cWe are writing because the man, Adekunle Adebiyi, who heads sales, is a dangerous threat to your company. We wish men like Adekunle Adebiyi will not destroy MTN Nigeria. You left a monster and sexual predator to continue in office but after one year, we can no longer be silenced by his continued intimidation.\n\n\u201cMany of us became victims of his boastful abuses and direct punishments. Three persons resigned in S&D through his intimidations and threats. Kumar Abubakar, a resourceful Senior Manager, was fired by him and Amina, his GM in the North, on trumped-up charges because Kumar knows all their fake and forged gross connections, numbers and sales figures.

          "text": "War is a black egg of carnage and despair, and when it breaks out; its shell of mayhem crushes stability, and its yolk of trouble melts futures. This sorry state has been the reality of Ukrainians for the last seven days as the country suffered an invasion from President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. The ongoing shelling and gun battles in important Ukrainian cities have claimed the lives of over 2,000 civilians and military personnel. The war has also impacted the lives of over 12,000 Nigerians living in the country.\n\nAs some of the country\u2019s citizens fled into neighbouring lands to escape the chaos, video clips surfaced on social media depicting how Nigerians, alongside other Africans, were turned back at the border by gun-wielding guards. Many described the viral images as racism rearing its ugly head. Others played the devil\u2019s advocate and blamed the Nigerians for leaving their father land for such a place.\n\nBelow are the top reasons why Ukraine is a popular destination among Nigerians emigrating.\n\nCHEAP BUT QUALITY EDUCATION\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigerians, alongside citizens of other African and Asian countries, emigrate to Ukraine in droves for educational purposes. According to data from UNESCO, there are 3,302 Nigerian students currently admitted into academic programmes in the country. For a country where only a tiny fraction understands the English language, ambitious Nigerian students are not dissuaded as they enroll themselves in programmes that are offered in English.\n\nFor Nigerian students trying to evade the incessant strike of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and not drill holes in their parents\u2019 pockets with the exorbitant fee of the country\u2019s private tertiary institutions, Ukraine presents a cheaper option. According to ToStudyInUkraine, with $4000-$5000, one can get a medical degree from a Ukrainian university, which is low compared to tuition fees in countries like Canada, the UK, and the US where the same degree could cost as much as $20,000 to $90,000.\n\nIn addition, medical degrees earned in Ukraine, for instance, are recognised worldwide, including by the World Health Organisation (WHO), European Council and other global bodies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking with Ukrainer, Abekwuchi Chukwumati, a senior at the faculty of law at Ternopil National Economic University, said her mother picked Ukraine as an educational destination because \u201cit\u2019s easy to apply for a visa here\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe child of my mother\u2019s friend studied here at Ternopil Medical University, so she recommended this school to my mum. And my mother thought, \u2018Okay. It\u2019s a good university, and it\u2019s easy to apply for a visa here.\u2019 So we decided to come here,\u201d she said.\n\nTHE LURE OF GREEN PASTURE\n\nAccording to TradingEconomics, the unemployment rate in Ukraine as of September 2021 was as low as 9.2% compared to 33.3% in Nigeria. There are obviously better chances of getting engaged with a job in Ukraine than staying in a country with a youth unemployment rate of 53.4%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemuneration is also a vital factor in the decision of Nigerians emigrating to Ukraine. The country has a minimum wage of 6,000 Ukrainian hryvnia, which equals N83,000 \u2014 over 150% above the N30,000 minimum wage in Nigeria.\n\nFor Chigo, a Nigerian student who migrated to Ukraine to study a few months ago, the standard of living in Ukraine dwarfs that of the Nigeria he left behind.\n\n\u201cThere is no comparison at all. The cost of living here is far lower than in Nigeria,\u201d he told TheCable.\n\nAn Instagram user, @cowriesking, who has been at the forefront of providing aid to Nigerians fleeing the war, blamed a lack of basic amenities in Nigeria as a major factor why he and others moved to Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe all know the situation of Nigeria. After all these years, the country can\u2019t still provide constant electricity,\u201d he told TheCable.\n\nHowever, emigration comes with low points. Uprooting oneself from the warmth and familiarity of one\u2019s country into the unfamiliarity of a foreign land comes with challenges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChigo described how he found it hard to acclimatise to the biting cold of the Ukrainian winter when he first arrived.\n\n\u201cThe cold was a challenge at first. You have to go places in multiple clothes. It takes a while to adapt to the cold. We go to wherever we are going as fast as possible and quickly get heated up upon reaching our destination,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Chukwumati, it was beyond the cold, but the country\u2019s \u201cquiet\u201d that she found disturbing at first.\n\n\u201cAt first, it was too cold for me in Ukraine. So cold. And too quiet, empty outside. A little bit too quiet for my liking.\u201d\n\nAlthough Chigo had to communicate with the Google Translate app whenever he was on a grocery run, he said \u201clanguage is not really a barrier\u201d.\n\nBut for Jeffrey, a Nigerian musician in Ternopil, the language barrier made socialisation difficult for him when he first moved to Ukraine. His situation only got better after picking up the local language in bits.\n\n\u201cI gradually learn Ukrainian by listening to the conversations of Ukrainians. But even when I know what to say (in Ukrainian), I remain silent,\u201d he said.\n\nThe terrible incident that Africans suffered at the Ukrainian border while trying to escape has evoked conversations around racism in the country.\n\nNze, a 25-year-old Nigerian studying at the state university of telecommunication in Kyiv, claimed he found it tough getting accommodation because Africans are often blacklisted as \u201csmelly tenants\u201d by Ukrainian landlords.\n\n\u201cI found getting accommodation very challenging because most Ukrainians don\u2019t rent their apartments to Africans. They say we smell and leave the place smelling,\u201d he told TheCable.\n\nCorroborating Nze\u2019s claim of racism, Chukwumati said she and some of her Nigerian friends have been victims of Ukrainians\u2019 hostility and racism in public transport. She recounted one harrowing incident.\n\n\u201cOnce I was riding a bus, and a woman was trying to push me out of my seat. And nobody said anything. They just looked as if it were normal. I didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "On February 27, Nigerian web designer, Olalekan Owonikoko was away from Twitter when a friend shared a screenshot of a tweet from his account, knowing fully well that it wasn\u2019t the kind of post Owonikoko would make. After seeing the screenshot, Owonikoko was confused as he hadn\u2019t made the post.\n\nA few days before this, the Russian government launched an offensive on a neighbouring eastern European country, Ukraine. But we are an internet world, so the war has also gone to social media, with each side trying to control the narrative online. A huge propaganda war is ongoing and social media has been crucial for sharing updates, and misinformation, about the war. TikTok was used to share updates on the Russian army\u2019s march to Ukraine, while on the other side of the war, a 27-year-old Russian TikTokker Niki Proshin live-streamed an anti-war protest in Russia. Photo sharing app, Instagram, is being used by independent journalist Ilya Varlamov to record videos and take pictures that represent his version of Russia\u2019s military action. In a matter of days, Ukrainian influencer Anna Prytula moved away from her lifestyle posts to show footage of missiles attacking her country on Instagram. Social media has also seen the rise of \u201cwar pages\u201d\u2014Instagram meme pages that promise to share updates on the Ukraine conflict but are fake pages hoping to get money from advertisements.\n\nOn February 26, social media accounts linked to Buffer, the social media scheduling tool, were hacked to spread support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine under the hashtag #SupportRussia. \u201cIt was clearly not the kind of content I would share,\u201d Owonikoko said. \u201cMy friend knew this and wanted to be sure I hadn\u2019t shared such a thing. I took a minute to be sure I hadn\u2019t engaged with any content like that and accidentally shared it. It was clear my account had been hacked,\u201d said Owonikoko, who noted that though his Twitter account is set up on Buffer, he rarely uses the app. Like most propaganda and disinformation campaigns, the accounts shared the same tweet, with the same social media asset, and at the same time.\n\nA cross-section of accounts that posted the propaganda post on Twitter. Source: Reddit\n\nBuffer released a statement on February 26, where it acknowledged that Buffer accounts had been hacked to share unauthorised posts that support Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Buffer revealed that 1,552 accounts were affected, while 618 accounts posted 766 unauthorised content across Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Buffer revealed in its statement that none of the 1,552 affected accounts had 2-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, and attributed the hack to reused passwords.\n\nTwitter user, @Downtownrob, revealed that he doesn\u2019t have two-factor authentication (2FA) on his account, and uses a virtual assistant, Fancy Hands, which publishes WordPress articles for him via Buffer.\n\nTechCabal\u2019s Twitter account, which is linked to Buffer, was compromised and also shared the propaganda tweet. The newsroom was alerted to the development; we took the tweet down and shared a statement on Twitter clarifying the situation.\n\nThis is not the first time Russia has tried to shape international opinion about its invasion of Ukraine. Back in 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea Peninsula, a network of trolls, bots, and spam accounts focused on denying military presence in the Peninsula. However, Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign goes beyond Ukraine; they affect users everywhere. For instance, a Facebook threat report released last May revealed that Russia\u2019s biggest disinformation campaigns targeted Ghana, the US, and Mexico.\n\nA few days ago, Facebook disabled a misinformation network of about 40 accounts that were pushing fake news about Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Twitter said it has been removing disinformation networks linked to the Ukraine conflict. With a no-holds-barred propaganda and disinformation campaign spreading on social media, it is imperative that users take digital security measures more seriously and are careful about information they consume on social media, especially at this time.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "What happens to your assets when you die? Do they go to your family or will they become unclaimed assets?\n\nGlobal unclaimed assets are running into billions of dollars. Currently, in the US, unclaimed cash and benefits are worth about $58 billion. In the UK, in 2019, The Telegraph reported \u00a3200 billion in lost assets. In South Africa, unclaimed assets are valued at R45 billion (~$3 billion). Chainalysis also estimates that about a fifth of all bitcoin mined to date \u2014 somewhere between 2.78 and 3.79 million\u2014are unclaimed.\n\nEvery nation in the world has its own reservoir of unclaimed assets.\n\nThese unclaimed properties and assets come from a variety of sources, including abandoned bank accounts and stock holdings, unclaimed life insurance payouts, forgotten pension benefits, forgotten landed properties, and more.\n\nRecently, in Canada, Yomi Osamiluyi, a software engineer, realised that his assets were placed in several investments and wished he could track them all under one platform which his loved ones would have access to claim in the event of his death and in the absence of a will. After doing some digging, he discovered that there was no simple means or tool to integrate his assets.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSimilarly, last year in Nigeria, Oluyomi Ojo, a Lagos-based tech entrepreneur, had just caught the bug of buying shitcoins\u2014dogecoin had just crossed a massive milestone and was trending on social media\u2014and downloaded Binance to buy some units of dogecoin. But, after buying it, the question he asked himself was, who gets the coin should anything happen to him? How would his family claim it?\n\nAs someone who\u2019s built and run businesses, instead of dwelling too long on the question, Ojo began to think of how to solve the problem. There were many ideas, but that of a tool that puts all one\u2019s assets in one place for easy tracking and management was top of the list. So, to test the validity of his idea, he tweeted about it, and within an hour, thousands of people engaged with likes, questions, interest, and more suggestions on how to finesse the idea.\n\nStartup idea. Investment inheritance tech. Somewhere you can connect all your cryptocurrencies & investments with passwords and details. If you pass on or anything happens to you. It shares full access with your next of kin.\n\n\n\nI feel platforms are inheriting unclaimed investments \u2014 Oluyomi Ojo (@OluyomiOjo) January 29, 2021\n\nEven though the idea to build a solution to the problem didn\u2019t come from Twitter, the conviction that it could be a product people would pay to use came from the social media platform. After the tweet went viral, it became apparent that there was a real problem to solve and a market to build for. So, that same day Ojo reached out to Osamiluyi, who was a founding member and CTO at Printivo, a Lagos-based printing company Ojo co-founded, for 4 years before relocating to Canada.\n\nDue to his initial interest, the idea resonated with Osamiluyi, and the duo started working on the product that would be called Cova.\n\n\u201cI reached out to Yomi, and within 24 hours, the first waitlist\u2019s landing page was ready and over 700 people dropped their email addresses,\u201d said Ojo, CEO at Cova.\n\nOluyomi Ojo, cofounder/CEO at Cova\n\nCova app was finally launched into the market December last year.\n\nHow Cova works\n\nCova is built to organise users\u2019 assets in one place and transfer ownership to users\u2019 listed beneficiaries in the event of their death. So, when a user opens an account on the platform and completes the required know-your-customer (KYC) process, they can then go on to file in their assets, create a beneficiary and third-party trustee, and their \u201ccheck-in time\u201d\u2014meaning the threshold of inactiveness that must be exceeded before the platform transfers ownership to the user\u2019s beneficiaries.\n\nCova provides layers of beneficiaries. For now, users can only add one direct beneficiary, which is the first layer, and then a trustee\u2014someone who will take charge if the beneficiary is unavailable to claim the asset.\n\nThe platform notifies the beneficiary when a user fails to check in after they\u2019ve passed their check-in waiting time. The same thing happens to the beneficiary when they fail to claim the asset and the trustee gets it.\n\n\u201cCova is like a single source of truth for everything you own. It gives you the power to aggregate, manage and track everything, even while you\u2019re alive, and also helps your people discover and claim your assets when you\u2019re gone,\u201d said Ojo, CEO at Cova, who is also co-founder at Hallo Creative, a Lagos-based advertising company.\n\nCova supports two types of assets: digital assets like bank accounts and crypto wallets; and physical assets like landed property. The digital assets are called connected or sync assets that can be pulled in from third-party systems holding the assets through API. For instance, users can sync their Cova profile with their local and international bank accounts, savings apps like Piggyvest and Kuda, investment apps like Bamboo and Robinhood, and crypto wallets like Binance, Trust Wallets, and BuyCoins.\n\nPhysical assets, on the other hand, are manually added. Users would have to add the details of the assets themselves\u2014location, certificate of ownership, and other required documents\u2014and their value.\n\n\u201cOur users are saying, \u2018I\u2019m alive now: what else can I do with this app?\u2019 We realise that people are a lot more focused on asset tracking, and we must be able to let them see what their assets are worth in real time,\u201d said Ojo. \u201cSome of them don\u2019t even go to their holding platform anymore; they just come to Cova, see what their assets are now worth, and are good.\u201d\n\nYomi Osamiluyi, cofounder and CTO at Cova\n\nSecurity is top priority\n\nIn this type of business, securing users\u2019 data is at the heart of the day-to-day. According to Osamiluyi, the company CTO and a security engineering , Cova employs encryption strategies to secure users\u2019 sensitive data. \u201cWe have also built a multi-factor authentication feature into the system so that users can add layers of security to their account.\u201d He also said that they will continue to look for better ways to secure users\u2019 data.\n\nThe company operates a subscription-based model and charges $4.99 per month and $59.99 per year. Ojo said, since launch, Cova\u2019s customers have gone into the thousands. What\u2019s also interesting is that the startup is positioned as a global company rather than the usual African company. It\u2019s operational anywhere in the world even though its user base is currently concentrated in the US, Canada, and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cUsers can sync their physical assets from anywhere in the world, but for bank accounts, only users in Nigeria, US, and Canada can do that, for now.\u201d\n\nGlobally, this is a nascent industry that can either be placed in insurance tech, inheritance tech, security tech, and even fintech. But for Ojo, it\u2019s better called wealthtech.\n\nAt the moment, Cova is the only business building at this scale in Africa. But since the company is positioned as a global enterprise, there are global direct and indirect competitors like Everplans, which helps in securing important documents.\n\nBoth Ojo and Osamiluyi believe that this new industry that Cova plays in will be big in the coming years as the proliferation of digital assets like crypto, NFTs, and stocks continue to expand.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside HUB2's digital stack for insurance providers in francophone Africa",
          "text": "Compared to other developed and emerging markets, insurance in Africa remains a marginal product. As of 2018, total insurance penetration in Africa stood at just 3% in a population of 1.2 billion people, per a McKinsey report. And going by data from the African Insurance Organisation, that figure dropped to 2.78% a year later, far below the global average of 7.23%.\n\nBut like most under-tapped sectors, there\u2019s a strong reason to believe that the rapid expansion of digital and mobile services in Africa could change the face of insurance on the continent. Already, a small but growing number of startups\u2014such as Nigeria-based Casava and Kenya\u2019s Lami\u2014have sprung up to broaden insurance coverage in some parts of Africa.\n\nWhile the aforementioned players directly offer insurance products to the mass market through digital channels, some other startups operate as enablers for incumbents. One such is C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire-based HUB2, an insurance-focused fintech company founded in 2018 by Ashley Gauzere.\n\nHUB2 provides a suite of infrastructure services\u2014including payment collections via mobile money, bank cards, and POS agents, chatbots deployment as well as logistics and delivery\u2014that help traditional insurance giants reach last-mile consumers in several francophone African countries.\n\nThe company currently operates in 9 French-speaking countries (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Mali, Guinea, Niger Republic, DRC, and Gabon) across West and Central African regions. It also serves at least 10 of the biggest insurance providers in the region (including Allianz, Leadway, Ascoma, OLEA, Activa, etc.).\n\nDespite its success so far, HUB2, which works out of the Village by CA R\u00e9union, a French department in the Indian Ocean, was initially launched to serve the e-commerce space in francophone Africa, not insurance.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFrom telecom to tech: founding HUB2\n\nBefore founding HUB2, Gauzere ran a management consulting company based in Mauritius that advised telecom operators across western Africa. Prior to that, he worked at French network operator Orange in Africa and the Middle East, developing broadband infrastructure in several countries.\n\nDuring his time at Orange, while deploying 3G and 4G networks as well as fibre infrastructure, Gauzere would always pay attention to the e-commerce sector and noticed that apart from internet connectivity, the main infrastructure needs that were holding back the sector were logistics and financial services.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, I decided to work on a payments aggregator for e-commerce services in francophone Africa which we launched a year later in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\u201d the CEO recalled in an interview with TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAt the end of 2019, we got our first customer from the insurance sector and after recording significant success with that account, saw that there was a huge opportunity there and decided to build a complete and dedicated technical stack to address the challenges that players in the insurance sector face.\u201d\n\nAshley Gauzere, founder and CEO of HUB2.\n\nA digital backbone for insurance services\n\nHUB2 is primarily a payments aggregator enabling interoperability between mobile money wallets within the same country. With regard to payment integrations, it is connected to at least 28 local and national major mobile money operators, including Orange Money, MTN, Moov Moov, Mobicash, Wizall, Yup, etc. through direct or indirect connections (via other aggregators).\n\nThe startup\u2019s main customers come from the insurance sector. Through its infrastructure, insurance companies, brokers, and retailers can carry out transactions, including premium payments and claims, via mobile money and bank cards. The startup also has partnerships with major POS networks, including InTouch, through which end customers can access, purchase and renew insurance covers provided by its clients.\n\nAccording to Gauzere, HUB2 currently processes up to $10 million per month in payments. Meanwhile, insurance providers on its platform can sell their products via 30,000 agents across its markets, with 5,000 of those in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire alone, which accounts for almost 30% of the insurance market in francophone West Africa.\n\nAs part of non-fintech services, HUB2 builds and deploys conversational chatbots to help insurance companies automate their customer engagement efforts, and has partnerships with Glovo and Jumia, to use their logistics services for the delivery of physical insurance certificates to customers.\n\n\u201cI like to refer to HUB2 as a \u2018hybrid\u2019 or \u2018FinInsurTech\u2019 company because we offer financial and non-transactional services, mostly to insurance companies,\u201d Gauzere said. \u201cThe vision is to enhance their traditional systems and make them more reactive and operate in real-time.\u201d\n\nGauzere believes HUB2\u2019s success so far has been down to a \u201creal product-market fit\u201d of its full-stack solution.\n\nFrancophone West Africa has an extremely low insurance penetration rate of 1.2%, according to the McKinsey report. Due to the low rate of insurance in the region of nearly 300 million people (excluding Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), major opportunities exist for this low penetration to grow substantially.\n\nIn addition, digital financial services, particularly mobile money (MoMo) and agency banking are widely used by the public in francophone African markets. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, one of the region\u2019s largest MoMo markets, 75% of the population own a mobile money account, compared to 20% who own bank accounts.\n\nMany traditional insurers are also realising the need to modernise and scale up their technological setup, especially in the wake of the pandemic-induced boom in the demand for remote services.\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s no better way to reach the mass market than through mobile systems,\u201d Gauzere said. \u201cAn additional advantage is that our digital infrastructure is on-demand, so there is no recurring cost for companies. The comprehensive service is available at a very marginal cost for companies to increase their operation and efficiency.\u201d\n\nDespite this, getting insurance companies to buy into using digital solutions hasn\u2019t been easy. The insurance sector in francophone Africa is a largely traditional one where paper certificates are common and delivered three to four weeks after subscription.\n\n\u201cThe adoption curve was a very huge issue early on,\u201d Gauzere said. \u201cYou talk to insurance companies about using mobile money and technology and they\u2019re like, \u2018Okay, so from which planet are you from?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe apathy for tech-enabled services is just one of many challenges the HUB2 team has had to deal with while building and scaling the platform in francophone Africa.\n\nThough HUB2 has secured a total of $1.8 million in total external funding since its launch, Gauzere reveals attracting funding has been difficult. He blames this on the fact that the insurance sector is not one where investors can get the most margin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still the early days,\u201d he said, adding that finding the \u201cright technical talent\u201d to help scale the 4-year-old startup has also been challenging.\n\nRegulation: an enabler and a bottleneck\n\nThe Conf\u00e9rence Interafricaine des March\u00e9s d\u2019Assurances (CIMA)\u2014an insurance oversight body covering 14, mostly francophone, countries with harmonised insurance laws and regulations\u2014was established in 1992 to improve the insurance process across the region.\n\nBy creating a single regulatory structure, the CIMA has been beneficial in promoting stability in the industry. It\u2019s also helped platforms like HUB2 scale relatively easily across the region but Gauzere noted that the one-size-fits-all policy for a diverse array of markets may lead to complexities in some member states.\n\n\u201cThe CIMA zone may enable easier movement across countries but sometimes, the inflexible regulatory demands and rules may hinder innovation in specific member countries,\u201d he said.\n\nGoing forward, Gauzere reveals HUB2 has several agreements with other mobile money providers and agent networks that\u2019ll help expand its market reach to 50,000 agents by 2022 end. However, the logistics side is harder to scale as the startup has to find a reliable partner in each country.\n\nHUB2 has also been contracted by two insurers in the French-speaking region to roll out fully digital micro-insurance products in some of its markets, according to the CEO.\n\n\u201cWe believe that digital micro-insurance, linked with the right network for distribution, has the same potential as mobile banking,\u201d Gauzere said. \u201cIncreasing insurance penetration in the region will largely be achieved through digital micro-insurance.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "On Tuesday, many African entrepreneurs and tech startup founders took to twitter to express their displeasure of how Mercury, a San Francisco-based digital bank for startups, blocked their accounts without prior communication.\n\nWhile some startups found out on Monday night that they\u2019ve been shut out of the platform and thought it was a glitch, choosing to wait it out till Tuesday, others found out on Tuesday when people started tweeting about it.\n\nMercury dey block everybody account. Wetin sup? \u2014 Polysaccharide Patriach (@bigbrutha_) March 1, 2022\n\nBank Mercury blocked a bunch of African tech startups\u2026 we have work to do. @immad please fix for the founders who are affected. \u2014 Benjamin Fernandes \ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddff (@Benji_Fernandes) March 1, 2022\n\nThis is not a good look. I have a list of over 20+ African startups whose bank accounts were mass-blocked at around the same time by @BankMercury yesterday. I love Mercury a lot but they can\u2019t just do this to an entire continent. It is not right & we need to all speak up. https://t.co/vr21Pd9nq4 \u2014 Moe is mourning her crocs (@Mochievous) March 1, 2022\n\nMercury restricted a large number of African startups\u2019 bank accounts enmasse due to \u201cunusual activity\u201d.\n\n\n\nLike that number of accounts. At the same time.\n\n\n\nWild. \u2014 10X Tech Bro (@OdunEweniyi) March 1, 2022\n\nLater on Tuesday, Mercury responded by sending out an email that vaguely indicated that the accounts were blocked due to some compliance issues.\n\nEmail sent to affected startups after blocking their accounts\n\nIn the later hours of the same day, after more bigwigs African founders have directly tweeted at Immad Akhund, cofounder and CEO of the startup, he sent out a personal email to the affected startups. In the email, he apologised and hinted that the restriction of the accounts was as a result of Mercury\u2019s partner bank noticing an \u201cunusual activity and asked us to lock and investigate a large set of accounts with linked activity.\u201d\n\nImmad Akhund\u2019s email to affected startups\n\nThis measure, however, has thrown a couple of businesses into chaos as they can\u2019t fulfill international transactions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no concrete reason why we\u2019re blocked. The last payment we made via the account was our Delaware Franchise Tax and we did that last week,\u201d said Charles Dairo, co-founder and CEO of Beezop, one of many startups whose accounts were temporarily blocked.\n\nWhile Beezop was lucky to have sent out their own tax payment prior to the event, some founders have not yet filed theirs, and failure to do so may lead to them being fined as the deadline was on Tuesday. Other founders who used the bank for more frequent transactions complained that the pending transactions they sent out are getting bounced and this is affecting their fiscal operation.\n\nwe have two vendors and several payments that we can't fulfil and one can imagine the rest of stories https://t.co/9N7mfOCaGC \u2014 ET (@ebottabi) March 1, 2022\n\nThe implications of this incident are bad for the affected startups but it has also put a terrible dent on Mercury\u2019s reputation on the continent.\n\nMany African founders and ecosystem players have come out to suggest a boycott and others have suggested a home-built alternative that only either serves African founders or black owned businesses.\n\nA black community-owned global digital bank for black-owned startups, fund managers, businesses, creators, etc. is needed. \u2014 Dayo Koleowo (@NateKorl) March 1, 2022\n\nNotably, even a home-built alternative will need partnership with foreign banks to fly. Digital business bank account providers like Mercury need to collaborate with, oftentimes, traditional banks who can choose to pull the plug anytime. Like in this case.\n\nThis situation is similar to instances on Wise, Paypal, and other international cross-border payment networks that often lock individual African users out of their accounts. Could this be the beginning of an extension to African businesses?\n\nTechCabal reached out to Mercury for comments and their response was similar to what the CEO had already said.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that one of our backend banks has suspended the accounts of a number of Mercury customers in Africa.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Inside NIPOST\u2019s latest financial inclusion play: Agency banking and fingerprint authentication",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fintech space, phrases like \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d and \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d have become so prevalent that they\u2019ve almost certainly become buzzwords. Sometimes, it appears that a fintech startup claiming to be the latest saviour is born every second.\n\nThis is hardly surprising considering the proliferation of fintech startups in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem and the largely unsolved problem of the unbanked. According to the Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), the country\u2019s financial exclusion rate is 35.9% \u2014 one of the highest in Africa.\n\nThat leaves almost 54% unbanked. Considering the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) plan to increase that number to 94% by 2024, there\u2019s still quite a bit to be done. And the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has recently thrown its hat in this ring.\n\nIn January 2022, NIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja. The platform comes with a free debit card that works offline and online and is available at all NIPOST outlets in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, the agency banking platform would follow the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) standards on financial inclusion. He also said that this is part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise the postal services and improve financial inclusion in the country.\n\nHow would this work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy UPU standards, NIPOST\u2019s agency banking platform should provide essential services like savings, payments, money transfers, insurance, and credit. However, it appears the platform would work much like a multi-teller PoS-based service, so the exact mechanics of how NIPOST hopes to serve its customers are a bit sketchy.\n\nTechpoint Africa sent a mail to the Postmaster General\u2019s office but received no reply and a visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that not much is known about the platform yet other than its March expected launch date.\n\nHowever, NIPOST is licensed by the CBN as a super agent and, by CBN guidelines, cannot provide insurance or credit facilities.\n\nAccording to Pantami, the free debit card would use biometric authentication.\n\nIn Africa, South Africa-based fintech, Paycode, provides biometric debit cards, which the company says are operational in several countries, including Namibia, Botswana, Nigeria, and Mozambique. In Namibia, Paycode works with the Namibia Post Ltd (NamPost).\n\nA biometric debit card uses the owner\u2019s fingerprints to authenticate transactions, ensuring additional security and ease of use by the uneducated, thus making it suitable for financial inclusion, especially in rural areas.\n\nThis also means the card can be used offline. For example, Paycode says anyone with access to its API can verify users biometrically without connecting to the Internet. ExtoLabs, a California-based software company with plans to launch in Africa, uses a Bluetooth connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn unknown player\n\nInterestingly, NIPOST did not mention a partnership with any fintech company to deliver this card. However, pictures of the ceremony in Abuja reveal a name \u2014 GingrPay \u2014 etched on the demo cards.\n\nA Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) search uncovered a company named GingrPay Nigeria Limited incorporated on May 18, 2021. A Google search led to a third party website with more info like directors, shareholders, persons with significant control, and companies where GingrPay company officers show up as directors or shareholders.\n\nThe website cites GingrPay\u2019s activity description as \u201cTo facilitate electronic circulation of money as well as the exchange of value between individuals and organisations on a timely and consistent basis using technological softwares.\u201d\n\nA search on the CBN website does not turn up any licence registered to the company name.\n\nVisiting other nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, postal services are no strangers to providing financial services. In Brazil, Correios, the state-owned postal company, operates the Banco Postal in partnership with Banco do Brasil, providing banking services to the unbanked.\n\nIn India, the India Post Payments Bank is a subsidiary of the India Post and has been in operation since September 2018, serving over four crore \u2014 40 million \u2014 customers. Initially, because the India Post appeared to be haemorrhaging money, there was some resistance to the initiative.\n\nOn the continent, in Ghana, the Ghana Post provides various financial services like agency banking in partnership with banks, insurance, and GhPostPay, which enables users to make online transactions. Remittance services are currently suspended.\n\nIn the Benin Republic, government-owned Le poste du B\u00e9nin enables customers to have both savings and current accounts, and provides credit facilities, insurance, and remittance.\n\nNamibia\u2019s NamPost gives customers access to a funeral cover and a savings bank that provides investment products, and save-as-you-earn accounts, among other things.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, postal services are used by significantly poorer persons, older, less educated, and people less likely to be employed than those who have an account at a financial institution or both a financial institution and the post office.\n\nLogically, it follows that postal institutions are essential to fostering financial inclusion.\n\nThe financial inclusion play\n\nNIPOST has made several attempts in this arena.\n\nIn 2017, it signed a partnership agreement with Nigerian fintech startup, Paga, to improve financial inclusion.\n\nOn a call with Techpoint Africa, Arike Okunowo, General Manager, Sales and Distribution, explained that the partnership broke down after a few months because there were some issues surrounding the staffing needed to successfully run the business.\n\nThe partnership saw Paga provide the platform, which NIPOST\u2019s workers manned. But Okunowo explained that the staff already had primary assignments and this created conflict.\n\nAs she told Techpoint Africa, \u201cIf you want to run financial services, you need some level of focus so that if the customer comes in, you are always available to attend to them.\u201d\n\nShe also said that NIPOST was very keen on having its staff man the platform with no third-party interference. However, she also said that they would be open to a possible partnership with the postal company in the future.\n\nOn its financial services page, the postal service company says it provides domestic transfers, international remittance, agency banking \u2013 this appears to have been on the page since April 23, 2021 \u2013 and mobile money services.\n\nNIPOST owns an International Money Transfer Operators (IMTO) licence and says it has partnered with companies like Western Union.\n\nA visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that the agency no longer carries out any of these services and doesn\u2019t seem to have done so for a while, an offshoot of Pantami\u2019s decision in 2019, which saw the agency adopt a cashless policy. All cash transactions, including remittance, are to be done in a banking hall.\n\nThere are also plans to create a microfinance bank.\n\nWhat industry players are saying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkunowo believed NIPOST\u2019s infrastructure makes it a good centrepoint as a shared resource.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say NIPOST should actually be a shared resource for all the providers because of its infrastructure, and because it\u2019s such a major part of the Nigerian state.\u201d\n\nWhile Edidiong Uwemakpan, Director, Brand and Corporate Communications, TeamApt, believed the decision is commendable, she worried about fraud.\n\n\u201cWhere I begin to find challenges is that you were trying to eliminate cash. Now, part of agency banking is, of course, bill payments, and that makes sense. But then the cash in, cash out part of things, that\u2019s where I don\u2019t really see how they plan to do it.\n\n\u201cBecause, are you going to be giving your NIPOST workers a float so that they can give people cash? And you were already trying to eliminate cash in the past because of fraud.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that NIPOST appears not to have partnered with well-known fintechs. And while Okunowo could not confirm if NIPOST had approached Paga, Uwemakpan said TeamApt did not receive any communication from the postal agency.\n\nHowever, though Uwemakpan believed that the market is big enough to contain everyone, she raises concerns regarding the number of outlets NIPOST has \u2013 3,000 \u2013 and whether this would be enough to serve customers. She said NIPOST might need to expand its reach to compete.\n\nOne thing Okunowo and Uwemakpan agreed on is that this endeavour requires quite a lot of investment by NIPOST.\n\nA digital economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the Federal Government of Nigeria announced a three-year modernisation plan for NIPOST. By 2020, the postal agency was to have been unbundled into six subsidiaries: NIPOST Banking and Insurance Company; NIPOST Property and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Services Company; NIPOST E-government Services Company; and NIPOST E-commerce Services Company.\n\nIn January 2022, speaking at a media parley held in Abuja, Dr Ismail Adewusi, Postmaster General and CEO of NIPOST, said that NIPOST was to be unbundled once more, this time, in three places: NIPOST Properties and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Company; and NIPOST Microfinance Bank Limited.\n\nHe also said the unbundling would be done before the end of January 2022. However, there has been no announcement to that effect.\n\nThe NIPOST Act is still in the process of being repealed, and the Nigerian Postal Service (Repeal and Reenactment) Act 2021, passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives in 2021, is currently awaiting assent by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWhen assented to, this means that NIPOST can be unbundled into whatever subsidiaries it sees fit and would hold regulatory powers, making the Postal Agency a Commission.\n\nNIPOST has also partnered with several private companies on its path to full digitisation. In December 2021, it announced an agreement with Egyptian startup, eGATE to create an app that automates last-mile delivery. Customers will be able to track communication with drivers and monitor their delivery.\n\nIn 2018, NIPOST introduced its Address Verification System and Digital Address System. Both were done in collaboration with identity verification startup, Youverify, to improve mail delivery and resolve addressing issues, but the link to the website leads to a dummy page.\n\nHowever, interestingly, there are plans to launch a digital postal code system that is expected to solve the same problem before the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface level, NIPOST does seem to have a lot planned that should benefit the average citizen, but implementation and consistency appear to be lacking.\n\nTo pull off its latest scheme, it might require an overhaul of its entire processes \u2013 like its unbundling, for instance. But these are still early days, and there is much that can still happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

The NCDC never used their solution, and they began to consider other use cases. One, in particular, caught their attention.\n\nImproving customer experience for African businesses\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever encountered challenges while using the services of businesses, especially those in Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications industry, then you\u2019re familiar with the voice prompt that asks you to wait for a customer service agent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my experience, you often have to wait a while before anyone attends to your problem. In some cases, the customer service agents fail to respond accurately.\n\nFounded in 2021 by Ugochukwu Okoro (CEO) and Joshua Olatunde (CTO), MyServiceAgent is a technology company that provides businesses with a range of tools to improve the customer experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of MyServiceAgent\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cAfter building MyServiceAgent, we discovered that it was a platform that can solve a key issue that was being faced not just by the NCDC but by a lot of businesses where we see customers call in to have their issues addressed, and they\u2019re usually placed on queues.\n\n\u201cFrom a survey we did, we discovered that the time given was usually inaccurate. I have spent 15 minutes waiting to speak to a customer care agent, and it never happened,\u201d Okoro says.\n\nMyServiceAgent is a voice-based customer engagement technology platform powered by artificial intelligence that helps businesses solve customer experience challenges. Its flagship product is the MyServiceAgent Smart Interactive Voice Response (IVR), which enables companies to simultaneously interact with as many as 1,000 customers while providing individual responses.\n\nThe startup does this by integrating with a business\u2019 customer relationship management (CRM) system, enabling it to understand a customer\u2019s needs and provide a response. It also uses artificial intelligence to train its software and improve responses.\n\nMyServiceAgent also provides a module that acts as a CRM for businesses without one that it can plug into, or it helps businesses set up a virtual call centre.\n\nProviding convenient and effective customer service solutions\n\nCustomer service is a crucial aspect of a business\u2019 operation, and poor customer service can lead to high churn. A few innovations have been built to solve this problem in the past decade. Businesses have used one of them, the chatbot, to fill in for human customer service agents, often routing unanswered questions to these agents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkoro believes that MyServiceAgent\u2019s solution is different and even better. One reason is the ability for customers to use its virtual call services without an Internet connection. Such a feature assumes increased importance when considering that Internet connectivity in most African countries is riddled with numerous challenges.\n\nAnother feature of MyServiceAgent\u2019s IVR is its ability to pick up conversations from where they ended and initiate subsequent calls with a customer.\n\n\u201cWith MyServiceAgent, businesses and customers can schedule calls. For example, a customer can call and say, \u2018I have this problem, but I\u2019ll be available within this period to resolve it, and MyServiceAgent on behalf of the business will initiate a call at the time the customer has chosen.'\u201d\n\nIn addition to its IVR solution, MyServiceAgent also provides a voice-powered OTP authentication, survey, and business messaging service for companies. Like the IVR offering, customers can choose a convenient time to respond to the business\u2019 inquiry.\n\nMyServiceAgent\u2019s business model\n\nSome entrepreneurs build solutions to problems without considering how they\u2019ll make money from them. However, except you\u2019re running a non-profit organisation, it helps to think of a way to generate revenue early enough.\n\nFor MyServiceAgent, using its services requires a business to have bought credit from which MyServiceAgent makes deductions based on usage. It charges a base fee of \u20a6250,000* ($500) to set up a virtual call centre. The startup has a \u20a67.50 ($0.015) cost per minute for inbound calls while it charges \u20a630 ($0.06) per minute for outbound calls with speech recognition.\n\n\u201cFor each of these functionalities, you need to have credit to be able to use them, and all of them are on a pay-as-you-go basis. The one that is a bit different is the virtual call centre which we charge a one-time fee to set up. Other than that, every service is on a pay-as-you-use basis.\u201d\n\nWhile MyServiceAgent has a base fee for its services, Okoro discloses that the startup is working hard to reduce the costs for businesses to ensure that small businesses can afford to use its services.\n\nSince its official launch in January 2022, the startup already has seven customers, including AltSchool, TalentQL, Truq, Uncommon Digital Vas, Akin Fadeyi Foundation, and Bumpa, with more going through an onboarding process.\n\nWhile it is still early days for the startup, Okoro reveals that there are already plans to expand into Ghana and Rwanda, with talks ongoing with a potential partner in Ghana. He also hopes that MyServiceAgent is a leading provider of cutting-edge customer service solutions globally. Meanwhile, it is eyeing unicorn status in the next five years.\n\n*at the exchange rate of \u20a6500 to $1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "Why is Africa\u2019s largest telco entering the metaverse?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTN has joined the league of companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Shopify betting big on the metaverse with the purchase of 144 plots of land in South Africa\u2019s first metaverse, Africarare. The land is situated in Ubuntuland, a virtual land modelled after the African landscape in Africarare.\n\nAfricarare was launched in October 2021 to bring African creativity to the metaverse. The launch featured the works of South African contemporary artist Norman Catherine as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the Milla Gallery located in Ubuntuland. The NFTs sold out shortly after the launch, fetching $53,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorman Catherine\u2019s work in Ubuntuland\n\nMTN\u2019s move into the metaverse could be another phase in its tech makeover. The telco rebranded by changing its logo from the popular white MTN text in a blue oval-shaped rim to simple black text in a black-rimmed oval.\n\nMTN Group Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer, Nompilo Morafo, said the rebranding is \u201caligned to our evolution from a telecommunications company to a technology company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the metaverse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUbuntuland demo\n\nThere are over 200,000 plots of land in Ethereum-powered Ubuntuland positioned and priced based on a tiered value system.\n\nSouth African entrepreneur Mic Mann who co-founded the metaverse, told Newzroom Afrika \u2014 a South African 24-hour digital satellite television news channel \u2014 that he and his team had been working on the metaverse for six months before it launched.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen such an immense amount of growth within the NFT marketplace and metaverses across the USA, Asia, and Europe. But there hasn\u2019t been much coming out of Africa, and we feel this is a great opportunity for Africa to take part in this new world.\u201d\n\nHe likened the metaverse to a video game, saying gamers have been exploring the metaverse even before it became a buzzword.\n\n\u201cThey socialise with their friends by buying virtual goods and virtual assets in games like Minecraft.\u201d\n\nHowever, the metaverse has changed significantly; it is now blockchain and crypto-enabled, making it possible to bring virtual assets into the real world.\n\nThis is how Ubuntuland works. Its metaverse token, $UBUNTU, can be used to purchase land and art and rent out rooms for meetings. Another South African advertising agency \u2014 M&C Saatchi Abel \u2014 purchased land on Ubuntuland. And according to TECHCENTRAL, the agency opened an office in the metaverse to collaborate with global partners.\n\nWith virtual meetings and art and fashion shows taking place in Ubuntuland, one wonders why Africa\u2019s largest telecom company is entering the space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does this amplify the experience of MTN customers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA map of Ubuntuland\n\nIn a press release on the company\u2019s website, MTN\u2019s Group Executive for Marketing, Bernice Samuels, said the move was also part of its Ambition 2025 based on \u201cleveraging trends that amplify consumer\u2019s digital experiences and engagement.\u201d\n\nThough the metaverse is a buzzword often thrown around on the Internet, it\u2019s still very new in many parts of the world.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Vice President for Africa, Derya Matras, told Forbes Africa that while the metaverse could unlock massive economic opportunities for the continent, the connectivity isn\u2019t there yet.\n\n\u201cObviously, the metaverse is not there yet, and it\u2019s going to take a good ten years to build it all together as an industry,\u201d she said.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the end-game?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is MTN entering the metaverse if it isn\u2019t going mainstream soon? The telecom giant\u2019s rebrand will be more than what it wears and more about what it does to complete its transition from telco to tech.\n\nWhile the metaverse has become a popular word on the Internet, it will take well over a decade before it becomes mainstream. It is then interesting to wonder why MTN has chosen to enter the metaverse as part of its tech rebrand strategy.\n\nMTN has already established its dominance as a telecommunication behemoth, and its recent move suggests that the company is looking to shed its telco skin and begin to flex its fintech muscles.\n\nSome of the most prominent fintech startups on the continent, such as Flutterwave, Chipper Cash and Paystack, have a brand positioning that screams tech; with the amount of success recorded by these companies, it is safe to say that positioning has its perks.\n\nIn November last year, MTN revealed that it had gotten approval in principle to operate payment service banks (PSBs) in one of Africa\u2019s largest economies, Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Emmanuel Paul, Senior Reporter, Techpoint Africa, the move into the metaverse could be \u201ca strategic manoeuvre that has nothing to do with the metaverse,\u201d but more to do with remaining in customers\u2019 minds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "The $1.3bn planned deal between Seplat Energy Plc, a major energy company in Nigeria, and US-based ExxonMobil looks set to put the Petroleum Industry Act, which seeks to attract new oil and gas investments, to the test.\n\nWhile approving a steering committee to supervise the implementation of the PIA last year, President Muhammadu Buhari said Nigeria had lost $50 billion worth of investments in the petroleum industry since 2011 due to the absence of a new law.\n\nThe United States Energy Information Administration estimated that Nigeria lost over $15 billion annually due to the delay in the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill, which was first introduced in the National Assembly in 2008.\n\nSeplat announced on Friday that it had entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Mobil Producing Nigeria Limited (MPNU), the shallow-water business of ExxonMobil in Nigeria, for $1.28 billion.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that Seplat Energy and ExxonMobil had submitted their application for ministerial consent for the deal.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) has listed conditions that must be met before the deal sails through. Mele Kyari, the group managing director of NNPC, has said that International Oil Companies (IOCs) that divest from Nigeria\u2019s upstream oil sector must address issues of abandonment and decommissioning of oil assets.\n\nThe state oil firm has expressed concern that many of the oil and gas assets sold to Nigerians since 2012, mostly by the IOCs, are rarely decommissioned or properly abandoned, a development that clearly breaches existing laws regulating the industry.\n\nRead also: Petroleum industry in confusion as FG plans to amend new PIA\n\nNNPC\u2019s position is premised on its belief that as part of a joint venture with MPNU and with a 60 percent stake, it should have the right of first refusal over any sale or pre-empt the purchase, according to industry lingo.\n\nHowever, an analysis of the NNPC Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) with private oil companies by analysts at Wood Mackenzie found that since this is share sale, not an asset sale, NNPC lacks pre-emption rights.\n\n\u201cBecause this is a corporate acquisition, NNPC has no rights to pre-empt a deal under the Joint Operating Agreement, which governs the JV. This means that ministerial consent would be the only hurdle remaining,\u201d it said.\n\nThe analysts, however, said, \u201cNothing can be taken for granted.\u201d\n\nThe same holds true for Shell\u2019s ongoing divestment by its subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company, which similarly rules out pre-emption, the analysts said.\n\n\u201cIf NNPC wants to acquire that portfolio, then it will have to out-bid the competition. If successful in raising up to US$5 billion with Afreximbank, it would have the firepower to do just that, and massively strengthen its position in the onshore delta,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nThe PIA had turned the NNPC into a commercial firm and this was expected to remove its influence over the sector as both a player and regulator.\n\nOn the implications of the deal, Wood Mackenzie analysts said if completed, it would be transformational for Seplat Energy.\n\nThey said, \u201cIt is already the leading indigenous company in Nigeria, but this will triple its working interest production to over 140,000 boe/d. In total, Seplat will operate 15 percent of Nigerian oil production.\n\n\u201cCrucially, the deal diversifies its operations into shallow water, which is largely devoid of the thefts afflicting its onshore operations. Although this is Seplat\u2019s first offshore acquisition, it will acquire all of MPNU\u2019s Nigerian staff, thus allaying any concerns about its operational capabilities.\u201d\n\nThe planned share sale by ExxonMobil covers a portfolio that includes 1.3 billion boe of contingent resources, 75 percent of which is gas and less than half of its 70 fields have been developed.",

          "text": "As fuel scarcity continued to hit Nigerians and businesses hard on Wednesday, marketers under the aegis of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) have lamented the inability to get petrol supply from depot owners.\n\nMotorists queued for hours on Wednesday at filling stations in major cities, including Lagos, with some spending as much as six hours or more while others kept a vigil on fuel queues so they could be among the first to be served the next morning.\n\nMike Osatuyi, national operation controller of IPMAN, told BusinessDay that his members were still finding it difficult to source the product from depot owners.\n\n\u201cSince NNPC assumed monopolistic power, to be importing solely, they have to live up to the expectation of meeting the nation\u2019s demand without any excuse or blaming anybody,\u201d Osatuyi said.\n\nHuub Stokman, chief executive officer of OVH Energy Marketing Ltd., in remarks at the 5th edition of Nigerian International Energy Summit on Wednesday, said the scarcity can be prevented with good planning.\n\n\u201cCurrent challenge shows why we need to have a good emergency plan; even if we have refineries producing PMS, they can go down for maintenance. We should use this as a learning for when the refineries come,\u201d said Stokman.\n\nIn January, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and its partners imported petrol that is high with methanol and which failed to comply with local standards.\n\nThese led to the quick recall of the products but only after several consumers reported their vehicles have been damaged.\n\nThis situation triggered massive fuel queues that are yet to abate after almost a month. The current scarcity has run into the current war between Russia and Ukraine which has driven up oil prices and disrupted global supply chains.\n\n\u201cWe cannot rule out this having an impact,\u201d said Clement Isong, the executive director of the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria, told BusinessDay.\n\nThe interplay of these factors is causing disruption at home. Despite the federal government\u2019s reassurance, the ongoing shortage of petrol is worsening across major cities in the country, and some marketers blame current development on the inability of the NNPC to meet supply gaps.\n\nGarba Deen Muhammad, group general manager, group public affairs division at the NNPC, had yet to respond to BusinessDay enquiries.\n\nMarket survey around petrol stations in Lagos revealed that five litres of petrol at the black market was sold for between N2,000 to N3,000 on Wednesday.\n\nMany residents, who spoke on the fuel situation, decried the unnecessary hardship they were subjected to in getting petrol as the scarcity was biting harder in major parts of Lagos, and neighbouring towns, forcing many people to spend hours at the filling stations.\n\nRead also: Petrol scarcity takes toll on businesses in Benin\n\nRecounting his ordeals, Festus Martins, a hotel manager, said having gone round many filling stations in Ibadan, with no luck, he was forced to buy petrol at N200 per litre at a filling station.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe suffering is too much. I have gone around the town looking for fuel to buy, but I didn\u2019t get it, as many stations I visited were not open for business. The few ones selling at the official rate have long queues and they don\u2019t sell in jerry cans.\n\n\u201cI was only able to buy at a place for N200 per litre. Some are even selling as high as N300 per litre.\u201d\n\nOn February 14, few days after fuel queues emerged, Bolt Nigeria customers received an in-app notification that there would be a change in ride prices for customers in Lagos starting from February 15, and that has since taken effect.\n\nThe company cited increased operating costs incurred by drivers on the app as the reason for the price review, but many have speculated that it was inspired by the fuel scarcity.\n\n\u201cFrom February 15th, 2022, ride prices in Lagos will be changing in light of the increased operating costs that drivers incur while driving with Bolt.\u201d\n\nPhotos:",

          "text": "At least 2,090 Nigerians are expected to arrive in Nigeria as the federal government commenced the evacuation of the first batch of its citizens fleeing Ukraine to neighbouring countries today, following the conflict between the country and Russia.\n\nGabriel Aduda, the permanent secretary of the ministry of foreign affairs, said in a statement on Wednesday that the stranded Nigerians would be evacuated from Romania, Poland and Hungary via Max Air and Air Peace flights.\n\nHe said, \u201cFurtherance to our efforts to evacuate Nigerians from neighbouring countries surrounding Ukraine, we can confirm that chattered flights will depart on Wednesday, March 2, 2022, to pick up Nigerian evacuees home.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have the following records of evacuees received by the Nigerian embassies at Hungary: 650 persons, Poland: 350 persons, Romania: 940 persons and Slovakia: 150 persons.\n\n\u201cThe capacity and routes of the airlines are as follows: Max Air to Romania 560 persons, Air Peace to Poland 365 persons and Air Peace to Hungary 360 persons.\n\n\u201cThe first batch of evacuees is expected to arrive in Nigeria on Thursday, March 3, 2022.

It should focus on that area. You are focusing on these social services and amenities at a time when the economy of the nation is depressed and not growing at all.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cSome of the things that happened in the recent past can\u2019t be spoken about publicly. I urge the commission never to allow what happened during the sharing of conditional cash transfer from the Federal Government to happen again.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not happy and are angry with the way the conditional cash transfer and sharing of social and economic amenities were handled. The commission needs to look at that and never allow it to happen again.\u201d\n\nNoting that the visit came at the right time as it was necessary to address the lingering issues troubling Nigerians, Obaseki said: \u201cOur founding fathers thought it wise that, in order to preserve the unity of this country, they needed to create a commission that would complement the policy which ensured that every Nigerian will feel that they are part of the country. This was done so that whatever belongs to the country would be equitably and fairly distributed to all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThank you for keeping the spirit of the constitution alive and trying to enforce the constitution as many people feel marginalised in spite of the effort of the commission. Nigerians feel they are not getting what is due them.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe cake we are trying to share in this country is becoming too small as our focus is to build a bigger cake that will be equitably shared. Everybody should be made to contribute something to the national cake for it to be enough for us to share.\n\n\u201cYou have done well as you go about to implement the first task of your mandate, which is ensuring equitable distribution of positions. In fairness, you have done well in that regard.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Executive Chairman, Federal Character Commission, Dr. Muheeba Dankaka, said the visit is in continuation of her engagements with critical stakeholders in the country, adding: \u201cUpon assumption of office, I made it a matter of policy to consult widely and drink from the wealth of experiences of our leaders of thought like you to guide my actions in the course of my assignment.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Character Commission was established with a primary focus of ensuring a strong, virile and indivisible nation, based on fairness, equity and justice, to promote national unity, foster national loyalty and give every citizen of Nigeria a sense of belonging to the nation, notwithstanding the diversities of ethnic origin, culture, language or religion, which may exist.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We need to domesticate the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programmes (NJFP) and need the help of UNDP.\n\n\u201cWe have done the enumeration of businesses locally and have the data of our local businesses.

We have put in place measures to ensure 24 hours loading in all depots.\n\n\u201cThis will ensure that scarcity created by panic buying will now be freed so that normalcy will return to filling stations.\n\n\u201cTypically in situations like this, people go to the fuel stations and buy in excess of what they need and this is what additional supply will resolve. I am very sure that very soon, we will see the relief on this,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari said that neither the Federal Government nor the NNPC had any plan to raise the pump price of petrol.\n\nHe urged marketers to ensure that they sell petrol at the price approved by the government.\n\nHe noted that following the meeting, the stakeholders had agreed that NNPC should carry out necessary sanctions on any marketer found selling petrol above approved price including the refusal to sell PMS to stations or depots.\n\nHe equally noted that the NNPC would carry out necessary sanctions allowed by law on any defaulting depot owner to ensure that Nigerians would continue to buy the product at the approved price.\n\nHe, however, apologised for the pains Nigerians were experiencing at fuel stations and appealed to consumers to avoid panic buying and to buy only the quantity they needed at fuel outlets.",

It is genocide.\u201d\n\nPutin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Moscow has pleaded \u201cself-defense\u201d under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n\nBut that has been roundly rejected by Western countries who accuse Moscow of violating Article 2 of the Charter, requiring UN members to refrain from the threat or use of force to resolve a crisis.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s ambassador to the UN Olof Skoog said the vote was \u201cnot just about Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is about defending an international order based on rules we all have signed up to,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the General Assembly\u2019s message was \u201cloud and clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnd hostilities in Ukraine \u2014 now. Silence the guns \u2014 now,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs bad as the situation is for the people in Ukraine right now, it threatens to get much, much worse. The ticking clock is a time bomb.\u201d\n\nSome delegations chose to place stuffed animals on their tables during the session \u2014 a stark visual reminder of the conflict\u2019s devastating impact on children.\n\nThe text of the resolution \u2014 led by European countries in coordination with Ukraine \u2014 has undergone numerous changes in recent days.\n\nIt no longer \u201ccondemns\u201d the invasion as initially expected, but instead \u201cdeplores in the strongest terms the Russian Federation\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u201d\n\nNearly every General Assembly speaker unreservedly condemned the war.\n\n\u201cIf the United Nations has any purpose, it is to prevent war,\u201d the US ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said during her speech on Wednesday.\n\nShe accused Russia of \u201cpreparing to increase the brutality of its campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield. That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs, which are banned under the Geneva Convention,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said.\n\nRussia\u2019s ally Belarus offered a staunch defense of the invasion, however.\n\nAmbassador Valentin Rybakov blasted sanctions imposed by the West on Russia as \u201cthe worst example of economic and financial terrorism.\u201d\n\nAnd he followed other Russian allies such as Syria in condemning the \u201cdouble standards\u201d of Western nations who have invaded countries including Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan in recent decades.\n\nOther speakers cited fears of a domino effect should Ukraine fall to Russia. Colombia railed against any return to \u201cempire,\u201d while Albania wondered: \u201cWho will be next?\u201d\n\nFrom the Arab world it was Kuwait, itself the victim of an invasion by Iraq in 1990, whose denunciation of Moscow was the most explicit.\n\nChina, India abstain\n\nJapan and New Zealand led condemnation from Asia, but the continent\u2019s giants \u2014 China, India and Pakistan \u2014 all abstained. During the debate Beijing had stressed the world had \u201cnothing to gain\u201d from a new Cold War.\n\nOn the meeting\u2019s sidelines, Washington has taken aim at Russians working at the United Nations, leveling accusations of espionage and demanding expulsions.\n\nUS President Joe Biden asserted Tuesday in his State of the Union address that Putin had underestimated the response to the invasion.\n\n\u201cHe rejected efforts at diplomacy\u2026 And, he thought he could divide us here at home,\u201d Biden said. \u201cPutin was wrong. We were ready,\u201d AFP reported.",

          "title": "Federal Govt Unveils New Approach To Tackle Adult Illiteracy",
          "text": "The federal government has announced a new strategy in the war to eliminate illiteracy and its accompanying malaise among the more than 90 million adult population and about 13 million out-of-school children in the country.\n\nUnveiling the new strategy called Literacy Enroute Economic Empowerment Strategy (LEEDS) at a one-day Strategic Management Meeting in Mararraba, Nasarawa State, on Tuesday, the Executive Secretary of the National Commission for Mass Literacy, Adult and Non-Formal Education, Prof. Simon Ibor Akpama, said the new strategy will emphasise a juxtaposition of the acquisition of basic and post-literacy skills with vocational skills acquisition for the attainment of economic self-reliance.\n\nThe new system, according to Prof. Akpama, will be in addition to existing strategies, namely the Literacy-by-Radio (LBR), the Rural Facilitators\u2019 Scheme (RFS), Each-One-Teach-One and other initiatives, all aimed at facilitating the attainment of the Commission\u2019s mandate of eradicating illiteracy among Nigerians aged 15 years and above.\n\nThe Executive Secretary said the strategic meeting was a \u201cdeliberate introspective innovation aimed at rejigging, resuscitating, reforming and repositioning the Commission\u2019s extant management style for maximum productivity in synchronisation with the Commission\u2019s \u2018sacred illiteracy eradication mandate for overall national development.\u201d\n\nIn the words of the Executive Secretary, \u201cThe introduction of LEEDS is not intended to undermine and emasculate the existing illiteracy eradication methods which have made remarkable impact on the Commission\u2019s literacy delivery trajectory but to integrate the Commission\u2019s major goals, policy thrust, actions and its extant literacy delivery methods into a cohesive whole for improved performance in our service delivery drive.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen functional, LEEDS will offer graduates from both the basic and post-literacy programmes to be provided with relevant kits and starter packs to establish their own businesses such as salons, fashion designing shops and the likes, which will in turn lead to reduction in unemployment and increase in income generation.\n\nThe Executive Secretary, while commending President Muhammadu Buhari and Education Minister, Adamu Adamu, for funding of the Adult and Non-Formal education sector, stated that LEEDS will form the antidote to poverty as it has been empirically proven that mere acquisition of basic and post-literacy skills devoid of economic empowerment tools aggravates poverty with its accompanying deleterious socio-economic consequences.\n\n\u201cOur strategic plan must encapsulate the stated imperatives of the National Commission for Mass Literacy, Adult and Non-Formal Education and unambiguously outline and reassess our preferred routes meant to accomplish the arduous task of illiteracy eradication which constitutes the synopsis of our mission and vision,\u201d Prof. Akpama stated, while calling on the management team to align their capacities, competencies and wealth of experience to ensure the success of the LEEDS strategy.\n\nIt can be recalled that the federal government recently unveiled a plan to educate about two million non-literate Nigerians annually to enable them uplift their status and enable them contribute to national development.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe National Commission for Mass Literacy, Adult and Non-Formal Education was established by Act 17 of June 25, 1990, with a mandate to, among others things, provide basic education to the country\u2019s non-literate adults and youths aged 15 and above through a non-formal approach.",

          "title": "Tambuwal: Making Giant Strides In The Seat of The Caliphate",
          "text": "As he rounds off the third year of his second term in office in three months\u2019 time, Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State could as well begin to roll out the drums ahead of the May 29, 2022 date in celebration of his laudable achievements in the seat of the Caliphate.\n\nSince he was sworn in on May 29, 2019, for the second term, the ebullient and ever-smiling governor has left no one in doubt that he was committed to a broader policy direction for the next four years but also consolidating the gains recorded during his first tenure between 2015 and 2019.\n\nToday, one of the poster boys of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governors has made giant strides towards turning Sokoto to a remarkable state.\n\nTambuwal\u2019s scorecard not just in three years but seven could be seen in all sectors, but more appropriately premised around three critical spheres: Education, Economy and Infrastructure. And instructively, the remarkable improvements in all sectors since he took over as Governor of Sokoto State in 2015 are testaments to his careful policy choices and diligent implementation.\n\nWhen he mounted the saddle in 2015, Tambuwal saw deplorable education indices across the state. He saw that the decay in the educational sector had almost engulfed the state. Thus, he was determined to arrest the ugly situation.\n\nBarely six months after he assumed office he declared a State of Emergency on Education sector in December 2015. Early in the following year, the Right to Education Bill 2016 was signed into law. The new law made education a justiciable right and made it illegal for children to be out of school by the actions of their parents.\n\nFor proper implementation of the new order, the fledgling administration embarked on massive school renovation and building of special schools. These were promptly handed over to the Local Government Councils to manage while the State provided fund.\n\nTambuwal\u2019s transformation in the education sector since 2015 is legendary in Sokoto State. A bird\u2019s eye view:\n\n\u00b7 Between 2016 and 2019, two Junior Secondary Schools were built in each of the 23 Local Government Areas in the state while four Junior Secondary Schools were built in the State Capital.\n\n\u00b7 Renovation of 1500 Primary Schools and 180 Junior Secondary Schools are currently ongoing and have reached over 70% completion.\n\n\u00b7 The administration has consistently provided not below 26% of yearly budget for education. This is above UNESCO\u2019s benchmark of between 15% and 20% for education.\n\n\u00b7 Over 600,000 children have been enrolled in school since 2016 with a consistent rise in the number of children getting back to school. Most importantly Tambuwal\u2019s government has focused on getting more girls into school, improving the lives and chances of women within the state.\n\n\u00b7 Between 2016 and 2017, there was a 4.4% increase in the number of enrolment of girls into primary schools.\n\n\u00b7 The administration created an Agency for Girl Child Education which focuses on getting more girls into school by engaging with their parents and communities on the importance of educating the girl child. Following a combination of community enlightenment and cash backed incentives, there has been a massive increase in the number of enrolment of girls into schools across the state.\n\n\u00b7 The government achieved remarkable increase in enrolment of girls into school with the government constructing more girls only schools across the 23 local government areas.\n\n\u00b7 Government Science Senior Secondary School has been built in grand style across the three senatorial districts which would allow direct entry for girls who had finished from the junior secondary schools within the state.\n\n\u00b7 Barely a year after he took over, the number of girls enrolled at junior secondary schools within the state stood at 71,132 in 2016 compared to 22,021 in 2012.\n\n\u00b7 Enrolment into senior secondary had also increased from 22,755 in 2014 to 27,004 in 2017.\n\n\u00b7 Recognising that early marriage is a setback to girls\u2019 school enrolment, in November 2021, 18 years after the passage of the Child Rights Act 2003, the Sokoto State Government joined the rest of Nigeria in domesticating the Child Rights Act. Tambuwal achieved this after nearly six years of painstaking engagement with stakeholders. This is considered a great feat in the most conservative part of Northern Nigeria, the seat of the Caliphate.\n\nIn the past six years, the Tambuwal Administration has frontally confronted the infrastructure deficit in his State. Before his emergence on the scene, Sokoto and Kebbi States had the lowest levels of access to potable water at 38 percent and 39 percent respectively. But Aminu Tambuwal is deftly tackling the problem.\n\nIn collaboration with the United States Agency for International Development, USAID, the administration has provided safe drinking water for over 30 formal and non-formal primary schools and learning centres in the state. About 700 towns and villages across the 23 local government areas now have potable water. This is in addition to the 1.5 million litre per day of water projects provided in all the headquarters of the 23 local government areas.\n\nThe health sector has received considerable attention as well. Last year, the government inaugurated, launched and completed the multi-billion Naira Sokoto State Advanced Medical Diagnostic Centre in Farufaru. The diagnostics centre was set up to intervene in providing first-rate medical services in the state. It boasts of cutting-edge medical equipment and technologies to rival some of the best across the world.\n\nThe previous year, in late 2020, work commenced on the 1,060 bed space Sokoto State University Teaching Hospital project. Work is ongoing at a very fast pace. The sum of N10 billion has been set aside by the state government for the hospital. Instructively, the Teaching Hospital will be the largest in West Africa. It is linked to three 150-bed capacity new premier hospitals situated in each of the senatorial districts in the state, which are in Binji, Sabon Birni and Tambuwal, and would serve as an accessible referral for patients from the rural areas. Hitherto, the hospitals served the rural demographics at the mercy of primary health care centres or the distant urban hospitals.\n\nGovernor Tambuwal in partnership with the World Bank committed N8.8billion in 10 LGAs to address the perennial erosion, flood and other complex environmental challenges in the state which have affected existing infrastructure and livelihood of the people. The projects include rehabilitation of Lugu dam and Wurno irrigation scheme in Wurno LGA, control of river erosion along the bridge linking Sabon Birni and Niger Republic, construction of medium earth dam at Rafin Duma and Kadassaka area in Gada LGA, and construction of main collector drainage and gutter from Tudun Wada area to River Sokoto in Sokoto South LGA. All the projects have been completed.\n\nOther notable projects include the construction of drainage gutter at Goronyo Dam and construction of earth dam and afforestation activities to mitigate erosion menace in Ungushi District of Kebbe LGA.\n\nSimilarly, other projects are at advanced stages of completion. Among these are construction of drainages, earth dams and land reclamation across multiple locations in Tambuwal LGA; construction of drainages, earth dam, afforestation activities to control erosion of Durbawa in Kware LGA; construction of earth dam, drainage and afforestation activities to check flood and erosion in Sifawa in Bodinga LGA as well as construction of drainage gutters to alleviate flood in Wamakko LGA.\n\nTo improve transportation in the state, many critical economic roads have been completed and these have enhanced economic and social activities in the state. Among these are Bachure \u2013 Falu, 5.6km\u2019 Tambuwal township roads; Tashar Iillela road; Gidan Igwai road; Sokoto Metropolis roads; Ugwamrogo road; Maituta road; Jemeta township roads; dualization of Sultan Ibrahim Dasuki road; Runjin Sambo roads.\n\nOthers include Agaiye, FGC-NNPC \u2013 Mabera Salame; Guiwa low cost; Jaiz Bank; Ubandoma; Tsafe; Katsina; Keystone Bank; Gidado; Bodinga; Justice Ladan Tsamiya, Sani Dingyadi; Barth and State Library roads.\n\nIt is worthy to note that gradually, Governor Aminu Tambuwal is changing the economic landscape of Sokoto State. The 2018- 2019 survey by the National Bureau of Statistics, NBS, placed Sokoto State as the poorest in Nigeria with 87.7% of its population within the poverty basket. With a population of about 5.3 million persons, this means that 4.6 million of its population is poor. Although many people in Sokoto doubt the veracity of this NBS report, given the sample size of 22,110 households used for the survey from a population of over 200 million of the Nigerian populace, the PDP administration is doing a lot to turn things around.\n\nThe current administration has increased internally generated revenue, IGR, by 238% between 2015 and 2020. \u201cThis continuous growth has been very significant. This is a positive mark on the Tambuwal administration,\u201d a government official noted.\n\nAlthough Sokoto\u2019s debt stock has grown significantly, it still remains the second lowest in the country. \u201cThis growth is justified by the significant increase in infrastructure development which the state government is currently undertaking. Having the second lowest debt profile in the country, qualifies the state to be able to take on more loans to allow for further development,\u201d the official said.\n\nFiscal transparency, accountability and sustainability has been a cardinal focus of the Tambuwal Administration. In this respect, the World Bank granted Sokoto State Government $1.5million for its commitment to the implementation of the States\u2019 Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability, SFTAS.\n\nThe state government clinched the grant after its astronomical score in the SFTAS ranking from 2/5 in 2019 to 14/15 in 2020, which puts it among the top three states in the country to achieve such.\n\nNotably, Sokoto is one of the few states in Nigeria to have operationalized its Treasury Single Account, TSA, covering at least 60% of its finances\n\nThe Tambuwal Administration has taken the issue of Ease of Doing Business seriously. In the \u201cStates Ease of Doing Business Survey Results\u201d by PEBEC in collaboration with KPMG Nigeria, Sokoto State scored 6.88. Between 2015 and 2018 the state has implemented reforms making it easier to enforce contracts. Within the period also, the state has fast-tracked commercial dispute resolution by introducing a frontloading procedure as part of its 2015 High Court rules\n\nIt is instructive to note that the Tambuwal administration despite paucity of funds, ensures that workers and pensioners, receive their salary and pensions as at when due.\n\nGovernor Tambuwal\u2019s management of the Covid-19 crisis also marked him out as a leader to watch out for. Even with the meagre resources available to the state, he increased the hazard allowances of health workers in the state by 100 percent. Also, he recalled all the retired health workers in the state: medical doctors, nurses, pharmacists, laboratory attendants, among others to help in the fight against the pandemic.\n\nTo take care of those recalled, Tambuwal directed the state Commissioner for health, Dr. Muhammed Ali Inname, to place all of them on their last salary before retirement.\n\nTo further contain the scourge, the state government launched a volunteer scheme against the spread of Covid-19. Sokoto remains the only state to do so. During the launching of the scheme at the International Conference Centre, Sokoto, Governor Tambuwal disclosed that the proposed allowances to be given to the volunteers would be doubled in appreciation of the workers\u2019 solidarity and selfless service.\n\nSuch deft managerial acumen has ensured that Sokoto is one of the few states where health workers have never for once embarked on either warning or total strike, even for a day since the coming of Tambuwal.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that Aminu Waziri Tambuwal\u2019s outstanding strides in the development of Sokoto State have earned him accolades and awards from many quarters. Among these are the Tribune Platinum Torch Bearer, Silverbird Television Man of the Year, etc.",

          "title": "FirstBank: Championing SMEs\u2019 growth through loan products initiative",
          "text": "\n\nFirst Bank of Nigeria Limited is at the forefront of developing different loan products that suit the needs and growths of SMEs in the country. AMAKA IFEAKANDU looks at the products and their impact on the SMEs and growth of the nation\u2019s economy\n\nIn recent time, the Nigerian government introduced different initiatives to boost activities of the small and medium scale industry in the country.\n\nWith the support of the World Bank and the African Development Bank, the government has assisted SMEs through various credit schemes and loans structured to fund their activities. Some of them are World Bank SME loan scheme, African Development Bank Export Stimulation Loan scheme; CBN Rediscounting and Re-financing Facility, National Economic Reconstruction Fund.\n\nAt different times, the apex bank has come up with intervention funds to enhance SMEs production. Apart from government, there are other ways SMEs can be funded which are through bootstrapping, loans from banks, moneylenders and grants from government institutions and non-governmental institutions. Financial experts are of the view that the reason government\u2019s attention has always been on the small scale enterprises is because the total aggregate of the type of business has the potential for accelerating the pace of economic development of the country and has successfully played positive role in the economic life of Nigerians in the rural areas.\n\nSMEs\u2019 records of low performance\n\nit appears that considering the enormous potentials of the SMEs sector, and despite the acknowledgement of its immense contribution to sustainable economic development, its performance still falls below expectation in many developing countries, including Nigeria. This is because the sector in these developing countries has been bedevilled by several factors. These factors include the unfavourable and very harsh economic conditions resulting from unstable government policies; gross under capitalisation, strained by the difficulty in accessing credits from banks and other financial institutions; inadequacies resulting from the highly dilapidated state of Infrastructural facilities; astronomically high operating costs; lack of transparency and corruption; and the lack of interest and lasting support for the SMEs sector by government authorities.\n\nThese challenges have affected the SMEs\u2019 contributions to the Nigerian Industrial output in particular.\n\nGovernment\u2019s efforts on SMEs growth\n\nIn Nigeria, the current administration and financial institutions are doing everything possible to ensure sustainable growth of the SMEs in the country.\n\nUnder the mortgage industry, the federal government had in the past, come up with different initiative to develop mortgage industry in the country. The federal government set up Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria(FMBN), the National Housing Funds (NHF) and the Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC) with the intention to make housing in the country more affordable.\n\nAlso, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the Nigerian Sovereign investment Authority (NSIA) jointly initiated the creation of Family Home Funds and voted N1 trillion for setting affordable housing for Nigerians with the potential capacity to generate up to 1.5 per cent increase in Gross Domestic Products by 2023.\n\nNMRC, which came up with refinanced mortgage loans totalling N18 billion as at December 2018, explained it was in line with its mandate to promote affordable home ownership in the country.\n\nThe NMRC, had in a statement, said:\u201cThe deployment of the N18 billion to refinance mortgage loan portfolios of member-lending institutions has helped to boost liquidity in the Nigerian housing market, thus enabling mortgage lenders to provide more housing loans and encouraging long-term mortgage loan creation.\u201d\n\nAlthough the deployment of the fund impacted either housing delivery or home-ownership, but it fell short of closing the country\u2019s housing gap. But today some Nigerian banks including First Bank of Nigeria Limited has introduced loan product that will help boost development of commercial mortgaging in the country. It is believed that accessing such fund would go a long way to boost activities in the sector.\n\nPetroleum sector\n\nThe federal government, in partnership with Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), established a N250 billion intervention facility to stimulate finance and motivate investors in the gas value chain for sustainable business development in the country. The fund, according to the permanent secretary, ministry of petroleum resources, Bitrus Nabasu; was designed to improve access to financing for private sector investment in the gas value chain and stimulate investment in the development of infrastructure to optimise the domestic gas resources for economic development.\n\nOther objectives of the facility include providing a platform to fast track the adoption of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as the fuel of choice for transportation and power generation and Liquefied Natural Gas (LPG) for domestic cooking, transportation and captive power.\n\nProvision of loan facilities either from government or financial institutions always help to revive companies struggling to survive.\n\nTransportation Sector\n\nAlso, in its effort to sustain the growth of the SMEs in the transport sector, the federal government recently initiated intervention grant for micro transport operators under its Survival Fund for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The scheme tagged the Transport Track targeted at 4,505 beneficiaries in each state across the country. But the grant is not sufficient enough to close the transportation gap experiencing in the country. Experts are of the view that transport industry has the capacity to generate more revenue to Nigeria if government and financial institutions give them adequate support. Available data showed the Nigerian transport sector accounts for 74 per cent of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) amounting to $27 billion funded projects in the country with an investment gap of about $113 billion.\n\nAgricultural sector\n\nWithout doubt, agriculture remains key to the country\u2019s economic diversification agenda. The CBN has developed different agricultural schemes to sustain growth in the agric sector. Some of the schemes include Agric Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF), Commercial Agriculture credit scheme (CACs), Agricultural Credit Support Scheme (ACSS) and Anchor Borrower Programme. The CBN\u2019s intervention funds in agriculture have helped farmers to some extent increase productivity.\n\nThe Agri-Business/Small and Medium Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS) was also established to support the federal government\u2019s efforts at promoting agricultural business/ Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) as a vehicle for sustainable economic development and employment generation. But with the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has seen the urgent need to diversify its revenue base into non-oil sectors by boosting support to priority sectors of the economy with high potentials to create jobs.\n\nConstruction sector\n\nContract financing is seen as a great way of fulfilling government contracts, and is quite common in the construction sector. It can be seen as a form of working capital finance. Contract financing is a payment solution where the contractor sells an invoice to a contract financing company to receive an advance up to 90 per cent of the invoice amount before the project begins. This provides the company cash flow which can help finance project-related costs, such as inventory and equipment. When the contract is paid by the customer, the contract financing company will send the contractor the remaining amount, less a fee.\n\nFirst Bank\u2019s efforts at promoting SMEs growth\n\nFirst Bank of Nigeria is one of the nation\u2019s banks at the forefront supporting the growth of SMEs in the country. The bank has initiated different products targeted at financing the specific needs of SMEs. Some of the funds can be used for commercial mortgage finance, petroleum distributorship finance, operational vehicle finance, contract finance among others.\n\nCommercial Mortgage\n\nThis facility is designed to meet the funding needs of established small and medium scale enterprises in a viable business with respect to acquiring business premises under the outright purchase or construction scheme.\n\nThe loan attracts 60-month tenor with maximum loan amounting to N100 million while the collateral is the property purchased.\n\nThe beneficiary will also pay management fee of one per cent under a competitive interest rate.\n\nPetroleum Distributorship Finance\n\nThe product is created to provide finance for dealers of fast moving white petroleum products (Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), Dual Purpose Kerosene (DPK), Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), and must possess DPR license and have been in business for at least 24 months.\n\nThe loan has 12-month tenor with flexible collateral and a maximum loan amounting to N120 million. The product has competitive interest rate with the management fee of one per cent.\n\nOperational Vehicle\n\nThis product is initiated to part -finance SMEs vehicles for operational use for day-to-day running of their business such as logistics and distribution. It was put in place to support business growth and expansion by giving beneficiaries the opportunity of purchasing the vehicle with ease.\n\nThe loan has 24 to 36-month tenor depending on the brand of the vehicle. The maximum loan is put at N20 million and above while collateral is the vehicle purchased.\n\nFast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)\n\nThis facility was developed to provide finance for distributors of FMCG companies on the bank\u2019s approved list of principals to support distributors\u2019 working capital requirement for their business expansion. The loan provides opportunity to increase volume of business and meet target set by principals.\n\nThe loan has 12-month tenor with maximum loan totalling N500 million and flexible collateral. The loan attracts flexible and competitive interest rate with the management fee of one per cent.\n\nContract Finance\n\nContract Finance was established to provide structured and controllable funding to eligible SMEs for the execution of contracts for companies listed on the bank\u2019s approved list.\n\nThe fund has 180-day tenor with maximum loan amounting to N50 million and above. It has flexible collateral depending on the nature of contract. Interest rate is flexible and competitive with management fee of one per cent.\n\nIn all, SMEs constitute the driving force of industrial growth and development in the country. The government should focus on and nurture the sector by making funds at low-interest rates more accessible to players in it to help them thrive.",

          "text": "Nigeria and 140 other nations voted against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and demanded the immediate withdrawal of troops from the Eastern European country.\n\nThe decision was reached on Wednesday at the United Nations General Assembly in a powerful rebuke of Moscow\u2019s invasion.\n\nAfter more than two days of extraordinary debate, which saw the Ukrainian ambassador accuse Russia of genocide, 141 out of 193 United Nations member states voted for the non-binding resolution.\n\n\u201cThe world is rejecting Russia\u2019s lies,\u201d US President Joe Biden said in a statement later Wednesday. \u201cRussia is responsible for the devastating abuses of human rights and the international humanitarian crisis that we are watching unfold in Ukraine in real-time.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: One Million Refugees Fled Ukraine In Week \u2013 UNHCR\n\nChina was among the 35 countries which abstained, while just five \u2014 Eritrea, North Korea, Syria, Belarus, and of course Russia \u2014 voted against it.\n\nThe resolution \u201cdeplores\u201d the invasion of Ukraine \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d and condemns President Vladimir Putin\u2019s decision to put his nuclear forces on alert.\n\nThe vote had been touted by diplomats as a bellwether of democracy in a world where autocracy is on the rise and came as Putin\u2019s forces bear down on Kyiv while terrified Ukrainians flee.\n\n\u201cThey have come to deprive Ukraine of the very right to exist,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told the Assembly ahead of the vote.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already clear that the goal of Russia is not an occupation only. It is genocide.\u201d\n\nPutin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Moscow has pleaded \u201cself-defense\u201d under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n\nBut that has been roundly rejected by Western countries who accuse Moscow of violating Article 2 of the Charter, requiring UN members to refrain from the threat or use of force to resolve a crisis.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s ambassador to the UN Olof Skoog said the vote was \u201cnot just about Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is about defending an international order based on rules we all have signed up to,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the General Assembly\u2019s message was \u201cloud and clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnd hostilities in Ukraine \u2014 now. Silence the guns \u2014 now,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs bad as the situation is for the people in Ukraine right now, it threatens to get much, much worse. The ticking clock is a time bomb.\u201d\n\nSome delegations chose to place stuffed animals on their tables during the session \u2014 a stark visual reminder of the conflict\u2019s devastating impact on children.\n\nREAD ALSO: Germany To Deliver More Anti-Aircraft Missiles To Ukraine\n\n\u2018Who Will Be Next?\u2019\n\nThe text of the resolution \u2014 led by European countries in coordination with Ukraine \u2014 has undergone numerous changes in recent days.\n\nIt no longer \u201ccondemns\u201d the invasion as initially expected, but instead \u201cdeplores in the strongest terms the Russian Federation\u2019s aggression against Ukraine.\u201d\n\nNearly every General Assembly speaker unreservedly condemned the war.\n\n\u201cIf the United Nations has any purpose, it is to prevent war,\u201d the US ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said during her speech on Wednesday.\n\nShe accused Russia of \u201cpreparing to increase the brutality of its campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield. That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs, which are banned under the Geneva Convention,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said.\n\nRussia\u2019s ally Belarus offered a staunch defense of the invasion, however.\n\nAmbassador Valentin Rybakov blasted sanctions imposed by the West on Russia as \u201cthe worst example of economic and financial terrorism.\u201d\n\nAnd he followed other Russian allies such as Syria in condemning the \u201cdouble standards\u201d of Western nations who have invaded countries including Libya, Iraq, and Afghanistan in recent decades.\n\nOther speakers cited fears of a domino effect should Ukraine fall to Russia. Colombia railed against any return to \u201cempire,\u201d while Albania wondered: \u201cWho will be next?\u201d\n\nFrom the Arab world it was Kuwait, itself the victim of an invasion by Iraq in 1990, whose denunciation of Moscow was the most explicit.\n\nChina, India Abstain\n\nJapan and New Zealand led condemnation from Asia, but the continent\u2019s giants \u2014 China, India, and Pakistan \u2014 all abstained. During the debate, Beijing had stressed the world had \u201cnothing to gain\u201d from a new Cold War.\n\nOn the meeting\u2019s sidelines, Washington has taken aim at Russians working at the United Nations, leveling accusations of espionage and demanding expulsions.",

He said while the South South and South West have tasted power at the centre, the same cannot be said of the Igbo-dominated South East.\n\n\u201cHow can you say rotation in the North and South, so when it comes to the South, it would be South-West and South-South every time? Is the South East not part of the South? What is the moral we are talking about?\u201d he asked during the show.\n\n\u201cIs it not the South West that has served [through] Obasanjo for eight years, Osinbajo for another eight years as vice president? [The] South-South has served its own. Is the South East not part of the South?

It is because of the heterogeneity of the country; to keep us together that the question of this rotation comes in; to accommodate ourselves as much as possible,\u201d Adebanjo explained.\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to overlook that now? Coming to the South for the 2023 presidential candidate is the equity, moral, and principle, except we are deceiving ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere leader also faulted the just-concluded constitutional amendment by the National Assembly, describing it as insincere.\n\n\u201cThere is no sincerity in the amendment,\u201d he said a day after lawmakers voted on over 60 proposed amendments.\n\nAs far as he is concerned, the amendments did not carry the people along and thus were not a reflection of the true yearnings of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWho are those making the amendment? Those are the beneficiaries of fraud in the Constitution,\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you amending a Constitution you didn\u2019t take part in. Did we make it? What is our input?

          "text": "Roman Abramovich has confirmed reports that he has decided to sell Chelsea with the proceeds going to a charitable foundation benefiting victims of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian-Israeli billionaire has owned the Blues since 2003 and helped steer the Stamford Bridge club to 19 major trophies.\n\nBut the 55-year-old\u2019s glittering reign in west London is close to an end, with a consortium of billionaires already making their interest in a deal public.\n\n\u201cI would like to address the speculation in media over the past few days in relation to my ownership of Chelsea FC,\u2019 read Abramovich\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cAs I have stated before, I have always taken decisions with the Club\u2019s best interest at heart. In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the Club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the Club, the fans, the employees, as well as the Club\u2019s sponsors and partners.\n\n\u201cThe sale of the club will not be fast-tracked but will follow due process. I will not be asking for any loans to be repaid. This has never been about business nor money for me, but about pure passion for the game and Club.\n\n\u201cMoreover, I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated. The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine. This includes providing critical funds towards the urgent and immediate needs of victims, as well as supporting the long-term work of recovery.\n\n\u201cPlease know that this has been an incredibly difficult decision to make, and it pains me to part with the Club in this manner. However, I do believe this is in the best interest of the Club.\n\n\u201cI hope that I will be able to visit Stamford Bridge one last time to say goodbye to all of you in person. It has been a privilege of a lifetime to be part of Chelsea FC and I am proud of all our joint achievements. Chelsea Football Club and its supporters will always be in my heart.\u201d\n\nAbramovich has put Chelsea up for sale but according to sources, will struggle to get the \u00a33billion he wants for the club.\n\nThe oligarch has instructed American bank the Raine Group to handle the sale of the west London side.\n\nSwiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss claims he has been approached ad is considering making an offer as part of a consortium which includes co-owner of the LA Dodgers Todd Boehly, who has shown previous interest in buying the club.\n\nAs revealed by MailOnline on Wednesday morning, Abramovich wants a return of at least \u00a33bn for the Stamford Bridge club.\n\nSources claim Abramovich believes Chelsea is worth north of \u00a33bn \u2013 but the likelihood of receiving such offers appears small.\n\nIndeed, it seems inevitable that the Russian businessman will have to lower his expectations, with doubts emerging that he will receive anywhere near the \u00a33bn he is said to deem acceptable.\n\nChelsea\u2019s debt to Abramovich, who took over the Blues in 2003, currently stands at \u00a31.5bn.\n\nThere is a sense that securing an American buyer might be Abramovich\u2019s best route towards a sale as investment from China, the Far East and Eastern Europe has dried up for clear political reasons.\n\nHowever, Abramovich\u2019s reported links to a Russian regime that has caused so much destruction in Ukraine could lead to reluctance from interested parties to deal with Chelsea.\n\nSimilarly, Chelsea are facing apprehension from rival clubs to deal with them in summer transfer window, or at the very least being hardballed during negotiations.\n\nReports suggest prospective signings are now uneasy about joining Chelsea given Abramovich\u2019s connections with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russian regime, particularly if the businessman remains at the helm.\n\nNevertheless, there has been strong indications that Abramovich will receive at least two firm offers for the club by the end of the week \u2013 but whether the bids are close to the sort of money the tycoon is looking for remains to be seen.\n\nThe danger of a potential buy-out being wrecked by Abramovich being sanctioned by the UK government has added urgency to the situation.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer questioned Boris Johnson in Parliament on why Abramovich hasn\u2019t yet faced sanctions, with the Prime Minister saying: \u201cIt is not appropriate to comment on individual cases at this stage.\u201d\n\nThe Raine Group first acted for Chelsea in 2018 after talks with US private equity firm Silverlake and British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe broke up without reaching an agreement.\n\nThe club has effectively been for sale ever since due to Abramovich\u2019s conflict with the UK government after the Home Office declined to issue him a visa, with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine giving him fresh impetus to sell.\n\nSpeaking to Swiss newspaper Blick, Wyss said: \u201cLike all other oligarchs, he (Abramovich) is also in a panic. Abramovich is trying to sell all his villas in England. He also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly. I and three other people received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea from Abramovich.\n\n\u201cI have to wait four to five days now. Abramovich is currently asking far too much. You know, Chelsea owe him \u00a32bn.\n\n\u201cAs of today, we don\u2019t know the exact selling price. I can well imagine starting at Chelsea with partners. But I have to examine the general conditions first. But what I can already say: I\u2019m definitely not doing something like this alone. If I buy Chelsea, then with a consortium consisting of six to seven investors.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is doubt whether a consortium style takeover would have longevity given the huge financial demands expected at a club the size of Chelsea.\n\nNevertheless, it is clear now that Abramovich is preparing his Chelsea exit strategy.\n\nIt emerged on Tuesday that Abramovich is trying to sell his portfolio of London properties.\n\nit is understood that the Russian has spent time in the United Arab Emirates in recent weeks with a view to transferring part of his wealth there.\n\nEditor",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) on Wednesday issued an interim order to scheduled domestic airline operators, preventing them from, \u201cany increase in airfares and or any conduct not necessarily directly in compliance, but in response to changes in the market on account of a compliance by others,\u201d pending outcome of the commission\u2019s investigation.\n\nThe Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive, FCCPC, Mr. Babatunde Irukera, said though the investigation was at early stages, there were sufficient probable cause to proceed and also provide interim measures to restore a free and undistorted domestic aviation market.\n\nBy the interim order, the operators are required to normalise prices to their prior state before the recent increment.\n\nHe said the commission was in addition to engaging the relevant stakeholders also entering and dispatching interim orders under Sections 17(a),(e),(l),(s),18(3)(a), 157 and 158 of the FCCP Act \u201cprohibiting the performance or continuation of any agreement or arrangement associated with, or resulting from discussions, deliberations, debates, argument or resolutions of/at any meeting of the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) or its members regarding any increase in air fares and or any conduct not necessarily directly in compliance, but in response to changes in the market on account of a compliance by others\u201d.\n\nThe commission, in a statement signed by Irukera, further enjoined scheduled domestic airline operators to ensure strict and prompt compliance with the order.\n\nHe said, a preliminary investigation by the commission had established that the AON held meetings on February 8, 17 and 23, 2022, where decisions to increase airfares were deliberated in violation of guiding regulation.\n\nHe added the instances of price-fixing denotes anti-competition and against FCCPA.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe investigation also confirms that one of the items of discussion during at least one of those meetings was to set base or minimum airfares. The Commission\u2019s understanding from intelligence so far gathered is that there was significant controversy and or an initial lack of consensus with respect to coordinated conduct resulting in setting airfares.\n\n\u201cThe Commission also has credible information that while attendees at the meeting may not have arrived at a consensus, the meeting ended in a resolution that encouraged, permitted or consented to the coordinated conduct.\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s understanding from the deliberations at the meeting is that the attendees engaged in mutual discussions and exchange of their respective revenue management models or other commercially sensitive information.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the FCCPC boss said, \u201cThe FCCPA prohibits conduct or any coordination between competitors including on the platform of trade associations. Specifically, Section 107 (1)(a) forbids competitors from fixing prices, and Section 108 prohibits any conspiracy, combination, agreement or arrangement between competitors in any manner that unduly restrains or injures competition. Coordination in increasing prices (otherwise known as cartel) is an unambiguous infringement of the FCCPA.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of the discussions and or resolution at the meeting, certain champions of the coordinated conduct of imposing a base fare or a Minimum Re-Sale Price (MRSP) for their services in a coordinated and contemporaneous manner proceeded to increase their fares to a minimum of N50,000 across all sectors. Specifically, Air Peace, Azman Air and United Nigeria Airlines immediately proceeded with the increase. Arik followed.\n\n\u201cHowever, on Friday, February 18, 2022 at 6:31 p.m. Aero Contractors informed its trade partners (travel agents) and its commercial executive team by email that ticket fares were reviewed effective February 18, 2022 with the least fare being N50,000 across all routes. Aero Contractors noted in this communication that all other airlines have effected same increase.\n\n\u201cWithin days, Max Air also increased fares to the same minimum N50,000. Ibom Air and Dana approximately 48 hours after what appears to be the initial coordinated conduct, also increased fares although not to the purported N50,000 minimum.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria to Save $1.8bn in Forex as Dangote, NNPC, Shell, Others Sign Gas Supply Deal",
          "text": "The Dangote Group, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Shell, Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) Limited, Total Energies as well as the Gas Aggregation Company of Nigeria (GACN) yesterday signed a Gas Sale and Aggregation Agreement (GSAA) in Abuja.\n\nThe agreement which took place on the sidelines of the ongoing Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES), THISDAY learnt would see the companies supply 70 million standard cubic feet per day of natural gas to Dangote Fertiliser Limited (DFL) to ramp up operations at the plant.\n\nNatural gas is a feedstock of the Dangote Fertiliser plant, with the gas supply agreement expected to guarantee the availability of the major raw material needed to run the plant.\n\nThe deal coincided with a statement by the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), releasing a new Domestic Gas Demand Requirement (DGDR) for 2022, and pegging the figure at 4.4 billion standard cubic feet for the country.\n\nNigeria represents one of Africa\u2019s heavyweights when it comes to hydrocarbon exploration and production, with over 206 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, but has a huge gas supply deficit despite rising demand.\n\nThe African Energy Chamber (AEC) recently put Nigeria\u2019s annual production capacity of gas at 1.450 billion cubic feet, as the country recovers from 2020 low production levels due to COVID-19.\n\nBut despite boasting of huge reserves and topping major countries, Nigeria\u2019s per capita consumption of gas, Nigeria\u2019s Ministers of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, recently lamented, remains one of the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nBut speaking during the contract-signing event which was witnessed by the chief executives of all the organisations, the Founder of the Dangote Group and Africa\u2019s richest person, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, said the deal would save the country a whopping $1.8 billion in foreign exchange.\n\nDangote stated that aside Egypt, Nigeria was the topmost fertiliser producer in Africa, explaining that the Dangote plant, Notore and the one belonging to Indorama have a huge combined production capacity on the continent.\n\nThe business magnate explained that aside meeting the domestic demand for fertiliser, the Dangote group was working hard to ensure that Nigeria retains a large chunk of its foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the Group Managing Director (Mallam Mele Kyari) for his leadership. Without him, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. I also want to commend Shell, and most of all Bala Wunti (Group General Manager, National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) for pushing and making sure this becomes a reality.\n\n\u201cThis additional gas will help bring in more foreign exchange into the country, especially with the current energy crisis. With our fertiliser plant, Notore, and Indorama, we are second in Africa. Apart from Egypt, no other African country has our capacity.\n\n\u201cWe will meet domestic market and also export and we are talking about $1.8 billion (savings) in terms of foreign exchange coming into the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nKyari said the contract was perfected within a short period based on its importance to the production of fertaliser and agro-economic growth of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, Dangote fertiliser is one of the biggest producers of fertiliser and this deal, which is to offer 70m scuf per day to Dangote fertiliser by the JV, will contribute to the surge of fertaliser production in Nigeria. Of course, it will tremendously be positive to our agro-economy,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nAlso speaking, Managing Director of the Shell Petroleum Development Company and Country Chair, Shell Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Osagie Okunbor, described the agreement as the fastest GSAA ever in the country.\n\nHe commended the partners for working under serious pressure to ensure that the deal was struck, noting that it remains hugely important for the country.\n\nHe explained that the current government takes agricultural production very seriously, noting that as the company which produces the bulk of Nigeria\u2019s fertilisers, the Dangote group was well positioned for the deal.\n\nMeanwhile, a statement earlier signed by the NMDPRA Chief Executive, Mr Farouk Ahmed, noted that the newly released national gas requirement was jointly determined by all the relevant stakeholders.\n\nHe stressed that the data was transmitted to the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) on Tuesday, with the power sector need pegged at 2.324 billion standard cubic feet per day.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the gas-based industries were fixed at 1.125 billion standard cubic feet per day and the commercial sector was set at 1.034 billion standard cubic feet per day while the total domestic gas demand requirement was 4.482 billion standard cubic feet per day,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe noted that the document would help the NUPRC to prescribe and allocate the domestic gas delivery obligation among all lessees as stipulated in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021.\n\nThe downstream authority added that the stakeholders consulted included gas producing companies, gas transportation companies, gas off-takers and key regulators such as the NUPRC and Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC).\n\nIt added that the organisation was obligated to determine the domestic gas demand requirement which shall be the total amount of marketable natural gas required for all wholesale customers of the strategic sectors.\n\nNNPC Restate Need for Full Deregulation of Downstream Petroleum Sector\n\nHowever, concerned about prices Nigeria pays for subsidising petrol consumption, the NNPC and marketers of petroleum products have re-echoed the need for full deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector in the country.\n\nThey said that deregulating the sector and allowing market forces to determine the price of petrol would boost the country\u2019s domestic refining capacity as more investors would be willing to invest in building refineries.\n\nSpeaking at a session yesterday at the NIES 2022, Group Executive Director, Refining, NNPC, Mr. Mustapha Yakubu, argued that full deregulation of the downstream sector would encourage the establishment of more modular and condensate refineries in the country.\n\nYakubu said the NNPC has the mandate to protect Nigeria\u2019s energy security and would continue to support efforts geared towards adding value to the nation\u2019s crude oil production.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe believe that there is need to improve our domestic refining capacity. That is why the NNPC is embarking on total rehabilitation of our four refineries and not just the usual Turn Around Maintenance.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have locally refined products after the completion of the rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cWe also have the Dangote Refinery coming up in Lagos while the Waltersmith Refinery in Imo is already in operation.\n\n\u201cOther modular and condensates refineries are coming up, and NNPC is supporting private investors in establishing them.\u201d\n\nThe NNPC GED appealed to Nigerians to show understanding with the NNPC due to the lingering scarcity of PMS across the country, adding that efforts were being made to resolve the issue.\n\nImmediate-past Chairman of Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) and Managing Director of 11 Plc, Mr. Tunji Oyebanji, said the postponement of the full deregulation of the downstream sector was a huge setback to the industry.\n\nOyebanji said liberalisation of the sector would enable investors across the value chain to have adequate returns on their investments, which was the goal of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nLending his voice, Chief Executive of OVH Energy Marketing Limited, Mr. Huub Stokman, said increasing Nigeria\u2019s domestic refining capacity would change the country\u2019s economic landscape.\n\nHe noted that the current challenge with the scarcity of petrol was a clear indication that Nigeria needed a good emergency plan going forward.\n\nOn his part, Executive Director, Rainoil Limited, Mr. Emmanuel Omuojine, said removing subsidy on petrol would add significant value to Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange reserves on the macroeconomic level.\n\nHe said deregulation of the sector would increase competition, operational efficiency, mergers and acquisitions, increase incentives to invest and capital investment inflow.",

          "text": "As scarcity of premium motor spirit (petrol) persists, causing long vehicle queues at filling stations so is the scarcity of Jet A1 (aviation fuel) at airports, as airlines are now forced to wait for supply before airlifting passengers.\n\nThis has been causing flight delays and sometimes cancellations when airlines wait and don\u2019t get supply, a situation that became worse on Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Azman Air cancelled its Lagos-Abuja afternoon flight when it couldn\u2019t get fuel to operate the flight, while Dana Air five aircraft were parked at the domestic terminal of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos, known as MMA2.\n\nOrdinarily, at that period of the day aircraft are rarely parked at domestic terminals, except the few that would be boarding flights.\n\nFindings by THISDAY revealed that all the airlines experienced flight delays on Tuesday due to their inability to fuel their aircraft. Air Peace, Ibom Air, Azman Air, Arik Air and Dana Air operated their flights behind schedule.\n\nSpokesman of one of the major domestic airlines told THISDAY that not only that there had been further increase in the price of the product, in Lagos it is sold at about N440 per litre, N500 per litre in Abuja. In addition to that; there is variation in the prices, as some marketers sell the product higher than others.\n\nAlso because of the scarcity of the product, some of the marketers have changed their policy whereby airlines buy aviation fuel and pay after few days. Now, they insist airlines must buy the product cash and carry.\n\nThe Communications Manager of Dana Air, Kingsley Ezenwa, told THISDAY that non-availability of aviation fuel was contributing to flight delays and affecting all airlines, expressing hope that the hiccups would be a passing phase.\n\nSpokesman of United Nigeria Airlines, Archiless Uchegbu told THISDAY that with the increase in the prices of aviation fuel and its scarcity, on-time performance of airlines has been impaired. Speaking on phone from Enugu, he told THISDAY that in the coal city passengers were waiting for their flights but there were delays because the airlines could not source the product, but expressed hope that the scarcity would not linger for long time; otherwise, it would paralise flight operations in the country.\n\nAlso, Head of Communications, Arik Air, Mr. Adebanji Ola, told THISDAY that for the past two weeks, airlines have been finding it difficult to source aviation fuel, but said he could not confirm whether marketers insist on cash and carry before selling the product.\n\nThe aviation fuel scarcity has exacerbated flight delays that have encumbered domestic flight operations in Nigeria and driven further the air of hopelessness, as passengers wait for several hours before they board their flights.\n\nOn Tuesday, THISDAY visited the departure lounge of MMA2 and felt the anxiety and uncertainty on the countenance of the passengers who were waiting, not knowing whether they would travel or not or when they would travel.",
