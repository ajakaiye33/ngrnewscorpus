          "title": "2023: Inaugurate NDDC Board, save APC in Niger Delta \u2014 Party members tell Buhari",
          "text": ".\n\n\u2026accuse Akpabio of setting party back in Niger Delta\n\nBy Festus Ahon, ASABA\n\nNIGER Deltans under the aegis of Committed members of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Tuesday, implored President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the party to save Niger Delta region from its sorry state by inaugurating the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC Board of Dr Pius Odubu and Olorogun Bernard Okumagba, which was confirmed by the Senate since November 2019 so as to win back the trust of the people of the region.\n\nThe APC members in a letter to President Muhammadu Buhari and leadership of the APC sigbed by Ebibomo Akpoebide, Menegbo Nwinuamene and Itam Edem, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to comply with the law setting up the NDDC, insisting that inauguration of a substantive Board for the Commission would \u201censure accountability, checks and balances, probity and equitable representation of the nine constituent states\u201d.\n\nThe people in the letter, said; \u201cMr President, we implore you to now rise to the occasion to save the Niger Delta region from this sorry state, from those who have deliberately decided to exacerbate the palpable tension in the region.\n\n\u201cKindly heed the call of Niger Delta leaders, governors, youths, women, traditional rulers, civil society organisations, and other stakeholders, comply with the law setting up NDDC, and also fulfill your own promise of June 24, 2021, and inaugurate the board of the Commission to ensure accountability, checks and balances, probity and equitable representation of the nine constituent states.\n\n\u201cThis, Mr. President, is the minimum your government and the APC can do to win back the trust of the Niger Delta people. A first step, Mr. President, is to immediately reset the leadership at the NDDC to conform with the law by inaugurating the Governing Board of the Commission, which has been confirmed by the Senate and has been on standby since 2019 following Akpabio\u2019s endless shenanigans.\n\n\u201cAs Niger Deltans and committed members of the APC we write to express our disappointment with how the Niger Delta has been treated by our APC government since 2019 when Senator Godswill Akpabio was appointed as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs.\n\n\u201cWe dare say that Chief Godswill Akpabio, a two-time governor of Akwa Ibom State and Senator until 2018 under the PDP, came to our party as a fifth columnist to destroy the APC and reverse the bold moves to cement the party in the Niger Delta states.\n\n\u201cHe has set the party back in many respects but we are hopeful that with concerted efforts by stakeholders we can regain our footholds before the next general election, which is very crucial. This is why we are glad that his resignation offers a chance to correct the ills and win back the trust of our people.\n\n\u201cThe resignation of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Akpabio, offers your administration the opportunity to reboot and reclaim its connection with the Niger Delta people after three years of the former Minister\u2019s disastrous manipulation of the NDDC, which has angered all stakeholders in the region.\n\n\u201cHis tenure has been the most disastrous for the people of the oil producing states who make up the NDDC. He has been especially disagreeable even in advancing the interests of the people of our region, not to talk of the damage he has done to your reputation and the APC among the people, especially the voting population.\n\n\u201cMr. President, please reboot and correct the ills committed by Chief Akpabio and make amends for the damage done to the APC in the region. As it stands, the APC cannot win an election in the region except these missteps are remedied.\n\n\u201cMatter of fact, a group, The Niger Delta Rescue Movement (NDRM) has already vowed not to back the APC in the 2023 elections following the delay to inaugurate a substantive board of the NDDC. The spokesman of NRDM, Jonathan Okwa, speaking in Yenagoa, Bayelsa state, stated that following the prolonged delay of President Buhari to give the Niger Delta people what is rightfully theirs, in accordance with the law, the NDDC Act, the group would ensure the mobilisation of the people of Niger Delta region to vote against the APC in the 2023 presidential and general elections if the board is not inaugurated. Chief Akpabio\u2019s actions have indeed imperilled our party in the Niger Delta States.\n\n\u201cMay we remind you of the trajectory of Akpabio\u2019s mischief. In October 2019, in exercise of your powers as spelt out in the NDDC Act of 2000, you, President Buhari appointed a Board for the NDDC which was duly confirmed by the Nigerian Senate on November 5, 2019. Through subterfuge, before the board could be inaugurated, Akpabio came up with the idea of an audit to be supervised by an interim management, so the Board was asked to be on standby for inauguration after a forensic audit originally planned to last three months.\n\n\u201cAkpabio then ill-advised you and came up with a grand scheme to suspend the inauguration of the board which was confirmed by the Nigerian Senate on November 5, 2019 and instead employed some interim officials in breach of the NDDC Act, people he relied on to fleece the NDDC of its resources and the NDDC nine constituent states of their commonwealth through an orchestrated scheme to conjure an unending audit of the Commission.\n\n\u201cFrom three months, he extended the audit to last two years! After contrived delays over two years, the report of the forensic audit of the Niger Delta Development Commission was finally submitted to you, Mr. President on September 2, 2021, eight months ago, yet the substantive Board you unequivocally promised to inaugurate is yet to be inaugurated.\n\n\u201cWe recall, Mr. President, that specifically on June 24, 2021, while receiving the leadership of Ijaw National Congress (INC) at the State House in Abuja, you promised that the NDDC Board would be inaugurated as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted.\n\n\u201cAt that occasion, you said that \u2018Based on the mismanagement that had previously bedeviled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021. I want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated.\u2019\n\n\u201cOur dear President, not only have you not fulfilled your promise eight months after, the INC which you received in audience when you made the above promise to Nigerians has been compelled to describe the delay in the inauguration of the NDDC Board as a \u2018clear betrayal of trust and display of state insensitivity on the Ijaw nation and Niger Delta region.\u2019\n\n\u201cDespite further assurances that the submission of the report would see to the inauguration of the board, it has not ended the delays, manipulations and hijacking of the NDDC by vested interests. This foremost federal government agency set up to right the wrongs in the Niger Delta over the years is still being run by a sole administrator appointed in breach of the NDDC Act.\n\n\u201cSadly, for a government that prides itself for adherence to rule of law, this administration conversely continues to administer the NDDC in flagrant violation of the NDDC Act. As a Commission established in 2000 by an Act of Parliament, the ongoing national embarrassment at NDDC should be of grave concern to you, Mr. President, about your legacy when you leave office in 2023 and thereby should persuade you to put an end to the illegality of further administering NDDC with a Sole Administrator that is not known to the law setting-up the Commission.\n\n\u201cIt may also interest you to know that there has been a pattern of illegalities instituted by the current administration to undermine accountability at the NDDC in a way that no other federal agency has been so treated in the last seven years of the Buhari Presidency. In the 15-year history of the NDDC, prior to your administration coming in 2015, an interim appointment had never been made outside of the law, even when the Governing Boards were dissolved.\n\n\u201cPrior to your coming to power in 2015, in the absence of a Board duly constituted in line with the NDDC Act, the most senior Civil servant in the NDDC took over as Managing Director in acting capacity for a brief period until a Board was constituted in line with the NDDC Act. The NDDC Act does not permit the appointment of any external persons from outside the Commission to act as Managing Director or Sole Administrator without compliance with the Act which requires nomination by the President and Confirmation by the Senate.\n\n\u201cThis is the same requirement for Ministers of the Federal Republic. The Law does not permit for anyone to be appointed as Acting Minister in any Ministry. If there is no Minister in a Ministry, the most senior civil servant \u2013 i.e. the Permanent Secretary holds forth until a Minister is appointed by the President and duly confirmed by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe orderly succession in NDDC was only breached in 2015 when your Administration dissolved the Bassey Henshaw led Board with Dan Abia as Managing Director, and appointed Mrs. Ibim Semenitari as Sole Administrator, a position she held illegally for over one year. The illegality in NDDC continued in January 2019 when the two-year old Victor Ndoma-Egba led Board was dissolved and replaced with an Interim Management team led by Professor Nelson Brambaifa.\n\n\u201cIt was not until August of 2019 that your government ended the illegal Brambaifa interim management team and then, in accordance with the law establishing NDDC, forwarded the list of nominees for the NDDC Governing Board to the Senate for confirmation, and then dutifully appointed the most senior civil servant at that time in NDDC, Mrs. Akwaghagha Enyia, as Acting Managing Director pending the Senate confirmation of the President\u2019s nominees as NDDC Board members, which list you, Mr. President personally signed and forwarded to the Senate on October 18, 2019.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately again this administration relapsed to its recourse to illegality in administering NDDC, because as the Senate dutifully screened and confirmed the nominees sent by you in exercise of your powers, as Board and Management of NDDC on November 5, 2019, this same government under the obvious manipulation of Chief Akpabio who has previously boasted that the NDDC was his \u2018settlement\u2019 for joining the APC, embarked on another spree of interim managements/sole administrator contraptions, while the Board confirmed by the Senate has been on hold since November 2019.\n\n\u201cSince October 2019 this government has appointed two interim management teams led by Joi Nunieh and Professor Keme Pondei, respectively, and presently the Commission is led by a Sole Administrator, Effiong Akwa.\n\n\u201cIt may interest you to know, Mr. President, that under the illegal interim managements/sole administrator contraptions, the combined two-year budgets for 2019 and 2020, as approved by the National Assembly was N799 Billion. Yet, as pointed out by Professor Benjamin Okaba, President of INC, under the interim management/sole administrator contraptions, \u201cover N600bn payments have been made for emergency contracts without due process; the 2020 budget was passed in December and N400bn was voted for the NDDC but the commission had spent over N190bn before the budget was passed, thereby violating the Procurement Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet, for all the big money spent by the interim managements under Akpabio\u2019s control not one naira has been spent on critical infrastructure in the Niger Delta states. Federal roads and other facilities are in terrible shape.\n\n\u201cWe also recall the Senate probe of NDDC in June/July of 2020 which revealed how the NDDC Interim Management Committee (IMC) appointed by Chief Godswill Akpabio blew N81.5 billion in just a couple of months in breach of extant financial and public procurement laws for which the Senate passed a resolution recommending that the IMC should refund the sum of N4.923 Billion to the Federation Account, and that the IMC should be disbanded, while the substantive board should be inaugurated to manage the Commission in accordance with the law.\n\n\u201cWe recount the November 2021 protest by the Association of Contractors of the Niger Delta Development Commission (ACNDDC) when the Chairman of ACNDDC, Joe Adia stated that the Commission \u2018pays N800 million each for so-called desilting jobs and yet contractors being owed N5 million you have refused to pay?\u2019 in addition to the doubly-restated scandal, earlier this year, involving the illegal sole administrator contraption in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) when the Ijaw Youth Council (IYC) alleged that \u2018illegal N20bn payment was made to ghost contractors over phantom jobs for phony distilling contracts purportedly awarded by the NDDC.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government, by its numerous illegal actions in the NDDC in the last three years has been de-marketing the APC in the Niger Delta region. In an article, \u2018NDDC: Buhari\u2019s Legacy of Illegality and Contempt,\u2019 by Godspower Tamunosusi, published in a national daily on December 13, 2021 and in many other national newspapers, he stated that \u2018Niger Deltans are very upset with the disdainful manner the region has been treated.\u2019 He also noted that there is increasing anger against the APC in the Niger Delta region \u2018as a result of the very poor, biased, illegal and provocative actions of the Federal Government in the handling of matters concerning the NDDC and the Niger Delta region.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe want to draw the attention of the President, the federal government and the APC to the danger in continuing with this interim contraption as this administration winds down. The NDDC Act, provides that each of the nine oil producing states have a representative on the board. In addition, there is one representative for all oil producing companies in the country and one person each from non-oil-producing geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cAll the members of the Board listed above are on part time basis as clearly stated in Section 2(3) of the NDDC Act. The only full time members of the Board as clearly stipulated in the NDDC Act are three \u2013 the Managing Director and two Executive Directors \u2013 who are responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Commission. However, for close to three years this has been ignored by the Buhari Administration. This has given rise to tension in the Niger Delta region.\n\n\u201cAgainst the relentless legitimate demands of stakeholders, it is in our best interest to keep a good legacy by abiding by the law establishing NDDC, especially as we are in a contest to select your successor. The government\u2019s breach of the laws guiding the establishment of an agency created to develop an impoverished region is not in good taste, especially when it looks like the audit was a smokescreen for Akpabio and the cabal backing him to fleece the resources meant for our people\u201d.",
          "summary": "\u201cThis, Mr. President, is the minimum your government and the APC can do to win back the trust of the Niger Delta people.\n\u201cAs Niger Deltans and committed members of the APC we write to express our disappointment with how the Niger Delta has been treated by our APC government since 2019 when Senator Godswill Akpabio was appointed as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs.\nChief Akpabio\u2019s actions have indeed imperilled our party in the Niger Delta States.\n\u201cAll the members of the Board listed above are on part time basis as clearly stated in Section 2(3) of the NDDC Act.\nThis has given rise to tension in the Niger Delta region.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Musa Na Annabi Sokoto\n\nSome clerics in Sokoto State have called on Nigerians to consider credibility and experience in the forthcoming 2023 general elections.\n\nA cross section of them told our correspondent on Sunday, in Sokoto that it was necessary for the nation to have credible, pious and committed leaders.\n\nProfessor Sani Sagir of Physics Department, Usmanu Danfodio University, Sokoto, described leadership as a \u201dresponsibility that required able person who is healthy, physically and mentality fit, intelligent and experience.\u201d\n\nSagir, who is also the Chief Imam of Maikilishi Jumaat Mosque, in Sokoto and also the National Vice President 1, Jama\u2019atu Izalatul Bid\u2019a wa Iqamatul Sunna stressed the need for matured mind in place of leadership.\n\n\u201dI pity those who are coming out to contest at this crucial situation of Nigeria.\n\n\u201dLeadership is very hard talk, especially in Nigeria, because of insecurity, economic instability and lack of unity.\n\n\u201dNigeria needs a very good leader with experience, good political will, someone that means well for the country, not someone that will steal public funds.\n\n\u201d A person that will do the right thing, not minding what people will say, as far as it is right and acceptable decision, because as a leader you need to be courageous in doing the right thing always.\n\n\u201d These are the kind of leaders we want at the moment. Now if you look at President Muhammad Buhari, he immensely tried in various sectors, however, because of age, so many things are needed,\u201d he said.\n\nSagir explained that the vice-president had been proactive though he is not young in recognition of his age as well.\n\nAccording to him, vice-president to complement President efforts is desirable in leadership to have good and viable subordinates.\n\nHe said the President needed ministers and advisers that are proactive and help him like vice-president to achieve more.\n\nAlso speaking with our correspondent Sheikh Muhammad Talata-Mafara, said \u201da good leader is a person with peoples\u2019 interests at heart, piety and submits himself to improving their living standard.\u201d\n\nTalata-Mafara, a renowned Islamic scholar, who translated many Islamic books, especially those written by Sheikh Usman Bin Fodio, cautioned Nigeians against money politics and selfishness.\n\nHe called on Nigerians to consider capability and achievements in supporting any presidential aspirant and other people seeking elective positions.\n\nSheikh Bilal Jabir-Elkanawy, called on Nigerians to ensure transparency and fairness at the electioneering, while delegates should vote for the most credible candidates at the primaries.\n\nJabir-Elkanawiy said, \u201dselling votes against their conscience to the highest bidders or moneybags is dangerous and it is against Islam.\n\n\u201cThe credibility of representatives in government starts with pre-election activities that herald the general elections.\n\n\u201cNigerians need to chose a credible candidate, if political parties fail to chose credible candidates from the primaries, for the masses to make their choices during the general elections in 2023.\n\n\u201d I want to urge all delegates and Nigerians to vote wisely, because of their children, their relatives and for the interest of our great nation, Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cleric described Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo \u201das a leader whose excellence in academics covers most disciplines and relevant to modern development, to tackle the challenges of the nation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, people have not witnessed any quarrels or serious misunderstanding with his principal and he is attested to be loyal.\n\n\u201d His vastness in understanding the diverse challenges and how to nip them in bud for a unified Nigeria, through his knowledge on law and humanitarian act was sacrosanct to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need to also eliminate vote buying completely from our elections, which is abhorred by the religion.\n\n\u201dI urge the delegates and electorate to shine their eyes and not vote the wrong candidates, because of money,\u201d Jabir-Elkanawiy said.\n\nAnother scholar, Malam Abdulmalik Bello-Gado, described Osinbajo as a loyal and dedicated Vice-President, with qualifications Nigerians needed in view of his experience.\n\nBello-Gado, a Deputy Imam of Gagi community, urged Nigerians to vote with their conscience and steer clear from money politics.",

          "text": "The National Home Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP) is one of the National Social Investment Programmes (NSIP) initiated by the President Muhammadu Buhari administration in 2016. I\n\nt is presently supervised by the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development (FMHADMSD). Despite challenges, the ministry has encouraged the enrollment of pupils in schools nationwide, with about 10 million primary one to three pupils fed daily in public schools across the country. AJUKA OKAH reports.\n\nIn the face of hardship, growing poverty, debilitating economy, occasioned by years of poor policies and mismanagement of the nation\u2019s resources, the greatest challenge of many families has been how to cater for their children, especially feeding.\n\nA visit to the market in any state across the federation has proven that feeding, which is number one in the basic necessities of life, is no longer as affordable as it was decades ago, as a result of inflation and rising cost of living.\n\nBearing in mind the growing poverty in Nigeria, after his election in 2015, the President Muhammadu Buhari administration initiated the National Social Investment Programmes in 2016 which was then under the Office of the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, but was later transferred to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development (FMHADMSD) in 2019, shortly after the creation of the ministry.\n\nWith the appointment of Sadiya Umar Farouq as the pioneer minister, President Buhari gave marching orders for the ministry to oversee the amelioration of the suffering of Nigerians, especially disaster victims, and to lift as many citizens as possible from the shackles of poverty through the numerous agencies under the ministry, with the popular National Home Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP) restructured to ensure that the feeding of primary one to three pupils in in public schools across the federation was seamless.\n\nThe School Feeding Programme\n\nFrom inception in 2016, the NHGSFP had the core objectives of increasing school enrolments, participation and completion, improvement of nutritional status of beneficiaries and stimulation of the local economy through the school feeding value chain, with over 127,000 cooks presently engaged in the programme, along with 100 aggregators mopping up protein items.\n\nAlso, thousands of other service providers in the school feeding value-chain are effectively participating in the production, processing, preparation and delivery of these free meals to the targeted beneficiaries.\n\nCurrently, the total number of children enrolled in the programme stands at 9, 990, 862 million (about 10 million) in over 53,000 schools of which most pupils have so far been verified and captured on the NHGSFP database, in line with the ministry\u2019s on-going efforts at establishing a verifiable database of beneficiaries across all of its programmes and interventions.\n\nThe program, at its core, is designed to address poverty in all its forms in collaboration with the Federal Government (through FMHADMSD) and State Governments, where the FMHADMSD is responsible for the release of funds, guidelines, policies, and monitoring, while the State carries out the day-to-day implementation, including procurement of food items, selection of cooks and vendors who prepare, cook and service of the meals to the pupils.\n\nRight from its introduction in 2016, the benefits of the NHGSFP and its impact on the lives and livelihoods of individuals, groups and communities are numerous. While addressing cross cutting issues of hunger, malnutrition and poverty, it has been encouraging school enrolment.\n\nFeeding cost\n\nWhen the NHGSFP was introduced by the federal government in 2016, school pupils were fed with N70 per child for 20 days in the schools that had enrolled in the programme, with the successes recorded in the implementation encouraging more states to enrol.\n\nHowever, with cases of inflation recorded with each passing year, it became evident that N70 was no longer feasible in feeding the school children, with vendors crying out to the federal government for increment.\n\nExpectedly, President Muhammadu Buhari recently approved an upward review in the feeding cost from N70 to 100 per child, in order to encourage the cooks and vendors and also prevent a case of malnutrition that would sabotage the successes recorded since the commencement of the programme.\n\nHowever, the N100 per child feeding is yet to kick off as the children are still being fed at N70 meal per child as of the time of filing this report.\n\nNevertheless, while addressing journalists in Abuja on Tuesday, NHGSFP team lead, Aishatu Digil, gave a breakdown of the cost of feeding 9, 990, 862 pupils with N100 everyday for 20 days in a month.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe were feeding school children with N70 per child, per meal. This was since 2016, but the president has approved N100 upward review. The breakdown of the N100 is as follows: N70 is for the cost of all food items (except egg), N14 for the cost of one egg per week to be implemented through the state structures in partnership with Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN). N10 stipends for cooks, N5 and N6 for micronutrient fortification, payable to cooks and one naira for quality assurance, payable to supervisors, which is optional.\n\n\u201cWe are planning of having \u2018Egg Wednesday\u2019, where each child in the programme will be given one egg every Wednesday. We have stakeholders like the World Food Programme, National Bureau of Statistics, National Orientation Agency (NOA), Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), Ministries of Agriculture, Education and others to deliberate on the modalities of disbursements.\n\n\u201cWe are here basically to look at how best we can realise the benefits of the programme based on the new approved cost to improve the standard and quality of the meal and menu for the children.\u201d\n\nFeasibility of feeding a child with N100\n\nOne factor militating against the feeding of school children is the cost of the implementation as a result of the rising cost of living.\n\nIt is no longer news that prices of food items are increasing on a daily basis, with those surviving on a dollar per day classified among those living in abject poverty.\n\nWhile N100 is better than the N70 presently being used to feed each pupil, the reality is that it is not enough as N100 can barely buy anything edible in the present economy, let alone being depended on to feed school children.\n\nSpeaking with this reporter on the NHGSFG, a school teacher in the FCT, Mrs Funke Adebayo, said that the federal government should be applauded for implementing the programme, though the cost is still very low.\n\nShe said: \u201cI came across a publication on social media where Nigerians were criticizing the federal government on the amount of money they felt is too much to spend on feeding school children. To them feeding 10 million children with 10 billion naira is too much. I just laughed at their ignorance knowing that many of them are not even aware that the money is too low for the number of children the federal government feeds on a regular basis.\n\n\u201cIf we are to do the maths, N100 is not enough to feed a child. The breakdown of 10 billion naira for 10 million people is just N100 per child. If you visit any roadside buka, a plate of rice is between N400 to N500. If you want to buy snacks, you have to spend more than N200. Egg alone is between N70 to N100. Even now, you can hardly get a corn for N100, let alone noodles.\n\n\u201cWhat Nigerians should be more concerned about should be to prevail on the federal government to increase the cost of feeding the children to even N200, because of the realities on ground. The nutrition of the children should be paramount. I don\u2019t even know the magic the facilitators are doing or how the cooks manage to feed children with only N70. It is mindboggling. This is where the minister of Humanitarian Affairs deserves accolades.\u201d\n\nPupils\u2019 confessions, commendations\n\nDespite the challenges in the implementation of the NHGSFG, it has been attracting commendations from many Nigerians, especially school pupils, who are hoping that it will continue even after Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nSpeaking with our reporter, a primary three pupil of the LEA Primary School, Utako, Abuja, Musa Bello, said the school feeding programme has encouraged him to come to school on a daily basis.\n\nHe said, \u201cEveryday I come to school, I will eat rice, beans or Indomie. It makes me come to school every day because there must be something to eat. Sometimes we don\u2019t eat in the house before coming to school because I am sure of getting food. Since I started schooling here, there is no day I don\u2019t get food whenever I am in school.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to President Muhammadu Buhari for the programme. I also thank the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq for sustaining the programme and making sure that we get nutritious food everyday we come to school. We like it and want it to continue.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a primary three pupil of LEA Primary School, Jahi, Favour Adeboye, said the programme has encouraged some of her friends to join her in school on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cThere are some of my friends who didn\u2019t like coming to school before, but they come to school everyday now. Though some still go home after eating, the number of pupils coming to school has increased. The food is nutritious and tasty; so we like it to continue,\u201d she said.\n\nFocal persons\u2019 take\n\nSpeaking in an interview with this reporter, the focal persons of different states said the school feeding programme has led to an increase in the number of school pupils, urging the federal government to sustain the programme even after the Buhari administration.\n\nThe programme manager, National Social Investment Programme (NSIP) in Kano state, Mr. Baba Zubair, said that School Feeding has helped a lot in the enrolment of pupils into primary schools, adding that Kano has over 1.2 million pupils it now feeds everyday.\n\nHe said: \u201cFrom inception, enrolment is the most important benefit of this programme. Pupils have increased more than three times. In addition to the state policy of free and compulsory education, this school feeding helps a lot in the enrolment of pupils in primary one to three. The economic benefits are so much that the value chain transcends from the producers to the farmers, local women and every part of the economic pyramid. So, with the school feeding taking place, the farmers produce more food, traders sell more, women also benefit from it.\n\n\u201cAlso, the economic benefits are so many that every part of our economy profits from it. This is because whenever there is school feeding, the farmers will produce more. The problem we are facing is that most good programmes like this don\u2019t continue once another government comes in. Something like this should be sustained because the results are there for all to see.\n\n\u201cIn Kano, we have the largest number of school pupils that are benefiting from this; currently, we are feeding over 1.2 million children between primary one and three everyday. We have 12,258 vendors or cooks. We have 10 aggregators supplying food items.\n\nLikewise, the State Nutrition Officer (SNO) on NHGSFP in Osun state, Mrs. Adedeji Comfort, told Blueprint Weekend that the number of school pupils has tripled as a result of the programme, but lamented the hike in the prices of food items.\n\n\u201cWe have an improvement in the enrolment of pupils in Osun; so this programme is encouraging. Every day, we do monitoring in Osun schools. Our monitoring team visits schools to count pupils, the quality and quantity of meals vendors bring to the school. However, we had the problem of hiking the price of food items. Before now, vendors complained of the high cost of food items. Now, a bag of rice is sold for N40, 000, while a congo of beans is N1, 500. We followed the 2018 ginger meal in the menu table. That is what they are following. They find it difficult to follow the menu table and demand to be given more money,\u201d she said.\n\nOn his part, the Enugu state programme manager, NHGSFP, Mr. Ifeanyi Onah, said the programme should be sustained because it has also been taken to the grassroots.\n\n\u201cThis is the best grassroots programme ever introduced by the federal government which has touched the lives of Nigerians positively. I encourage the government to sustain it because it is the best programme that is far-reaching in touching the lives of the people, both rich and poor. It, however, has its own challenges. The effect of Covid-19 pandemic led to a hike in the prices of food items.\n\n\u201cThat made it difficult for cooks and even aggregators to access food at the normal price they were getting it before. It was also affected by the price of N70, though the federal government recently increased it to N100. We say kudos to the government for considering the pleas of the stakeholders to be able to match the realities in food prices. Apart from some of the challenges, the programme is really touching many lives positively in Enugu state.\u201d\n\nCommendations\n\nAs a result of the transparency of the ministry in implementing the programme, stakeholders have commended the federal government upon its achievements, especially the expansion of the NHSGFP.\n\nThe stakeholders made the commendation March 3 in Abuja during a two-day training organised by the ministry, in collaboration with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), on \u201cOptimising school meal menus,\u201d using SMP Plus (Plus School Menus Tool) for states focal persons and managers from the six geopolitical zones.\n\nSpeaking at the training, the focal person for Adamawa state and the North-east, Mrs. Mary Yuwadi, said the ministry, through the NSIP, has increased enrolment in the state as the children receive their breakfast daily. She added that those children that had dropped out of school were back to school because they were encouraged by the meals given in the schools.\n\n\u201cThe meal is very nutritious; we give them a balanced diet and that has increased their nutrition. So, we want the government to continue with the programme and we also appeal that some of the schools that are not included in the programme should be added,\u201d she said.\n\nIn his remarks, the acting head, WFP, Capacity Strengthening and Policy Coherence Unit, Kim Do-Hwan, said feeding children with nutritious meals would enhance their growth and productivity, adding that the training would help to improve NHGSFP nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe at the WFP are here to help the government of Nigeria to achieve its objectives for the school feeding programme. One of the ways is improving the nutritious contents of the menus, developing them in a way that is more cost- effective and tailored toward a good context, so that it can also spur local economic development,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has urged the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to step-up its efforts in educating and protecting Nigerians from the increasing cases of the ravaging Monkeypox disease.\n\nIt stressed that the Agency, which is saddled with the responsibility of disease prevention and control, must not lose sight of other infectious diseases like monkeypox, even as it focuses on COVID-19.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 association, while urging Nigerians to adhere strictly to the preventive measures of personal hygiene, especially hand hygiene because like monkeypox, COVID-19 is still very much in the country, and the situation can become worse if not handled properly, implored religious institutions \u2013 churches and mosques \u2013 to take up the responsibility of sensitising their followers about the disease.\n\nRecall that yesterday the NCDC announced that the country has recorded 21 confirmed cases of the Monkeypox disease in the last five (5) months, with one death. Also, in the month of May, a total six (6) new confirmed positive cases were reported from four (4) states \u2013 Bayelsa (2), Adamawa (2), Lagos (1), and Rivers (1).\n\nGlobally, according to reports from the World Health Organization (WHO), as of 26 May, there have been a cumulative total of 257 laboratory confirmed cases, with around 120 suspected cases reported, from 23 non-endemic countries. However, no deaths have been reported.\n\nSpeaking with The Nation, the newly elected President of the NMA, Dr Uche Ojinmah, said: \u201cWe have the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) that has the responsibility of not just monitoring and controlling COVID-19, but every infectious disease. Therefore, they should step up to the plate. It is the business of the NCDC; they can link up with the Ministry of Information and get people aware.\n\n\u201cThey need to start giving us data on this Monkeypox as it happens across the country. With the current awareness coming from a reputable government institution like that, people will sit up. We need to start directing our calls to the appropriate institution, which is the NCDC. We don\u2019t expect President Muhammadu Buhari to give us information on this. Let the NCDC step up to the plate and do their job.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control needs to understand that it is not only COVID-19; it is important. It is however necessary to be combined in the sensitisation of the people. The media also have a role to play in sensitisation. The government needs to bring the will, but we all in our little ways can contribute.\n\n\u201cWe have a bit of a problem in this country; we initiate measures, achieve a positive response, and we drop our guards. In 2015 when Ebola came, we took it on as a nation, and we got rid of it, and everybody went back to their normal lives. COVID-19 has come and with us, if you check even in flights now, you force people to wear their masks. Nigerians, therefore, need to be serious and the government needs to play a role.\n\n\u201cMonkeypox is here now and everybody pretends they don\u2019t know \u2013 until it becomes a problem. I also expected that the government, civil society, and non- governmental organisations should have started spreading the message by now. Our churches and mosques should take up this course now that it has not become a disaster.\n\n\u201cDoctors should also start to educate patients they see that do not have it. We need to start now to prepare the minds of our people; it may not be as bad as Ebola or COVID-19, but it is still a problem. So, the earlier we start preventive measures, the better we will be.\u201d",

          "title": "Road to 2023: Atiku\u2019s emergence unsettles APC",
          "text": "From Wilfred Eya and Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nBarely a week to the presidential primaries of the All Progressives Congress(APC), indications have emerged that the emergence of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as the candidate of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party(PDP), has unsettled the ruling party.\n\nIt was learnt that the development has created anxiety in the APC and largely changed its earlier projections to prosecute the 2023 general elections.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nA highly placed member of the ruling party from the North told Daily Sun that power brokers in the ruling party have zeroed in on another Northern candidate to counterbalance the threat from Turaki Adamawa.\n\nHe said that barring a last minute change of heart, the APC hierarchy may have foreclosed the possibility of supporting a candidate from the South.\n\nHe said: In politics, it is not about sentiments. It is like a football game where the players play to win. All the players chase the ball, which to politicians is power, to win.\n\nBreaking!!! Earn up to N2 - N3 million monthly GUARANTEED (all paid in US Dollars). No training or refereal required. Do business with top USA companies like Amazon, Tesla, Facebook, IBM, Netflix, Zoom, etc. Learn more .\n\n\u201cThe question is who in the APC South can match Atiku considering the voting demographics of North and South. So, the only option is for APC to elect another Northerner to battle Atiku, also from the North.\n\n\u201cRemember, Atiku is a veteran in politics. He has contested four times to be president. Turaki Adamawa is an old war horse with enough experience. So, you must consider a lot of factors before picking any candidate that would face him in such a crucial election. It is not a time for gambling. Let the Atiku and another APC candidate from the North battle for votes in that region.\u201d\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nThe development comes even as the ruling party have been enmeshed in confusion over the unending clamour to zone the presidential ticket to the Southern part of the country for the sake of equity, fairness and balancing, especially after the North has held power for almost eight years now, under President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAlthough the APC national leadership, the presidency and even party chieftains have continued to maintain deafening silence on the direction the ticket pendulum will swing to, the emergence of Atiku, he said may have provided the much anticipated ground for the ruling party to zero in on a northern candidate to counterbalance Atiku.\n\nOne of the issues that have dominated the permutation over how the APC presidential candidate will emerge is that President Buhari would anoint one of the aspirants as a consensus candidate.\n\nSince this year, if the rumour millers did not spine the pendulum of the anointed one to the side of the former Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu, they would swing to the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, or the former Minister of Education (State), Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba.\n\nOther aspirants speculated to have received President Buhari\u2019s endorsement at one time or the other include Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, the President of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan, former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and now former president, Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nApparently, the silence of the leadership of the party and President Buhari on the issue of zoning and possible consensus option has contributed hugely in escalating the confusion and anxiety especially which zone will produce the party\u2019s candidate. It has equally kept the aspirants in the dark one week to the June 6-8, Special convention to pick the candidate of the party.\n\nUnfortunately, while the aspirants have remained perpetually anxious to know their fate, the party\u2019s leadership continued to adopt hide and seek tactics, apparently perhaps to wait for the opposition party to pick its presidential candidate.\n\nMany believe that the APC\u2019s repeated rescheduling and adjusting of its timetable and activities for the special convention are part of its hide and seek strategy for the primaries.\n\nBoxed to a corner by the warning from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that it will no longer bow to any pressure again to shift the deadline for the conduct of the primary, in addition to the opposition party setting the ball rolling by picking Atiku as its candidate, the calculation and permutation by the ruling party will not only change but will provide clearer picture to the APC leadership on the direction to take.\n\nAlready, Atiku\u2019s emergence may have thrown the leaders of the party into a state of apprehension and disquiet. In the calculations of several party members, zoning the presidential ticket to the South could be tantamount to sending the ruling party into early political retirement.\n\nYet to others, giving the ticket to an aspirant of the northern extraction equally portends the same consequence if not worse judging by the calibre and political clout of the northern aspirants side by side with the PDP candidate, Atiku.\n\nIn the calculation of some critical observers, with the strategic backing from the northern oligarchy for the former vice president, there are indications that the opposition may be coasting to victory going by the perception that it would be easier for Atiku with better political structure and stronghold to mobilise his ethnic-conscious northern electorate than any possible candidate that may emerge in the APC.\n\nThose that hold that view may be hinging their conviction on the perceived and much-touted bulk voting strength of the Northern electorate in deciding the overall winner of any presidential election.\n\nThe contention is that should the APC risk zoning its presidential ticket to any other part of the country other than the north, it may be counter-productive.\n\nWith the fortune of the ruling party gradually dwindling due to perceived security and economic challenges in the country, in addition to the fact that President Buhari with cult followership will not be on the ballot paper, many argue that Atiku may make mincemeat of any candidate from the South.\n\nYet to others, APC may have lost the ticket putting in place measures that encouraged greater percentage of the aspirants from the South to pick the presidential nomination forms.\n\nIt was understandably so because the party in its quasi-zoning arrangement had settled for certain critical positions in the national leadership especially the national chairman hitherto in the South going to the North.\n\nA chieftain of the party, who shared similar sentiments, argued that none of the APC presidential aspirants can match Atiku force for force during the main election regardless of whether the ruling party deploys state apparatus or not.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cAmong those that purchased form in APC, only Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu can boast of rivaling Atiku\u2019s political structure. However, with the current situation, it will be a remote possibility for any of them to get the ticket of the APC. If you take the ticket to the South the northern oligarchy will frustrate it with their massive voting pattern. I can see bold conspiracy against the South in the emergence of Atiku as PDP candidate,\u201d the chieftain, who spoke to Daily Sun in confidence argued.\n\nHowever, many insist that the general election is certainly not going to be a stroll in the park.\n\nFormer APC National Publicity Secretary (NPS), Yekini Nabena, who claimed that with Atiku, the ruling party is at a vantage position to retain power at the centre beyond 2023 boasted APC has the former vice president\u2019s password.\n\nNabena who spoke to Daily Sun, argued that since Atiku never challenged APC successfully both during primary and main elections, he will still be defeated in the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cAtiku has never been a threat to the APC. If you go back to history, you will know that he has always been a failure in almost all the presidential positions he contested in or against the APC. APC has the password on how to defeat Atiku and the 2023 presidential election will not be an exception.\n\n\u201cWe have been in the trenches several times with Atiku but APC has always prevailed. Don\u2019t forget that he contested the party\u2019s presidential primary during the 2015 election; he lost and left the party. He confronted the APC again in the 2019 presidential election and still lost. Yes, we are not going to undermine him and the forces behind him this time around, but we are solidly battle-ready for him,\u201d Nabena boasted.\n\nAsked whether the APC\u2019s presidential ticket pendulum should swing South or North to counter Atiku\u2019s forces, the Bayelsa State-born politician said: \u201cIt is too early to bother ourselves with that. We will go to the primary and elect the right candidate but regardless of where our candidate comes from, APC is not afraid of Atiku. He is a featherweight where the APC is involved. I repeat, Atiku is not a threat to the APC.\u201d\n\nApparently wary of Atiku\u2019s firepower and penetrating political structure, a chieftain of the party wrote: \u201cI urge the National Chairman of the party and the entire NWC to stamp their feet and zone APC presidential ticket to the North East. President Buhari has a right to choose his successor and I call on him to pick Senator Ahmad Lawan as his successor. In every democratic setting, presidents and Governors support and pick their successors.\n\n\u201cI call on President Buhari to pick a successor from the North East and that will be the equity the South East needs. With the North East, the cycle will be closest to completion of regions producing the president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBy now, all APC aspirants should drop their ambition and support a North Easterner. Senator Ahmad Lawan is the destination. Congratulations to the North East as we look forward to a president of Nigeria from the North East,\u201d the chieftain insisted.\n\nBeyond the permutations, the dilemma of zoning is not the only challenge facing the APC over the emergence of Atiku, as the crack in the national leadership of the party may also count against the party peacefully picking an acceptable candidate.\n\nIn a petition the party\u2019s National Vice Chairman (North West), Salihu Moh Lukman, sent to President Buhari, he accused the National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, of not only autocratically handling affairs in the party but has also become inaccessible even to his National Working Committee (NWC) members.\n\nHighlighting the casual manners NWC has handled sensitive issues, Lukman frowned at the constant involvement and peddling of the name of President Buhari over certain issues.\n\nCriticising the levity in handling an issue as sensitive as picking the candidate of the party, he almost passed a vote of no confidence on the leadership, stressing: \u201cThe case of appointing Screening, Primary and Convention Committees is a good example. Again, although with your prompting, a committee was set up under the leadership of Deputy National Chairman (North). Sen. Abubakar Kyari, with the task of managing all the processes, eventually the committee was unable to discharge its function.\n\n\u201cPartly because of that, for instance, although the National Convention to elect the party\u2019s Presidential Candidate is scheduled for May 29 and 30, less than 48 hours, we are yet to have a Convention Committee in place. In fact, the presidential aspirants are yet to be screened.\n\n\u201cThe official explanation is that you are awaiting final consultation with President Buhari. At the risk of sounding agitated, this is unfair to President Buhari because to the best of my understanding, it is an attempt to use the President\u2019s name to give excuses for failure, if it happens, which should not be the case.\n\n\u201cAs NWC and as our leader being the National Chairman, I want to appeal to you on the need for new initiatives in managing the party. At the rate we are going, we are walking back to the old spot of over centralised implementation of party decisions around the National Chairman.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, critical challenges of managing important tasks such as organising National Convention to produce Presidential Candidate of the party is being handled informally. This should not be so, and everything must be done to correct that,\u201d he warned.\n\nApparently, confronted with this looming leadership crisis, the ruling party, though no stranger to managing crisis, may have serious issue at hand to contend one week ahead of the crucial presidential primary.\n\nBeyond the impending leadership crisis, the fear is that there may be an implosion should the ruling party fail to manage the backlash that will follow the methodology it will use in picking the presidential candidate out of the over 25 aspirants that picked the N100 million nomination forms.\n\nBut the Director-General, Voice of Nigeria (VON), Osita Okechukwu, dismissed the possibility of Atiku\u2019s emergence, claiming that the dream is still alive.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Sun, Okechukwu argued: \u201cmethinks Atiku Abubakar\u2019s opportunistic victory will have little or no impact on APC\u2019s election of a presidential candidate from among Ndigbo aspirants or by extension the Southern belt aspirants.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think Mr President I know even going by consensus, will deny the South their turn. More so when Atiku has nothing new and tangible to bring to the table in the face of prevailing daunting economic scenario.\n\n\u201cHe is used to sharing money and none to be shared. Most importantly, one, northern voters are sophisticated, having voted for Chiefs MKO Abiola and Olusegun Obasanjo, and they will vote a Southerner this time around so as to shame the PDP for breaching rotation convention in their constitution.\n\n\u201cSecondly, there are a number of northern voters who are patriots who believe in equity, natural justice and the imperative of unity of our dear country. Going South is the best to smoothen polarisation in the land. Thirdly, the dormant Igbo voters in Kano, Lagos and other towns plus core non-Igbo APC voters will trounce Atiku at the polls,\u201d he argued.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\u2022Predicts 100% of country\u2019s revenue may be for debt service by 2026\n\n\u2022Nigeria received $6.8bn facilities from global lender in two years\n\n\u2022Akabueze rejects IMF\u2019s prediction on debt service\n\n\u202280 Million Nigerians facing food insecurity, says UN country representatives\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\n\n\nWith Nigeria\u2019s fuel subsidy payout averaging N500 billion monthly, total expenditure on subsidy could hit a record N6 trillion mark by year-end, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned yesterday.\n\nThe multilateral lender also revealed that a macro-fiscal stress test it conducted on the country showed that interest payments on debts in the country could amount to Nigeria using 100 per cent of its revenue to service debts by 2026 if not closely monitored.\n\nIMF\u2019s Resident Representative for Nigeria, Mr. Ari Aisen made these disclosures while presenting the latest Sub-Saharan Africa Regional Economic Outlook, in Abuja.\n\nHe also revealed that Nigeria received a total of $6.8 billion facilities from the IMF following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria received $3.4 billion in Special Drawing Rights (SDR) and as well as a loan in the same amount.\n\nThe IMF chief expressed worry that many African countries, including Nigeria risk sliding into critical debt servicing problem unless urgent actions were explored to significantly raise revenue.\n\nAisen noted that over 80 per cent of the federal government\u2019s revenue was committed to debt service, a situation he described as an \u201cexistential problem\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a reflection of low revenue. It is an existential issue for Nigeria. It is essential for macro-economic stability. It is important for the provision for social service,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther x-raying the fiscal challenges, he regretted that as an oil exporter, Nigeria was not only unable to take advantage of the current global high oil prices to build reserves, but also confronted by low earnings due to the subsidy on petroleum products.\n\nWith N500 billion monthly fuel subsidy payouts, he noted that the country might end up with a record N6 trillion subsidy at by year-end.\n\nHowever, he raised optimism that the Dangote Refinery would reduce fuel importation when completed, thereby cutting down the subsidy burden.\n\nSpeaking on the economic outlook for the continent, the IMF official identified key priority areas as how to reduce debt vulnerabilities, balance inflation and growth; and manage foreign exchange rate pressures.\n\nAisen stated: \u201cUnrivalled potential for renewable energy and an abundance of minerals, a successful transition offers opportunities for diversification and job creation; ensuring the green transition is also a just transition.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that fragile and conflict-affected African countries were at the risk of falling further behind in terms of development, especially now that the world economy was faced with an unprecedented high energy and food prices.\n\nThe Fund, he stressed, had done a lot to help to Sub-Saharan African countries, having given them the $23 billion Special Drawing Rights allocation and planning to re-channel additional $100 billion SDR from developed countries.\n\nAccording to him, Africa needed $425 billion to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. This was in addition to between $30 and $50 billion per year for climate adaptation and $6-10 billion annually for commodity import.\n\nAisen further said: \u201cI think the biggest critical aspect for Nigeria is that we have done a macro-fiscal stress test, and what you observe is the interest payments as a share of revenue and as you see us in terms of the baseline from the federal government of Nigeria, the revenue almost 100 per cent is projected by 2026 to be taken by debt service.\n\n\u201cSo, the fiscal space or the amount of revenues that will be needed and this without considering any shock is that most of the revenues of the federal government are now in fact 89 per cent and it will continue if nothing is done to be taken by debt service.\n\n\u201cIt is a reflection of the low revenue of the country. The country needs to mobilise more revenue to be able to have macroeconomic stability. It has become an existential issue for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe war in Europe is hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa and Africa. So, I think we should pay very close attention to this issue.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIn Sub Saharan Africa, Russia and Ukraine are first and the fifth major sources of wheat imports to Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cSo clearly having this conflict is the epicenter of the wheat-producing countries being hurt, which puts as we said, a big premium on the price of wheat. And it is especially complicated in Sub-Saharan Africa where we have 57 per cent of the population on moderate or severe food insecurity and this is extremely concerning for the IMF because after two years of the pandemic on top of these people already suffering, you have this extra shock affecting the price of basic food items in an already very vulnerable population is something of great concern to us.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he advised Nigeria to in the short-term to prioritise its debt, inflation, growth and foreign exchange management.\n\nIn his contribution, the Director-General of the Budget Office, Mr. Ben Akabueze, who disagreed with Aisen on Nigeria\u2019s debt service/revenue figures, put debt service/revenue at 76 per cent.\n\nHe admitted that even at that level, it was way far too high, adding: \u201cThere is no doubt that the debt servicing \u2013revenue is way beyond what we want it to be,\u201d adding that the federal government had taken steps to significantly increase revenue.\n\nAkabueze stressed that additional revenue was the only choice before the government, assuring that the nation would not default in its debt service obligations.\n\nHe expressed regret that vested interests had made the removal of petrol subsidy very difficult over the years.\n\n\u201cWhen you try to remove subsidy or raise tariffs, you get summons, you see resolutions get passed, asking you not to,\u201d he said\n\nAccording to Akabueze, when the executive arm of government prepared the 2022 budget, it was with the understanding that the petrol subsidy would be removed but that somehow, that move was frustrated.\n\nIn his remarks, the Director of Policy at the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr. Hassan Mahmoud explained that the recent upward adjustment of the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) was to ensure an environment in which the nation could still attract investors and to prevent capital outflows that could hurt the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThe United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Mr. Matthias Schmale, agreed with the food insecurity raised by the IMF representative, saying there was an urgent need to increase social safety net for the vulnerable population.\n\nHe said: \u201cBy the way, our own analysis is that they are already 15 million people in acute need of food support in the country and that was before the Ukraine-Russia conflict and our prognosis right now is that this may rise to 19.5 million.\n\n\u201cBasically, all the 80 million who live below the poverty line in Nigeria are food insecure. So, the currently almost 50 million need help now. If we want to avoid serious damage to the house, and serious hunger, I mean, a few weeks or months. So there needs to be an element of social protection and direct support to these people.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022My presidential bid sent message to north that south can\u2019t be underrated\n\n\u2022Tells Atiku many people around him have no electoral value, pledges to deliver party in 2023\n\n\u2022Ex-vice president, Rivers governor, Saraki, Anyim close ranks, advance collaboration for next year\u2019s elections\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\n\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike yesterday accused his southern colleagues of masterminding his failure to win the ticket, saying they ganged up against him with some vested interests to derail the quest for a southern president.\n\nHe stated that the effort he put up to clinch the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential ticket sent a strong message to the north, stressing that never again would anyone underestimate the capacity of the south to secure the country\u2019s presidency.\n\nWike spoke in Port Harcourt, in his first public comments on the PDP presidential convention at the weekend in Abuja, where he lost the presidential ticket to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.\n\nThe governor made the assertions at a reception in Port Harcourt organised by the people of his state to welcome him back from the PDP convention in Abuja.\n\nHe said he told the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku, that many of the people around him had no electoral value to deliver their states, but vowed to deliver PDP in 2023.\n\nThe governor\u2019s comments came as Atiku, yesterday, commenced a reconciliatory move to try to get the other presidential aspirants, who contested the PDP ticket with him at last Saturday\u2019s nomination convention, to close ranks behind him for the party\u2019s success in 2023.\n\nAtiku had earlier met with Wike, former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim, in Abuja in what he described as a \u201ccontinuation of my commitment to bring everyone on board in ensuring that the PDP stands as one united party.\u201d Declaring that it is a \u201ccontinuous process,\u201d a post stamped AA read on his official Facebook page.\n\nSimilarly, the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT), the governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, and a senatorial candidate from Delta State, Ned Nwoko, yesterday, congratulated Atiku on his election at the presidential convention on Saturday.\n\nBut Wike, who spoke extensively on what happened at the convention on Saturday, said it was disheartening that some governors from the south could jettison the collective interest of the people they claimed to represent due to their inordinate ambitions. He added that it was the agreement by the southern governors that the presidency should come to the south that motivated his presidential aspiration.\n\nThe Rivers governor described as shameful the inability of some of those, who were part of the agreement, to stick to the deal when it mattered, accusing them of betrayal.\n\nWike stated, \u201cI contested in an election (primary) based on the principle and agreement with all southern governors and leaders of the south that the presidency should go to the south this period.\n\n\u201cWe have done our part. We never betrayed anybody, because it is not in our blood to betray. But it is a shame to those people, some of the governors from the south; they were the people used to sabotage our course.\n\n\u201cLook at a region ganged up, then you, your own region cannot gang up. You became tools to be used against the interest of your people, and you think you have won? You have lost! You will continue to be perpetual slaves. Rivers people, you don\u2019t need to bother yourselves. PDP needs us. If they say they don\u2019t need us, they should wait.\u201d\n\nWike explained that his motivation in the presidential race was to offer service and advance the interest of Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe winner (of the ticket) also saw it. They underrated us, but now, they will not underrate us again. We have all it takes to do whatever we want to do. It is a matter of you being firm; it is a matter of you being hopeful. There is nobody that is born greater than us in this country; therefore, we cannot answer second-class citizens. We can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWe just used this one to tell them that enough is enough. We made them not to sleep. We made them not to eat. We made all of them from wherever they said they came from to know that there is somebody, who can take them on. This country does not belong to one particular zone. If people are afraid of talking, it is their business. I cannot be a second-class citizen in my country.\n\n\u201cSome of them, their in-laws are governors in the ruling party, but they want to interfere in what happens in PDP. Some of them their brothers are governors in the ruling party and they want to interfere in PDP.\u201d\n\nHowever, Wike said with the presidential primary over, and given his pledge to work for whoever emerged PDP ticket holder, Rivers State would work to deliver PDP and all its candidates in the 2023 general election.\n\nHe recalled that in 2019, despite the failure of the presidential candidate he supported to clinch the ticket, Rivers State gave PDP massive votes and refused to negotiate with the All Progressives Congress (PDP) to give them 25 per cent of the votes.\n\nWike said, \u201cIn 2019, I was the only governor from the South-south, who never negotiated with the present government. They came, I said no, I was not going to be party to that. And that is why APC never had 25 per cent in this state.\n\n\u201cBut in all the other states in the South-south, the president got 35 per cent to 40 per cent. I said I was not going to sit down with them and negotiate.\u201d\n\nThe governor said he had told Atiku that many of those hanging around him did not have electoral value, advising all members \u2013 whether in the north or south \u2013 to deliver the kind of votes Rivers State would deliver in the 2023 general election in order for PDP to win the presidency.\n\nHe also said it was wrong for the party to have allowed the governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, to speak for a second time after the time allotted to each of the aspirants to address the delegates.\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku first visited Tambuwal at his Abuja residence on Sunday, to thank him for the role he played in the outcome of the convention.\n\nTambuwal had on Saturday, at the PDP convention, announced he was stepping down for Atiku, a move many believed swayed the votes in favour of the former vice president.\n\nNational Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, also visited Tambuwal to appreciate him for his role, saying, \u201cyou\u2019re the hero of the convention.\u201d\n\nSome, however, believed Tambuwal\u2019s withdrawal from the race was actually a smart move, which had no defining effect on the emergence of Atiku.\n\nAtiku continued with the reconciliation process on Monday, when he visited his closest rivals, Wike, Saraki, and Anyim.\n\nDuring his visit to Wike, the former vice president was accompanied by National Vice Chairman of PDP, Dan Orbih; former Minister of Police Affairs, Adamu Waziri; and former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, among others.\n\nThe meeting took place in Wike\u2019s private residence in Maitama, Abuja, where he received Atiku and his associates, Senator Olaka Nwogu, among others.\n\nA source privy to the meeting said Atiku pleaded with Wike to work with him for the purpose of rescuing the country, regardless of the outcome of the primary, which saw Wike polling 237 votes to come second.\n\n\u201cIn continuation of my commitment to bring everyone on board in ensuring that the PDP stands as one united party, earlier today, I visited His Excellency, Governor Nyseom Wike, at his Abuja residence. This is a continuous process,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nAtiku arrived the private residence of Saraki about 3.05pm and the duo went into discussion.\n\nA post by the presidential hopeful said the visits were to seek the cooperation of all the presidential aspirants in the journey to rescue Nigeria.\n\nIn his own twitter post, Saraki thanked all the delegates and his supporters, saying, \u201cI thank all our friends and supporters across the nation for keying into our vision to provide #RealSolutions and #FixNigeria!\n\n\u201cI congratulate the winner of tonight\u2019s #PDPPresidentialPrimary, His Excellency, our former vice president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, on his emergence as the presidential flag-bearer of our party.\n\n\u201cAs we prepare for the future, I am proud that our message of #RealSolutions and deliberate leadership has resonated with millions of young Nigerians across the nation. Now, we must all rally round all our candidates across the nation to fix our economy, curb the insecurity, and put an end to the rising cost of living.\u201d\n\nThough the outcomes of the meetings were not made public, a party source hinted that the PDP presidential candidate, who also visited Anyim, would later move to meet the Akwa Ibom State governor, Emmanuel Udoh.\n\nMeanwhile, chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT), Senator Walid Jubrin, said the election of Atiku as the presidential candidate was a big success for the party and a good omen for all Nigerians.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAtiku\u2019s success at the recently concluded PDP primaries has opened a good way for all Nigerians, when it comes to 2023 general election, to elect a Nigerian president.\n\n\u201cWe must remember that Atiku was earlier elected at PDP primaries at Port Harcourt in 2019 but was nakedly sabotaged by APC through an unholy way. We must remember the good performance of Atiku as vice president to President Olusegun Obasanjo, our party must be fully congratulated for playing a good role and, of course, all our delegates across the 36 states and the FCT.\u201d\n\nThe BoT chairman also congratulated Senator David Mark and his committee for organising one of the best electoral national conventions after the Port Harcourt convention chaired by Governor Okowa of Delta State in 2019.\n\nJubrin stated, \u201cMy advice as the PDP BoT chairman, the conscience of the party, is that we must come together as one entity fully together as one party, talking with one voice to make our party greatest, not only in Nigeria, West Africa, but the greatest in Africa with no differences in tribe, section or religion.\n\n\u201cAtiku would be Nigerian president and never a tribal or any religious president. Finally, the BoT will assist the party and, surely, the Waziri Adamawa himself to come out with very a acceptable vice president from southern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOrtom, while congratulating Atiku, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Nathaniel Ikyur, said, \u201cIn John 3.27, the Bible says, \u2018A man can receive nothing except it\u2019s given to him from above\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo, for the benefit of all Nigerians for whom we strive to make society better, let us now come together under the leadership of the party and be focused to dislodge the APC, who has destroyed the very essence of our nationhood, by winning the 2023 general election to restore the dignity of Nigerians, both at home and in the Diaspora.\n\n\u201cLet me on behalf of myself, the government and people of Benue State, heartily congratulate His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar, the former Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on his nomination as the presidential candidate of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), for the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cI believe that with your experience and goodwill across all facets of this nation, your election as the standard bearer of the PDP is a clear indication that our party has begun the historic journey back to power in 2023.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that you will put forward your election to restore security in every nook and cranny of the country, revive our collapsed economy, and bring back Nigeria\u2019s dignity, where the sanctity of human lives of all Nigerian citizens will be respected. This will also make the social life of every Nigerian much more meaningful as you will rescue Nigeria from bottom to top.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Delta North PDP senatorial candidate, Nwoko, said Atiku\u2019s victory at the convention reflected the choice of the delegates and will of God.\n\nNwoko, in a press statement, said the former vice president earned the victory.\n\nHe said, \u201cPDP got it right. The hitch-free conduct of the presidential primary should be instructive to other political parties. I found the election transparent and credible.\n\n\u201cMy belief is that only an electoral process staged without rancour can guarantee popular democracy and enthrone lasting peace, unity and progress in the Nigerian polity.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the 2023 general election, our creed as the political class must defer to strict democratic principles of rule of law, fairness and people-centred motivations for orderliness in our nation.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Screening continues today with Osinbajo, Fayemi, Onu on standby\n\n\u2022Bakare, Ken-Ohaneye say they won\u2019t challenge the party if asked to step down\n\nAdedayo Akinwale\n\n\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Screening Committee, yesterday, screened 11 of the party\u2019s 23 presidential hopefuls, ahead of the primary election scheduled to take place between June 6 and 8 at Eagles Square, Abuja. The exercise commenced shortly after the committee\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe inauguration of the seven-man screening committee, chaired by former National Chairman of APC, Chief John Oyegun, took place at Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, with journalists barred from covering the event and the screening.\n\nThose screened yesterday included former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu; former governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun; former Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi; Jigawa State Governor Abubakar Badaru; and former Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba.\n\nOthers also screened were Ebonyi State Governor Dave Umahi, Felix Nicholas, Senator Ajayi Borroffice, former Senate President Ken Nnamani, Mrs. Uju Ken-Ohaneye, and former Governor of Zamfara State, Sani Yerima.\n\nThe screening, which ought to have been done last Monday, started yesterday and was scheduled to end today, with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, and others on standby for today\u2019s exercise.\n\nTinubu, who arrived the venue at 5:50pm, was accompanied by Hon. James Faleke and Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, among others. He was screened at 8:20 pm, while Sanwo-Olu left at the time the committee was about to screen Tinubu. Tinubu left Transcorp at 8:56pm but refused to grant interview to journalists, who had laid siege to him.\n\nBut speaking with journalists, Pastor Tunde Bakare said he would not challenge the authority of the party if he was asked to step down for the party to come up with a consensus arrangement, because the party was supreme.\n\nBakare stated, \u201cThe party supremacy is the utmost essence. You cannot force your way through a party\u2019s structure. The party has the final say. And when we get to that bridge, we will know how to cross it.\n\n\u201cThe screening exercise is to check who is guilty and who is not. And it depends on the people, who are doing the screening. By God\u2019s grace, we have complied with everything demanded for. We have supplied every information.\n\n\u201cAnd every information given is accurate and there is no miscommunication anywhere. Therefore, we will listen to what they have to say to us. And we trust God for accurate answers and deserving answers to all questions.\u201d\n\nOn her part, the only female aspirant, Ken-Ohaneye, also said she would step down if the party asked her to do so, provided the party would be willing to carry on with her economic blueprints.\n\nKen-Ohaneye said, \u201cI want you to know that we are a family politically, and if I am asked by the party to step down, I will not challenge the party, because, like they say, charity begins at home.\n\n\u201cI will never see it as a problem to my party, because I am going to respect them. I am going to do whatever it takes to promote my party and make them relax so that they can make a better decision.\n\n\u201cSo, if their decision is to ask me to step down, I will not have choice than to step down. As long as they can carry over my blueprints on board, definitely, I will respect my party.\u201d\n\nShe disclosed that the approach deployed by the screening committee was a huge incentive for her, as she was more relaxed in responding to questions and the conversation was very frank and straight to the point.\n\nOther presidential aspirants to be screened today are Governor of Cross Rivers State, Professor Ben Ayade; President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan; Kogi State Governor Yahaya Bello; Mr. Tein Jack-Rich; former Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu; former Minister of Information, Chief Ikeobasi Mokelu; former Speaker of House of Representatives, Hon. Dimeji Bankole; former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, and former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha (if allowed to attend from his detention by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Sagir Mai Iyali has asked the party\u2019s presidential screening committee to disqualify one of the aspirants, Bola Ahmed Tinubu over alleged certificate forgery.\n\nThe petition dated May 17, 2022, was submitted on Monday, May 30, and its receipt was acknowledged by one Emmanuel Akpan.\n\nTinubu\u2019s academic qualifications have been a subject of controversy for over a decade.\n\nHe had indicated he graduated from the University of Chicago in his INEC form 001 filled when he contested the Lagos State governorship poll in 1999.\n\nThe former governor also claimed in the affidavit he attached to the INEC form that he lost his university degree certificate while he was in exile between 1994 and 1998.\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Chief Gani Fawehinmi (SAN), had also questioned Tinubu\u2019s credentials and sued the Nigeria Police Force for failing to investigate him.\n\nThe Supreme Court in its judgment on May 10, 2002, ruled that Tinubu could not be prosecuted by the police for alleged certificate forgery.\n\nThe apex court also ruled that the Inspector-General of Police could not be compelled by Gani to investigate Tinubu for alleged certificate forgery as he enjoyed immunity at the time.\n\nIn a petition sent to John Odigie Oyegun, chairman of the presidential screening committee of the APC, Iyali said Tinubu never graduated from the University of Chicago.\n\nHe added that the former governor lied about his age and state of origin.\n\nThe APC member further asked that the former Lagos governor shouldn\u2019t be allowed to participate in the June 7 primary of the party.\n\n\u201cWe understand that Bola Ahmed Tinubu who has since procured his Expression of Interest and Nomination forms and has submitted same to the party has certain issues that clearly amount to a similar disqualification scenario.\n\n\"From the information contained in prior submission to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), particularly in 1999, Mr Tinubu Presented a false claim, on oath, of his attendance at University of Chicago from 1972-1976. It is clear now that these claims are false. Not only was this filed in the INEC form with a declaration on oath on December 20th, 1999, but it was also contained in an affidavit of loss sworn to before the High Court of Lagos, Ikeja Registry, December 29th 1998.\n\n\"The latter claim that seeks to transpose history is untenable. Mr Tinubu has to show proof he attended University of Chicago or he must stand disqualified as the opposition is in possession of these same documents.\n\n\u201cOver the years, the identity of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has been shrouded in secrecy. In fact, no one can claim to know the identity of the man.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the age of Tinubu is not known to anyone. Though, it\u2019s not contention that he is above the statutory age of 35-years, it\u2019s equally important that his exact age is known,\u201d the petition read.\n\n",

          "text": "A member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Sagir Mai Iyali has asked the party\u2019s presidential screening committee to disqualify one of the aspirants, Bola Ahmed Tinubu over alleged certificate forgery.\n\nThe petition dated May 17, 2022, was submitted on Monday, May 30, and its receipt was acknowledged by one Emmanuel Akpan.\n\nTinubu\u2019s academic qualifications have been a subject of controversy for over a decade.\n\nHe had indicated he graduated from the University of Chicago in his INEC form 001 filled when he contested the Lagos State governorship poll in 1999.\n\nThe former governor also claimed in the affidavit he attached to the INEC form that he lost his university degree certificate while he was in exile between 1994 and 1998.\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Chief Gani Fawehinmi (SAN), had also questioned Tinubu\u2019s credentials and sued the Nigeria Police Force for failing to investigate him.\n\nThe Supreme Court in its judgment on May 10, 2002, ruled that Tinubu could not be prosecuted by the police for alleged certificate forgery.\n\nThe apex court also ruled that the Inspector-General of Police could not be compelled by Gani to investigate Tinubu for alleged certificate forgery as he enjoyed immunity at the time.\n\nIn a petition sent to John Odigie Oyegun, chairman of the presidential screening committee of the APC, Iyali said Tinubu never graduated from the University of Chicago.\n\nHe added that the former governor lied about his age and state of origin.\n\nThe APC member further asked that the former Lagos governor shouldn\u2019t be allowed to participate in the June 7 primary of the party.\n\n\u201cWe understand that Bola Ahmed Tinubu who has since procured his Expression of Interest and Nomination forms and has submitted same to the party has certain issues that clearly amount to a similar disqualification scenario.\n\n\"From the information contained in prior submission to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), particularly in 1999, Mr Tinubu Presented a false claim, on oath, of his attendance at University of Chicago from 1972-1976. It is clear now that these claims are false. Not only was this filed in the INEC form with a declaration on oath on December 20th, 1999, but it was also contained in an affidavit of loss sworn to before the High Court of Lagos, Ikeja Registry, December 29th 1998.\n\n\"The latter claim that seeks to transpose history is untenable. Mr Tinubu has to show proof he attended University of Chicago or he must stand disqualified as the opposition is in possession of these same documents.\n\n\u201cOver the years, the identity of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has been shrouded in secrecy. In fact, no one can claim to know the identity of the man.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the age of Tinubu is not known to anyone. Though, it\u2019s not contention that he is above the statutory age of 35-years, it\u2019s equally important that his exact age is known,\u201d the petition read.\n\n",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Stax is making progress with solving USSD's user experience problem",
          "text": "Despite the growing ubiquity of sleek, internet-powered apps to carry out digital transactions, the fact remains that 9 out of 10 mobile transactions in sub-Saharan Africa flow through Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). TechCabal has written about this persistent protocol before, highlighting its continued reliability not only for those who own feature phones but for smartphone users as well.\n\nLast year, we covered the launch of Stax, an offline mobile app that seeks to give a desperately-needed makeover to USSD\u2019s drab interface and offer users an aesthetically pleasing and seamless experience.\n\nAs Stax, owned by US-based developer Hover, celebrates its first anniversary, TechCabal caught up with its CEO and co-founder, Ben Lyon, to discuss the startup\u2019s commitment to providing offline mobile banking services, its growth aspirations, and upcoming features on its app.\n\nUSSD is here for the long haul\n\nBack in the early 2000s, when many Africans were still getting used to their newly acquired mobile phones, they relied heavily on USSD to check and top up their airtime. It quickly became an important channel for mobile banking, and eventually, users started to use USSD to purchase internet data, send money, and pay their bills. The fact that USSD is accessible on multiple types of phones and functions offline has helped it retain popularity 2 decades on.\n\nOne might assume\u2014understandably so\u2014that USSD exists under constant threat of the internet. It doesn\u2019t help that the design of USSD, despite its proven efficiency, make for a poor user experience, which could compel a user to migrate to more intuitive mobile apps.\n\nStax claimed to possess a deep understanding of USSD\u2019s continued importance in African markets and users\u2019 needs for a smooth and simple mobile banking experience. This understanding was the impetus for the company to build what they hoped would become a universal money app for Africa, where users can link all of their bank accounts and mobile wallets\u2014and, soon, their crypto wallets, too.\n\nThe app\u2019s technology automates the standard USSD menu, meaning, instead of dialling a bank\u2019s USSD code, Stax users simply need to tap a button on the app, while utilising the efficient USSD backend. Lyon said that Stax is looking at possibly creating its own USSD codes through Africa\u2019s Talking, a telecommunication solution provider, and using those codes to access more information services, even when they\u2019re offline.\n\nHover co-founder and CEO, Ben Lyon, told TechCabal over a call that while Stax is currently only available in 9 African countries, it is still pursuing continent-wide opportunities to expand, and as such, it is imperative that it targets USSD, the centre of digital commerce, and tap into users\u2019 strong preference to turn off their mobile data.\n\nHe explained that the types of phones most Africans own\u2014half of which are feature phones\u2014is further reason to focus on smoothening USSD transactions.\n\nTo Lyon, this reality, much like USSD itself, will not change any time soon. Not even increased fintech industry funding and improving mobile connectivity and internet penetration will threaten the need for a USSD-powered solution like Stax.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to see, over the next few years, more data consumption,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we\u2019re actually going to see more data metering, and so I think the size of the offline market is actually growing.\u201d\n\nTo prove his point, Lyon referenced a Caribou Data study that found that 94% of financial digital transactions in Africa are made using USSD, leaving 6% of those transactions to come from elsewhere, like internet-based financial products. That, Lyon said, is what distinguishes Stax from the fintechs pursuing a much smaller opportunity in the 6% internet-facilitated transactions.\n\nOther studies on the rising cost of data in Africa further substantiate the argument on which Stax builds its vision. In a Worldwide Mobile Data Pricing 2021 report from Cable.co.uk, sub-Saharan Africa ranked as the most expensive region, with the average price for 1GB of mobile data coming in at $6.44, followed by Oceania at $5.51 and South America at $5.25.\n\nSince coming out of beta last May, more than 200,000 people have used Stax\u2019s mobile app, and it has seen as many as 40,000 monthly active users. It is focusing on retention and hoping to turn on a growth engine that will see it acquire 45,000-plus new users or more per month.\n\nAfter it secures a Series A funding round, Stax intends to expand its service to tens of markets across Africa.\n\nSolving the fragmentation problem\n\nLyon explained that fragmentation, both of Android phones and USSD codes, was one of the biggest challenges Stax faced in building its product. Stax has to ensure that its USSD technology is compatible with its users\u2019 Android phones. Stax has to ensure that its USSD technology is compatible with its users\u2019 Android phones, but that leads to a lot of work on their end. This has required his team to constantly test their technology on hundreds of makes, models, and versions of Android devices, including Tecno, Infinix, Huawei, and Samsung\u2014all of which are common phone brands in African markets. But this, Lyon believes, made Stax a defensible business.\n\nIn proprietary data, Stax claimed to have purchased from Caribou Data; as of September 2020, 8% of Android users in Nigeria were still on Android version 4. \u201cIf you want to make sure that your product works for those users, you have to do all of this reverse compatibility, so you\u2019re not just building on the latest Android versions, because that won\u2019t work for 90% of the market,\u201d he said.\n\nStax navigated a similar obstacle with USSD. Lyon called it a \u201cfractal problem\u201d, where there are no standards in the use of USSD for digital money across Africa. This forces Stax to do a lot of testing on their own and it tends to be arduous. \u201cYou don\u2019t have standard error codes, standard responses; and services change from one user to another.\u201d\n\nOne solution Stax has built is a USSD directory that gives users a comprehensive view of the global USSD landscape. The directory also has a built-in searchable index of USSD services globally to reduce the friction between USSD and users across Africa.\n\nStax\u2019s aim to prioritise user experience and eliminate or reduce data use to drive growth is not new on the continent. Senegalese unicorn, Wave, got a huge slice of the market already dominated by a telco Orange and a fintech Wari, by delivering an excellent customer experience while consuming very little data and maintaining low prices. In fact, Wave is available to users that cannot afford 3G or 4G subscriptions; and users without smartphones can access the app via QR cards.\n\nStax for Africa\n\nWhile Stax\u2019s offline feature has a continental reach, it currently only operates in 11 countries: Ghana, Zambia, South Africa, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Malawi. The company also caters its marketing to each country based on their unique needs, presenting itself as an app that can coexist with popular banking and mobile money practices in each place. In Kenya, for example, Stax promises users that it can help them better manage their M-PESA accounts, easing the process of moving money from M-PESA to their bank accounts by aggregating them all in one place. In Nigeria, where it\u2019s commonplace for one user to have as many as 5 bank accounts, Stax plays up its feature that allows them to organise all their bank accounts in one app.\n\nLyon is under no illusions about the possibility that, eventually, more fintechs will transition into USSD to capture USSD users on the continent, raising the level of competition with Stax. In fact, it is already happening, he said. African fintechs like Barter by Flutterwave, Opay, and Abeg have all built USSD modes into their apps.\n\nHe maintains, however, that Stax is still better positioned to seize the opportunities in the market due to the years\u2014since it launched in 2017\u2014that the company spent building a core USSD infrastructure. Hover agreed with this, which was why Lyon decided in 2020 to pivot the parent company\u2019s attention exclusively to Stax.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, Lyon welcomes competition and inspiration from other companies. He cited True Balance, an Indian payment app that was initially built for users to manage their phone recharge, bill payments, and balances without remembering complicated USSD codes. The app has since expanded its services to help users pay their mobile and electricity bills, added an e-commerce arm as well as credit services, and in the process amassed 60 million users. Stax, Lyon said, has been eyeing the success of True Balance and taking notes.\n\nWhat are the next steps for Stax? The company hopes to become an offline payment super app by embedding third-party services onto its app. It hasn\u2019t started building the infrastructure for that just yet, but its offline payment play is taking off. Stax currently supports more than 100 bank and mobile money services across 9 markets. In Kenya, it works with 30 different banks, M-PESA, and Airtel Money. In Nigeria, it supports all of the major banks and several of the microfinance institutions (MFIs)\n\nAlthough Stax does not support any cross-border payments, pivoting to crypto will allow it to support international transactions. It plans to launch a self-custody USDC wallet, which will allow users to transfer money to anyone with a public address.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn California, it\u2019s Silicon Valley. In Kenya, it\u2019s Silicon Savannah. There are many Silicon Savannahs in Africa. Just think of major African cities with tech hubs, and you\u2019re there. Interestingly, this article is about Joram Mwinamo, someone who is actively participating in the evolution of tech businesses in Kenya and has been part of the entrepreneurship ecosystem since 2007.\n\nIf you spend ten minutes with Joram, he\u2019ll spend eight talking about tech\u2019s potential and how he\u2019s been helping businesses tap into it by helping them make sense of the problem from a human angle.\n\n\u201cHaving that good understanding of human problems and being able to break them down, and then create solutions, and walk backwards to create technology to address the problems, based on the technology that you build, you find that now you\u2019re able to extract data, speed up certain processes, [and] have objective information.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nJoram is a seasoned Kenyan entrepreneur who runs with a school of thought that if a founder is only good at building a product and terrible at everything else, it will affect the startup\u2019s overall success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably one of those people, who, even when we have an extended technology discussion, I discuss more of the non-technology than the technology itself because I find that a lot of technologists look at the tools and solutions a bit too much. I come from a philosophy of looking at the real problems first and then seeing what kind of technology will be helpful in solving it.\u201d\n\nIt was around this that he created his lofty plan \u2014 building 5,000 consortiums across the world. Now, we have to answer a few questions: What drives Joram? What\u2019s unique about his approach? What\u2019s his background? How far has he come?\n\nSetting the ball rolling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nIf you ask Joram about himself, 80% of the time, he\u2019s instinctively talking about how he has played and is still playing his part to support the Kenyan entrepreneurship ecosystem. But that is not all there is to know about him.\n\nDuring our chat, he fondly remembered the small beginnings; however, he is proud of how far he has come. In a little over a decade, Kenya has become a hotspot for the big guns. The country\u2019s capital, Nairobi, houses Microsoft\u2019s first Africa Development Centre, Google\u2019s proposed first Product Development Centre on the continent, and Amazon\u2019s planned AWS Local Zone launch.\n\nGrowing up in a middle-class family in Nairobi, Joram studied computer science at Egerton university. This leaves one wondering why anyone would make such a decision in 2002 when the potential of tech and the importance of the Internet were not appreciated in Africa yet.\n\n\u201cI realise I was introduced to technology a bit early. Because of that experience, I did have some exposure to coding quite early and gotten comfortable with technology. Where my dad, in the work that he used to do, was a civil servant, but somehow he linked up with some South African consultancy, and as a result, we ended up with one or two computers at home, and one was like a mini-computer, and the other one was like one of those really early laptops. I remember tinkering around with it. This was maybe 1995/96.\u201d\n\nAs an undergraduate, his involvement with AIESEC paved the way. The organisation, which focuses on cultural exchange and professional and leadership development, allowed him to work outside his country for two years as a graduate: first in Uganda as a project manager and then in Norway.\n\n\u201cAnd then, when I came back to Kenya, I was still not clear whether I would continue being employed or run a business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before he knew what he wasn\u2019t interested in doing \u2014 being employed for a hardcore tech role. Together with a friend who had a similar tech background, Joram registered a management consulting company called WYLDE International in 2007 after discovering that businesses face challenges primarily because of their owners\u2019 mindsets.\n\nOf drive and eccentricity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nInstead of focusing on hardcore tech requiring coding and building products with his computer science degree, Joram and his friend chose to solve human problems differently by helping businesses make sense of their solutions and unique value propositions. Today he is chasing his passion full steam ahead, with everything he has done to date in pursuit of this dream.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about Joram\u2019s drive, it is majorly about serving others.\n\n\u201cI kept seeing a gap on the human side of interaction with technology. I have always seen that people could be excellent at the technology aspect of building up the codes but terrible at understanding the problems that that code is supposed to go and solve. I\u2019ve been very passionate about promoting individual local solutions to the challenges that businesses face and helping them access the kind of solutions that would help them to grow.\u201d\n\nWith more clients coming in for management consulting, Joram discovered the problem runs deeper than that; it was only a matter of time before Joram decided to do something bigger. And in 2020, Joram co-founded SNDBX, an entrepreneur support hub \u2014 an upgrade from WYLDE. Being ambitious, he needed to create something that would help similarly ambitious entrepreneurs avoid mistakes while building and scaling their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe have a bit of a unique setup. What would traditionally be looked at as an incubator/accelerator? What we have in addition is that we also bring together about 33 different professional services under one roof so that as people build their businesses, they also look for access to things like legal services, governance, HR, marketing, branding, literally everything. We\u2019re able to avail those services as well, and so people can build holistic services that can grow and scale. And of course, this being Nairobi, a lot of these businesses are in the tech space, but we also deal with quite a number of businesses outside of that as well.\u201d\n\nJoram calls it a consortium. Think of it this way, you have an idea for a soon-to-launch business in Kenya, and you need professional advice. When you arrange a meeting with Joram or any of his nine team members and have a discussion, you can access recommended professional services immediately because they are all under the same roof.\n\nA quick reminder that even before SNDBX, Joram was always all about entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch.\n\nAnd this is where his story gets a bit interesting; Joram is not always excited about new technologies because he\u2019s all for the useful tech elements that have a return on investment. However, he has remained relevant by keeping up with the latest trends, especially how they key into the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cEven though I couldn\u2019t code to save my life today, I would be very comfortable in a technology solution conversation, and probably being able to then make the best decision around, for example, which language or which platform or which hardware or software would be best to tackle a specific type of solution.\n\n\u201cI read local and international magazines about just what\u2019s happening out there. I\u2019m subscribed to quite a number of forums online that talk about the trends of what\u2019s happening almost on a daily basis. The podcasts that I listen to, of different authorities around the world or YouTube videos that I watch keep me sufficiently updated.\u201d\n\nSomewhere down the line, Joram picked up and developed human-centred design skills, which he considers very important to what he does.\n\n\u201cCertain human behaviours look simple but understanding them makes [them] more valuable\u2026 and I find out that a lot of people take such thing[s] for granted.\u201d\n\nOf gains and keeping it together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nHe\u2019s excited about the prospects that Africa\u2019s local challenges present. In a breath, he mentioned different ideas he\u2019s been playing around with for Africa\u2019s informal sector: something to make payment seamless for the hawker in traffic, an inventory system for a second-hand clothing vendor, or a solution to fund Africa\u2019s communal life.\n\nUnsurprisingly, stories about how he has helped different businesses steer themselves towards success are at the top of Joram\u2019s success list. He is proud to be helping the continent create more entrepreneurs building multinationals and startups that have gone beyond the continent\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cFor me, one of the most fulfilling things is to see an entrepreneur translate the knowledge that they are learning into actions within the business and then begin to see the growth and hire more business people.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he\u2019s sometimes limited by the challenges facing businesses on the continent.\n\nJoram agrees that being a husband and father of four while being stretched at work can be challenging, but he seems to be managing alright. On a regular day, he drops his kids at school before heading to work, where he meets with his team and customers, responds to emails, and does work-related reading.\n\nDoing most of his work on his phone definitely helps, so he\u2019s available to respond to work in real-time and get things out of the way by delegating while on the move. Evenings are for spending time with his family, exercising, listening to podcasts, and reading; he\u2019s currently writing a book about entrepreneurship which he plans to launch this year.\n\nBy the way, there\u2019s something interesting about how he can maintain a work-life balance. He is calendar-driven, but while calendar scheduling is highly recommended for time management, Joram optimises it to prioritise his family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had to have that philosophy of building in the rocks first. If you look at my digital calendar, I have built in all I do with my family first; those are already built into my calendar, and a lot of people find it surprising that I keep it in my calendar. After building all the family stuff, then I\u2019ll now come back and build in the important work meetings that are recurring. Then after that is when I plan everything else. I also try to have a one-week holiday every quarter.\u201d\n\nWhatsApp and notepad also come in handy to keep communication going and log ideas. Meanwhile, he dreams of a time when there would be 5,000 SNDBXs across major cities worldwide.\n\n\u201cIf I live long enough, we plan to have a SNDBX in every continent, in every country possible. So, the number I have in my head is 5,000 SNDBXs across the world. All the way in the different cities in China, in South America, in the US, in Europe.\u201d\n\nBut he fears not being able to implement the ideas in his head before time runs out. He agrees that this makes him uncomfortable with slow execution.\n\nTalking of his philosophy, Joram says, \u201cAs I\u2019ve grown older, I\u2019ve realised that a lot of what we\u2019re unable to achieve is maybe because of pride or ego, not being able to ask for help. So, I find myself nowadays asking for help a lot and very quickly and very early rather than trying to struggle at something that I\u2019m not very good [at] doing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

The party believes that matches involving national teams like the Springboks \u2014 South Africa\u2019s Rugby squad \u2014 should be made free or at a reduced cost to the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC).\n\nMost importantly, it plans to prohibit the sale of exclusive broadcasting rights.

It also collaborates with logistics partners to ensure that goods are delivered within 24 hours.\n\nInformal retailers can order products through AI-powered channels like SMS, WhatsApp chat, and other apps and have their goods delivered to their stores.\n\nRetailers use the company\u2019s Betastore wallet to repay loans, deposit funds for operations, and send, receive, and save money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe wallet allows them to separate their business money from their personal money. It also enables retailers to receive and send money to any bank and load cash with any agency banking platform.\n\nThe startup says it aims to reach over 10 million informal retail outlets that account for more than 90 percent of the total essential goods trade. Also, it plans to launch its Buy Now, Pay Later financing strategy in July 2022.\n\nThe company wants to enter new markets before the end of the year and expand to 100 cities across Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and Senegal.

They will also receive discounts for future events.\n\nAyoken intends to release NFTs of some major African artistes and others from around the world in the coming months. The startup has already collaborated with Ghanaian Afrobeats artiste, KiDi (Dennis Nana Dwamena) for his first NFT release on June 1, 2022.\n\nMoreover, Ayokenlabs will feature digital collectibles from sports brands, and influencers all over the world.\n\nWhile most of the funds will be used to acquire exclusive licences and to quadruple the size of its tech team, the company plans to use the funds to sign exclusive deals with artistes and partnerships with telcos\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nHow I Work: Peace Itimi, Digital Marketing Professional and Trainer\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills.

Emmanuel did not spare a moment to state how much he will not be able to afford $110 (\u20a666,000) for Internet every month.\n\nPrice is one thing but the impact of these satellites on the planet is another very big issue. Emmanuel gives the geeky details on why too many satellites orbiting the Earth closely could have cataclysmic repercussions.\n\nAway from SpaceX, DStv is getting some heat in its home country, South Africa. The African National Congress (ANC), South Africa\u2019s ruling political party, wants to ban the satellite TV service from having exclusive rights to broadcast national sporting events.\n\nBut can this really happen? Chimgozirim points out that the cable TV service gets some of these rights for as much as $200 million every five years, the type of money most services don\u2019t have.\n\nThe interesting question, however, is where does DStv get this money?

The ongoing sale is being held auction style using its native token, $VHC.\n\nAs part of the land sale, a free HTC VIVE Flow VR glasses will be given per parcel of land bought. However, to ensure scarcity and value, a limited number of virtual land (VLAND) parcels have been made available for purchase due to the high number already sold during the private sale round.\n\nLand parcels are currently being sold in the Vitality and Play districts of the metaverse, and using Vault Hill\u2019s interactive map, prospective land buyers and those who already participated in the private land sale can view which districts still have available VLAND. The map can also be used to explore the brands and creators that have already purchased land in the metaverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe VHC land parcels are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) built on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-721) which are unique and distinct. The land has been grouped into four categories\u2013 standard, premium, deluxe and exclusive \u2013 each with their own unique offering.\n\nThe exclusive land type for instance can be merged to form a cluster of up to 8 land parcels, and it also has a courtyard in its center. Not only will Exclusive landowners benefit from a prime location, but owners of all 8 parcels that form a cluster have a unique advantage of monetising the courtyard to the limits of their imagination. Owners could erect a billboard in the courtyard, or even stadiums, conference centers, art installation, etc.\n\nOne of the many benefits of being a virtual land owner in VHC is that VHC is the first virtual world that combines all aspects of users\u2019 reality leveraging seven basic human instincts to enhance experiences in the metaverse. It is also the first virtual world with urban planning and development benefits to ensure users build on their virtual land respectfully.\n\nAdditionally, land owners will be given a \u2018NO CODE\u2019 builder tool which gives them total creative freedom to build their desired edifice without having to learn a single line of code. These edifices could range from cinemas, fitness studios, museums, libraries, event centers, etc. There are limitless opportunities for land owners in VHC be it individual investors or brands seeking to establish their presence in web3.\n\nVisit Vault Hill\u2019s marketplace now for your chance to own a piece of the world\u2019s first human-centric metaverse. Further information regarding the land sale can be found here and the metaverse development timeline can be viewed in the whitepaper. Updates can be gotten in real-time via the social pages \u2013 Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, Discord\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

Through its native token CSV, Cassava transforms any web application into a crypto-enabled app suitable to reward contributors and end-users for their dedication. Their product offering consists of token rewards networks, digital identification systems, user-controlled data profiles, and a crypto and NFT wallet specifically designed to empower content creators.\n\nAs such, Cassava is a new incentives platform for Africans and the regional market, as CSV will enable projects, content creators including NFT artists, video creators, and content consumers to earn rewards in innovative ways through play-to-earn, create-to-earn, and engage-to-earn models. Additionally, it will offer CSV holders a portfolio of incentives, including lending, staking, AMM, and voting rights for platform governance.\n\nWhy Cassava Network?\n\nCassava offers a unique opportunity for African creatives to build digital economies, protect their intellectual properties and connect with the global market at large, through an easy-to-use multifunctional wallet that can be integrated with apps for user incentivization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cassava Network\u2019s PR Director, Kelin said \u201cCassava Network will use the investment capital to expand and improve its technological capabilities in order to leverage the Web3 economy to drive crypto mass adoption across Africa and beyond. The next phase of Cassava development will include a multi-chain wallet that incentivizes users, an African-focused NFT Marketplace, and a rewards system that pays users for transacting and using apps in Cassava\u2019s ecosystem. \u201d\n\nThe market opportunity in the African creative space is enormous. Africa has one of the youngest and fastest-growing populations, as well as the highest proportion of entrepreneurs among its working-class adults. Cassava is designed for the innovative youth seeking pan-African connectivity, and a global reach that will translate into sustainable, income-generating opportunities.\n\nWith regards to the global blockchain market, Africa alone is expected to possess a 30% market share and grow from a $1.1 billion market in 2020 to a $134.9 billion market by 2028.\n\n\u201cEMURGO Africa is excited to support the development of Cassava Network\u2019s innovative content rewards ecosystem. We firmly believe Africa is a huge market full of bright potential that can lead the way to spur large user growth and demonstrate the real benefits of a flourishing Web3 economy,\u201d said Shogo Ishida, Executive Director for the Middle East & Africa at EMURGO Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about this partnership, which will help fund the revolutionary DeFi tool, which enables mobile applications to migrate to web 3.0 functionality that rewards content creation and user engagement. We are inspired and driven by projects with a strong use case, a resilient founder, and a long term vision to bring change to socio-economic challenges in Africa\u201d said Vincent Li Founding Partner at Adaverse.\n\nAbout Adaverse\n\nAdaverse is a Cardano-focused joint accelerator initiative \u2014 set up with the collaboration of EMURGO Africa, a subsidiary of EMURGO, the official commercial arm of the Cardano protocol, and Everest Ventures Group, a leading blockchain industry accelerator \u2014 looking to build the infrastructure of the projected $139.4 billion African blockchain market by 2028.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called for doctors\u2019 collaboration to sustain reforms in the healthcare sector, ensuring a resilient and equitable system to deliver efficient, quality and affordable healthcare services to Edo people.\n\nObaseki gave the charge when he received the new executives of the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) at the Hospital Management Agency, who were on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nThe governor, who noted that he is pursuing a holistic reform in the sector and putting in place mechanisms to discourage manpower for healthcare delivery from leaving the country, urged the doctors to support the government\u2019s effort at strengthening the system and curbing the brain drain in the health sector.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe need more doctors, particularly with the way the doctors are traveling out for greener pastures. What we need is to strengthen the institutions that produce doctors. We are strengthening our educational system to produce more doctors.\u201d\n\nNoting that his administration is tackling the age-old challenges in the health sector such as dearth of modern medical equipment, decaying healthcare infrastructure, inadequate personnel and poor funding, Obaseki stated, \u201cThe system we inherited and structure put in place at that time was meant for that time but today the society has changed, leading to the reforms in our medical sector. We must rethink the sector we inherited.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cMedical healthcare is global and standardized and as such, we need to measure up. We need to restructure our healthcare system in the state. The COVID-19 pandemic is an eye-opener for us as everyone was restricted from moving around. The lesson is that we must fix our healthcare system.\n\n\u201cWe have insisted on healthcare reforms. This is why I brought down the central hospital to decentralize the healthcare system in the state, ensuring that there is at least one healthcare facility in every community to ensure healthcare is closer to the people.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on how to produce more doctors by strengthening the basic education system and giving quality education to produce more doctors for the state. We need more than 200 new doctors in the system, who will be in the community to take charge of the PHCs across the state and must be motivated and encouraged to stay here.\u201d\n\nReacting to the doctor\u2019s request to be included in the N40,000 new minimum wage, the governor said, \u201cDoctors are special breeds of civil servants and earn more and should not be asking for minimum wage. You are civil servants but the only set of civil servants who earn more than the governor. A consultant in your system earns twice what I earn as a governor. Why should you be asking for minimum wage? What the government did is to help those at the bottom because people go through a lot every day.\n\n\u201cThe wage is to help those at the bottom to pass the poverty threshold. Certainly, there are allowances due to you but subject to negotiation. We don\u2019t like making promises we cannot fulfill as a government. This is one of the quarrels we have with the federal government. You can\u2019t go and negotiate a labour contract and impose it on us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Edo, we respect labour which is why we have not had any strike regarding allowances or wages in the state as the welfare of our workers is important to us,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the leader of the delegation and president of the association, Dr. Uaboi Ovbiagele commended the governor for the holistic reforms in the healthcare sector, pledging their support to sustain reforms in the sector.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By our correspondent\n\nNew Materials Nigeria Company, a building material company recently commissioned in the Kuje area of Abuja will save Nigeria a whopping sum of $100m in foreign exchange annually when fully operational, its Managing Director, Mr. Jackie Dai Hui has said.\n\nBriefing newsmen on the advantages of establishing the company in Nigeria, Mr. Jackie said it is estimated that when the company which produces Fiber Cement Board reaches its peak of about five million square meters annually; it would help the federal government save $100m in foreign exchange.\n\nHe explained that if the New Materials Nigeria Company succeeds, it will, within 10 years, invest in more companies and product lines especially in the area of production of Gypsum and Solar panels for alternative power generation.\n\nSpeaking further, the Managing Director said that so far, over $50 million has been invested in the New Materials Nigeria Company explaining that in no distant time, it will grow its investment in Nigeria by establishing a branch in Lagos.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of the New Materials Nigeria Company has gone a long way to provide employment to 150 Nigerians both at senior and junior levels who he said are also being trained in various skills.\n\n\u201cWe have management and junior staff. Our Human Resource Manager is Nigerian; our Office Manager is a Nigerian and our Shift Leader also is a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThese are top management positions. We train Nigerians to run the company; we are transferring technology to those who are brilliant. Today you may see some Chinese but next time you come you won\u2019t see Chinese, you will only see Nigerians here.\n\n\u201cWe want to share. Not like other foreign companies where all the top management staff are foreigners and Nigerians left to do the labour work. We have moved beyond that.\n\n\u201cWe have to treat Nigerians who have the desire to work with our company well and encourage them to build a career. We have administrators, we have technicians, we have general labour, we have managers and we have shift leaders.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning, later we will give them more platforms, maybe one day when we have branches in Kano, ECOWAS countries like Cameroun; we can send Nigerians there to be Directors. This is what we do. We grow together for a shared future.

          "text": "BY ONU OKORIE\n\nLagos: May 26, 2022: To encourage and simplify vehicle ownership for personal use by millions of Nigerians, First City Monument Bank (FCMB) now offers auto loans of up to N30 million at a reduced interest rate. The FCMB auto loan supports acquiring brand new and pre-owned vehicles (popularly known as \u201cTokunbo\u201d), with N500,000 as the minimum loan amount that a customer can access for a repayment duration of up to 5 years.\n\nThis affirms FCMB\u2019s commitment to improving the social well-being of individuals and enhancing access to credit for higher standard of living for families.\n\nCommenting on the unique value proposition, Divisional Head, Personal Banking of the Bank, Mr Shamsideen Fashola, said, \u201cvehicle ownership is one of the most exciting moments in a person\u2019s life. Yet, many people struggle to save up for a long time to make this dream come true. To bridge this gap, we created a value proposition that is flexible, convenient and empowers individuals, families and businesses to achieve the dream of vehicle ownership. Nigerians can now finance their dream vehicle with an auto loan from FCMB at a low-interest rate with monthly or yearly payment options depending on their income. We, therefore, urge the populace, including, but not limited to salaried individuals, to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfil their vehicle ownership dream\u201d.\n\nFCMB Auto Loan empowers qualified Nigerians to part-finance the purchase of brand-new and pre-owned vehicles while spreading the repayment between one and five years. The loan, which is dependent on the type of vehicle to be purchased, is open to salaried individuals and self-employed Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the number of registered vehicles in Nigeria is 13 million. However, vehicle ownership in the country has been declining because of increased prices. This is due to foreign exchange and importation challenges, leading to a drastic reduction in purchasing power and sales decline in the auto industry.\n\nA purpose beyond profit commercial banking institution, First City Monument Bank is a member of FCMB Group Plc, led by Ladi Balogun as Group Chief Executive. The Bank is committed to COVID-19 recovery, income equality and poverty reduction by easing credit constraints to disadvantaged individuals and small businesses. The intervention of FCMB in the automobile sector aligns with Goals 3 and 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus on well-being and reduced inequalities.",

Many spent the night camped at the high-altitude site.\n\n\u2013 On holiday \u2013\n\nThe cause of the crash has yet to be confirmed, but Pokhara Airport spokesman Dev Raj Subedi said on Monday that the aircraft operated by Nepali carrier Tara Air did not catch fire in the air.\n\nFour Indians and two Germans in their fifties were onboard the twin-prop aircraft, along with 16 Nepalis, including a computer engineer, his wife and their two daughters who had just returned from the United States.\n\nThe four Indians were a divorced couple and their daughter and son, aged 15 and 22, on a family holiday.\n\n\u201cThere was a court order for (the father) to spend time with the family for 10 days every year, so they were taking a trip,\u201d Indian police official Uttam Sonawane told AFP.\n\n\u2013 Poor safety record \u2013\n\nAccording to the Aviation Safety Network website, the aircraft was made by Canada\u2019s de Havilland and took its first flight more than 40 years ago.\n\nTara Air is a subsidiary of Yeti Airlines, a privately owned domestic carrier that services many remote destinations across Nepal.\n\nIt suffered its last fatal accident in 2016 on the same route when a plane with 23 onboard crashed into a mountainside.\n\nNepal\u2019s air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.\n\nBut it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance.\n\nThe European Union has banned all Nepali airlines from its airspace over safety concerns.\n\nThe Himalayan country also has some of the world\u2019s most remote and tricky runways, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots.\n\nThe weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.\n\nIn March 2018, a US-Bangla Airlines plane crash-landed near Kathmandu\u2019s notoriously difficult international airport, killing 51 people and seriously injuring 20.\n\nThat accident was Nepal\u2019s deadliest since 1992, when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane died when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport.\n\nJust two months earlier a Thai Airways aircraft had crashed near the same airport, killing 113 people.",

The truth remains that people will throw up everything and anything. I am not particularly accepting that the process was monetized excessively, safe for those that can be proven. If you are looking for Political parties that dollarises and criminalises the process, it\u2019s APC. Nobody should try to blackmail or take anything from our primary that is adjudged to be best.\u201d\n\nMr Sowunmi who also spoke on the allegation that emergency of Atiku Abubakar as the candidate of the party is against the clamour for power shift to the South, said \u201cthe whole concept of zoning is a party affairs and must not be seen as constitutional. The country is divided into six zones and we must not just think it is three zones of the South against the north. The emergence of Atiku has not affected Nigeria\u2019s unity, rather the burden of unity lies with APC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the strengthen of its candidate, Mr Sowunmi stated that Atiku Abubakar is a pan-Nigerian who will represent the interest of all Nigerians irrespective of their tribe or religion.\n\nThe governorship candidate, however cautioned cultural groups like PANDEF, Arewa Consultative Forum, Afenifere and others to steer clear of political matters and allow political parties manage its affairs. \u201d I have advised that PANDEF, Arewa, Afenifere and others need to be told not to jump into political matters as if they are political parties. They should not be seen usurping the powers of political parties.\u201d\n\nOn whether the party has the capacity to manage the fallout of the presidential primary, Mr Sowunmi noted that PDP will reach out to everybody and reconcile all groups, while nothing that there are no dissenting voices.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the party to present a candidate. If there is an equity challenge, nobody should address that to PDP rather the APC, because it has only produced its president from the northwest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am telling Nigerians that politics is not for the lily-livered. What happened at the primary is that delegates voted for a unifier.\n\nOn zoning, Mr Sowunmi said \u201cI have maintained consistently that the place of birth is just an accident of history that no one can repair. The only equity challenge that we have is the Southeast because the region has not been able to produce president.\n\n\u201cSometimes, the political gladiators from the other side will always wish that only crises will exits from the camp of their rivals, but hello, you can go to the bank with this, the political process from \u2018tomorrow\u2019 will show that PDP is a big party. We\u2019ll hug ourselves and unite one another\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am telling Nigerians that your darling party is back, we have given you a darling candidate that you know well, Even with the congratulatory message from Asiwaju, it shows that he knows the worth of Atiku.

          "text": "A former Senator representing Kogi West, Dino Melaye has expressed satisfaction with the conduct and outcome of the 2022 Presidential primary of the People\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\nThe former lawmaker stated this on Monday while featuring on TVC\u2019s current affairs program, Journalists\u2019 Hangout.\n\nMr Melaye equally expressed his confidence in the party\u2019s ability to wrestle power from the APC government in 2023.\n\nAccording to him, the convention produced the best candidate to fly the party\u2019s flag in a free and fair contest that every participant is proud of.\n\nSpeaking about his defeat at the party\u2019s senatorial primary, the former lawmaker said all that happened at the election has become history and doesn\u2019t want to discuss it again. \u201cI have moved on. All that happened in the Senate rerun have become history. I really don\u2019t what to dwell on the past. That primary has gone and I have moved on.\u201d\n\nMr Melaye also spoke about his performance while serving as Kogi West senator. \u201cAs a Senator, in terms of representation, I did my best because I implemented so many projects. In the history of National Assembly, I have the highest number of bills. The records are there, they are incontrovertible. I did my best for my people.\u201d\n\nReacting to question about his switch of support from the former Senator President, Bukola Saraki to former Vice Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, the former lawmaker made it clear that he never switched support. He explained that he supported Saraki 100% while he was with him. \u201c I did not switch support from Saraki to Atiku. I was 100% with Saraki when I was with him. I have no problem with Saraki, I still saw him this morning and we both laughed together.\n\n\u201cI chose Atiku time because I have to stay with the known to the unknown. At this time, we need a unifier, who can unite Nigeria. One who cannot be seen as a Muslim, or Christian. Atiku is a popular person whose name is known every in Nigeria. So I moved from unknown to known. So, I did not switch support but support the man who can make Nigeria great.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Melaye dismissed the rumour that Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal betrayed his colleague and fellow aspirant, Nyesom Wike when the former announced his withdrawer from the contest and directed his delegates to vote Atiku Abubakar. He said governor Tambuwal did not betray Mr Wike as there was no written agreement between the two of them. He added that both former aspirants worked independently in pursuit of their ambition. He equally dismissed the insinuation that there was a gang up by some northern elites against the South.\n\n\u201cGovernor Tambuwal saw the necessity to elect a candidate that can unite Nigeria because our dear nation needs a father figure who can unite everyone. Someone who will be able to unite Nigeria and that person is Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\u201cAlhaji Atiku is sound and healthy, politically sagacious and intellectually sound. Atiku will not fail, he will win with landslide. Whatever APC is going to do in terms of manipulation, Atiku is the next president of Nigeria. Our convention has shown that we are more united that ever. We are on big family,\u201d Melaye said.\n\nThe Kogi-born former lawmaker who also spoke on the economy, said it is obvious to everyone that Nigeria is in serious economic distress as prices of goods and services increase alarmingly everyday. According to him, the prices of common goods such as bread, rice, air ticket among others are increasing almost everyday, thereby making life more difficult for Nigerians. \u201cNigerians have engaged both APC and PDP and they know the difference. So, I am confident Nigerians will vote PDP in 2023.\u201d\n\nEconomically, everything has risen such that cost of living has gone up astronomically.\u201d\n\nOn the fight against corruption, Mr Melaye said in the history of Nigeria, there\u2019s no government that is as corrupt as the present Buhari administration. He alleged that people loot brazenly under Buhari administration without consequence. \u201d It is a known fact that tis government is corrupt, people are looting without limitation. Look at the case of the suspended accountant general of the federation who is accused of stealing more than N80bn. There cannot be such thing under Atiku Administration.\u201d\n\nDefection\n\nSenator Dino Melaye argued that most of the governors who defected from PDP to APC are in their second term. He queried why those governors didn\u2019t do so in their first term in office.\n\n\u201d Those defecting from PDP to APC are doing so to protect themselves because they know once they cross to the party, their sins are forgiven. But I can tell you for sure that APC cannot win counsellorship election in a free fair and credible elections in Nigeria again.\u201d\n\nMr Melaye who boasted that PDP is now one big and united family, said all aggrieved parties will be brought back under one big umbrella because Atiku is a father figure. \u201d Atiku is matured, he will unite Nigerians. Everyone will have a bite of national cake. Everybody will benefit from Atiku\u2019s government not only those in his campaign. He urged Nigerians to come out and vote Atiku in order to bring Nigeria back to the path of development.\u201d\n\nWike vs Atiku\n\nReacting to the insinuations that governor Wike will not give total support to Atiku Abubakar\u2019s ambition, Mr Melaye said he believes Mr Wike is a man of his words who has promised to support whoever emerged candidate of the party.\n\nGovernor Wike says what he meant and mean what he says. I believe he will support his party because he\u2019s a party man. I appeal to journalists not to sow seed of discord in our party. By the grace of God, success awaits us in 2023.\n\nSpeaking on the alleged supremacy battle between North and South at the presidential primary, Mr Melaye accused APC of spreading such fake news. He said contrary to opinions of many, Kano and Katsina voted for Governor Wike while Delta voted for Atiku. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like North versus South in this contest, it\u2019s just the creation of APC. There was no tribal war, the delegates voted according to their conscience.\u201d\n\nOn the strength of his party and its candidate, the former lawmaker said \u201d the least of PDP aspirant will defeat all aspirants in APC. We are not afraid of any aspirants. Both the president and other aspirants on the platform of APC will be defeated by Atiku. He touted Mr Kolade-Otitoju to swear with Bible that PDP did not win the 2019 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWhere in a peculiar time in our history where we have to choose between winning and zoning. We have decided to acquire power before sharing power. So we decided to throw it open to acquire power before sharing power,\u201d Mr Melaye said while reacting to the choice of a northern candidate.\n\nSenator Melaye said former vice president Atiku Abubakar is a strong and mature candidate who is competent enough to deliver on his cardinal objectives which include unity of purpose, security, State building and nation building, devolution of power, economy and restructuring.",

At one point, U.S. crude rose to $119.42 per barrel \u2014 a 12-week high, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nContracts for August also traded higher: WTI crude rose 3.21% to $115.83, and Brent was up 1.63% to $119.53 per barrel.\n\nThe agreement resolves a deadlock after Hungary initially held up talks. Hungary is a major user of Russian oil and its leader, Viktor Orban, has been on friendly terms with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.\n\nCharles Michel, president of the European Council, said the move would immediately hit 75% of Russian oil imports.\n\nThe sanctions will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports. And by the end of the year, 90% of the Russian oil imported in Europe will be banned.\n\nThe embargo is part of the European Union\u2019s sixth sanctions package on Russia since it invaded Ukraine. Talks to impose an oil embargo have been underway since the start of the month.\n\n\u201cThe European Council agrees that the sixth package of sanctions against Russia will cover crude oil, as well as petroleum products, delivered from Russia into Member States, with a temporary exception for crude oil delivered by pipeline,\u201d according to a May 31 statement from the European Council.\n\nThe European Council added that in case of \u201csudden interruptions\u201d of supply, \u201cemergency measures\u201d will be introduced to ensure security of supply.\n\nThat temporary exception covers the remaining Russian oil not yet banned, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a press conference.\n\n\u201cWe have agreed that the Council will revert to the topic as soon as possible in one way or the other. So this is a topic where we will come back to and where we will still have to work on, but this is a big step forward, what we did today,\u201d she said, referring to the temporary exemption.\n\nVon der Leyen explained that the temporary exemption was granted so that Hungary, along with Slovakia and the Czech Republic \u2014 all connected to the southern leg of the pipeline \u2014 have access which they cannot easily replace.\n\nRoughly 36% of the EU\u2019s oil imports come from Russia, a country that plays an outsized role in global oil markets.",

          "text": "In its first official reaction to the adjustment of the general election guidelines, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Monday, said it did not act unilaterally or out of sync in adjusting the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the conduct of the 2023 general election by a few days.\n\nThe commission also took a swipe at the PDP, which has cancelled all its primary elections in Ebonyi State, saying, \u201cSome of the political parties that criticised the commission despite being part of the pleas for a little adjustment are now taking advantage of and seizing the opportunity of the 6 days grace period or window they criticised to put their house in order by conducting their outstanding primaries.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the national commissioner in charge of Information and Chairman, Voter Education, Festus Okoye, said, \u201cThe Commission understands the mood of the nation and assures Nigerians that going forward, it is determined to follow through with its timelines embedded in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is focused and determined to conduct free, fair and transparent election in 2023,\u201d Okoye added.\n\nAccording to him, the commission was resolute and would not in any way tamper with the critical timelines in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities, adding: \u201cThe Commission did not act unilaterally or under any form of pressure or duress in the 6-day grace period granted to the 18 registered political parties.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that on May 10, 2022, the Commission held a consultative meeting with the leaders of all the 18 registered Political Parties. At the meeting, the political parties requested for an adjustment of the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThey requested for 60 days and the Commission turned it down. Thereafter, the political parties requested for a shift of 37 days and the commission turned it down.\n\n\u201cAt the consultative meeting, where the parties made the request, some of them accused the Commission of endangering democracy by refusing to alter the Timetable and Schedule of Activities. They insisted that they may not have candidates in so many of the constituencies unless they are given a grace period.\n\n\u201cOf course, the period for the primaries had started as at the time the political parties unanimously made the request. By the Timetable and Schedule of Activities, the period for the primaries commenced on the 4th of April 2022 and to end on the 3rd of June 2022. None of the Political Parties accused the Commission of shifting the goal post at the middle of the game.\n\n\u201cOn the 12th of May 2022, the political parties wrote to the Commission once again requesting for an adjustment of the timelines and the Commission turned down their request. None of the political parties accused IPAC of acting unilaterally or not representing them.\n\n\u201cOn the 26th of May 2022, the political parties under the auspices of the Inter Party Advisory Council, wrote to the Commission and requested for a meeting to hold on the 27th day of May 2022. IPAC invited their members to the meeting. 15 of the registered Political Parties attended the meeting.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting of the 27th May 2022, they informed the Commission that they used their own network to invite all the registered political parties. They once again requested for an adjustment of the timelines on grounds that they have problems.\n\n\u201cThey pleaded and canvassed that the Electoral Act 2022 was being operated for the first time and that most of them have made mistakes in the conduct of their primaries. They pleaded with the Commission to show some magnanimity to enable them have crisis-free primaries and avoid avoidable litigation,\u201d the INEC national commissioner stated.\n\nHe explained that instead of 37 to 60 days, the political parties pleaded for only six days between the 3rd June and the commencement of the upload of nomination forms on our web portal on 10th June 2022.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, not true and cannot by any stretch of imagination be insinuated that the commission bowed to pressure. The commission granted a request and headed the plea by all the political parties in Nigeria to use the six days already provided in the Timetable of which all the parties were aware of.\n\n\u201cA passionate plea by political parties for what they called a little adjustment cannot by any stretch of imagination be termed bowing to pressure. Furthermore, the six days grace period extended to the political parties will not in any way affect any of the timelines in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities of the Commission.\n\n\u201cThere is no longer any window to play with or any little adjustment to be made. Political parties may find out to their disappointment that they may have no candidates in constituencies, where they are unable to conduct or conclude their congresses and democratic primaries as provided by the Electoral Act 2020. We remind all Political Parties of what happened in some States (Rivers and Zamfara) in 2019,\u201d Okoye said.",

          "text": "The Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has called for global solidarity in responding to crises facing the world, especially the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe DG in a statement issued by WTO on Monday, underlined the important role the global trade body could play in helping to tackle pressing issues such as growing food insecurity, the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, supply chain disruptions and dwindling fisheries resources.\n\nIt pointed out that at a Forum at the recently held World Economic Forum, the DG said a theme common to all the major crises facing the world today was the fact that no single country would be able to resolve the challenges on its own.\n\n\u201cYou cannot have resilience unless you have global solidarity,\u201d she told participants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s survival together, it\u2019s supporting each other, it\u2019s financing together, it\u2019s recognising that my resilience cannot happen unless your resilience also happens.\u201d\n\nThe DG reminded participants that world leaders created a set of institutions after the Second World War based on the idea of solidifying international interdependence and solidarity and using these institutions to help solve problems of the global commons.\n\n\u201cWe have the institutions, we just have not reformed them to be able to deal with these issues, and my institution, the WTO, is one that I think needs to be made fit for purpose,\u201d she declared.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Director-General also participated in a discussion on challenges to trade with European Union Trade Commissioner, Valdis Dombrovskis and Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal.\n\nDuring the discussion, the DG noted that at the MC12, the WTO members would be addressing many crisis issues. These, she said would include the WTO\u2019s response to the pandemic, both in terms of addressing trade and health measures, and of a waiver to WTO intellectual property rules for vaccine production; concluding more than two decades of negotiations on an agreement to eliminate harmful fisheries subsidies; setting the path for future work on agricultural reform; and launching the process for discussions on WTO reform.\n\n\u201cMembers will also seek to address food security fears by looking at what steps can be taken to facilitate trade\u2019s central role in ensuring that food is available to those in need, while also addressing the concerns of producers regarding the need to ensure sufficient domestic supply.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to agree to things multilaterally, and that has been plaguing the WTO. We shouldn\u2019t make light of it. That\u2019s why we need to find ways forward to agree on some things to show that the organisation can function,\u201d she added.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala also underlined the urgent need to address global warming and its impacts during a Forum discussion on climate change.\n\nShe said climate change should not be sidelined as the world grapples with other immediate challenges.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of inaction are in front of us every day, on every continent, in so many countries,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that we\u2019re in a world of simultaneous crises, climate change, food, the pandemic, international security, but I don\u2019t think we can prioritize one over the other because they\u2019re all linked, they\u2019re all crises of the global commons.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Timipre Sylva has said IOCs were leaving Nigeria because the environment was becoming too volatile for their operations.\n\nIn an interview with The Energy Year, a market intelligence organisation, Sylva stated that Nigeria\u2019s situation had become, \u201cprecarious\u201d because of the multitude of challenges besetting the oil sector.\n\nThe minister noted that while Nigeria was tackling the challenges, the damage being done by vandals was eroding investors\u2019 confidence in the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cOur biggest problem is the insecurity of our pipelines. There is a lot of pollution due to oil theft and pipeline vandalism, which has placed us in a precarious situation. It is one of the biggest reasons why IOCs leave Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey (IOCs) feel that our industry is becoming too volatile and a significant polluter. The criminals who rupture our pipelines to set up illegal refineries which are not regulated are seriously damaging our environment.\n\n\u201cIt is our duty to ensure that we can tackle this issue, which is mainly a question of law and order rather than production. Once solved, all the production that has been lost will get to our tanks, while restoring investors\u2019 confidence in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the minister, while the goal was to restore Nigeria as the leading crude oil producer in Africa, if the country could tackle security and technical issues, it should be able to ramp up production to 2.6 million bpd, and in the long run, boost it to three million bpd.\n\nDescribing fuel subsidies as, \u201cthe biggest impediment to the growth of the downstream sector,\u201d Sylva stated that nobody wants to invest in an industry where they cannot even recover their cost of production.\n\nOn the projections for growth, Sylva noted that the Dangote Refinery would come on stream by the end of the year plus a significant number of modular refineries which are also coming on line as well as the rehabilitations of the refineries which are expected to boost local refining.\n\n\u201cOnce the subsidies are removed and these projects are operational, a golden period for the Nigerian downstream sector will begin,\u201d he maintained.\n\nHe reiterated that Nigeria has not been able to meet its production quota because it was finding it difficult to restart oil wells it shut down in the heat of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, OPEC asked us to bring down production because oil prices were at a historical low. Unfortunately, Nigerian reservoirs react in a particular way, and when you want to shut down 100,000 bpd, you end up shutting down 300,000 bpd to achieve the desired 100,000 bpd. As a consequence, the drop has been drastic,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that as a country, Nigeria was not taking full advantage of the high oil prices because production is not meeting expectations.\n\n\u201cWe are now in a very disturbing situation where we cannot meet our OPEC quota, but we are working assiduously on this by looking at all the relevant issues. For example, we are tackling the problem of crude oil theft, which has seriously affected our production,\u201d he said.\n\nOn local content, he pointed out that Nigeria has made significant progress in 10 years, growing local participation in the oil and gas sector from 3 per cent to 35 per cent, saying that a target of 70 per cent has been set for the near future.\n\nHe added that the concluded 2020 marginal field bid round will bring local companies into the production space by allowing them to learn how to operate with smaller fields and prepare them to take over any assets divested by IOCs.",
