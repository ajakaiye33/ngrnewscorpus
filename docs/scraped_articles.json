          "title": "Train attack: Relatives give FG 72-hr ultimatum to rescue victims",
          "text": "Relatives of the kidnapped victims of the terror attack on a Kaduna bound train from Abuja have accused the Federal Government of insensitivity towards the plight of the victims two weeks after the incident.\n\nThey also said that since the incident, the Nigerian Railway Corporation had yet to reach out to them on efforts made to rescue the kidnapped victims.\n\nConsequently, the relatives handed down a 72-hour ultimatum to the Federal Government to ensure the safe rescue of their beloved ones from the den of the terrorists, adding that failure to listen to them, would force them to decide on how to rescue their loved ones.\n\nThey stated this shortly after their meeting on Monday in Kaduna, adding also that they had yet to be contacted by the terrorists for negotiation.\n\nDr Abdulfatai Jimoh, who led and spoke on behalf of the kidnapped relatives, said they were yet to establish contact with their beloved ones or even the hoodlums since the incident on March 28, 2022.\n\nAccording to him, it is better for the government goes into negotiation with the terrorists as they have demanded in a recent viral video, to secure the release of their loved ones alive.\n\nThis, he said, was not out of place since the federal government seemed incapacitated to protect the lives and property of the citizens.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis incident happened on the 28 of March, a day or two after, most of had communication without relatives. The kidnappers said that we should be ready that they are going to contact us. And we have not heard any communication from them since then.\n\n\u201cSince this incident happened, we expected that by now, the government, the Nigerian Railway Corporation and the Federal Ministry of Transportation are supposed to have identified relatives of the victims to tell us what effort they are making or not to rescue our loved ones unhurt.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the primary duty of any government is to protect the lives and property of citizens. We believe our government can do it and it\u2019s capable of doing it, until a few days ago we had been expecting telephone calls from the abductors because that\u2019s what they promised us but when we saw the video, they made it very clear that they want to discuss with the government; that they have something with the government.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they want from the government. But it\u2019s now an opportunity and a window for the government to rescue our loved ones by opening a channel of communication with them(terrorists). This is not out of place. It is done anywhere in the world.\n\n\u201cEven the US, Israel and the most powerful nations of the world, do negotiate when they have issues like this to preserve the lives of their citizens. This, we know our government can do and we are appealing to them to do it. We don\u2019t know what is between them but it is something that can be resolved in the interest of the lives of Nigerian citizens. Life is very sacred even if it is one life that\u2019s involved.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the Nigerian government to do everything within its powers and it is something that\u2019s not beyond the government to do. We are appealing to them to come out to open a channel of discussion with the bandits and get our loved ones out as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cWe have been in serious anguish in the past 15 days. Many of us have not been sleeping, we have not been sleeping. We are like living corpses. We have decided collectively that we are giving the government 72 hours to do everything necessary to rescue our loved ones.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Nigeria in a sorry state \u2014 Ex-Katsina Gov, Shehu Shema",
          "text": ".\n\nBy Ogalah Ibrahim\n\nConsidering the ongoing local government election in Katsina State which began today, coupled with other problems bedevilling the country, a former Governor of the state, Barrister Ibrahim Shehu Shema has said that the country is in a sorry state, alleging monumental fraud in the exercise.\n\nShema expressed shock over alleged acts of illegality in the exercise, noting that he cannot understand why materials were reported having left the Central Bank of Nigeria premise in Katsina between 8 am \u2013 10 am yesterday, Sunday and escorted to their various destinations in the 34 LGAs by party representatives could have been diverted supposedly by those in government, citing instances of places like Kankara, Bakori and a number of other places.\n\nThe former Governor described the Katsina Local Government election as a scam and a shame on APC administration at the state and central levels.\n\nShema who registered his displeasure over the conduct of the local government election in the state while speaking with a team of pressmen at his Dutsin-ma resident said:\n\n\u201cI am totally disappointed in the APC administration in Katsina State. Indeed in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s state, it will be a shame if the Local Government election cannot be conducted correctly, freely, fairly, giving equal opportunity to all Nigerians and Katsina people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a lot of the polling units, I have discovered that, like in Mashi LGA, the returning officer is a card-carrying member of APC and on top of that they took ballot papers to the different units but without result sheets.\n\n\u201cThey are holding the result sheet to return to government house to meet Aminu Bello Masari and his cohorts to fill these forms and tell Nigerians that election has been conducted.\n\n\u201cThis is not an election. This is a sham. it\u2019s a shame on APC nationwide and a shame internationally that they can\u2019t hold a common local government election.\n\nShema recalled how \u201cthe same Aminu Bello Masari, dissolved a duly elected local government council of the PDP extraction under his administration before the supreme court of Nigeria declared the action as illegal, unconstitutional, null and avoid, compelling him to pay them their due entitlement for the time they were supposed to be in office.\n\n\u201cThis kind of action should not go unpunished in this country.\n\nNigeria belongs to Nigerians. It doesn\u2019t belong to any small group of people who think they can manipulate and mess around the life of this country,\u201d\n\nShema said\n\nFor the country to make any meaningful progress, Shema said there must be a change from this kind of leadership:\n\nIn his words:\n\n\u201cAre we going to continue like this? How can democracy, rule of law, and our economy grow under this kind of activity that does not even respect the people of this country?\n\n\u201cI am hugely disappointed at the government of Aminu Bello Masari and those who are behind him to carry on with this unlimited illegality. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nNonetheless, concerning their next line of action on the April 11 local government election, the former Governor said: \u201cour people are there and will insist on the election being conducted. They will insist on results being entered into the venue. That\u2019s what the law says.\n\n\u201cThe Chairman of the electoral commission has told Nigerians and Katsina people indeed that elections will be announced at each polling unit and wards for the Councillorship and the local government headquarters for the chairmanship.\n\n\u201cBut that is not what is happening today. APC people are carrying result sheets, in someplace like Danmusa, I saw pictures of young boys brought from the bush supposedly by the secretary to the state government, Mustapha Inuwa. They are brought to come and thumbprint yesterday and announced the result in the Local Government Secretariat.\n\n\u201cSo in essence, Nigeria is in a sorry state on top of the rising insecurity on a daily basis, hunger, poverty, despair and destructions happening to every institution in Nigeria that has been thriving. We are\n\nReacting to the allegations, the Secretary to the Katsina State Government, Dr Mustapha Inuwa, at a press briefing this evening at the state government house said such allegations are not new.\n\nApparently, he noted those making such accusations knew what they did while in government which accounts for why they are levelling such allegations.\n\nIn his words:\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, the state independent electoral commission (KTSIEC) did all they could do in terms of preparation to ensure that election materials and personnel were discharged early enough to reach to the destinations designed to do this election.\n\n\u201cHowever, what actually brought the delay is that the PDP organized thugs in most of these places to ensure that election materials from the local government headquarters towards do not reach these wards on time.\n\n\u201cWe had to work with the security agencies to ensure that they were able to disperse these thugs brought into these local governments to ensure electoral materials and personnel move to the various polling units and so on.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what actually caused the delay in some places. Honestly, some places were not able to get something done until in the afternoon. That is why up to this time I am talking to you, the election is being held in some parts of the state in some of these local governments. But about an hour ago we heard that the election has been concluded in about 19 LGAs and their results came in.\n\n\u201cSo we have done all we could by providing the necessary logistics to people concerned and I believe KTSIEC did the best it could to ensure everybody and every material is there on time.\n\n\u201cSo, these people know they are failures because they know they collected money from Abuja in the name of contesting the election, so they are making noise so that those who gave them money will say yes, they have done something. We are used to it. They have been doing it so it is not something new.\n\n\u201cAll the elections here in 2019 and 2015, it is the same technique, the same system they adopted. So it is not something new and you know the person here is a renowned liar, an internationally recognized liar. So when he makes all these sorts of allegations we are not surprised.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Buhari is not problem of Nigeria, Lucky Udu insists",
          "text": ".\n\nSocial media Influencer and Director of Youth Sensitisation and Rehabilitation Affairs, has declared that the responsibility of every parent is greater than the leadership of any President, he urged Nigerians to stop seeing President Muhammadu Buhari as the cause of the nation\u2019s problems.\n\nThis he made known clear basis on critical analytical examples in a video he recently released on his page.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhy is that we always blame the government for everything? Most of us have parents that are not responsible people and this has nothing to do with the President. How can you have a 17 years old daughter and you don\u2019t even know how this girl gets money to buy a sanitary pad every month? How can you be happy to say that your children are in school and yet they don\u2019t call to ask you for money? Most of your parents have abandoned your daughters to the fate of any man that will ever come across their lives in the name of a relationship. This is wrong and this behaviour has nothing to do with the President!\n\n\u201cThe girls you see at night standing on the street to hustle, they are not aliens. These are people\u2019s daughters. When these girls were young, when they were still little children, this was never the original plan they had for themselves.\n\n\u201cMost of our youth today are unfortunate in life because the kind of parents that raised them are very nonchalant people. When you see girls standing on the street, I want you to know that this was never the original plans they had for themselves when they were still young children, they had bigger and better dreams. Most parents have daughters who stand on the street every night but don\u2019t even know what is going on in their lives. With just 10,000 you can pay these girls and do whatever it is you want to do with them.\n\nParent you need to be more responsible to your children no matter how difficult life is.\n\nIn his practical instance as to how children can turn out to be a sore on our flesh as parents, society and the nation at large, he said, \u201chow many of you knows Evans the kidnapper? This guy dropped out of school when he was still in JSS 2 and a few years after, his father sent him out of the house. Evans travelled to Lagos to go and survive. While Evans was hustling on the street, he met a group of guys that later influenced him into robbery, and little by little, Evans journeyed into the path of kidnapping people to make money.\n\n\u201cThis guy did this business for years and many did not know what he was doing to survive until he became an adult and he was later apprehended by security operatives in Nigeria. When Evans was still a child, I know he had better dreams and ambitions for his life but unfortunately, one event turned his life around.\n\n\u201cMost of you will say he made his decision but I want you to understand that in every society, not everyone is strong-willed and not everyone can resist the temptation to go into crime when they are faced with hardship.\n\n\u2018Most parents are very nonchalant but you won\u2019t even know it. Go to school, ask around and see how many of their boys are selling drugs on the street to survive. What about the ones doing Yahoo Yahoo, practising rituals? Most parents don\u2019t even know what is going on in their Children\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cSome of your parents are so strict that you believe that all your children will ever need to survive in school is their books and water. When last did you have a heartfelt conversation with your child? Most of them have needs that you don\u2019t even know about. If you can\u2019t take care of your children and parents who else will take care of them? Most of you are not ready for this conversation because you are too emotional.\n\nYou want to start defending your parents, but no matter what they do, they will always be perfect in your eyes. But it\u2019s only a matter of time before you will realise that your parents owe you more responsibility than the government will ever do. I am not here to judge any of you, I don\u2019t even blame some of you for the things you do to survive every day. Most of you are just unfortunate in life and some of you have parents who no longer care about you.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no society in this world that you won\u2019t see someone who is selling drugs or doing prostitution. This is to tell you that there is no perfect country and the responsibility of the parents is greater than the leadership of any president. We shouldn\u2019t always blame the president for everything going on in our lives. Most of us have parents that are not just responsible for us\u201d, he added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Governor Godwin Obaseki\n\nBy Ozioruva Aliu\n\nALTHOUGH there have been agitations in some quarters for Edo State to conduct local government elections, not many saw it coming this way when Governor Godwin Obaseki, some days ago, sent an amendment bill to the state House of Assembly for a review of the Edo State Local Government electoral law.\n\n\n\nThis process of democratizing the third tier of government is coming a little over a year after the tenure of the elected local government chairmen and councilors ended on March 4, 2021.\n\n\n\nThe state House of Assembly, passed the request for the amendment of the law, whose focus for review was the number of days the state electoral commission has to carry out the exercise once inaugurated that was reduced from 45 days to 15.\n\n\n\nThis position and the constitution of the Edo State Independent Electoral Commission (EDSIEC) has drawn the ire of critics who allege that the process was a plan by Obaseki to continue to hold and control the third tier of government and from the back door hold majority of the delegates for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of its coming primary elections having not been able to properly integrate members of the party who came with him from the All Progressives Congress (APC) into the PDP.\n\n\n\nFor instance, the Chairman, Coalition of Registered Political Parties (CRPP), Samson Isibor, raised eyebrows on the membership of the commission, headed by Justice James Oyomire (rtd), as he alleged that himself and other members of the Commission are going to do the bidding of the governor and would deliberately scheme out all those who may be interested in the exercise except those Obaseki wants.\n\n\n\nHe also complained that the 15 days was too short and it would shut them out.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress which initially said it was not going to participate in the election reversed itself through its State Publicity Secretary, Barr Peter Uwadia-Igbinigie barely 24 hours after it threatened to boycott the exercise.\n\n\n\nAddressing a press conference at the end of a meeting at the State Secretariat of the party in Benin City, he said that APC is fully prepared and will participate in the elections as directed by the national leadership of the party.\n\n\n\nJustification\n\n\n\nThis development has thrown up some issues which include, is the action of the government so far legal?\n\n\n\nHave the people been asking for local government elections and are they ready to be part of the process to bring a democratic process there?\n\n\n\nHowever, some of Obaseki\u2019s supporters believe that the elections into local governments were long overdue and the action has not in any way contradicted the laws of the land.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has since decided that what governs local government elections is the state local government laws, so what has the governor done wrong?\u201d a very senior government official queried.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the same law has been amended several times by previous administrations and it can still be amended at any time by the House of Assembly which has the powers to do so.\n\n\n\nHe went on. \u201cPeople have been clamouring that we should conduct local government elections, what is now the problem?\n\n\n\n\u201cThe law is the law and we are only bound by what the law says should be done. \u201cMoreover, has EDSIEC said that they cannot do the elections within the time frame?\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy will they say the time is short when they know that the tenure of the councils expired last year and the law even says the process of fresh elections ought to have started three months before their expiration of the tenure, so government is even late if you ask me.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the governor also believe that whatever criticism the opponents, who include members of the PDP, may have is not enough to discredit the process, arguing that the local government elections are to open the democratic space for more people to be involved in governance which, they say, is the basis for democracy.\n\nOne of them added, \u201cThere are 192 wards and 18 local government areas in the state and this means you have chairmen, vice chairmen, secretaries, elected councilors, supervisory councilors and other political appointees that would be attached to some of these people, that is a big plus for the process of deepening democracy in the state.\u201d\n\n\n\nJostle for tickets\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the EDSIEC had initially fixed April 19, 2022 for the elections before it was stopped by a court in Abuja. Interested people, particularly in the PDP, have started jostling and negotiating to have the ears of the leaders so that they can be picked for the available positions.\n\n\n\nSome of the immediate past chairmen are already lobbying to be returned for a second term but investigation shows that only a few of them would be able to return.\n\n\n\nIn Edo South, which is made up of seven local government areas, only one of the former chairmen is sure of a return ticket as leaders of his area and wards have unanimously adopted him as a consensus candidate.\n\n\n\nAnother, who tried to lobby for return in the house of a leader few days ago, was rebuffed because he was said to have lost his polling unit and ward during the 2020 governorship election in the state.\n\nThere are fears that the crisis of the inability of the PDP to harmonise may rear its head as it was gathered that in a local government in Edo North that a faction of the PDP who were members of the APC have been meeting to pick their choice candidates while another faction who are old members of the party have also been meeting to pick their candidates and, if that is not stopped, the party could present two categories of candidates in the area.\n\n\n\nBut this fear was allayed as it is the responsibility of the state chairman of the party to present candidates for elections to EDSIEC and, so far, the state chairman of the party, Hon Tony Aziegbemi, has been on the side of Obaseki.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupremacy war\n\n\n\nSupporters of the governor and those of the old members of the PDP, led by the chairman, South-South of the party, Chief Dan Orbih, are also seeing the local government elections as a supremacy war, especially after the Abuja court verdict against any move to dissolve the party executives from the ward to the state level to give room for harmonization.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey refused to harmonise, they kept the governor waiting for one year, they were playing politics with the governor and they wanted the governor to fold his arms?\u201d a supporter of the governor told Vanguard.\n\n\n\nIt is highly suspected that Obaseki wanted to cash in on the elections to get statutory delegates to the presidential primary election of the PDP which is slated for May and even for other parties who may win election in some of the local government areas.\n\n\n\nA chieftain of the PDP told Vanguard, \u201cThe court ruled against harmonization which means the governor has to work with what is on ground.\n\n\n\n\u201cPolitical parties will soon begin their presidential primaries, so the governor has access to the statutory delegates because the council chairmen, vice chairmen and secretaries are statutory delegates and that is the same scenario for other political parties because if, for instance, APC wins any local government, the chairman and others will also participate in the primary election of the party.\u201d\n\nEDSIEC preparedness/ suspensioon of election\n\n\n\nWhile inaugurating EDSIEC, Obaseki charged the members to be neutral in the conduct of the council polls, saying they should ensure that the electoral process was free, fair and transparent.\n\n\n\nLater that day, the Commission released the timetable for elections into the 18 local government areas of the state.\n\n\n\nThe Notice of Election signed by the Commission\u2019s Secretary, Peter.O. Ojo, said the electoral body would meet with political parties.\n\n\n\nEDSIEC said the conduct of party primaries would be between March 30 and April 6, 2022, while the publication of notice of polls at the ward collation centres would be on April 11, 2022.\n\n\n\n7th April to 12th April, 2022 is for collection and submission of forms by political parties/submission of list of party agents, and electioneering campaign would commence on 12th April, 2022.\n\nAspirants would be screened between 13th and 14th April 2022 while names of candidates will be displayed on 15th April, 2022.\n\n\n\nAccording to EDSIEC, submission of names of changed/substituted candidates and screening of substituted candidates is scheduled for 16th April, 2022, and 17th April, 2022 will be for final publication of listed validated candidates, while electioneering campaign will end on 18th April, 2022.\n\nBut on Friday evening, EDSIEC announced the suspension of the conduct of the local government elections.\n\nA statement signed by Emmanuel Abebe on behalf of the Chairman of EDSIEC said the suspension of the local council elections was due to the restraining order by the Federal High Court, Abuja on the Edo State Independent Electoral Commission.\n\nThe statement said all processes leading to the conduct of the elections have been suspended, pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice.\n\nIt said, \u201cIt is hereby announced for the information of the general public that due to the content of the publication in the Vanguard Newspaper of 7th April, 2022 by which the Federal High Court Abuja restrained the Edo State Independent Electoral Commission from conducting the Local Government Elections in the State scheduled for 19th April 2022, all processes leading to the conduct of the said elections are hereby suspended, pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice.\u201d\n\n\n\nHearing on the issue has been fixed for April 14th and that would go a long way in determining the next step to take on the local government election.",

This crisis is taking place in a highly vulnerable region, where more than 8.4 million people require humanitarian assistance and protection.\u201d He said.\n\nThe Head of Special Duties at the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development Madam, Ms. Nadia Soso, and the representative of the Permanent Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development agreed on the criticality of the food security and nutrition situation in the north-east, which affects people\u2019s health and well-being.\n\nThey reiterated their commitment to address the food and nutrition situation of affected people through planning, strategy and policy development. While everyday presents a new challenge for community members affected by crises, government representatives called on donors and local and international partners to remain supportive, commending their effective partnership.\n\nThe United Kingdom (UK) High Commissioner to Nigeria and Chairperson of the North-east Ambassadors\u2019 Group, Ms. Catriona Laing, called for additional funding and attention to the crisis, noting that the cost of inaction is higher than that of taking action. She said that the UK supports people affected by the conflict in Ukraine, but not at the expense of other crises, calling on other donors to do the same and for all partners to work collaboratively to address vulnerability.\n\nShe noted the increased costs of food, fertilizer, fuel, etc., which are also leading to incremental rises in the cost of delivering humanitarian assistance. She appealed to partners to address humanitarian needs but also to work to implement long-term solutions, including stabilization programmes in locations where the security situation allows it, increasing accountability in the humanitarian response and supporting the government\u2019s social safety net interventions.\n\nThe French Ambassadress to Nigeria, Ms. Emmanuelle Blatmann, reiterated her government\u2019s commitment to address food insecurity through joint large-scale programmes with WFP, FAO and the European Union (EU).\n\nShe noted that the government is providing \u20ac166 million for food aid globally, including 50 per cent of that to Africa.\n\nMs. Blatmann also indicated that France is to support the Economic Community of West African States with funding for food aid in situations of drought.\n\nThe EU reinforced its political and financial commitment to partner countries in Africa. About \u20ac554 million in 2022 will be targeted at increasing food security in Sahel and Lake Chad.",

          "text": "Zenith Bank Plc is deploying digital tools to grow more businesses, simplify service processes, make its payment channels more efficient and resolve customers\u2019complaints. The moves have led to improved profitability and N97.33 billion final dividend for shareholders in the financial year ended December 31, 2021. COLLINS NWEZE writes that the bank\u2019s development of products to serve the retail segment of the market will continue to drive its operations and sustain growth trajectory.\n\nMany financial institutions with wide network expansion are leveraging technology to drive their operations. Technology is not only making banking interesting and seamless, it is reducing the cost of serving for lenders that invest on it.\n\nEffective use of technology has also led to improved profitability, better asset quality and improved returns on investment for shareholders.\n\nThe 2021 year results of Zenith Bank Plc showed a good example of what a seamless technology does to a bank\u2019s profitability and returns for shareholders.\n\nDuring the Zenith Bank\u2019s 31st Annual General Meeting (AGM) held last week in Lagos, the shareholders approved N97.33 billion final dividend for the financial year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThey also approved the proposed final dividend, and were excited at the final dividend payment of N2.80 per share. This brought the total dividend for the 2021 financial year to N3.10 per share with a total value of N97.33 billion.\n\nThe results in perspective\n\nIn spite of a challenging macroeconomic environment aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Zenith Bank Group achieved year-on-year (YoY) growth in gross earnings of 10 per cent from N696.5 billion reported in the previous year to N765.6 billion.\n\nThis was on the back of a 23 per cent YoY growth in non-interest income from N251.7 billion to N309 billion and a two per cent YoY growth in interest income from N420.8 billion to N427.6 billion.\n\nProfit before tax also grew by 10 per cent, from N255.9 billion to N280.4 billion in the current year.\n\nThe increase was due to growth in the top-line and very strong management of the treasury portfolio that increased efficiency, resulting in a drop in interest expense by 12 per cent from N121.1 billion in 2020 to N106.8 billion in the current year. This further led to a seven per cent increase in net interest income of N320.8 billion in 2021 from N299.7 billion in 2020.\n\nCustomer deposits increased by 21 per cent, growing from N5.34 trillion in the previous year to N6.47 trillion in the year.\n\nThe growth in customer deposits came from corporate and retail customers. Retail deposits grew by N146 billion from N1.72 trillion in 2020 to N1.87 trillion in 2021.The Group\u2019s continuous drive for retail deposits combined with the strategic rebalancing of its funding base helped to reduce the cost of funding from 2.1 per cent to 1.5 per cent in the year.\n\nAlthough operating expenses grew by 13 per cent YoY, growth remains below the inflation rate, and the Group improved its Earnings per Share (EPS), which grew by six per cent from N7.34 to N7.78.\n\nTotal assets increased by 11 per cent, growing from N8.48 trillion in 2020 to N9.45 trillion in 2021, mainly driven by growth in customer deposits.\n\nWith the steady recovery in economic activities, the Group grew its gross loans by 20 per cent, from N2.9 trillion in 2020 to N3.5 trillion in 2021, with moderated NPL ratio from 4.29 per cent to 4.19 per cent YoY.\n\nThe Group recorded impressive liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of 71.6 per cent and 21 per cent, which remained above regulatory thresholds of 30 per cent and 15 per cent.\n\nViews from stakeholders\n\nAt the AGM, founder and Chairman of Zenith Bank Plc, Jim Ovia, thanked the shareholders for their loyalty, which has enabled the bank to rise to the pinnacle of the financial services industry. He assured them of the bank\u2019s commitment to deliver superior value to shareholders.\n\nThe Group Managing Director/Chief Executive, Zenith Bank Plc, Ebenezer Onyeagwu, said: \u201cIf you look at the bank\u2019s history over the years, Zenith Bank has grown, and even within the pandemic, we have maintained a reasonable positive growth trajectory.\u201d\n\nHe said the bank is deploying digital capability in growing more businesses, simplify service processes, make its processes more efficient, and deal with customers\u2019 complaints.\n\n\u201cApart from developing new products, we are discovering new business verticals, especially within the retail segment, which have significant revenue,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe added: \u201cMeeting the expectation of shareholders means we have to work harder. The team is dogged, hardworking, resilient, and above all, we have a very supportive board that comes with superior guidance\u201d.\n\nThe Chairman Emeritus, Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria (ISAN), Sunny Nwosu, expressed the delight of shareholders over the payment of dividends by Zenith Bank.\n\nHe noted that the bank\u2019s shares remain the toast of investors as it has never failed to pay dividends to shareholders.\n\nAlso, President of the Association of the Rights of Nigerian Shareholders (AARNS), Faruk Umar, said: \u201cThe bank is doing very well. All the ratios and indices have gone up. More importantly, while we were in the meeting, I got my alert of the credit of my dividend.This is very commendable.The leadership of the bank has been very effective; we thank Jim Ovia for the leadership he has been giving. He has increased the dividend in spite of the economic hardship in the country, and I believe the Group Managing Director (GMD) is doing very well. I commend the management and staff of the bank, including the board, and I am very confident that this year would also be very good for the bank.\u201d\n\nUmar also commended the GMD for the numerous awards the bank received in 2021, especially the sustainability awards.\n\nEazybanking: Digital payment on the go\n\nThe Eazybanking by Zenith Bank is a convenient, fast, secure, and affordable way to access one\u2019s bank account 24 hours a day, seven days a week through the mobile phone without internet connectivity. It is a session-oriented service unlike SMS, which is a store and forward-based service. This service is available to account holders (except ZECA and Premium account holders) with any phone that runs on the GSM platform.\n\nThe lender explained that Eazybanking is different from other technologies as it provides an interactive browsing experience, its available on GSM handsets, it has an in built USSD encryption and \u201cno store just forward\u201d facility for performing secure transactions and ensures faster service, as network latency is low.\n\nIn terms of security, Eazybanking is safe as it has various levels of authorisation that ensures that one\u2019s banking transactions and information remains private.Verification using Debit card (MasterCard, Visa and Verve) PAN and PIN to authorise transaction and BVN. The service can only be accessed from the number registered with the bank for transactions notification (Alertz).\n\nThe product is available to Zenith Bank\u2019s customers.These are low income earners with non-feature phones, GSM phone and alertz number. The customer is expected to dial *966*00# with one\u2019s Alert Z number.\n\nArtificial Intelligence powered Chatbot\n\nZenith Bank has continued to distinguish itself in the financial services industry through superior service offerings, unique customer experience and sound financial indices. It has remained a leader in the digital space with several firsts in the deployment of innovative products, solutions and an assortment of alternative channels that ensure convenience, speed and safety of transactions.\n\nHence, many bank customers were excited when Zenith Bank introduced an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered Chatbot on WhatsApp named ZIVA (Zenith Intelligent Virtual Assistant), which enables customers to perform financial transactions and enjoy real-time customer service from their mobile phones.\n\nThe technology allows customers to enroll by simply adding the bank\u2019s verified WhatsApp mobile number on their mobile devices, agree to the legal terms of use and then initiate a conversation. It also provides the convenience for the bank\u2019s customers to interact and transact on a 24-hour on the encrypted WhatsApp platform.\n\nWith this capability to respond to chats/queries anchored on the WhatsApp platform, customers will be able to open new accounts, receive transaction notifications, check their balances on the go, transfer funds and top up airtime. They will also confirm cheques, pay bills, apply for loans, block their accounts, and request mini-statements, among other services.\n\nOnyeagwu said: \u201cThe launch of ZIVA is driven by the need for additional secured channels of communication with our customers as we deepen our retail penetration.\n\n\u201cSince the behavioural pattern of the modern customer dictates that they want to engage with brands over the channel of their choice, it was really important for us as a leading financial services institution and a pioneer of several technological innovations in the financial services industry to implement this solution in order to continue to create value for our teeming customers, who incidentally, were already using WhatsApp as a primary channel of communication.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank President, David Malpass, and Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emefiele, empasises the gains of deploying technology in improving banking and Zenith Bank\u2019s introduction of ZIVA aligns with that goal.\n\nAside reducing cost of serving banks, digital banking makes banking easy and seamless.\n\nReward for good work\n\nIn recognition of its track record of excellent performance, Zenith Bank was voted as Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021, Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards 2020 and 2021, Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, and Best in Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2020 and 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom.\n\nAlso, the bank emerged as the Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2020 and 2021, Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital in the \u201c2021 Top 1000 World Banks\u201d Ranking by The Banker Magazine and the Retail Bank of the Year at the BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Awards 2020 and 2021.\n\nZenith Bank was also honoured as Bank of the Decade (People\u2019s Choice) at the ThisDay Awards 2020 and emerged winner in four categories at the Sustainability, Enterprise, and Responsibility (SERAS) Awards 2021, carting home the awards for \u201cBest Company in Reporting and Transparency\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Infrastructure Development\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Gender Equality and Women Empowerment\u201d, and the coveted \u201cMost Responsible Organisation in Africa.",

          "text": "Last week, the Ogun State Government unveiled two events \u2013 a mass transit system and a transportation masterplan for the gateway state, writes ADEYINKA ADERIBIGBE .\n\nExperts have not ceased to laud the Ogun State Government\u2019s transportation masterplan at the unveiling of the mass transit bus system.\n\nAt the launch of the buses last Thursday, at the arcade ground of the Governor\u2019s Office, Abeokuta, Governor Dapo Abiodun said the buses were fitted with Wifi, which passengers could use on the go.\n\nLike its sister city, Lagos, Abiodun is happy that he is bringing innovation in intra and inter city transportation.\n\nWith a 16,762.0 square metres land area and 5.217 million population (2016 population figures), Ogun is Nigeria\u2019s industrial capital, the same way Lagos is the commercial capital.\n\nHowever, despite being Lagos\u2019 closest neighbour, the state has remained mostly rudimentary in transportation planning as successive administrations paid little attention to transportation as a catalyst to development.\n\nThe event was attended by former President Olusegun Obasanjo; Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi; former Ogun State Governor Aremo Olusegun Osoba; and Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo among others.\n\nAbiodun said his government was seeding N20 billion in the transportation system. He said the transport masterplan was to provide efficient, affordable and comfortable means of moving people from one place to another.\n\nHe also assured that the botched Olokola Deep Sea project would be reactivated. According to him, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) would soon be signed between the state and a private firm for the construction of the port.\n\n\u201cIt is important to know that the whole essence of the transportation master plan is for us to efficiently move people either intra-state or inter-state. We are the industrial capital of this country and neighbour to Lagos State, Nigeria\u2019s biggest economy and fourth biggest economy on the African continent.\n\n\u201cWe see the cross border migration every day and the trouble our people go through.\n\n\u201cOur transportation master plan has proffered suggestions and solutions for us to deal with this. Today, we are launching these mass transit buses.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Abiodun, the pilot phase would begin from the state capital, Abeokuta, and extend to other parts of the state.\n\nA major part of the masterplan, Abiodun said, is developing Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lanes, similar to what obtained in Lagos. he added that the transport sector may be one of the biggest beneficiary of the Lagos-Ogun Joint Development Commission (LOJDC).\n\nThe masterplan, according to him, would cover land transport (rail, bus transit), waterways, with water taxis and modern ferries, and air component.\n\nAbiodun said the pilot scheme would move people from Abeokuta through Mowe, Kara, to Marina and from Ifo and Ado Odo -Ota axis to Lagos and vice versa.\n\n\u201cVery soon, we will be signing a Memorandum of Understanding with a firm for the construction of the long awaited Olokola Port. The port will soon be a reality. We are also committed to having water transportation by having water taxis\u2019, Abiodun stated.\n\n\u201cThis is why we have come up with a multi-modal Transportation Master Plan that we launched today. This transport policy takes into consideration the short, medium and long term approaches to the development of our transport sector. This will include road, rail, water and air transportation plans for the State,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the multimodal transportation masterplan stemmed from the Urban Transport Policy and Strategic Transport Intervention Plan.\n\nAmaechi commended the state government for running a purposeful government, saying all the legacy projects carried out by the governor would continue to speak for him after leaving office.\n\nHe reiterated the commitment of the Federal Government to improving the transportation system across the country.\n\nAmaechi said the construction of the Lagos-Calabar rail line, that would pass through Lekki Deep Seaport down to Epe township, would soon commence.\n\nOsoba, who spoke on behalf of Obasanjo, noted that Abeokuta had been a commercial centre, adding that with the launch of the mass transit buses, the administration had succeeded in restoring the past glory of the state in transportation.\n\nOsoba said he would continue to support the Abiodun-led administration to meet the needs of the people.\n\nOba Gbadebo commended the state government for providing a modern transportation.",

He briefed us on his reasons, his thinking and his message.\n\n\u201cAll the governors in attendance graciously came to listen to him. He acknowledged the role of the governors in the last convention of our party, where, according to him, they steadied the party by helping in the evolution of the leadership that is accepted and widely acknowledged as that which we wish for our party.\n\n\u201cWe appreciated him, and his message and we will discuss the message at one of our forum meetings.\u201d\n\nThe PGF chairman faulted the insinuation that the ambition of Tinubu and Osinbajo may be putting the governors in a tight corner. Rather, he said their aspirations have further thrown up the party as a choice party parading competent aspirants.\n\nBagudu stressed: \u201cOn the contrary, we appreciate our party because it has become a party that has endeared itself to Nigerians. We have many brilliant people in our party, some serving and some not serving. The fact that we have people in our party that express a desire to lead the party into the highest office in electoral contests shows how much our party has resonated with Nigerians and our members.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a hallmark of success that people are showing interest. But, at the end of the day and because they are leaders of the party, they will always put the party\u2019s interest at heart.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of the party adopting a consensus candidate as its presidential standard-bearer, the PGF Chairman said the party would adopt the best option, insisting that the APC would always go for the best.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that in the 2015 presidential election primary, President Buhari contested against several others and it was a beautiful contest. There is nothing wrong. Members of the party always want to see consensus if it is possible. But, we are a democratic party.\n\n\u201cIn our last convention, we had consensus in some of the offices and election in some others. There is always misrepresentation of consensus as if people are being snowballed into positions they would rather not take.\u201d\n\nThe former Lagos State governor, who had informed President Muhammadu Buhari about his intention, also embarked on extensive consultations with party stakeholders nationwide.\n\nApart from meeting traditional rulers and opinion leaders in the Southwest, he has met members of the APC National Assembly caucus, Northern monarchs and religious leaders.",

          "text": "I\u2019m tired of ASUU going on strikes over disagreements with Fed Govt, says Ngige\n\nBy Frank Ikpefan, Abuja, Bisi Olaniyi, Benin\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t tell Education Minister how to run his ministry\u2019\n\nASUU insists on implementation of re-negotiated 2009 agreement, UTAS deployment\n\nLabour and Employment Minister Chris Ngige has said he is tired of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) going on a strike every time there is a disagreement with the Federal Government.\n\nThe minister said this in a statement yesterday in Abuja by the Head of Press and Public Relations, Patience Onuobia, after a meeting with members of the government\u2019s team on the 2009 Federal Government/University-based Unions\u2019 Agreement Renegotiation Committee, led by its Chairman, Prof. Nimi Briggs.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cI started pushing to see that things were done. What the Munzali Committee came up with is a proposal. Both Munzali and ASUU did not sign. At our last meeting in February, before ASUU proceeded on strike, we said everyone should go back to his principal.\n\n\u201cI asked the Education Minister several times what they had done with the document. We later got information on areas of disagreement. There is nothing wrong with that. It is bound to happen. I told ASUU to put up a committee; they said the Munzali Committee had expired.\n\n\u201cAs a conciliator, I have to make use of the labour instruments at my disposal. The bosses in the Federal Ministry of Education do not feel the strike. There are things that are above me.\n\n\u201cI am not the Minister of Education. I cannot go to the Education Minister and dictate to him how to run his place. But I told ASUU that they should be bombarding the Federal Ministry of Education for this to be moved forward.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways to do so. If you go to the Labour Act, there is something called picketing. You can picket. A strike is an ultimate thing. Picketing means that you can stay in the corridor, clapping or singing. Workers are permitted to do so. But I am tired that every time there is a disagreement, it is a strike.\n\n\u201cAnd the bosses in the Federal Ministry of Education don\u2019t feel the strike. It is the children and some of us, as parents that have our children in public schools\u2026\u201d\n\nThe minister said the Federal Government remained committed to the renegotiation of the conditions of service for all workers in public universities across the country.\n\nNgige said the Nigerian university system produced him and he remained proud of it.\n\n\u201cWhen we went to universities here, I knew the course content and as a medical doctor, the doctors we trained here are better than the ones trained abroad. That is one of the counsels I gave to my children. You can do your first degree. One got admission in Ghana, I said no. Others got in Canada and the UK, but I refused.\n\n\u201cIf anybody is interested in the welfare of workers in Nigerian universities, I am number one. I told my colleagues that what university professors showed us here as their salaries is unacceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nProf. Briggs, who is also the Pro-Chancellor of the Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ndifu Alike, Ebonyi State, said the re-negotiation committee was consulting with all stakeholders with a view to finding a lasting solution to issues in dispute.\n\nAlso, ASUU has said there would be no resumption in public universities until the re-negotiated 2009 agreement is signed, implemented and the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) deployed.\n\nThe union\u2019s University of Abuja (UniAbuja) Zonal Coordinator, Dr. Salawu Lawal, announced this while addressing reporters at the university yesterday in Gwagwalada.\n\nHe said ASUU members would return to the classroom when their demands are met by the Federal Government.\n\nThe Abuja zone comprises the Federal University of Lafia; Federal University of Technology, Minna: Nasarawa State University, Keffi; Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University, Lapai, and UniAbuja.\n\nLawal said: \u201cYou would recall that ASUU declared a four-week rolling strike at the University of Lagos (UNILAG) National Executive Council meeting on February 14.\n\n\u201cOwing to the failure of the Federal Government to act within that period, the national action was rolled over for another eight weeks, following the resolution taken at an emergency NEC meeting at the Festus Iyayi National Secretariat on March 14.\n\n\u201cThe action, as you are probably aware, is to, among other things, compel the Federal Government to sign and implement the draft renegotiated 2009 ASUU-FGN Agreement submitted to it by the Prof. Munzali Jibril Committee in May 2021.\n\n\u201cDeploy for use in the Nigerian university system was the home-grown payment and personnel solution called UTAS developed by ASUU as a replacement for the failed Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS).\u201d\n\n\u201cAs usual, the Federal Government has ignored ASUU\u2019s call for full implementation of that famous agreement and other memoranda signed with the union.\n\n\u201cNo meeting has been held between the two parties since the commencement of the ongoing strike. The only exception is our union\u2019s re-submission of UTAS for a retest.\n\n\u201cThe summary is that unless and until the renegotiated 2009 agreement is signed and implemented and UTAS deployed, there will be no work in public universities.\u201d",

          "text": "* Osinbajo\u2019s declaration a betrayal of trust, says Tinubu support group\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nFew hours after the declaration by Vice President Yemi Osibanjo for President, national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, met with governors of the ruling party.\n\nThe meeting held at Kebbi State Governor\u2019s Lodge, Asokoro, Abuja had about 12 governors elected on the platform of the party in attendance.\n\nWhile fielding questions from journalists after the meeting, Tinubu said he met with the governors to seek their support for his ambition.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy mission here is to seek collaboration, support and encouragement of my party, the APC, for my ambition to become the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as replacement for President Muhammadu Buhari after his tenure.\u201d\n\nAsked about the declaration for President by his (political) son (Osinbajo), Tinubu said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any son grown up enough to make such declaration.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) and the Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, said Tinubu told the governors about his intention to vie for presidency.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, this morning, met members of the Progressive Governors Forum where he stated what he had made public already -his intention to seek for the office of the President come 2023, which he has already announced publicly. He briefed us on his reasons, his thinking and his message.\u201d\n\nBagudu noted that all the governors in attendance graciously came to listen to him.\n\nHe said Tinubu acknowledged the role of the Governors in the last convention of the party, where the governors steadied the party and helped produce a leadership that was accepted and widely acknowledged.\n\nBagudu added, \u201cWe appreciated his message and we will definitely discuss the message at one of our forum meetings.\u201d\n\nAsked if Osinbajo and Tinubu contesting was putting the governors in a tight corner, Bagudu said the governors appreciated the development because it was an indication that the ruling party had endeared itself to Nigerians.\n\nHe stated: \u201cOn the contrary, we appreciate our party because it has become a party that has endeared itself to Nigerians. We have many brilliant people in our party, some serving and some not serving.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have people in our party that expressed desire to lead the party into the highest office in an electoral contest shows how much this our party has resonated with Nigerians and our party members.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a hallmark of success that people are showing interest, but at the end of the day and because they are leaders of the party, they will always put the party\u2019s interest at heart.\u201d\n\nOn the fears that APC may adopt a consensus candidate for the Presidency, Bagudu stressed that the governors would always encourage the party to go for the best.\n\nHis words: \u201cDon\u2019t forget that in the 2015 presidential election primary, President Buhari contested against several others and it was a beautiful contest. There is nothing wrong. Members of the party always want to see consensus if it is possible but we are a democratic party.\n\n\u201cIn our last convention, we had consensus in some of the offices and election in some others. There is always misrepresentation of consensus as if people are being snowballed into positions they would rather not take.\u201d\n\nBagudu said the ruling party had done well, adding that Buhari has led the party very, while assuring that come 2023, Nigerians would see another President of the APC extraction.\n\nMeanwhile, Tinubu Support Group (TSG) has described the declaration by the Vice President as a betrayal of trust.\n\nTSG Head of Media, Mr. Tosin Adeyanju stated this on Monday while reacting to THISDAY enquiry.\n\nThe group noted that Osibanjo\u2019s declaration did not portend any danger to Tinubu\u2019s presidential ambition.\n\nAdeyanju said: \u201cHis declaration is a welcome development but a betrayal of trust to the political family he belongs to. However, he does not portend any threat to our camp.\n\n\u201cOur eyes are on the ball and we are counting our numbers. Our consultation continues, as our principal is meeting with governors of the party.\u201d\n\nThe group was of the opinion that Osibanjo\u2019s declaration would further strengthen internal democracy as party members look forward to a transparent primary.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for primaries with any interested person because our principal is a true democrat,\u201d he said\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I have been to practically all local governments in Nigeria. I have been in markets, factories, schools, and farms. I have been in agricultural, mining and oil producing communities; in the Delta, in Kebbi, Enugu, Borno; Rivers, Plateau and Ondo; & in all other States of the federation, listening to the diverse experiences and yearnings of our people.\n\n\n\nI have visited our gallant troops in the North East and our brothers and sisters in the IDP camps. I have felt the pain and anguish of victims in violent conflicts, terrorist attacks, flooding, fire and other disasters.\n\nI have been in the homes of many ordinary Nigerians in various parts of the country. I have sat with our techprenuers in Lagos, Edo, and Kaduna, with our Nollywood and Kannywood actors; with our musicians, from Lagos, Onitsha, and Kano. And I have spoken to small and large businesses.\n\nI stood where they stood and sat where they sat. I know their hopes, aspirations and fears; and I believe that in those hopes and aspirations are the seeds for the great Nigeria that we all desire.\n\nI believe that the very reason why the Almighty God gave me these experiences, these insights, and these opportunities, is that they must be put to the use of our country and it\u2019s great peoples.\n\n\n\nWhich is why I am today, with utmost humility, formally declaring my intention to run for the Office of the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria, on the platform of our great party, the All Progressives Congress. If by the grace of God and the will of the people, I am given the opportunity, then I believe that first, we must complete what we have started;\n\n*radically transforming our security and intelligence architecture,\n\n*completing the reform of our justice system focusing on adequate remuneration and welfare of judicial personnel,\n\n*ensuring justice for all and the observance of rule of law,\n\n*rapidly advancing our infrastructure development, especially power, roads, railways and broadband connectivity,\n\n*providing an excellent environment for businesses to thrive,\n\n*taking the agriculture revolution to the next level especially mechanization and developing the farm to table value chain\n\n*making sure that the government, its agencies and regulators serve the business community,\n\n*creating a tech economy that will provide jobs for millions;\n\n*enhancing our Social Investment Programme to a full scale social welfare scheme,\n\n*completing the promise of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within this decade,*completing the task of ensuring that all Nigerians, male and female, attend school,\n\n*reforming our educational system for relevance to the challenges of this century,\n\n*completing the task of universal health coverage for all,\n\nand\n\n*strengthening the capacity of States and Local Governments to deliver on their respective mandates.\n\nAbove all, front and centre of our efforts will be the provision of jobs and opportunities for our young people.\n\nI now most solemnly and respectfully seek the support of fellow Nigerians everywhere in this land, and the diaspora, young and old, male and female, in the great and exciting journey that we have ahead of us.\n\nWe will, working together, establish by the grace of God, the Nigeria of our dreams in a few short years. We will build on the foundation laid by our predecessors. We will need to move, with much speed, intentionality, and perseverance, towards the vision of a prosperous, stable, and secure nation.\n\n\n\nI am convinced beyond doubt that we have the creativity, the courage, the talent, and the resources to be the foremost black nation on earth. Let us now birth the expectations of greatness conceived generations before us.\n\nLet us build a Nigeria where the man from Nnewi sees the man in Gusau as his brother, where the woman in Warri sees the woman in Jalingo as her sister, where the love of our nation burns alike in the hearts of boys and girlsfrom Gboko to Yenogoa. Where everywhere, in this land, is home for everyone, where our diversities, tribes and faiths unite, rather than divide us.\n\nLet our tribes become one tribe; the Nigerian tribe, where all are treated fairly, justly and with respect. Where all are given equal access to the abundant opportunities that God has bestowed on this nation. It\u2019s time.\n\nGod bless and keep our Republic and its great people.\n\n\n\n* Being the full text Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s declaration for President speech on Monday April 11, 2022\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

According to reports, Mohammed Koko was brought before a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt by the EFCC in 2009 together with three other top officials of Zenith Bank on charges of fraud totalling N3.6 billion,\u201d the probe report further revealed.\n\n\n\nThe report noted that his financial profile showed that he had several accounts in five banks.\n\n\n\nThe EFCC went on to analyse Koko\u2019s bank accounts and the amounts of money in inflow and outflow which all confirmed the alleged fraudulent acts of the NPA boss.\n\n\n\nIn the summary of findings in the report, the EFCC investigation team said, \u201cOne, Mohammed Bello Koko received payments in cash and transfers totalling N829 million into his Zenith Bank personal account between 2015 and May 2021.\n\n\n\n\u201cTwo, he is a director at M.B.K Business consults and Cethes company which Ali Amin Abubakar is also a director in both companies.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe EFCC in the report recommended the prosecution of Koko for the various fraud and money laundering discoveries alongside his alleged accomplice, Ali Abubakar.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is recommended that the Operations department should investigate the capital expenditure accounts and tenders board minutes of the NPA during Mohammed Koko\u2019s tenure as executive director, finance and administration preparatory to his possible prosecution alongside his suspected accomplice, Ali AMIN Abubakar,\u201d the report concluded.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had on February 15, 2021, reported that President Muhammadu Buhari appointed Mohammed Bello Koko as the substantive Managing Director of the NPA.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Pandora Papers in 2021 revealed that Bello Koko was behind two shell companies incorporated in a tax haven to anonymously invest in the United Kingdom property market.\n\n\n\nThis potentially violates Nigeria\u2019s public service code of conduct laws.\n\n\n\nPandora Papers also disclosed that he and his wife, Agatha Anne Koko, enlisted the services of financial secrecy seller, Cook Worldwide and Alem\u00e1n, Cordero, Galindo & Lee (Alcogal), an offshore law firm, to register Coulwood Limited (reg. number: 1487897) and Marney Limited (reg. number: 1487944) in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), one of the world\u2019s most commonly used tax havens, in 2008.\n\n\n\nBoth companies were registered on the same day, June 19, 2008.\n\n\n\nThough a public servant, Bello Koko is also a director of the two companies, in violation of Nigeria\u2019s Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act (Sections 5 and 6).\n\n\n\nPandora Papers project is led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).",
          "summary": "An investigative report by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has found Mohammed Bello Koko, the Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), guilty of N829 million fraud in kickbacks and money laundering activities.\nAt the time the report was done, Koko was the acting Managing Director of the NPA.\nFollowing the suspension of Hadiza Bala Usman as the Managing Director of NPA by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Presidency announced Koko as her replacement in an acting capacity.\nBuhari in February 2022 confirmed Koko as substantive managing director of the NPA.\nSaharaReporters had on February 15, 2021, reported that President Muhammadu Buhari appointed Mohammed Bello Koko as the substantive Managing Director of the NPA.",

Due to the exigencies of this appeal and its Constitutional colorization, there is need to hear this matter expeditiously.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the Appellant is hereby given up to Tuesday 12th of April, 2022 to file its notice of Appeal and the parties are to file their respective briefs of arguments within three days from the date of service of the notice and record of Appeal on the respondents. There shall be a further three days given to the appellant to file a reply.\n\n\u201cParties should desist from taking any step to frustrate the hearing of the appeal. The matter is adjourned to the 4th of May, 2022, for the hearing of the appeal. Fresh hearing notice to be issued on the 2nd to the 12th respondents.\u201d\n\nApart from the PDP, the National Assembly had also vowed to appeal against the verdict.\n\nAnother suit on the matter is still pending at the Federal High Court in Abuja. The judge, Inyang Ekwo, fixed April 28 for hearing in the case.\n\nThe division of the federal court in Umuahia, Abia State, had on March 18, nullified Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act \u2014 a decision that sits well with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s earlier protest against the controversial legal provision.\n\nThe novel statutory provision had prohibited political appointees from voting as delegates in party conventions or congresses for the election or nomination of candidates.\n\nIn her verdict, the judge, Evelyn Anyadike, held that the section was \u201cunconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever\u201d and ordered the AGF who was the sole defendant in the suit, to \u201cforthwith delete the said Subsection 12 of Section 84 from the body of the Electoral Act, 2022.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "MTN Nigeria, the Nigerian arm of Africa\u2019s largest telecom, today received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria to run a payment service bank.\n\nWith this approval, MTN Nigeria can provide virtually all the services offered by conventional commercial banks with the exception of granting credit and processing foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThis announcement follows a previous approval in principle granted in November 2021, to Airtel Africa Plc and MTN Nigeria Communications Plc to operate a payment service bank in the country. The final approval was subject to the fulfilment of certain standards of the conditions within six months. This hints that, while MTN has gotten its own approval, Airtel Nigeria could be getting its own soon.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers like Ghana and Kenya when it comes to penetration. In January, MTN revealed that MTN Nigeria\u2019s mobile money service had attracted 9.4 million active users since launching in August 2019.\n\nThis approval is expected to spur the adoption of mobile money in Nigeria as the use cases increase. The widespread coverage of MTN will help it serve people all over the country, especially in rural areas and also position the telecom giant as a competitor for the market share and earnings of commercial lenders.\n\nMTN Nigeria, which provides one-third of the MTN Group\u2019s sales, saw revenue climb to a record \u20a61.7 trillion ($3.4 billion) last year, with profit leaping 45.5% to \u20a6298.9 billion ($598 million). Mobile money is a growing contributor to MTN Nigeria\u2019s income, and it\u2019s expected that the new banking licence would allow the company to explore growth opportunities presented by the Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Girls are mainly trafficked for sexual exploitation, while boys are used for forced labour, according to the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, launched by UNODC in 2021.\n\nNigeria is not an exception, as the Nigeria Immigration Service said that in recent times, it had identified and arrested some top facilitators of human traffickers at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos.\n\nA top official at the services said following the continual record of syndicate trying to traffic young girls out of Nigeria illegally through the Lagos airport, the command had put modalities in place to tackle human trafficking at the airport and ensure the country\u2019s border remains secured.\n\nNigeria has continued to be a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to trafficking in persons including forced labour and forced prostitution.\n\nHuman traffickers have continued to deploy strategies to lure vulnerable people into believing that employment has been secured for them.\n\nNigerian network\n\nAccording to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, besides trafficking in human beings, Nigerian networks are known to be active in other criminal businesses such as corruption, migrant smuggling, counterfeiting of documents and money laundering.\n\nNigerian groups are well-organised both geographically and logistically and are able to mobilise a large number of human resources. One of their main strengths is their distribution in hubs along the trafficking route, from Nigeria to transit and destination countries, and the support of personal contacts carrying out various activities linked to the trafficking business.\n\nThe long-established presence of the Nigerian Organized Crime and Gang Section in the EU has given them an insight into law enforcement methods and a good understanding of how to misuse legal immigration channels (in particular the asylum mechanism, which they abuse both to traffic their victims and to legalise their status).\n\nThis is shown by the many trafficking in human beings (THB) suspects who either hold legal residence permits, are currently asylum applicants, or former asylum seekers.\n\nEntry points\n\nAccording to a recent report by Europol titled \u2018Criminal networks involved in the trafficking and exploitation of underage victims\u2019, southern EU member states, such as Italy and Spain, are main entry points for trafficked Nigerians, who are then forced into prostitution.\n\nOther entry points for human traffickers include Austria, Belgium, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to UNODC, the most common form of human trafficking detected by national authorities is trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, and more recent data show an increase in the detection of trafficking for forced labour and other forms of exploitation.\n\nIdentifying human traffickers\n\nJessica Ebrard, a representative of UNODC, said COVID-19 had had a drastic economic effect, which had led to loss of jobs, making more people vulnerable to be trafficked out of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to her, traffickers disguise themselves as helpers to victims, whom they promise job opportunities and greener pastures outside the country, only to be trafficked for purposes of drug trade, servitudes, prostitution and organ harvesting, among others.\n\nShe noted that globalisation allowed trafficking networks to set up complex routes and systems within and across borders.\n\nEbrard said the presence of these complex channels created a challenge because prosecuting one trafficker might only minimally disrupt the network of traffickers.\n\nRead also: NIS arrests top facilitators of human trafficking at Lagos airport\n\nShe added that reports had shown that a high number of victims of trafficking were recruited through social media and other online technology.\n\nAccording to the Europol report, trafficking networks are mainly composed of members sharing the same nationality or ethnic ties, and they mostly target victims of the same nationality.\n\nThe report also has it that female suspects play a key role in the trafficking and exploitation of minors, much more than in criminal networks that traffic adult victims.\n\nIt said, \u201cWhen the victims of trafficking are young girls, the younger traffickers are mainly male and applying the lover boy method. Most EU traffickers have a criminal background in their country of origin or in other EU member states, mainly in relation to property crimes, drug trafficking or fraud.\n\n\u201cTraffickers regularly engage victims\u2019 families in the recruitment process or target children hosted in facilities such as orphanages and foster homes.\u201d\n\nNon-EU trafficked children are transported into Europe via air or sea, frequently with the involvement of smuggling networks. Transport within EU territory occurs mainly on land, using private vehicles or public transport.\n\nIn some EU member states, traffickers exploit minor victims in legal businesses such as brothels, red-light districts and sex clubs. The online advertisement of sexual services is an increasing phenomenon relating to THB for sexual exploitation, with children being advertised as adults.\n\nThe report also has it that document fraud has continued to be an essential component in the trafficking of minors. Traffickers often seize victims\u2019 documents and provide them with fake identities to conceal their real age.",

But, the federal government has not issued any concrete statement on the matter, as the abductees have so far spent nearly two weeks in captivity.\n\nIn the two minute-30 seconds video seen by BusinessDay, the terrorists were seen putting on military camouflage and uniforms with dozens of captives including students. Foreigners possibly of India or West Indies origin appeared in the video suggesting that foreigners are part of those kidnapped.\n\nThe terrorists made the victims take turns in an edited script to call the government to come to their aid by acceding to the demands of the terrorists.\n\nOne of the terrorists was heard asking the victims about their names, course of study, occupation and what they do for a living. These raised some concerns that the terrorists may not be the regular bandits known to have been terrorizing North-West Nigeria.\n\nOne of the victims shown in the video is a young lady who identified herself as a student of Kaduna State University studying agriculture.

          "text": "The well-crafted statement formally announcing the presidential ambition of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo may have lasted just over two-minutes but it had been in the making for months, culminating in Sunday night\u2019s crucial meeting with governors of the All Progressive Congress (APC) at Aguda House, Abuja.\n\nAs the 12 APC governors came in, they first went into a holding room for initial consultations. And when the meeting started, sitting nearest to the vice president were Mai Mala Buni, former party chairman, Dapo Abiodun Ogun State governor, and his Kaduna State counterpart Nasir El-Rufai.\n\nRead also: 2023: Osinbajo declares for presidential race (VIDEO)\n\nWhile they waited for the meeting to begin, the vice president spent time outside calling up a number of leading personalities including traditional rulers from around the country including the senate president. BusinessDay, however, learnt that the tireless efforts made to speak to Bola Ahmed Tinubu last night failed.\n\nIt was clear Tinubu, the national leader of the party, did not want to pick the calls, one source said to BusinessDay.\n\nLast night\u2019s meeting, plotted by the campaign team of the vice president, further confirmed the governors\u2019 firm grip of the party. The vice president and his team had watched the governors display their stranglehold two weeks ago as they played a crucial role in the near perfect national convention .\n\nOn account of this, Osinbajo\u2019s formal declaration was never going to happen until he had met the governors, according to one source close to the vice president.\n\nIn addition to El- Rufai of Kaduna and Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, the other state governors at the meeting were Abubakar Bagudu of Kebbi, Muhammad Abubakar Jigawa, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano, Simon Lalong of Plateau, Kaduna, Hope Uzodinma of Imo, Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos, Gboyega Oyetola of Osun, Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa and . Hafis Kawu, a former presidential aide and House of Representatives member, was also in attendance.\n\nRead also: Full transcript of Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s declaration speech\n\nBusinessDay has a good account for why some of those who were expected did not show up. For instance, the governor of Borno State could not attend because of a family bereavement. So too the governor of Gombe who was also bereaved.\n\nAminu Masari, governor of Katsina could not make it to Abuja for the meeting because he was overseeing the local government elections. Rotimi Akeredolu and TAbubakar Sani, the governors of Ondo and Niger States are said to be abroad.\n\nYahaya Bello, Kogi State governor who has himself declared to vie for the gave no reason for his absence while Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti State called very late to say a contact who had promised to provide a plane to fly him to Abuja had disappointed him.\n\nSources said by the time the governor of Ekiti called it was no longer possible to send a jet or make any alternative arrangements. There is still a puzzle about the absence of Ben Ayade, Cross Rivers State governor and David Umahi of Ebonyi who were expected at the meeting.\n\nBusinessDay learnt that last night\u2019s meeting with the governors had initially been planned to hold on Thursday but had to be moved forward to last night because a number of the governors were unavailable.\n\nHowever, apart from having to wait until after the party convention, the vice president was also keen to properly manage and choreograph the communication with the president with whom he has had at least three meetings. The first of which was in Januarywhere he sought counsel and guidance. Both men met on Thursday when the VP told his boss about how he planned to meet governors of the party.\n\nAccording to one source, \u201cwe have been very deliberate about how the vice president will step out. Firstly, there was never a question of him not running because of Asiwaju. That was never discussed to the best of my knowledge. So, it was always a matter of timing and sequencing because we wanted to get it right from the very first step.\u201d",

We are not here to find fault. This is a reality and if we continue like this as a country, we will fail.\n\n\u201cNobody is going to fix it for us; we have to fix it for ourselves. Nobody is coming from Abuja or abroad to help us fix these things. If we don\u2019t, we are the ones most at risk, because we are living in a society where you have no control and anything can happen to you at any time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this is so important. I think it\u2019s a foundation that future governments would rest and we would not relent.\u201d\n\nObaseki added, \u201cAs we are going on with the \u2018operation show your building plan\u2019 exercise, we should also take note of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) data too. Look at INEC delineations to see whether when it comes to elections, people are registered and participating in governance. Except we work together, even if we bring all the money in Nigeria, we cannot develop Amagba.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cPeople are asking, what will happen after you leave? What will happen is that we will have it right and the people will know, and then anybody who comes in and does not give them what they want, the person will have to answer to them. So, we can sustain this development if we decide to.\n\n\u201cWe are going to every community in Edo, every local government and every ward. We need to know every village in them and how they are governed. The assignment today is that every agency of government must tell us why they exist and how they are providing services to our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going for local government elections. We need to open up the space. In a normal democracy, what we are doing now is a local government function, but the local governments have collapsed and we need to come up with an arrangement to ensure that the local government works,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe governor further noted, \u201cEvery agency must now have a planning team and the head of that agency must be the Chief planner because you are the one, we will hold responsible. You will tell us how you intend to roll out your services to our people.\n\n\u201cWe will need to beef up our planning as we are undertaking data to replan the existing areas. There\u2019s a need for the ministry of budget and planning to be involved in this, because we have to tie the socioeconomic planning and physical planning together.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Edo State Commissioner for Physical Planning, Urban and Regional Development, Isoken Omo, said the Ministry has concluded the recertification exercise in the Amagba axis of Benin City, visiting over 5,000 properties in the area, walking from street to street and door to door.\u201d\n\nShe said there are approximately 25,000 residents in the area, noting that there are 3796 bungalows, 756 Storey buildings and 608 vacant plots in the axis.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "FG under pressure over worsening economic conditions",
          "text": "By ADEBAYO OBAJEMU\n\nAfter what seemed like an unending silence eminent personalities are again warning the administration of President Buhari to do something about the rising insecurity and general uncertainty in the land before it spiral out of control. But the body language of the president and the silence of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) doesn\u2019t suggest any hope of a reprieve for Nigerians who are under the siege of economic distress and insecurity.\n\nDominating the headlines last week was the issue of the Imam of Apo Mosque, Sheikh Nuru Khalid, a fiery preacher who criticized President Buhari\u2019s handling of the insecurity in the country, following the Kaduna train attack, warning that the government was not doing enough and appeared unperturbed.\n\nThe preacher said this in a Friday sermon penultimate week. The following day, he was put on suspension by the Mosque Committee, and was subsequently sacked last week.\n\nHowever, on Thursday, the controversial Imam said he\u2019s not a slave to anybody. He told the BBC that being an Imam doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t talk about the killings going on in Nigeria, and no one can treat him like a slave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not your slave, I won\u2019t keep quiet about the killings in Nigeria because I\u2019m an Imam.\u201d\n\nHe said that the government of Nigeria was not doing well in fighting against insecurity in the country and that\u2019s not good at all.\n\nAs if on cue the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye lamented on the state of insecurity in the country.\n\nSpeaking during his Holy Ghost sermon, he said God has yet to speak to him about the 2023 elections unlike in 2019 when God spoke to him a year before the elections.\n\n\u201cAs of now, I still do not know whether or not there will be an election next year. Do not say that Pastor Adeboye said there will be no election next year, that is not what I said\u2026 Adeboye does not know yet,\u201d he told his congregation.\n\nPenultimate Sunday, Adeboye noted that he is very concerned about the Kaduna killings, oil theft, Nigerias depressing debt profile and other current national challenge.\n\nOn the Kaduna train attack, he said, \u201cyou cannot go to Kaduna by road, air or train. That brings so many questions to my mind as a man of prayers. Why Kaduna? Who is trying to isolate Kaduna? Why? After Kaduna, which next? he asked.\n\n\u201cIt is in the news and nobody has denied it that as of now more than 80 per cent of the oil we are producing is being stolen\u2026 that leads me to several questions, he said.\n\n\u201cWho is stealing the oil? Where is the money going? What do they want to do with the money? Who are the foreign nations buying this stolen oil? How many of these nations of the world are your friends?\u201d\n\nAccording to him, it is an open secret that more than 90 per cent of the money Nigeria gets from crude oil sales is being used to furnish interest accruing on debt.\n\n\u201cWe are borrowing more and according to a friend of mine, we are moving steadily towards a state of bankruptcy a whole nation\u2026\u201d\n\nAs if last week was a season of lamentations over disturbing proportion of insecurity, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, described the security challenges facing the country as a serious situation, calling for concerted efforts by stakeholders to stem the tide. He said that government has been overwhelmed by the security challenge and questioned government\u2019s willingness to stop the crisis.\n\nThe former president spoke at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, in Abeokuta, Ogun State, while receiving a Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential aspirant, Dr. Ugochukwu Williams and his team.\n\nObasanjo, while reacting to the recent attacks on Kaduna-Abuja train, where no fewer than seven persons were confirmed dead and 21 other passengers injured, and 127 missing, said the security challenge in Nigeria has overwhelmed the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\n\n\u201cI believe very strongly, and I have said it publicly and I will say it again that the situation we are in this country is not a situation where one man will say yes, he has a solution unless we are deceiving ourselves. I believe we need to sit down collectively and look at the situation.\n\n\u201cA situation where you are not safe on the road, you are not safe on the train, you are not safe at the airport, shows a very serious situation.\n\nI believe that all right-thinking Nigerians must know that we have a situation that has overwhelmed the present administration, but we should not allow that situation to overwhelm Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, government in a quick reaction dismissed his concerns, noting the problem did not start with this government, and everything was being done to solve the problem.\n\nIn the same vein , the Labour Party, LP, last Wednesday, warned that if the escalating wave of terrorism in parts of the country remained unchecked, it has the potential to derail the forthcoming 2023 general elections.\n\nThis came as a legal luminary, Afe Babalola, proposed the convocation of a national dialogue as a catalyst for revamping Nigeria from its incessant security challenges.\n\nLabour party alleged the seemingly impotence of the Federal Government to arrest the situation, makes the whole scenario threatens the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Arabambi Abayomi, said: \u201cLabour Party condemns in totality the very weak responses of government to terrorism. At least now that the APC government, the security agencies and all the federal might have failed to provide security to the people, it is quite plausible that Nigerians should be constitutionally empowered to carry arms for self defense.\n\n\u201cLabour Party subscribes to the fact that the first and the very most important duty of government is to constitutionally provide and ably guarantee the safety and security of the citizens, but it is unfortunate that the APC led government had left Labour Party with no choice but to strongly condemn the level of its highly shocking and extremely nauseating incompetence shown against the continual killings of the citizens across the nation by the terrorists.\n\n\u201cIt has now come to a stage that as a nation, this must not be condoned anymore. The time has come for the government to do what is standard and needful immediately, as security is the main demand for a truly democratic rule, but this is one area in which the federal government had been found highly wanting.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, in a revealing disclosure last week, spoke between the lines that many African countries were making efforts to make economic mileage out of the country\u2019s security challenge by lobbying companies operating in Nigeria to leave and come to them.\n\nAppearing before the House of Representatives Committee on Public Accounts, Adebayo, leading other agencies under the Ministry to the committee to respond to queries from the Auditor General for the Federation, said one of such countries was Ghana.\n\nConcerned about the nefarious activity of bandits, and the spate of killings and kidnapping, especially the Kaduna-Abuja train attack, Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to seek international help in combating the perennial security crisis in the country.\n\nThe playwright said this at a press conference he tagged Forget the past, forfeit the future: A nation seceding from humanity, on Thursday in Lagos.\n\nHe urged Mr Buhari to take help from the international communities even if it means the UN (United Nations) establishing a unit in the country.\n\nMr Soyinka maintained Nigeria is overqualified for international help and should stop hiding under false pride or national integrity.",

          "title": "The world at their feet: Access Bank\u2019s global banking push",
          "text": "By Okey Onyeweaku\n\nFor those who have studied its operations over time, it is noticeable that Access Bank is in the habit of almost forever fine tuning its processes to create greater and better value for its owners. The ambitious bank which just transited to a holding Company not too long ago, has aside from targeting the number five position in Africa, also now revealed that its focus is set on being acknowledged as a reputable global financial institution.\n\nSpeaking at a forum recently, GMD of the Access Bank Holding Company, Mr. Herbert Wigwe said the financial institution was working round the clock to ensure that it would soon be in position to compete with the worlds best banks.\n\nWigwe who said no bank that was like Access Bank in 2002 is alive today, also remarked that the bank had never failed to meet its aspirations in terms of its growth projections in its 20-year history.\n\n\u201cWe have always achieved our aspirations. We are not set now at creating a Pan African bank but a global institution. We are still on our expansion mood. We are paranoid about the future,\u201d Wigwe said.\n\nHe affirmed that the banks next big bet; namely its projection for 2027 would be pursued aggressively and be met.\n\nWigwe said the projection would see the bank regionalising its presence on the continent with regional offices in Ghana, Kenya, Botswana, South Africa and Nigeria.\n\nHe said that the company, after 20 years, was moving to another level, and was even now intent on creating a much more diversified institution.\n\nWigwe said that Access Bank was moving to a Holding Company, with the bank as one of its subsidiaries in line with the changing times in which it aims to be Africas inspiration to the world.\n\nBanking is changing at a faster pace than we can imagine, Wigwe, who is transiting to Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Access Holdings Plc said.\n\nAccording to him, technology is also most critical in changing all things. He said that anyone that failed to change with the trends would suddenly wake up one day to find out he had no business anymore.\n\nWigwe said the bank was creating strong digital technology footprints in line with its growth objectives which would also help it better ensure efficient service delivery.\n\nHe said that the bank would continue to support the government in making the economy better, just as it had played a major role in the formation of CACOVID to intervene with large doses of Corporate Sector help for the nation at the height of the pandemic.\n\nAccess Holdings Plc had last Monday announced board changes at its banking subsidiary, Access Bank Plc.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by Mr Sunday Ekwochi, the Group Company Secretary.\n\nThe statement said the board appointed Mr Roosevelt Ogbonna as the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the bank.\n\nIt said that the appointment underscores the effectiveness of the Groups robust succession planning arrangement and follows the appointment of the incumbent, Wigwe, as the Group Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer, Access Holdings Plc.\n\nIt also announced the appointment of Mr Victor Etuokwu as Deputy Managing Director, Retail North and Mrs Chizoma Okoli as Deputy Managing Director, Retail South.\n\nIt noted that the three appointments had been approved by the Central Bank of Nigeria, effective May 2, 2022\n\nIt equally announced the resignation of Mr Adeolu Bajomo as Executive Director, Information Technology and Operations, with effect from Sept. 30, 2022, following his decision to pursue other personal interests.\n\nCommenting on these developments, Mr Bababode Osunkoya, the Chairman of the Board said: \u201cthe new appointments reflect the robustness of our leadership succession plan and our decision to considerably strengthen our retail business while harnessing the potentials of SMEs and financial inclusion towards the attainment of groups strategy.\n\n\u201cThe appointees have been selected based on their exceptionally rich, professional, academic, and corporate board experiences, which are all relevant to the needs of our board.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply convinced that their skills will no doubt continue to add significant value to our banks quest to become Africas Gateway to the World.\u201d\n\nACCESS BANKS PERFORMANCE\n\nUnarguably Nigerias biggest bank by assets, Access Bank Plc has maintained its growth trajectory for the fourth consecutive year, recording 51.13% growth in profit to N160 billion for the full year 2021, ended December 31.\n\nBy this feat, the tier 1 lender has grown its profits by 167% in 4 years since hitting N60 billion in 2017.\n\nThe bank recorded gross earnings of N971.9 billion for the financial year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 27 per cent over N764.7 billion posted in the financial year 2020.\n\nAccording to its financial results released to the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) on Friday, the lenders Profit Before Tax (PBT) for the period rose by 40 per cent Year on Year to N176.7billion from N125.9 billion in 2020, while Profit After Tax (PAT) grew by 51 per cent y/y to N160.2billion from N106.0 billion in 2020.\n\nThe assets base of the group equally remained strong and resilient with total assets of N11.7 trillion as at December 2021, representing a growth of 35 per cent y/y from N8.7 trillion in 2020 and more than twice the banks total assets in 2018.\n\nOther performance indicators show that customer deposits stood at N7.0 trillion as at December 2021, a whopping 24.47% leap from N5.6trillion in 2020. Net Loans and Advances stood at N4.4 trillion as at December 2021 from N3.6 trillion in 2020. Non-Performing loans (NPL) ratio stood at 4.0 per cent as at December 2021 as against 4.3 per cent in 2020.\n\nThe bank, however, recorded a 64.66% depletion of net gain on financial instruments to N42.46 billion, on the back of a N136 billion loss on non-hedging derivatives.\n\nBut its e-banking income raked in N66.28 billion, representing a 18% spike from N56.09 billion in 2020 and suggesting an improvement in the banks utilization of the e-channels in the delivery of financial services to its customers.\n\nThe bank last traded at N10.40 per share, with a market capitalization of N369.67 billion and Year-to-date performance showing 11.83% share price appreciation as of Thursday, March 17, 2022.\n\nIn line with its policy of regularly extending the fortune to the shareholders, the board of directors has proposed a final dividend of N0.70 per share, to be paid on each of the 35,545,225,622 issued ordinary shares, bringing the total dividend for the financial year to N1.00 kobo, having paid an interim dividend of N0.30 kobo in September 2021.\n\n\u201cOur diversified business model yielded positive sustainable results, guided by a robust risk management framework, as we grew the business cautiously and recorded sound prudential ratios. This years results reinforce our resolve to generate sustainable returns despite challenging market conditions,\u201d said Herbert Wigwe, Chief Executive Officer, Access Bank Plc.\n\n\u201cWe sustained robust capital and liquidity positions, well above regulatory levels with a Basel II Capital Adequacy Ratio of 24.5 per cent and a Liquidity Ratio of 51.0 per cent . This positions the Bank to support our customers across various markets and adequately execute our expansion strategy.\n\n\u201cTo actualize our vision of becoming the worlds most respected African Bank and Africas Payment Gateway, we have taken strategic strides to create indelible footprints across the African continent.\n\n\u201cThese include our most recent additions in South Africa, Botswana, and Guinea. We also strengthened our business in Mozambique and Zambia, with noticeable improvement in rankings and market share.\u201d\n\nStrategic growth\n\nWith its successful merger with Diamond Bank in 2019, Access Bank made a bold statement of intent to dominate the Nigerian banking space. It was a transaction that instantly shot it up as the biggest bank in the country, with assets base of N7.28 trillion, and customer base of 31 million.\n\nHowever, an appreciation of N1.537 trillion or 21.6 per cent within one year ramped up the assets value of the lender to N8.680 trillion.\n\nA story of small beginnings.\n\nIndeed Access Bank has come a long way. For perspective, todays Access Bank was a small commercial bank, ranked 65th in size out of 89 banks in the country when Wigwe and his business partner, Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, acquired it in 2002. It was scaled up through a series of strategic mergers and acquisitions to build capacity and market strength over the years.\n\nWigwe took over from Aig-Imoukhuede as the banks MD/CEO in 2014 and has been driving its expansion, both in terms of footprint and product diversification.\n\nThe group is relying on its digital capability and innovative payments solutions to take the business to the next level as part of its expansion strategy.\n\nBy 2023, Access Bank will have consolidated its position as Africas gateway to the world with about 100 million customers in Nigeria and additional 20m customers across our African subsidiaries, Wigwe said last year.\n\nEyes on the ball, we will also be watching in the months and years that follow.",

          "title": "New revenue allocation formula faces fresh hurdles",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nThose yearning for the review of Nigeria\u2019s vertical revenue allocation formula would have been elated by the just released recommendations of the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) should receive express approval.\n\nBut that celebration would have to wait until the National Assembly is done with the ongoing constitutional review process because some of the proposed amendments would have a bearing on the recommendations contained report.\n\nThe proposal seeks a 3.33 per cent reduction in the current federal government allocation and on the other hand an increase of 3.07 per cent and 0.44 per cent for the states and local governments. It also seeks an increase of .2 per cent for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and a decrease of .38 per cent for Development of Natural Resources. The last time a review was done was in 1992.\n\nRecall that the RMAFC had revealed that the revised revenue sharing formula would be ready for submission to the federal government by the end of 2021. The review is coming 28 years after the last one was done in 1992 following agitation by stakeholders that more revenue should be made available to the state and local governments.\n\nThe current revenue-sharing arrangement has the federal government (including special funds) getting 52.68%, the state governments receive 26.72%, while the local governments get 20.6%.\n\nHowever, if the proposal is approved, the federal government will receive 45.17 per cent of the money from the consolidated revenue fund of the federation, made of oil and gas sales proceeds as well as tax and revenue from Customs.\n\nThe states of the federation will receive 29.79 per cent while 774 local governments will receive 21.04 per cent of the funds. The proposals were submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday, and must be passed into law by the National Assembly to be effective.\n\nBut Buhari said he would await the outcome of the ongoing constitutional review process before presenting the report to the National Assembly as a bill for enactment. President Buhari stated, Ordinarily, I would have gone ahead to table this report before the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment.\n\nHowever, since the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula is a function of the roles and responsibilities of the different tiers of government, I will await the final outcome of the constitutional review process, especially as some of the proposed amendments would have a bearing on the recommendations contained herein.\n\nBuhari revealed that the recommendations in the report will amongst other things, establish local government as a tier of government and the associated abrogation of the state/local government account; moving airports; fingerprints, identification and criminal records from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent legislative list, empowering the RMAFC to enforce compliance with remittance of accruals into and disbursement of revenue from the Federation Account as well as streamlining the procedure for reviewing the revenue allocation formula.\n\nPresident Buhari declared that for Nigeria to have a lasting review of the present revenue allocation formula, there must first be an agreement on the responsibilities to be carried out by all the tiers of government.\n\nHe noted that the proposal seeks a 3.33% reduction in the current Federal Government allocation and on the other hand, an increase of 3.07% and 0.44% for the States and Local Governments.\n\nHe added that with regards to the Special Funds, the report by the RMAFC proposed an increase of 0.2% for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and a decrease of .38% for the Development of Natural Resources.\n\nThe President recounted that the federal government also made its input into the process of reviewing the vertical revenue allocation formula based on existing constitutional provisions for roles and responsibilities for the different tiers of government.\n\n\u201cWe must note the increasing visibility in Sub-national level responsibilities due to weaknesses at that level. For example: Primary Health Care; Basic Primary Education; Levels of insecurity, and; Increased remittances to State and Local Governments through the Value Added Tax sharing formula, where the Federal Government has only 15% and the States and Local Government share 50% and 35% respectively,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the RMAFC chairman, Elias Mbam, who submitted the report, the major reasons for the exercise is that since the last review was conducted in 1992, the political structure of the country has changed with the creation of six additional States in 1996, which brought the number of states to 36. The number of local government councils also increased from 589 to 774.\n\n\u201cThere have been considerable changes arising from the policy reforms that altered the relative share of responsibilities of the various tiers of government such as deregulation, privatization and the lingering controversies over funding of primary education, primary healthcare,\u201d he said.\n\nMbam said the leading philosophy behind the proposed review was guided by the need for distributive justice, equity and fairness as enshrined in relevant Sections of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nHe added that the principles took into cognizance the indivisibility of the country, public opinion and weighted constitutional responsibilities and functions of the three levels of government.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts are divided over the proposal for a new revenue formula for the country. While some see it as a major step towards addressing some of the recurring revenue crisis within the federating units, others say anything short of true fiscal federalism cannot resolve the nations revenue problem.\n\n\u201cI have always held that more should be given to the states and local governments, if the issues of massive infrastructural deficits, insecurity, health, education and so on, are to be adequately addressed,\u201d a public affairs analyst, Mr. Vincent Alakwe told BusinessHallmark.\n\nAlakwe believes that the present revenue formula gives too much to the federal government, while leaving the states and local governments, which are closer and can impact the people more with little or nothing.\n\nIn his submission, an economist, Mr. Victor Ajayi, noted that the only way to free the country from its revenue quagmire is true fiscal federalism.\n\n\u201cWe must stop this lazy culture of rushing to Abuja every month for handouts and begin to look the way of allowing every state to grow at its own pace,\u201d Ajayi said.\n\nThis culture of going to Abuja to share money preventing the states from seeing the gold mines the states have been endowed with.\n\nJust let these states manage whatever they have and pay tax to the centre, its as simple as that.",
          "summary": "BY EMEKA EJEREThose yearning for the review of Nigeria\u2019s vertical revenue allocation formula would have been elated by the just released recommendations of the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) should receive express approval.\nRecall that the RMAFC had revealed that the revised revenue sharing formula would be ready for submission to the federal government by the end of 2021.\nThe states of the federation will receive 29.79 per cent while 774 local governments will receive 21.04 per cent of the funds.\nPresident Buhari declared that for Nigeria to have a lasting review of the present revenue allocation formula, there must first be an agreement on the responsibilities to be carried out by all the tiers of government.\nMeanwhile, analysts are divided over the proposal for a new revenue formula for the country.",

          "text": "Amidst tail and headwinds, Africas Global Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, has assured shareholders and investors of its unwavering commitment to sustain its current growth trajectory even as its efforts at business diversification across Africa and beyond continues to yield increasing returns.\n\nThe Group Chairman, Tony Elumelu, who made this declaration at UBAs 60th Annual General Meeting, which was held at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja on Thursday April 7, 2022, noted that the banks strategic investment decisions over the past few years have indeed translated to huge returns for its investors, despite the challenging business environment witnessed in the last two years.\n\nI am proud of how as a Group, we have been able to further consolidate on the new capabilities we have built, novel customer solutions we have deployed, efficiency gains recorded and the growth prospects we have leveraged from a recovering world, Elumelu stated, adding These were the building blocks for the very strong financial performance and the growth delivered by your Group in 2021, further confirming the wisdom of the investments we made and the strategy we have pursued, to ensure the diversification and sustainability of our business model.\n\nWhilst expressing his delight to shareholders and customers who have stood with UBA for almost eight decades, Elumelu remained confident of the banks capacity to sustain this momentum especially as economic activities recover from the impact of the Covid -19 pandemic.\n\nOur goal is to continue to build strong brand loyalty with our customers and create additional value for our shareholders, whose underlying support has positioned UBA for continued growth, the Chairman noted.\n\nUBAs Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Kennedy Uzoka, who went into details about the improved performance of the banks subsidiaries in the financial year under consideration, said, We are happy that the global community recognises the role our Group is playing in the transformation of the African economic landscape through innovative and customer focused banking services.\n\nHe pointed out that the banks business in the United Kingdom had specifically witnessed remarkable expansion, adding As from July 2021, UBA UK started making profit, and even to date, they are still doing well, and the same can be said for many of our African subsidiaries.\n\nThe truth is that we are driven by the opportunities and potential in each of the geographies that we invested in, and we are happy with what we have achieved so far.\n\nShareholders who spoke at the meeting including Sir Sunny Nwosu, Alhaji Farouk Umar, Mr. Nonah Awoh, Mr. Patrick Ajuda, Mrs. Bisi Bakare and Chief Timothy Adesiyan, were unanimous in their commendation of the board and management of UBA, for the impressive financials which have translated to higher dividends for shareholders.\n\nDespite the economic situation UBA has been able to grow profitability and increase its customer base. If you compare the dividend with the share price of UBA, you will see that our dividend yield is very high. No bank in Nigeria has been able to achieve this, and I therefore commend the UBA board, Umar noted in his remarks.\n\nAt the end of the 2021 financial year, UBAs Profit Before Tax was impressive with a 20.3 percent growth to N153.1 billion, compared to N127.3 billion at the end of the 2020 financial year; while Profit After Tax rose grew by 8.7 percent to N118.7 billion in 2021, compared to N109.2 billion recorded the previous year. As a result, the Bank proposed a final dividend of 80 kobo for every ordinary share of 50 kobo for the financial year ended December 31, 2021, bringing the total dividend for the year to N1.00 as the Bank had earlier paid an interim dividend of 20 kobo.\n\nUnited Bank for Africa Plc is Africas global bank, offering banking services to more than twenty seven million customers, across over 1,000 business offices and customer touch points in 20 African countries. With a presence in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and France and its more recent operating license in the United Arab Emirates, UBA is connecting people and businesses across Africa through retail; commercial and corporate banking; innovative cross-border payments and remittances; trade finance and ancillary banking services.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on the bank which has shown vigour and promise.\n\nOne other significant thing about UBA is that it has long left its contemporaries behind and stands out as a leader.\n\nThe lender (Company) has remained formidable in the midst of all odds.\n\nIn fact, in the previous years its strong performances have also provided a sturdy base for the vigour and strength which the lender has displayed.",

          "text": "Minister of Women Affairs Dame Pauline Tallen has vowed to ensure justice is served on the death of popular gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, allegedly killed by her husband.\n\nShe said Domestic Violence is a crime under the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act (2015).\n\nThe minister\u2019s position was contained in a statement Monday by the director, press and public relations of the ministry, Olujimi Oyetomi.\n\nTallen stressed the need for further rehabilitation of the artist\u2019s children, who, according to reports, were allegedly directed by their father to flog their mother while she was tied up by him.\n\nShe expressed disappointment that advocacies against domestic violence, especially Violence Against Women and Girls, persisted when both the federal and state governments had declared zero tolerance to Gender-Based Violence.\n\nThe minister further said the ministry was working with relevant authorities \u201cto set in motion the mechanism to rehabilitate children of the late singer so that they do not grow up damaged and assume that such acts are normal thereby poisoning our society.\n\n\u201cI wonder and ask how such a talented and self accomplished individual who loved God would have been a victim?\n\n\u201cIt is now truly obvious that violence knows no class or creed. It could have been that she cried out to her Church or Pastor or friends or family, but all she got was \u201cit is well\u201d and now that the inevitable has happened, they are speaking out. It is NOT WELL if we carry on with the traditional ways of sweeping bad behaviour under the carpet.\n\n\u201cThe ministry under my watch will prosecute this matter to get justice for Osinachi. It is obvious that her children also need psyco-social support to heal from this trauma if it is true that their Father will go the whole length of tying her up and asking the children to flog her with a cane. This is unbelievable and MUST be condemned in all its ramifications,\u201d Tallen said.\n\nThe minister prayed for the repose of the soul of the late singer and all victims of domestic violence, calling on all to join the ministry in the fight to end every form of gender based violence.\n\n\u201cOur Religious and Traditional institutions, as well as the immediate families must join us in this fight to rid our society of such acts before they become fatal. Please if you see something, speak out, so that together we can save lives,\u201d she urged.\n\nMinister pays condolence visit\n\nSpeaking during a condolence visit to the artiste\u2019s home in Arco Estate, Abuja, the minister said after her private session with the children of the deceased, her findings compelled her to demand for justice for the late \u2018Ekwueme\u2019 crooner.\n\nShe also reiterated the need for full protection for the deceased\u2019s children.\n\n\u201dEven though reports had it that the late singer was hospitalized for throat cancer disease before her death, social media claims would just not go away that she suffered GBV in the hands of her husband.\n\n\u201dThe Honourable Minister, who asked for a private session with the children of the deceased disclosed that her findings compelled her to make the demands for justice for her, and protection for the children for the things they disclosed to her away from prying eyes,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement also said the children of the deceased were presently being cared for by a family friend, Mr. Sunday Achino, from Dunamis Church where the late singer worshipped.\n\n\u201cThere is no smoke without fire! I have confidence in the Police and the Judicial system to ensure justice for the late singer; and I also demand that the children should be offered special protection; those are what the Nigerian women, whom I stand to represent are demanding of this situation,\u201d she added.\n\nOsinachi\u2019s husband arrested\n\nAnd in another twist to the incident, the Federal Capital Territory( FCT) Abuja Police Command, has arrested Peter Nwachukwu, husband of the late singer.\n\nSpokesperson of the commend, Josephine Adeh, confirmed the development to Premium Times on Monday.\n\nAdeh said: \u201cHe is now in our custody. We picked him up yesterday, Sunday, The deceased younger brother reported the matter, and we have commenced an investigation. So we won\u2019t be issuing any statement for now.\u201d\n\nThe gospel music star, who shot into the limelight with the hit \u201cEkwueme\u201d, which has been watched over 72 million times on YouTube, died in an Abuja hospital on Saturday.\n\nInitially, it was reported that the talented Abuja-based gospel artiste died after an unknown illness.\n\nHowever, close friends and associates have suggested that her violent union led to her untimely death.\n\nThey also accused the Ekwuemecrooner\u2019s husband of constantly molesting and beating her.\n\nOn Saturday, her colleague, Frank Edwards, alleged the late singer had an abusive husband, who regularly brutalised her before she died.\n\nFamily reacts\n\nSpeaking on behalf of her family for the first time Sunday, the deceased\u2019s older sister, Favour Made, alleged that her sister\u2019s husband was responsible for her death in an interview with the Vanguard.\n\nMade said her sister\u2019s death was from a cluster of blood gathered in the deceased\u2019s chest due to her husband, who allegedly kicked her recently, and not cancer-related.\n\nShe said: \u201cShe did not die of cancer. Instead, the husband, Mr Peter Nwachukwu, hit her with his leg on the chest. He has been beating her all this while, but my sister hides all that she was passing through from us. Before now, we have told her to come out of the marriage, and we told her that they are not divorcing and that it\u2019s just a separation. But, she felt that God is against divorce.\n\n\u201cWe told her that separation is not a sin but just for her to stay alive and take care of her children. She will always tell us to relax and that the man will change. So when the man kicked her in the chest, she fell, and he took her to the hospital, but he did not even tell us.\u201d\n\nThe late Osinachi was a lead singer at the Dunamis International Gospel Centre. She was featured in several popular gospel songs like \u201cNara Ekele\u201d by Pastor Paul Enenche (Dunamis, Abuja) and \u201cYou no dey use me play\u201d by Emma.\n\nShe is survived by four children and her family.",

          "text": "Former Lagos state governor and frontline presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has said he has no son grown enough to contest the presidential ticket of the ruling party.\n\nTinubu spoke to journalists in Abuja Monday shortly after a closed-door meeting with some APC governors, to seek their support and encouragement for his presidential ambition.\n\nHis comment came as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo formally declared his intention to seek the APC ticket to contest for the office of the president.\n\nOsinbajo was attorney general and commissioner for justice of Lagos state for eight years under the Tinubu administration.\n\nTinubu speaks\n\nAddressing journalists after meeting with the governors, Senator Tinubu said the parley was part of his consultation with relevant stakeholders to actualise his ambition of succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari on the expiration of his tenure in 2023.\n\nAt the meeting were Governors Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna state; Dapo Abiodun of Ogun state; Simon Lalong of Plateau state; Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano state; Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi state; Mai Mala Buni of Yobe state; Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos state; Hope Uzodimma of Imo state; Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa state; Muhammad Badaru of Jigawa state and Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun state.\n\nAsked to comment on the declaration of Osinbajo, his political godson, to contest the nation\u2019s top office, the former Lagos state governor simply said: \u201cI don\u2019t have any son grown up enough to make such declaration.\u201d\n\nOn his mission, Asiwaju said: \u201cMy mission here is to seek collaboration, support and encouragement of my party, the APC, for my ambition to become the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as replacement for President Muhammadu Buhari after his tenure.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on the meeting, a statement by Tinubu\u2019s media office said: \u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, this morning, met members of the Progressive Governors Forum where he stated what he has made public already his intention to seek for the office of the President come 2023 which he has already announced publicly. He briefed us on his reasons, his thinking and his message.\n\n\u201cAll the governors in attendance graciously came to listen to him. He acknowledged the role of the Governors in the last convention of our party, where, according to him, the governors of the party steadied the party by helping in the evolution of the leadership that is accepted and widely acknowledged as that which we wish for our party. We appreciated him, his message and will definitely discuss the message at one of our forum meetings.\u201d\n\n\u2018APC for the best\u2019\n\nAlso speaking with newsmen after the meeting with Asiwaju, Chairman Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) and Kebbi state Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, said there was nothing wrong in Vice President Osinbajo contesting the presidential ticket with Tinubu, his godfather, arguing that the aspiration of the duo is a confirmation of the quality of the party.\n\nOn whether the governors were in tight corner over this, he replied: \u201cNo, no, no. In fact, in the contrary, we appreciate our party because it has become a party that has endeared itself to Nigerians. We have many brilliant people in our party, some serving and some not serving.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have people in our party that express desire to lead the party into the highest office in electoral contest shows how much this our party has resonated with Nigerians and our party members.\n\n\u201cFor us, it is a hallmark of success that people are showing interest, but at the end of the day and because they are leaders of the party, they will always put the party\u2019s interest at heart.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to react to speculation that APC may adopt consensus candidate for the presidential ticket, Bagudu said: \u201cWe always encourage our party to go for the best. Don\u2019t forget that in the 2015 presidential election primary, President Buhari contested against several others and it was a beautiful contest.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing wrong. Members of the party always want to see consensus if it is possible, but we are a democratic party. In our last convention, we had consensus in some of the offices and election in some others. There is always misrepresentation of consensus as if people are being snowballed into positions they would rather not take.\n\n\u201cAPC has done well as a party, President Buhari has led the party ably well and we believe strongly that come 2023, Nigerians will see another President of the APC extraction.\u201d\n\nMy mission \u2013 Osinbajo\n\nIn his declaration, Monday, Vice President Osinbajo vowed to continue where President Muhammadu Buhari stops in \u201cradically transforming our security and intelligence architecture\u201d.\n\nHe made this known in a short video posted on his Twitter handle, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s declaration speech reads in part: \u201cIn the past seven years, I have served as Vice President under a true Nigerian patriot, a servant of the nation in war and peace, and a man of integrity, President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cWe have, together, worked through some of the most difficult times in the history of our Nation, but we have remained focused on securing the country, providing infrastructure and growing our economy.\u201d\n\nIn seven years, Osinbajo said he served the government in several capacities and had, at the direction of the president, represented Nigeria in sensitive high level international engagements.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have been to practically all local governments in Nigeria. I have been in markets, factories, schools, and farms. I have been in agricultural, mining and oil producing communities; in the Delta, in Kebbi, Enugu, Borno; Rivers, Plateau and Ondo; and in all other states of the federation, listening to the diverse experiences and yearnings of our people.\n\n\u201cI have visited our gallant troops in the North East and our brothers and sisters in the IDP camps. I have felt the pain and anguish of victims in violent conflicts, terrorist attacks, flooding, fire and other disasters.\n\n\u201cI have been in the homes of many ordinary Nigerians in various parts of the country. I have sat with our techprenuers in Lagos, Edo, and Kaduna, with our Nollywood and Kannywood actors; with our musicians, from Lagos, Onitsha, and Kano. And I have spoken to small and large businesses.\n\n\u201cI stood where they stood and sat where they sat. I know their hopes, aspirations and fears; and I believe that in those hopes and aspirations are the seeds for the great Nigeria that we all desire.\n\n\u201cI believe that the very reason why the Almighty God gave me these experiences, these insights, and these opportunities, is that they must be put to the use of our country and it\u2019s great peoples.\n\n\u201cWhich is why I am today, with utmost humility, formally declaring my intention to run for the Office of the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria, on the platform of our great party, the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cIf by the grace of God and the will of the people, I am given the opportunity, then I believe that first, we must complete what we have started; radically transforming our security and intelligence architecture, completing the reform of our justice system focusing on adequate remuneration and welfare of judicial personnel.\u201d\n\nHe solemnly and respectfully sought the support of fellow Nigerians everywhere, young and old, male and female, in the great and exciting journey ahead of him.\n\n\u201cWe will work together by the grace of God. The Nigeria of our dreams in few short years. We will build on the foundation laid by our predecessors. We will need to move, with much speed, intentionality, and perseverance, towards the vision of a prosperous, stable, and secure nation.\n\n\u201cI am convinced beyond doubt that we have the creativity, the courage, the talent, and the resources to be the foremost black nation on earth. Let us now birth the expectations of\n\n\u201cLet us build a Nigeria where the man from Nnewi sees the man in Gusau as his brother, where the woman in Warri sees the woman in Jalingo as her sister, where the love of our nation burns alike in the hearts of boys and girls from Gboko to Yenagoa.\n\n\u201cWhere everywhere, in this land, is home for everyone, where our diversities, tribes and faiths unite, rather than divide us.\n\n\u201cLet our tribes become one tribe; the Nigerian tribe, where all are treated fairly, justly and with respect\u2013where all are given equal access to the abundant opportunities that God has bestowed on this nation. It\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cGod bless and keep our Republic and its great people,\u201d Osinbajo said.\n\n\u2018Osinbajo has no match\u2019\n\nSimilarly, an Arewa elder and former Special Adviser on National Assembly Matters to two former Presidents, Senator Muhammed Abba Aji, has declared that Vice President Osinbajo would clinch the presidential ticket of the party and eventually win the general election.\n\nThe former senator said among the array of presidential aspirants, Professor Osinbajo \u201cis objectively the best and he is set to win the party primaries and the 2023 presidential elections.\u201d\n\nAddressing journalists Monday in Abuja, Abba Aji said Osinbajo has a solid support base in the North, along with thriving circles of influential supporters across the South.\n\nThe former presidential aide who is one of the Arewa elders in the Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG), a pro-Osinbajo lobby group, also applauded the spontaneous nationwide celebrations that greeted Osinbajo\u2019s declaration for the 2023 presidency.\n\n\u201cI have been in politics since the early 80s and I can tell you that the Nigerian electorate is now much wiser, much more discerning and sophisticated than what you had in the past; the spontaneous rallies are a show of strength, asserting the power of the real people and it is a strong pointer to Professor Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s very bright chances for ultimate electoral victory,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tinubu, he said: \u201cAsiwaju is a great leader of our party and his rile in bringing about an Osinbajo vice Presidency has been vindicated; having performed creditably, impressing President Buhari and millions of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nSenator Abba Aji, who stressed that the security situation in his home state of Borno has vastly improved under the Buhari administration, further noted that Osinbajo greatly impressed Nigerians with his performances during the period he acted as President.\n\n\u201cHis (Osinbajo\u2019s) chances are very bright in the view of most people that I have interacted with; he is better than anyone else but we are in a democracy and others also have a right to present themselves and increase the choices available to the electorate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Igbo\u2019s turn\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the Congress for Igbo Agenda (CIA), a socio-political interest group, has posited that Nigerians could suffer untold hardship, hunger and injustices in the next eight years if they failed to elect a president of Igbo extraction next year.\n\nFounding president of the group, Rev. Innocent Chukwudi Peace-Udochukwu, said the emergence of Nigerian President of Igbo extraction would be antidote to the country\u2019s myriads of challenges, including insecurity, hunger and separatists agitations.\n\nPeace-Udochukwu made the call at Awka while addressing a congress of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Anambra State Council.\n\n\u201cWe will produce the next executive President of this country because the sacred heritage of the Igbo nation and the eternal will of God are all embodied in our echoing demand. We all know deep down that an Igbo presidency would be the best, most significant investment in nation-building in our fractured and extremely divided nation since independence.\n\n\u201cHaving a competent and proven Igbo like Peter Obi as President will permanently address and satiate the legitimate complaints of political exclusion and its attendant separatist agitations which veto a great extent turned the once peaceful Southeast region into a theatre of war, and may soon spill over to other regions. Nigerian President of Igbo extraction, as an added benefit will definitely repair some of the economic, political damage and stagnancy of the past decade.\n\n\u201cNigerians must know that if we fail to get it right at this point in time that another eight or more years of hunger, killings, injustices and severe hardship is already starting us in the face but God forbid that we will not be wise enough to seize this golden opportunity to right the wrongs of the past years,\u201d the group said.",
          "summary": "His comment came as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo formally declared his intention to seek the APC ticket to contest for the office of the president.\nOsinbajo was attorney general and commissioner for justice of Lagos state for eight years under the Tinubu administration.\nIn fact, in the contrary, we appreciate our party because it has become a party that has endeared itself to Nigerians.\nDon\u2019t forget that in the 2015 presidential election primary, President Buhari contested against several others and it was a beautiful contest.\n\u201cAPC has done well as a party, President Buhari has led the party ably well and we believe strongly that come 2023, Nigerians will see another President of the APC extraction.\u201dMy mission \u2013 OsinbajoIn his declaration, Monday, Vice President Osinbajo vowed to continue where President Muhammadu Buhari stops in \u201cradically transforming our security and intelligence architecture\u201d.",

I have been to practically all local governments in Nigeria. I have been in markets, factories, schools, and farms. I have been in agricultural, mining and oil producing communities; in the Delta, in Kebbi, Enugu, Borno; Rivers, Plateau and Ondo; & in all other States of the federation, listening to the diverse experiences and yearnings of our people.\n\nI have visited our gallant troops in the North East and our brothers and sisters in the IDP camps. I have felt the pain and anguish of victims in violent conflicts, terrorist attacks, flooding, fire and other disasters.\n\nI have been in the homes of many ordinary Nigerians in various parts of the country. I have sat with our techprenuers in Lagos, Edo, and Kaduna, with our Nollywood and Kannywood actors; with our musicians, from Lagos, Onitsha, and Kano. And I have spoken to small and large businesses.\n\nI stood where they stood and sat where they sat. I know their hopes, aspirations and fears; and I believe that in those hopes and aspirations are the seeds for the great Nigeria that we all desire.\n\nI believe that the very reason why the Almighty God gave me these experiences, these insights, and these opportunities, is that they must be put to the use of our country and it\u2019s great peoples.\n\nWhich is why I am today, with utmost humility, formally declaring my intention to run for the Office of the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria, on the platform of our great party, the All Progressives Congress.\n\nIf by the grace of God and the will of the people, I am given the opportunity, then I believe that first, we must complete what we have started;\n\n*radically transforming our security and intelligence architecture,\n\n*completing the reform of our justice system focusing on adequate remuneration and welfare of judicial personnel,\n\n*ensuring justice for all and the observance of rule of law,\n\n*rapidly advancing our infrastructure development, especially power, roads, railways and broadband connectivity,\n\n*providing an excellent environment for businesses to thrive,\n\n*taking the agriculture revolution to the next level especially mechanization and developing the farm to table value chain\n\n*making sure that the government, its agencies and regulators serve the business community,\n\n*creating a tech economy that will provide jobs for millions;\n\n*enhancing our Social Investment Programme to a full scale social welfare scheme,\n\n*completing the promise of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within this decade,\n\n*completing the task of ensuring that all Nigerians, male and female, attend school,\n\n*reforming our educational system for relevance to the challenges of this century,\n\n*completing the task of universal health coverage for all,\n\nand\n\n*strengthening the capacity of States and Local Governments to deliver on their respective mandates.\n\nAbove all, front and centre of our efforts will be the provision of jobs and opportunities for our young people.\n\nI now most solemnly and respectfully seek the support of fellow Nigerians everywhere in this land, and the diaspora, young and old, male and female, in the great and exciting journey that we have ahead of us.\n\nWe will, working together, establish by the grace of God, the Nigeria of our dreams in a few short years.

I told him not to forget that we have the Speaker of Lagos here,\u201d he said while praying for more wisdom for Obasa in his leadership position.\n\nWale Ahmed who said he expects Obasa to be unopposed, added: \u201cMy prayer is that after the elections next year, we would all gather here to celebrate again.\u201d\n\nOba Agbedeyi, while thanking Obasa for positively making Agege a place to reckon with, urged the Speaker to return so as to bring more developments to the area.\n\nMr. Johnson Sunday Babatunde, chairman of Orile-Agege LCDA, who led the conversation, warned that Agege must not lose all that it had gained through Speaker Obasa. Rather, he said, the area should experience more dividends of democracy.\n\n\u201cA lot of people from Agege have been employed because of Obasa. A lot of infrastructure have come to us because of Obasa. There should be no vacancy in Agege Constituency 1,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that one way Agege can appreciate Obasa\u2019s love for the area is to ask him to return and work for him to occupy the position again.\n\nSupporting the collective decision by the leaders, Ganiyu Egunjobi, chairman of Agege local government council, said the Speaker had brought glory to Agege and that he should be encouraged to return to the House unopposed.\n\nEarlier, the Islamic clergy at the Iftar, Chief Imam Quadri Abdul Ganiu Ayorinde, harped on love and the importance of Ramadan.\n\nHe prayed for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the APC, and Obasa and described those who invite Muslim faithful to break fast with them as blessed.",

          "title": "Macron to Face Le Pen in French Presidential Election Runoff on April 24",
          "text": "French leader Emmanuel Macron and challenger Marine Le Pen qualified for what promises to be a very tightly fought presidential election runoff on April 24, pitting a pro-European economic liberal against a far-right nationalist.\n\nWith 96 percent of the votes counted for Sunday\u2019s first round, Macron garnered 27.41 percent of the votes and Le Pen 24.03 percent.\n\nIn face of the results, other major candidates admitted defeat, and except for another far-right candidate, Eric Zemmour, they all urged voters to block the far-right in the second round.\n\nBut after five years in power in which his abrasive style has upset many, while Le Pen succeeded in softening her image, Macron will have to fight hard to win back disgruntled voters. He cannot take it for granted that voters will rally around a traditional anti-far right front.\n\n\u201cNothing is decided, and the battle we will wage in the next 15 days will be decisive for France and Europe,\u201d Macron told supporters, urging all voters to rally behind him on April 24th to stop the far-right from ruling the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nIfop pollsters predicted a very tight runoff, with 51 percent for Macron and 49 percent for Le Pen. The gap is so tight that victory either way is within the margin of error.\n\nOther pollsters offered a slightly bigger margin in favour of Macron, with up to 54 percent. But that was in any case much narrower than in 2017, when Macron beat Le Pen with 66.1 percent of the votes.\n\nLe Pen, who had eaten into Macron\u2019s once-commanding 10-point poll lead in recent weeks thanks to a campaign focused on cost-of-living issues said she was the one to protect the weak and unite a nation tired of its elite.\n\n\u201cWhat will be at stake on April 24 is a choice of society, a choice of civilisation,\u201d she told supporters, who chanted \u201cWe will win!\u201d as she told them: \u201cI will bring order back to France.\u201d\n\nMacron, meanwhile, told supporters waving French and EU flags: \u201cThe only project that is credible to help purchasing power is ours.\u201d\n\nFollowing the announcement of the projections, Communist Party candidate Fabien Roussel, Socialist Anne Hidalgo, Yannick Jadot of the Greens and right-wing Republicans\u2019 candidate Valerie Pecresse said they would vote for Macron to prevent the far-right leader from coming to power.\n\n\u201cSo that France does not fall into hatred of all against all, I solemnly call on you to vote on April 24 against the far-right of Marine Le Pen,\u201d Hidalgo, who polled ninth with just under two percent of votes, said.\n\nPecresse also said she would vote for Macron, warning of \u201cdisastrous consequences\u201d if he did not win the runoff. Melenchon urged his supporters to refrain from voting for Le Pen in the runoff.\n\n\u201cWe know who we will never vote for \u2026 Not a single vote must go to Mrs Le Pen,\u201d he said at his party headquarters in Paris, stopping short of telling supporters they should back Macron.\n\nFar-right candidate Eric Zemmour endorsed Le Pen, the only major candidate to do so. He acknowledged disagreements with Le Pen, but said Macron was a worse choice.\n\nPolitical Commentator Pierre Huski said that Le Pen might be disappointed with the projected results announced.\n\nHuski believes the gap between the estimated votes of Le Pen and Macron makes the former a weaker challenger than she imagined for the second round.\n\n\u201cThe next two weeks will be pretty hard for her as she has to face the president, who is good at debating, on a televised debate,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, she lost [to Macron] because of the same debate.\u201d\n\nLate campaign run\n\nNot for two decades has a French president won a second term.\n\nBarely a month ago, Macron appeared near certain to reverse that, riding high in polls thanks to strong economic growth, a fragmented opposition and his statesman role in trying to avert war on Europe\u2019s eastern flank.\n\nHowever, he paid a price for late entry into the campaign, during which he eschewed market walkabouts in provincial France in favour of a single big rally outside Paris. A plan to make people work longer also proved unpopular.\n\nBy contrast, Le Pen for months toured towns and villages across France, focusing on cost-of-living issues that trouble millions and tapping into anger towards the political elite.\n\nA Le Pen victory on April 24 would lurch France, the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy, from being a driving force for European integration to being led by a euro-sceptic who is also suspicious of the NATO military alliance.\n\nWhile Le Pen has ditched past ambitions for a \u201cFrexit\u201d or to haul France out of the eurozone\u2019s single currency, she envisages the EU as a mere alliance of sovereign states.\n\nWho next holds the Elysee Palace will depend on how those who backed Macron and Le Pen\u2019s rivals cast their ballots. In past elections in 2002 and 2017, voters on the left and right have united to block the far-right from power.",
