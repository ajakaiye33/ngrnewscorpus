          "title": "Ninety: Building A Legacy",
          "text": "Words By \u2013 Oreva Akpobome\n\nHe grew up in an Anglican household, the fourth of five children and the only male. Alabo Tuwonimi Tuonims, professionally addressed as Ninety, attended Kings & Queens High School, and Spring Foundation School, both in Bonny Island, Rivers State, for his primary and secondary education respectively.\n\nHe grew up listening to Michael Jackson, Damian Marley, and Style Plus and started writing his own music as early as age 15. In 2016, Ninety graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology from the Accra Institute of Technology, Accra, Ghana. After graduation, Ninety returned to PortHarcourt, took a course in music production and audio engineering, and learned to play the keyboard, making it the second musical instrument he plays having learnt drumming in Junior Secondary School.\n\nIn 2017, he set up his own studio, which he commercialized but used mostly himself.\n\nDecked in a crisp white shirt paired with blue jeans and white low-top sneakers, Ninety gives us insight into how he plans to leave a legacy.\n\nHow would you describe the kind of music that you make?\n\nI would describe my sound as Afro-Fusion. My particular brand of Afro-Fusion is a combination of R n B and Soul, with that familiar Afro \u201criddim\u201d we all love. But this description is if we\u2019re talking genres. I just make the kind of music that touches on personal experiences, and seeks to elevate the spirit; Silky, relatable vibrations. I think that\u2019s a good way to describe the kind of music I make.\n\nWhere do you find inspiration?\n\nMusic! That\u2019s what inspires me. I don\u2019t know if that answers your question but for me, listening to music takes me to a different world. The melodies, the lyrics, the production etc. it\u2019s all so beautiful to me, and it inspires me to create my own music, to add to everything that\u2019s out there. The feeling I get from experiencing music is unmatched, I can\u2019t describe it, and I believe that\u2019s why it\u2019s so therapeutic for me. It\u2019s actually funny because, my friends always tease me about how I carry around my huge headphones to listen to music but to me, it\u2019s what takes me to my happy place.\n\nWhat motivates you to create?\n\nNew experiences motivate me to create. Music is how I naturally express myself, so, whenever I experience something new, whether it\u2019s a place, a feeling, a person, or a relationship, my natural instinct is to tell people about it through lyrics and rhythm. I am quite an introverted person, so, making myself and my issues the center of attention is still a bit odd to me (laughs). But, when I turn all that into music, it\u2019s easier for me to express myself and connect with people.\n\nHow do you define success as an artist?\n\nFor me, success is when people I don\u2019t know start looking forward to my next drop. That\u2019s when an artist is a true gem. Having friends and family support me means a lot but, they know me already. They\u2019ve seen my highs and lows, wins and losses, and they have invested time and effort into my life; so, they are naturally genuinely excited about what I create. But when total strangers are sending me messages, asking when my next song is coming out, or where my next performance is, it really warms my heart and drives me to do even more.\n\nDoes your art help you in other areas of your life?\n\nMost definitely. It has helped me express myself. It\u2019s very restorative for me and it creates the space I need to dig deep and process my thoughts and feelings. I don\u2019t have to bottle things up or hold on to them anymore because, my art helps me let go. It also helps me with building relationships with people. Artists need one another, especially in Nigeria where we need all the support and resources we can get. I\u2019ve made a lot of friendships from studio sessions, jam sessions, backstage at performances, things like that. It\u2019s made my life much fuller than I would have imagined.\n\nWhat\u2019s the purpose or goal of your work?\n\nI create music so I can be remembered. I want to leave something in this world for generations after me to listen to. I really think there is nothing new under the sun; so, the emotions and experiences we are going through today, will still be relatable to people decades from now, especially if it\u2019s coming from a genuine place. This music I make is part of my legacy, so I want people to grow up listening to it just like I grew up listening to great artistes. My work is bigger than me, and I want people to always know that I make music for the bigger picture, not for trends or social media fame.\n\nHow does your music relate to societal issues?\n\nI make music from the youth\u2019s point of view. In Nigeria, people are going through so many different things. We all have to deal with personal issues with our family and relationships, then we have career issues, school issues, rent etc. Then, there are problems specific to Nigeria like, bad governance, violence, unemployment, lack of basic amenities and infrastructure, the list is long. I infuse all of that in my music because, that\u2019s just the reality I live in, and it\u2019s relatable to so many young people in Nigeria. At the same time, I want my music to provide a sort of escape because problem no dey finish. We have to have an outlet to enjoy and de-stress.\n\nHow do you navigate the music industry?\n\nI keep an open mind, and I try to learn as much as possible. I have been blessed to have worked with, and still, work with some of the most talented and creative artists and music professionals in the country. So, I try to make sure that I keep my ears and eyes glued to what they are doing and really digest the advice they give. It\u2019s a learning curve for me, but I\u2019ve enjoyed every step.\n\nWhich art trends inspire your current work?\n\nI can\u2019t think of any. I don\u2019t usually get inspired by trends or what other people are currently doing. I just do my own thing and stay true to myself.\n\nHow has your style changed over time?\n\nI started by doing rap, trap, and a bit of soul. Over time, it has morphed into more of an Afro sound with hints of Soul and RnB. I haven\u2019t revisited rapping or trap music in a long time but who knows what\u2019s to come next (laughs). I think it\u2019s an artiste\u2019s job to evolve, though. So, I am excited to hear what my sound would be like in a couple of years.\n\nWhat are your favourite and least favourite parts of doing music?\n\nMy favourite part is the creative process itself. There is a certain magic about having an idea turn into a beat, then lyrics, and then turn into a full song. I\u2019m in the studio a lot, so it\u2019s a very comfortable place for me and once I am comfortable, the ideas just flow. For my least favourite part, I don\u2019t have one. I love every part of it. Even the parts that force me to become more extroverted than I normally would be.\n\nDo you have a network of other artistes, and how do they support you?\n\nYes, I do. I know people and have worked with people who have shown me and my music true love and support by playing and sharing my music with friends and at events. I have also, met some amazing people through social media who I\u2019ve stayed connected with and have been showing me love, through reposts, shares, likes, comments, shoutouts\u2026you know things like that. And of course, sharing tips and advice from one artiste to another, is a powerful way of building a community where, we can all support one another.\n\nHow would you describe your response to criticism?\n\nI listen and filter out as necessary. People will always have an opinion so, to me, it is important not to sway too much, but at the same time criticism is what helps us all move forward. So, as long as I feel like it\u2019s coming from a genuine, constructive place, my ears are always open. I try as much to stay original while accommodating criticism.\n\nIs there a specific environment or material that\u2019s integral to your work?\n\nI would say the guitar. It is the base of most of my songs. It\u2019s an instrument that fits me well because it can be played in many different ways. The guitar has many layers to it just like me.\n\nWho are your biggest artistic influences?\n\nBurna Boy for sure is a huge influence. Being a Port Harcourt guy himself, I feel like we share a common background. He has stayed true to himself and his sound while still developing his artistry, and creating an international audience, that really inspires me. PartyNextDoor is another big influence for me, he has that dancehall sound infused with RnB that I love. It has a cool rhythmic quality. He never does too much but it\u2019s always impactful. And lastly, I would say Frank Ocean, because his lyrical game is out of this world, and he has a way of conveying feelings in a song that I admire.\n\nWhat were your earliest influences in music?\n\nFrom my personal life, I would say my dad. He introduced me to so many songs that I cannot even remember the names of (laughs), but the melodies have stayed with me till now. But generally, it would definitely be Style Plus and Michael Jackson.\n\nWhat is the biggest problem you have encountered in the journey of music?\n\nThe most challenging thing for me was, having no one believe in the bigger picture I had for myself and my music at the beginning of my journey, especially, because of where I come from. It\u2019s always a struggle breaking out from the career norm and doing something like music. Even though artistes and professionals in the music business are getting a lot more respect than they were years ago, making the cross-over into the music world, is still a hurdle. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so eternally grateful to Magnito, Michael Ugwu and the Freeme Music team. You know, they are still the only independent, indigenously owned distribution and label services in Nigeria, if not Africa, and the fact that they were the only people, willing to take that leap and make being a working artiste a reality for me. This is something I appreciate tremendously.\n\nIf you could change one thing in the music industry, what would it be?\n\nI\u2019m not in a position to say what\u2019s what. I\u2019m still learning and trying to make a way for myself. Each obstacle is a learning curve for me. Until I get to a point where I completely know the ins and outs of the industry like the back of my hand, I\u2019m just rolling with it and defining my own path. I believe I\u2019ll get to a place where I would be able to create my own wave that will inspire others to get into music.\n\nIn what ways do you think social media has changed the music industry?\n\nI think it\u2019s the biggest thing that has happened in the evolution of music distribution and consumption. Communication is everything and social media has made that super easy. I can drop a snippet of my song, a cover, anything and it can reach people worldwide. They are able to save it, replay it, share it, and remix it, the possibilities social media has provided for artistes and their supporters in terms of listening and interacting with music, is mind-blowing. And it is only getting better.",

She recently appeared on the Forbes 30 under 30 for 2022, as one of the continent\u2019s brightest achievers under the age of 30.\n\nBorn into a family of six by entrepreneurial parents with a business conglomerate spanning manufacturing, real estate, oil and gas, naturally instilled considerable pro-business values in her, which inspired a successful career path today.\n\nIn this interview, the graduate of Economics and Political Science from the University of Manchester, UK, talks about her career, making the Forbes 30 under 30 list, family background, her definition of feminism and future goals.\n\nYou recently made the Forbes under 30 list. What does it mean to you?\n\nI am proud of myself that a modest, young, Nigerian woman like myself through passion, determination and hard work, gets to represent Nigerian entrepreneurism in such a progressive light. I\u2019m proud of what this exposure does for the psyche of the average Nigerian youth in these remarkably tough times.\n\nI\u2019m proud that the international media is paying attention to young Nigerian (women), who, are making real impact in the renewables sector.\n\nCan you tell us about your career path, your role in your company, and why you chose your line of business?\n\nFrom a young age, I was exposed to the energy industry through the family business. However, I gained a new perspective on energy when I started my career at the United Nations Secretariat in New York. I learnt that energy had to be clean, safe and sustainable. Even more, that closing the energy access gap had to start by reaching the furthest behind first. It was at that time that, I found an outlet where I could actively work on effecting change. This change was none other than the energy transition. As a young woman in Nigeria, I understood the importance of having a dream this big, the impact it would have on the country, and the flame it would ignite in the hearts of young people; the underdogs, the underestimated who had something to prove. I wanted to channel the energy of the youth in order, to usher in this change.\n\nHow long has your company been in business and what services does it offer?\n\nSalpha Energy \u201cSalpha\u201d is a solar company that was founded five years ago, which, designs and distributes a range of solar systems for homes and businesses that are off-grid and with unreliable grid access, which constitutes a greater proportion of the Nigerian population.\n\nSalpha\u2019s business model is based on the understanding that pricing and the reduction of upfront costs is key to capturing the target customer base. The Nigerian energy market is bottom heavy, so our strategy is to bring the underserved and unserved homes and businesses in rural and urban areas into focus, and up the energy ladder.\n\nWhat was your mission and goal when you were starting out your company? Is your mission and goal same as the outset?\n\nMy mission was simple and consistent over the years. Firstly, to reach the furthest behind in energy poverty first, by providing clean and affordable solar energy products across Africa.\n\nSecondly, to harness the energy, passion, and intelligence of the youth across the nation and continent, towards accelerating access to clean energy.\n\nWhat are some of the books you have read that have really stuck with you and has helped shape the way you think as a female entrepreneur?\n\nPsychology of Money \u2013 Morgan Housel\n\nLife Visioning \u2013 Michael Bernard Beckwith\n\nPower of Character in Leadership \u2013 Myles Monroe\n\nWho was your role model growing up and who is your model now?\n\nMy role model growing up were my parents because I was inspired by all they were able to achieve with sheer hard work and team spirit.\n\nTell us a bit about your background. What is it about your parents that inspired your career path?\n\nOn a personal level, I grew up watching my entrepreneurial parents grow the family business into a conglomerate spanning various sectors including; Oil and Gas, Manufacturing and Real Estate. Naturally, growing up in such a household inspired me and instilled considerable pro-business values in me, helping me realize that through our commercial endeavours, we can very much have a positive influence on other people\u2019s lives.\n\nWhat were some of your fondest memory as a child?\n\nI had so much fun growing up. I was a very playful, cheeky and inquisitive kid that loved exploring the neighbourhood, playing pranks and video games. My fondest memories were me and my cousin Pascal, sneaking out of the house with our bmx bikes and racing against each other, also beating my brothers in our family fifa tournaments.\n\nAs a young entrepreneur who just made the Forbes under 30 lister, what does female empowerment mean to you?\n\nI always love to quote this line \u201cFemale empowerment means being brave enough to question and go against social and gender norms \u2014 to go against what one is taught. It means redefining beauty, power and womanhood as a whole.\u201d\n\nWhat are the pressures that comes with being a young female entrepreneur and how do you maneuver them?\n\nHaving to assert myself more and prove myself constantly in situations in which I think that a man would not need to do such things. Though over the years, people have come to accept that I\u2019m a young female dominating my field.\n\nAlthough, proving and asserting myself was not difficult because, from a young age, I was surrounded by entrepreneurial women because my family business was structured in a way that gave men and women equal opportunities to thrive. I watched my mother in her mid 20s, manage a wide portfolio of companies and she was also a serial entrepreneur. My parents also gave me a seat at the table and always made it clear that my voice mattered.\n\nI am also a leader that believes in working as a united front and creating an empowering work environment to inspire future-oriented thinking and celebrate diversity.\n\nWhat\u2019s your typical day like and how do you unwind?\n\nI run my own business alongside my family owned business. So, sometimes, my typical day involves going to multiple places. I could go to the mainland where my office is at Festac or Apapa where my family business is. I could also be in Victoria Island. So, in one day I could shuttle around these three places and what am I doing? Checking on the teams to see how they are doing, basically troubleshooting.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m a nerd and workaholic. So I unwind by meditating. Every evening, I shut everything off and tune into myself. Call it a spiritual practice, I feel that it really helps you ground yourself and asides that, I love to read. I\u2019m very nerdy, so that keeps me very relaxed and in the know of what is happening. I chill with my family too and play video games with my oculus VR set.\n\nHow would you describe your fashion style?\n\nI am on a style journey, but it also goes without saying my style is intended to build reality to my tagline, which is chic, classy and clean.\n\nAnyway, I am simple and sophisticated, I always believe in simplicity with a dose of sophistication in attaining a great look.\n\nIn my closet, you will always find a statement handbag, a classic blazer, high waisted Jeans and a pair of sneakers.\n\nWhat are you most grateful for?\n\nMy resilience.

          "title": "Oluyemi Orija: Heartbeat For Indigent Inmates",
          "text": "She is an unusual breed. Oluyemi Orija, Managing Partner at Headfort Chambers cum Executive Director of Headfort Foundation, is one who has dedicated her life to decongesting Nigerian prisons by helping poor inmates access justice.\n\nTill date, she has rewritten the story of almost 300 Nigerians who would have still been waiting endlessly for their cases to go to trial.\n\nThe lawyer, entrepreneur and human rights activist has gained global fame and recognition for her work, as she was in 2021 listed among the BBC 100 Most Influential and Inspirational Women Around the World. Orija has also drawn the attention of reputable local and international media outlets like Aljazeera and the Guardian UK. In this interview, she speaks to Allure on her work, life, and style.\n\nHow did it feel to be on the 2021 BBC list of 100 Most Influential and Inspirational Women Around the World?\n\nThe feeling is surreal, amazing, and comforting to know that people are seeing the work I and my team are doing. It is not just seen nationally but globally. Importantly, I am encouraged to keep doing the good work of putting smiles on the faces of the less privileged.\n\nThe average lawyer sees an opportunity for money-making in every case; what propelled you into free legal services?\n\nMy definition of success from a very young age has always been positive impaction in peoples\u2019 lives and not prosperity. For me, it is prosperity to have a lot of money, but it is success to touch lives. Being a lawyer gave me the opportunity to touch lives by looking for indigent inmates incarcerated unjustly, and rendering free legal service to them. The inmates need the services, but they cannot afford it; hence they continue to languish in prison even if they were innocent or charged for minor offences. I might not be rich in the pocket or bank account now, but I know I am very wealthy considering that I and my team have, as of today, touched 295 lives and families, by ensuring their freedom from prisons.\n\nThe Nigerian justice system is notoriously complicated; doesn\u2019t this deter you sometimes?\n\nThere is no doubt that the justice system is complicated and if it were not complicated, the inmates might not need our services in the first place. We are aware of this fact, and we always prepare to confront it. I am like the shoulder my team members lean on when discouraged; so, I cannot afford to be deterred or discouraged. I am always focused on the end goal\u2014 which is, freedom of an innocent young man/woman in prison. This keeps me going.\n\nHow do you determine which inmate deserves your help amid thousands crying for justice daily?\n\nWe do not take all cases. There are requirements to be met before we can offer our services to an inmate. The first is, the inmate must be indigent, meaning the inmate and the family are poor and cannot afford legal services. The second one is that the inmate is innocent of the crime charged or he is charged with misdemeanor. How we determine innocence is that we look at the documents before the court, the evidence against the inmates, and where there is a complainant, we also reach out to the complainant to hear from him/her. You will know a trumped-up charge when you see one.\n\nThis is a huge calling and you personally cannot stand as defending counsel in every case; what has trying to gather lawyers of like-minds cost you?\n\nAt the beginning, it was tough getting lawyers on our team because we didn\u2019t have a huge amount of money to pay but we were consistent. At every recruitment, we made sure to sell the vision to applicants and made them realise that we do not have so much money to pay. We were keen on those passionate about the cause and ready to grow with us. Some people joined and left while some stayed. It is easier now to get passionate lawyers to join the team because our work and integrity is doing the talking and we now receive volunteers\u2019 applications daily.\n\nHave you ever had to reward any lawyer financially to work with you?\n\nAbsolutely! I have seven lawyers currently under my direct employment apart from other administrative staff, and they are paid monthly to do the work. Some volunteers will also request for money, but we always remind those volunteers the meaning of volunteerism. We encourage our volunteers via other means but not financially because we obviously cannot afford it.\n\nWho bears the cost of that; you or the inmate?\n\nHeadfort Foundation bears the cost. We do not collect any dime from inmates or our beneficiaries.\n\nThe economy is tough; how do you get funds for your work?\n\nI own a law firm called Headfort Chambers; this law firm is into general law practice, and it is 100% for profit purposes. A certain percentage of our proceeds at the firm goes into the foundation monthly, to help with the operations of the foundation. Aside from this, we also use the online platform to solicit for funding from individuals and private organisations; and we now have good Nigerians home and in diaspora supporting this cause financially.\n\nThe Headfort Foundation is said to be the first to introduce technology into access to justice in Nigeria by creating an App that links victims to pro bono lawyers; how functional and effective has this been?\n\nThe \u201cLawyers NowNow\u201d App is very efficient and it is functional all over Nigeria. Since we launched it on the 1st of April 2021, it has well over 2,000 downloads and has attended to about 300 cases. The App automatically assigns the cases reported on it to lawyers who are already registered on the app as volunteers and the lawyers swing to action immediately to act on the cases. The App is like the best thing to happen to the Nigerian youth who are the major victims of police brutality, harassment, and extortion.\n\nFrom your experience, what\u2019s the biggest reason Nigerian prisons are so congested?\n\nThe biggest reasons the Nigerian prisons are congested is bad policing and lack of consequences for bad policing. The police arrest people without any evidence of crime, they turn civil matters to crime, charge people on trumped-up charges and these acts are aided by the magistrates by dumping them in prison. I have been in a court where the magistrate was asking the prosecutor \u201cwhat kind of charge is this?\u201d but instead of throwing out the charge against the defendant, the magistrate still remanded the defendant in prison and granted him a bail whose conditions he could not perfect. The police officer responsible for the arrest and all other officers who approved such charges were supposed to be held responsible for bringing such frivolous charges to court, and wasting the resources of the state to prosecute the charges. When police officers are punished and made to pay fines/penalty for these acts, we will have less frivolous charges in courts and thereafter, less inmates in prison.\n\nRehabilitation is supposed to be a primary function of prison service but has remained a major challenge in this clime. Does this give you any concern?\n\nAbsolutely, this gives me a lot of concern, but you would not blame the correctional centers. Imagine a center built for 800 inmates housing over 3,000 inmates; what kind of rehabilitation will take place there? Where inmates presumed innocent are living in the same space with condemned inmates for months, and sometimes, years? NGOs and religious bodies have been supporting the correctional centers in this regard but there is more still to be done. We have recognised this gap at Headfort Foundation and that is why we designed a project called \u201cEx-inmate Support Initiative.\u201d The project is basically to support our beneficiaries as soon as they are released. We refer them to our social workers and counsellors, they counsel them and help re-integrate them back into the society; and we assist them around employment, skill acquisition, education, physical and mental health support.\n\nWhat are the bottlenecks you face while trying to help inmates access justice?\n\nThe bottlenecks we face include financial demands by court officials who expect us to \u2018tip\u2019 them to do the work they they are paid to do notwithstanding that we are rendering pro bono services, unnecessary adjournments on cases, long wait for DPP advice, and when the advice is finally out, arraignment at the high court and assignment of the cases to judges. These and many more are the challenges we face.\n\nIt took you barely three years to establish your own law chamber after law school; looks like you were in a hurry\u2026\n\nYou can say that again. During my youth service, I read the book, \u2018The Girl Entrepreneur\u2019 by Ibukun Awosika. The book was an eye opener to entrepreneurship; it helped me to prepare for entrepreneurship. I gave myself the target of three years to be under pupilage and during these three years, I cared less about the peanut I was earning, I gave my all into my work and learned all that is there to learn. Now, I will be 10 years at the bar this year and of course, I am still learning every day.\n\nWhat takes your time when you aren\u2019t pursuing cases?\n\nWhen I am not working, you will see me having quality time with my son and catching up with my family. These are the people from whom I draw the strength to work.\n\nWhat does a typical day look like for you?\n\nMy typical day is wake up and set my team on top gear, give them information and resources to carry on their daily duty if there is need to, go to court if I have a case to personally attend to, surf internet for opportunity for the organisation, reach out to stakeholders, and remain at standby at all times because I can be called for anything at any time.\n\nWhat\u2019s your preferred holiday destination if you ever find time for holidays?\n\nMy preferred holiday destination would be Santorini in Greece.\n\nDescribe your personal style in a few words\u2026\n\nMy personal style is actually very boring; you will most times find me in a pair of jeans, and a T-shirt, with a pair of sneakers\u2014 but when I want to feel girly, a pair of high heels will go along with it.\n\nWhat fashion item won\u2019t you ever be caught without?\n\nOne fashion item you will always find me with is my wristwatch. I feel naked without it.",

We suspected that they passed a night in a bush closed to Zak.\n\n\u201cWhen people realised that the bandits arrived in the community, they quickly informed Operation Safe Haven stationed in Zak and they swiftly mobilised their troops to the general area and repelled the attacks together with the vigilantes. It was a serious crash, \u201d Shapi\u2019 added.\n\nWhen contacted, the Spokesman of the Military Taskforce responsible for the maintenance of peace in the state, code-named Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), Major Ishaku Takwa, also confirmed the incident to journalists, but could not ascertain the casualty figure.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of an incident in Wase, but I cannot confirm any casualty.\n\n\u201cOur troops repelled the attack, our men moved to Gajin Bashar community after receiving distress calls of an attack, that\u2019s all I can say for now\u201d, he explained.\n\nDAILY POST reports that Zak is about 40 kilometers from Wase town, the headquarters of Wase LGA.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has bid farewell to the outgoing Secretary-General of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Mohammed Barkindo.\n\nAt a brief reception at the Presidential Villa Abuja on Tuesday in Abuja, Buhari said the nation would remain grateful for his invaluable contributions to the oil and gas sector, describing him as a worthy ambassador of the country.\n\nThe President noted that posterity will remember him kindly for making the nation and himself proud during his six years of meritorious service at the helm of affairs as the 4th OPEC Secretary-General from Nigeria.\n\nThe President directed the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited to mobilise the oil and gas industry to organise a befitting welcome reception in honour of Barkindo.\n\n\u2018\u2018You have indeed been a worthy ambassador of our country. We are proud of your achievements before and during your appointment at OPEC and the proud legacies you will leave behind.\n\n\u2018\u2018Your time in charge of the affairs of OPEC has been a very challenging one for the global oil industry. Oil producers were finding it difficult to come together to address challenges that were crippling the oil market.\n\n\u2018\u2018Not long after, the world was faced with the COVID-19 pandemic that sent crude prices spiralling down at an alarming rate. You showed incredible leadership to rally industry players and pushed through the turbulent times.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is no doubt about your efforts in putting together the Declaration of Cooperation which is the largest in the history of OPEC and the global oil industry and also the longest in duration in the history of the organization. This was a herculean task,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nThe Nigerian leader heaped more praise on his compatriot for providing experienced administrative management to OPEC, adding that his efforts have placed the organisation in a stronger position to confront the challenges it will face in the coming years.\n\nIn his remarks, Barkindo attributed his success to the tremendous guidance, charisma, and international gravitas of President Buhari; support from the OPEC secretariat in Vienna; and cooperation by members of the organisation.\n\nHe recounted how the counsel from President Buhari helped in the birthing of the Declaration of Cooperation of OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries, after he assumed office in Vienna, Austria in 2016 during a downturn in the sector when oil prices plunged to less than 10 U.S dollars per barrel.\n\n\u2018\u2018It was very obvious to me that this was beyond OPEC alone to address. We needed to get the support of other leading oil producers around the world.\n\n\u2018\u2018I recall that I did consult with you and I drank from your fountain of wisdom and your deep reservoir of knowledge of OPEC and global affairs.\n\n\u2018\u2018With your advice and guidance, I set out to various capitals around the world to try to persuade them to understand the gravity of the situation and the need for them to urgently join hands with OPEC.\n\n\u2018\u2018I did explain to them that they do not have to be full members of OPEC but we could work together in a framework of cooperation and on the 10th December, 2016 we signed this historic agreement in Vienna, and on the 1st January, we started working together and we were able to assist the oil market to restore stability.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe former OPEC Secretary-General noted that the Declaration of Cooperation, which is now in its sixth year, also helped the organisation to navigate the turbulence in the market occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nHe explained that amidst COVID-19, the organisation took a decision to withdraw 9.6 million barrels per day from the market- the highest ever adjustment in its history- for a duration of two years.\n\nHe added that OPEC is now in the final lap of restoring the production figures due to a rebound in the global market and economy.\n\nBarkindo stressed that \u2018\u2018throughout the period of my tenure I have continued to benefit from the President\u2019s international goodwill and everywhere I visited in the world both within OPEC and outside OPEC, the first person your fellow Presidents, Prime Ministers and Kings, ask me of is; how is my brother, President Muhammamdu Buhari.\u2019\u2019\n\nHaving survived the major turbulences in 2016 and 2020, Barkindo expressed confidence that the worst is over and the future looks very promising for the organisation.\n\nHe, therefore, thanked President Buhari for giving him the opportunity to serve, pledging that Nigeria would continue to play its leadership role in OPEC as well as in the global oil industry.",

Whoever claims to know the date is not only misleading the public but cannot claim to be a genuine Servant of God. He is at best, an agent of Satan pretending to be a Pastor.\n\n\u201cCAN, therefore, commends the Police for their prompt actions which included rescuing over 70 victims from the Church premises. They should further be subjected to medical check-ups since nobody knows what they were going through where they were camped.\n\n\u201cWe hereby urge all denominations to keep an eye on the pastors under them towards ensuring wholesome biblical conduct. Members of the churches all over the nation are enjoined to cross-check every teaching from the Bible before believing it,\u201d the statement further stated.\n\nRecall that the nation was awaken with a discovery of over 40 children allegedly camped in a church building on the guise of rapture.",

As much as we know that Atiku reserves the right to choose whoever he wills as his running mate, we also have the right to vote according to our desire.\n\n\u201cAnd that desire is clear- that the PDP would not get one vote from Igbo land should they field Wike, because this is a man who disowned Ndigbo.

The National Working Committee (NWC) is divided now.\n\n\u201cSome governors, ex-governors, ex-ministers and founding fathers of the party like a former National Security Adviser Gen. Aliyu Gusau, ex-President of the Senate Bukola Saraki, Governors Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, Douye Diri and Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, ex-Governors Henry Seriake Dickson, Sule Lamido, Babangida Aliyu, Boni Haruna and others are with Atiku.\n\n\u201cBut from Wike\u2019s camp, a new set of power brokers is emerging. They include Governors Seyi Makinde and Samuel Ortom, ex-governor Hassan Dankwambo, Ayodele Fayose and Donald Duke, a former Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Bello Adoke (SAN), many senators and members of the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cDisturbed by the division, especially threat to PDP chances in swing states like Kano, Lagos and Rivers states, a former President of the Senate, some ex-ministers and leaders of the party are trying to make amend.

Wike is a committed and loyal party leader. He has been there for PDP when some leaders abandoned it.\n\n\u201cWike was recommended by a committee as vice presidential candidate of the party, but some forces in the party abandoned the report without mutual consultations.\n\n\u201cThey came up with ridiculous excuses of temperament, ambition and overzealousness. When it comes to certain challenges, Wike is useful.\n\n\u201cYet, it has pleased some leaders of the party to wish him away as nobody. They came up with ridiculous excuses.\n\n\u201cAlso, what is hurting the Rivers State governor and his strategists is that all mutual decisions agreed with Atiku were not honoured, including the one at their meeting after the presidential primaries. Atiku paid a visit to Wike in Abuja and some issues came up.\n\n\u201cThe next thing that happened in the party was that the likes of ex-Governor Babangida Aliyu started attacking Wike. The hand was Esau\u2019s, the voice was Jacob\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe source added: \u201cWike is ready to draw the battle lines any moment from now because Atiku\u2019s camp has not been forthcoming, especially on a minimum demand.\n\n\u201cIt was agreed that once a presidential candidate comes from the North, the National Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, will step down.\n\n\u201cIf PDP leaders cannot comply with a minimum threshold, you can imagine what will happen after the party wins the 2023 poll.\u201d\n\nA source in Atiku\u2019s camp said: \u201cIt is strategically unwise to ask Ayu to step down because Atiku is yet to win the election.

          "title": "VP slot: Islamic cleric, MBF, Afenifere, others reject Muslim-Muslim ticket",
          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna, Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nProminent Nigerians, including frontline Islamic cleric have cautioned against same religion presidential ticket, saying it would exacerbate the religious tension in the country.\n\nSince Bola Tinubu emerged the presidential candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC), there have been arguments and counter-arguments as to whether he would pick a Muslim or a Christian as running mate.\n\nKaduna-based Islamic cleric, Sheik Haliru Maraya, said it was wrong for any Muslim to support a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThe former special adviser to the late Kaduna State Governor, Ibrahim Yakowa on Islamic Matters and Hajj, said a one faith joint ticket was at variance with the spirit of justice entrenched in Islam.\n\nThe cleric, in a statement, yesterday, said those promoting the Muslim-Muslim ticket do not wish the country well.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a Muslim who will support a Christian-Christian presidential ticket. Undoubtedly, the Muslims would cry out for the perpetration of injustice against them. Hence, it is wrong for a Muslim to support a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket as it is at variance with the spirit of justice which the religion of Islam promotes and defends at all times.\n\n\u201cThose promoting the idea of a Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian presidential ticket, in today\u2019s Nigeria, do not wish the country well, especially now that it is divided along religious fault lines. I wonder what the country would be should the various agitations in the land assume\n\n\u201cFor a political party to have Muslims as its national chairman, presidential candidate and vice-presidential candidate, such a party is indeed not in a position to say it promotes and defends the spirit of justice, fairness and equity.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a multi-religious country of more than 200 million people who are Muslims and non-Muslims. Hence, one can say that the country is owned by more than 200 million citizens who are of diverse religious background. In order to be just to all the citizens of the country, and also to balance the apparent religious sentiments prevalent in the country, Nigeria\u2019s politicians and its major political parties have avoided fielding same-faith presidential candidates since the present political dispensation from 1999.\n\n\u201cIn any event, the combination of people of different religious background, on a presidential ticket, appears to give vent to the constitutional requirement that the composition of the Federal Government and its agencies should reflect the federal character of the country, and the need to promote national unity, thereby ensuring that there is no predominance of sectional groups in the government, as enshrined in Section 14(3) of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria as amended.\u201d\n\nMaraya said the combination of a Muslim and non-Muslim, in a presidential ticket, in Nigeria of today, also gives vent to the spirit of justice, fairness and equity as enshrined in the religion of Islam.\n\nIn its reaction, the Nigeria Democracy Defence Watch, also warned that a Muslim/Muslim ticket would adversely affect its fortune.\n\nIts National Coordinator and National Secretary, Ahmed Adamu and Adeniji Adegoke, in a letter addressed to President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said the plan would portray Nigeria as an Islamic and sectarian nation.\n\nThe group said millions of Christians, moderate and progressive Muslims, civic groups, ethno-cultural associations and enlightened members of the international community, would rise against the ticket.\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said anybody contemplating that alternative was not thinking about the sensitivity of Nigerians and the situation at hand. He noted that Nigeria is currently polarised so much that such a move is capable of inflaming the country beyond anybody\u2019s control.\n\nThough President of the Arewa Youths Consultative Forum (AYCF), Alhaji Yerima Shettima, agreed that Muslim-Muslim ticket is not ideal, he said it was inevitable for the APC under the current circumstance.\n\n\u201cAs it is today, considering the numerical strength of Muslim North, it will amount to a big risk and gamble for Tinubu to pick a non-Muslim from the North as his running mate. It is not because it is what I want but nobody can afford to gamble with a non-Muslim and expect a typical Northern Muslim to support that. It will be difficult, not because some of us want it that way, but that is the reality. I am sure if the APC had their way, they could have put a Christian from the North but considering the fact that there is mutual suspicion between Muslims and Christians in the North, it will be difficult for that to happen.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that APC has no choice, even as he noted that the journey with be rough with such arrangement.\n\n\u201cThe journey will still be rough for Muslim-Muslim ticket but it is a lesser risk for the party. So, I am sure they took the lesser risk above the major risk. An average Muslim in the North does not see Tinubu as his candidate; that is the sentiment.\n\n\u201cTinubu knows the game and the Muslims in the North also know the game and understand the consequences and that is why they are picking Muslim-Muslim. It is unfortunate because ordinarily, we would want to see a situation where we can all be equal in this project; a situation where it does not matter your religion as long as you can give us the result. That\u2019s my personal opinion but the reality on ground is different,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the Director General of Voice of Nigeria (VON) and chieftain of the ruling party, Osita Okechukwu, there is nothing wrong in the arrangement.\n\nHe said it would not be politically wise for the APC to go with a Northern Christian, who is a minority in the North, since Tinubu is a also minority in the South by the virtue of his faith as a Muslim in the South.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge difference between when a Northern Muslim runs a Southern Muslim presidential ticket, and when a Southern Muslim runs a Northern Muslim presidential ticket. A Southern Muslim is a minority in the South, therefore, may be compelled to choose a Northern Muslim who belongs to the majority in the North. Bear in mind that we are talking of real politicking, where victory is determined by numbers.\u201d\n\nBut for a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Adetokunbo Pearse and the National Publicity Secretary of pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, it would be the height of insensitivity for the APC to run with a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nPearse noted that the APC would be sending a clear message to Nigerians that it does not care about the unity of the country if it goes ahead with a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cThe APC will be telling Nigerians that their purpose is to win for the sake of winning, not for the sake of bringing unity or peace, if they go with a Muslim vice presidential candidate. A Muslim-Muslim ticket will further reduce the electability of Tinubu whose chances are quite narrow even now. Keeping in mind that the Vice President is selected and not elected, a Muslim- Muslim ticket, or a South-South ticket will represent a clear demonstration of insensitivity and political recklessness,\u201d he said.\n\nThough Ajayi said religion is not a measure of performance, he noted that agitation for religious balance has become a big issue in Nigeria\u2019s politics due to lack of equity, fairness and justice in the way the country is being governed.\n\n\u201cThe issue of religion, like the issue of ethnicity, becomes topical in Nigeria today because those governing the country, especially in the recent time, have shown deleterious and unbiased bias against those who are not of their faith or the same ethnic group like them. Because of the polarisation in the country today, the ideal thing is to have people of the two faiths combining \u2013 Muslim/Christian or Christian/Muslim. What I think we should stress more is good governance; the type that would ensure that equity, fairness and justice are the operational norms,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Christopher Oji, Sunday Ani and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nOndo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), has said that members of the South West security outfit, Amotekun, would no longer wait for herdsmen and bandits terrorising the state to attack the people, but take the battle to them in the forest.\n\nHe also noted that since the criminals acquired prohibited and sophisticated arms to carry out their nefarious activities without check, the governors may be compelled to acquire their own weapons to confront them headlong.\n\nSpeaking during the Politics Today programme on Channels Television, yesterday, Akeredolu decried a situation where criminals are left to acquire illegal weapons, while Nigerians are disposed of their legally acquired weapons. \u201cWe cannot continue like this any longer. The governors will adopt their own ways to get arms to defend their people,\u201d he added.\n\nHe equally said that if the worsening security situation is to be controlled, Nigeria must begin to seriously consider the issue of state police, because that is the only way out of this insecurity mess in Nigeria: \u201cWe know the limitations of our security agencies, which is caused by our perverted federalism. We cannot secure Nigeria with a central police command. We need to have state police. A situation where one command sits in Abuja to give orders to the rest of the country is no longer factional now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor also charged the people of Ondo State to, henceforth, confront the criminals when they attack them, instead of running into their homes.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t run away from them. We must be prepared to confront the challenge. Our people cannot afford to lay back as if we are lazy. We are not lazy; we are indomitable. How we are going to confront the criminals is not what we shall discuss in public, but how we are going to do it is nobody\u2019s business,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the lessons learnt from the Owo Catholic Church attack, he said: \u201cWe should be more careful and very alert at all times to identify strangers in our midst at all times. And when incidents like that happen, we should not run into our houses, but confront it, and that way, the attackers will not be able to escape.\u201d\n\nIF YOU ARE CONFRONTED BY A LION, WH... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video IF YOU ARE CONFRONTED BY A LION, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?\n\nAgain, on the alleged arrest of some of the criminals involved in the Owo attack, the governor said the Amotekun Commander never said he arrested anybody. The man said they only recovered their vehicle and a handset which they handed over the DSS for analysis and further investigation.\n\nHe also disagreed with the Federal Government\u2019s position that Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) was responsible for the attack, saying the government was too quick to make such a claim.

Emmanuel Silas, was kidnapped by terrorists in the early hours of yesterday.\n\nThe Chancellor, Catholic Diocese of Kafanchan, Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Uchechukwu Okolo, confirmed the development in a statement made available to journalists in Kaduna. This was coming a few days after the burial of Rev. Fr. Vitus Borogo, who was killed by terrorists on his farm in Kujama, along Kaduna-Kachia Road on Saturday, June 25, 2022, and was laid to rest on June 30, 2022 in Kaduna.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cIt is with great pain that we announce to you the kidnapping of our priest, Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Silas. The event occurred in the early hours of July 04, 2022, when he could not turn up for morning Mass.\n\n\u201cHe was abducted from the parish rectory at St. Charles Catholic Church, Zambina, in Kauru Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\n\u00e5\u201cWe solicit an intense prayer for his quick and safe release; we equally wish to call on all and sundry to refrain from taking the laws into their hands. We will use every legitimate means to ensure his quick and safe release.\n\n\u201cMay Jesus, crucified on the Cross, listen to our prayers and hasten the unconditional release of His Priest and all other kidnapped persons.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Edo State Police Command, yesterday, announced the rescue of Rev. Fr Luigi Brena, 68, an Italian of Somascan Father\u2019s Community, who was kidnapped by hoodlums.\n\nNigeria no longer safe to live in \ufffd... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Nigeria no longer safe to live in \u2013Catholic bishops\n\nThe Command\u2019s deputy Public Relations Officer, ASP Jennifer Iwegbu, in a statement, said: \u201cIn our continuous efforts to curb crime and criminality in the state, most especially kidnapping, the Edo state police Commissioner, Abutu Yaro, has massively deployed police operatives to most of the identified volatile areas in the state, and the move has started yielding positive results.\n\n\u201cConsequent upon this, operatives of the Edo state police command attached to Iguobazuwa Division on the 03/07/2022, at about 1745hrs received information that Rev. Fr Luigi Brena \u2018M\u2019, 64 years, an Italian of Somascan Father\u2019s community, was kidnapped by hoodlums suspected to be kidnappers, along Ogunwuyi through Usen community in Ovia South West local government area of Edo state.\n\n\u201cOn receipt of the information, the police operatives immediately swung into action and trailed the suspected kidnappers to their camp.\n\n\u201cThe suspects, on sighting the operatives, opened fire on them but the superior fire power of the police operatives neutralised three of the kidnappers, while the rest escaped into the forest with various degrees of gunshot injuries, abandoning their victim.\n\n\u201cThe victim was immediately rushed to Igbinedion Teaching Hospital, Okada, for medical attention. Intensive bush combing is ongoing with the aim of arresting the suspected kidnappers now on the run,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMeanwhile, the police Command, in a separate incident, announced, yesterday, that it had arrested a 65-year-old Okoh Peter and four others, for allegedly engaging in cultism in Benin.\n\nAlso, a motorcyclist, who shot at policemen while trying to escape, was arrested in Auchi.\n\nThe Command, in a statement by its deputy PPRO, ASP Jennifer Iwegbu, said the arrest was in continuation of the police quest to rid the state of criminal elements.\n\n\u201cWith determination to check the menace and excesses of cultism and unnecessary killings in Edo State, men of the anti cultism unit of Edo State Police Command have been working round the clock with area commands and divisions to ensure that the ugly trend is stopped.\n\n\u201cThe move by the police has yielded tremendous success during operations. On 02/07/2022, at about 17:15hrs, operatives of state Command, Ekiadolor sector, while on routine patrol within Ekowe community and environs, intercepted some suspected cultists at the community\u2019s youth house.\n\n\u201cThe suspects, on sighting the police, took to their heels which attracted the attention of the operatives. The operatives chased and arrested five of them, Andrew Owhoyavwosa \u2018M\u2019 22 years, Joseph Meshak \u2018M\u2019 25 years, Osazee Solomon \u2018M\u2019 35 years, Godswill Obasohan \u2018M\u2019 25 years, Charles Odiase \u2018M\u2019 52 years and Okoh Peter \u2018M\u2019 68 years.\n\n\u201cOn the spot search conducted at the scene led to the recovery of two locally made single barrel guns, one locally cut to size single barrel gun, 30 live cartridges, a first aid box, other items as well as N37, 000,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cAlso, the motorcyclist was arrested by the operatives of the Command, in collaboration with vigilantes on 03/07/2022, at about 02:30hrs, while on routine patrol along Igbe Road in Auchi Etsako West Local Government Area of the state.\n\n\u201cHe was said to be acting suspicious when he was accosted and, in an attempt to evade arrest and escape, shot at the police, but was subdued and arrested.\n\n\u201cOn the spot search conducted on him led to the recovery of one locally made cut to size single barrel gun, one live cartridge and one expended cartridge, while the motorcycle with Reg. no. BEN-316-QP was also confiscated.\n\n\u201cDuring preliminary investigation, the suspect confessed to being a member of the dreaded Vikings Confraternity. He will be charged to court at the end of investigation,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commissioner of Police has assured residents of the state that the Command would not relent in its efforts to rid the state of criminal elements and their cohorts.

          "text": "As a prominent president of an African nation once explained to then US President Barack Obama, there are lines that Africans should never cross regardless of what the international community thinks. One of such lines is sexuality. While the rest of the world considers the pairing of a man and a woman to be conventional and can be flipped in the name of homosexuality, most of us are not having it. Even so, not everybody has been brave enough, like that African President, to speak out against the rising tide of this behaviour. But the Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), Segun Runsewe, is leading the conversation.\n\nNot long ago, there was a viral video that almost turned social media on its head: the video of Bobrisky (real name Idris Okeneye) in his female fa\u00e7ade during his alleged housewarming ceremony. In the beginning, Bobrisky received knocks because he claimed that he bought the house for N400 million.\n\nDuring the ceremony, however, Bobrisky was not the main attraction, rather the Islamic clerics who attended the housewarming ceremony took the spotlight.\n\nThe clerics were not at Bobrisky\u2019s party to renounce his cross-dressing lifestyle. They were there to pray for him, which is the norm on this side of the world whenever one accomplishes something worthwhile. Even though Bobrisky was dressed, spoke, and acted as a female, the clerics had nothing to say except to smile and bob their heads in the face of his aberrant behaviour.\n\nWhat Runsewe predicted not long ago is gradually taking root. According to him, if the Nigerian government does not take a firm stand on the matter of homosexuality and its associated lifestyles (including cross-dressing), it is only a matter of time before it becomes accepted. And if clerics can ignore it, who will have the courage to fight against it?\n\nAnd so Runsewe is vindicated. His vision, needless to say, is on point, as is his counsel on the matter.",

The company is on its own.\n\n\u201cOf course, we don\u2019t know who owns the mining site, and that is one of the problems we are facing in the state. We wanted to regulate their activities but they are resisting it.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said the state government would now domesticate the mining laws which will put all mines and miners under the state government control, while still remaining on the exclusive legislative list.",

          "text": "Ibrahim Oyewale in Lokoja\n\nThe private sector in Kogi State and the management of the Nigeria Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) are mulling a partnership arrangement between them that would lead to the completion of the Jamata River Port in Lokoja, the state capital.\n\nThe call for the completion of the River Port that was first awarded in 2012 by the federal government through a private partnership arrangement was made yesterday when the Organized Private Sector, made up of Shippers Council of Nigeria, Shippers Association, Manufacturing Association of Nigeria, Nigeria Association of Small Scale Industrialists (NASSI), Kogi State Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, and a high-powered management staff of Nigerian Inland Waterways Authority visited the port for a facility tour.\n\nThe General Manager, Marine Services of NIWA, Mr. Joseph Ororo, and the General Manager, Ports and Environmental Services, Agbalu Fidelis, were among other top management staff of NIWA at the facility tour.\n\nWhile the private sector lauded the efforts of the government thus far, it decried the slow pace of work on the port, pointing out that if the port is operational, it would help reduce cost of doing business.\n\nThe private sector said the location of Lokoja and the River Port cannot be overemphasised, lamenting that travel time, loss of many hours, and dilapidated nature of the state of Nigerian roads have made it very important to complete the Lokoja port.\n\nThe stakeholders identified adequate budgetary funding as factor that has slowed down the pace of work since it was first awarded in 2005 and later in 2012.\n\nWhile pointing out that following the 2012 flooding that was witnessed in the state, which led to a call for a variation of the contract, the sector lamented that it took many years until 2021 when it got an approval for variation from the earlier N4.1billion to N6.4billion.\n\nThe private sector team led by Okolue A. Ify, director, North Central Zone of the Shippers Council, and Edwin Ignatius, director-general, Nigeria Shippers Council, Kogi State chapter, led the passionate appeal to the federal government to ensure the completion of the Jamata Inland River Port located in Lokoja, pointing out that the economic benefits which are enormous for the country remains unquantifiable.\n\nThe various representatives of the private sectors pointed out that following the benefits that would accrue the country when completed, and called the government to seek a private sector partnership arrangement that would see to the completion of the port.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the NIWA team, Ororo, general manager, Marine Services of NIWA and Fidelis, GM, Ports and Environmental Services, disclosed that the Jamata Inland River Port is at 59 percent completion, expressing optimism the main quay structure would be ready by the end of the year.",

Yet, the army would say that they are taking care of soldiers and the families of soldiers that lost their lives.

          "title": "Crisis Brews In Delta State Community After Over 300 Fulani Herdsmen Settle In, Monarch Issues 15-day Ultimatum For Relocation",
          "text": "Residents of Okpanam community in the Oshimili North Local Government Area of Delta State have been engulfed in fear as no fewer than 300 Fulani herdsmen reportedly took over a section of the community and are settling in.\n\nThe traditional ruler (Ugoani) of Okpanam Kingdom, Michael Ogbolu, raised the alarm that the herders are occupying the area without his authorisation, adding that the community has given the herders a 15-day ultimatum to leave the area.\n\n\n\nAccording to Vanguard, the traditional ruler raised the alarm last week during a tripartite meeting held at his palace in Okpanam, involving the indigenes, chairman of Oshimili North LGA, Mr. Innocent Esewezie and Fulani leaders.\n\nRecall that as a result of the incursion of Fulani people into the woodland of Akwukwu-Igbo, Okpanam and other communities under Oshimili North, the council under the leadership of Louis Ndukwe, in 2020 passed an executive order mandating all Fulani herders and strangers residing in the outskirt and undergrowth areas of the communities to relocate to the towns where natives live or vacate the communities.\n\nBut the traditional ruler said on Monday that \u201cFulani people just went to occupy one part of Obodogba land belonging to the Okpanam community. In our previous engagement, Obi Eluunor told us that anything concerning the Fulani people, we should route it through his office.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Monarch, \u201cI wrote to Obi Eluuno, I gave him seven days to remove the Fulani people from our bushes.\n\n\u201cThen the Commissioner of Police wrote, fixing a meeting for last week, at the same time, the local government chairman, Mr. Esewezie, came around, asking that we sit down to address the issues. He galvanised the whole of them and we met here in my palace and I told them that the matter is very simple, only that the government in Delta State does not respect the laws made by it.\u201d\n\nHe noted that \u201cDuring the tenure of the former council chairman, Louis Ndukwe, the council came up with an executive order requiring all Fulani people, herders and strangers in our bushes to vacate and come and live with us in the town, but nothing was done.\u201d\n\nThe traditional ruler maintained that \u201cOur position is that the chairman of Oshimili North, Esewezie, should give effect to the executive order; we cannot accommodate these people in our bushes. We are predominantly farmers, they bulldoze their way into the bushes, they eat up our farm crops and also rape our women.\n\n\u201cThe long and short of it is that we gave them 15 days with which to relocate and that by July 14, 2022, the council chairman will go there (occupied area) himself to witness the evacuation.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a community leader identified as Ndukwe, said, \u201cThe council chairman held a meeting with Fulani herdsmen even on Sunday, you know that the former council chairman came up with an executive order in 2020. It has to be implemented. Few days ago, he also met with Fulani people. He is dealing with the security challenges community by community.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that these people (Fulani) went to Okpanam, forcefully took a parcel of land and as we speak, they are turning themselves into a community of over 300 persons without authorisation from the community.\n\n\u201cThey just come into any community, bulldoze their way and are doing all sorts of nonsense. Luckily for us, the leadership of the Fulani is cooperating with the council, the police are also cooperating.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the herders who said they do not accept the directive to vacate the area they are occupying embarked on a protest along Benin-Asaba Expressway.\n\nDuring the protest, their spokesperson, Idris Abubakar, claimed that they were legal occupants of Oshimili because they pay rents for where they are living.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should come to our aid so they can allow us to stay as legal occupants. The government should come to our aid and halt the council chairman from passing this so-called executive order.\n\n\u201cWhoever is living in any place is a legal occupant of that place. We have receipts that they gave to us. We pay tenancy each year,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nHowever, the Delta State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Charles Aniagwu, has said that the state government was not aware of invasion of part of Okpanam land by herdsmen.\n\nBut the Commissioner admitted that there were some northerners occupying the area whom he claimed are doing menial jobs to earn a living.",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Nigerian startups can build healthier cultures",
          "text": "Earlier in May, TechCabal asked 5 employees at different startups what was important to them when considering a job offer. All, understandably, listed monetary compensation as high on their list. But they ranked something else even higher: company culture.\n\n\u201cEveryone likes money, including me. Salary is a major motivation, but I value other benefits as well. If I had to choose between a well-paying company with a bad culture that\u2019s also providing added benefits, and a healthy workplace culture with lower pay, I\u2019d definitely go for the company with the lower pay because that\u2019s what\u2019s important to my professional growth. And that\u2019s what I value,\u201d said Ibrahim Adeniyi, a full-stack engineer at Quick Lookup.\n\nThe number of employees TechCabal interviewed, while small, is reflective of a larger pool of employees who are quickly realising how important healthy workplace cultures are to them. In its 2022 Global Talent Trends report, LinkedIn shows that at least 40% of job seekers across the world consider company culture an important factor when job hunting.\n\nIn fact, healthy workplace cultures are so important that they can boost retention by at least 40%. This is especially important at a time when retention is at an all-time high. Studies now show that 65% of younger people are less likely to stay in a role for more than a year. Job hopping\u2014the act of moving from company to company within short periods\u2014is now rampant, and while there are other factors egging these rates up, workplace culture tops the list.\n\nHigh turnover rates are not strange at startups, but they can be obstructive to the growth and success of a startup, especially when you consider how much money startups lose in hiring and rehiring. Turnover costs startups up to 20% of an employee\u2019s annual salary, and for managerial roles, the costs will go up.\n\nSo, how can startups on the continent keep this number down? How can they use healthy cultures to boost employee retention and engagement?\n\nCulture is everything\n\nFor Olufunmilola Bucknor, an HR professional and talent advisor with 18 years of experience recruiting for top brands, the first step is understanding what culture is in the first place.\n\nOlufunmilola Bucknor\n\n\u201cCulture is the way we think, the way we talk, the way we give feedback. It\u2019s even the way we eat! Distinct and ingrained culture will make your employees stand out. People will be able to take a look at your employees, at the words they use, and instantly tell where they work,\u201d Bucknor says to TechCabal over a phone call.\n\n\u201cWhen you understand how and what culture is, you can then take steps to embed healthy ones in your startup. People spend more of their waking hours at work than anywhere else. If you want to get the best out of them, you have to make sure the environment is conducive. So essentially, culture is not just for the employees, but for the organisation too.\u201d\n\nLearning on the job\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace, who is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), believes that having clear mission and vision statements also helps in building healthy cultures.\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace\n\n\u201cIf the vision and mission of a startup aren\u2019t clear to the people, they start to act in ways that suit them. For a team to be productive, everyone needs to flow in the same direction, and if everyone\u2019s understanding of the mission is different, then the team will move at different paces,\u201d Samson-Grace says to TechCabal over a call.\n\n\u201cHave a clear mission and make sure you communicate it frequently to your team. Once people understand your mission, why your company exists, and the problems you\u2019re trying to solve, it\u2019ll help define behaviours that will support that mission.\u201d\n\nBucknor takes it a step further and emphasises the need for employees to understand where they fit in within the organisation. \u201cThere are companies where employees don\u2019t even know what their own goals are. They know they have jobs, but they don\u2019t know what their goals are. That leaves them feeling out of place, and that can be troublesome.\u201d\n\nTo solve this, Bucknor says that startups should help their employees understand what roles they play in the business. \u201cSet KPIs, give each and every employee goals and provide them with feedback and training that will help them achieve these goals.\u201d\n\nThe HR expert also explains that where most startups get it wrong is in how they set goals and give feedback. \u201cFeedback should be aimed at helping employees improve, and it shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s only given at performance appraisals. One of the reasons employees don\u2019t like appraisals is because managers wait too long to give feedback, and when they do, it\u2019s not constructive.\u201d\n\nAppraisals should not be punitive, Bucknor explains. They should be used for learning, and learning is what\u2019s most important for jobs.\n\nBucknor uses the 70\u201320\u201310 model to explain why it\u2019s important that startups learn how to give constructive feedback. \u201cWe learn on the job. There\u2019s only so much training and courses can teach you. Seventy per cent of learning is gained on the job, 20% from interactions with the team, and only 10% from training and courses. So if you don\u2019t give constructive feedback, and allow people learn on the job, you\u2019re doing them and your startup harm in the long run.\u201d\n\nCulture also includes benefits\n\nStartups can also improve company culture by offering appropriate benefits.\n\n\u201cThe needs of employees differ from startup to startup, and sometimes, from team to team,\u201d says Samson-Grace. \u201cThink of it the same way you think of how children have different needs. The way you address those needs impact your relationship with the children.\u201d\n\nThe right incentives, according to Samson-Grace, can boost a startup\u2019s culture. \u201cYou need to consider the economy, and ask your employees what difficulties they face at home and even at work. If you can reduce their burden, you free up more time for your employees to focus on work.\u201d\n\nOne Nigerian crypto startup, Helicarrier, does this by providing daily lunches and paying employees in a dollar-pegged stablecoin. \u201cFor our Nigerian-based staff, this helps keep them above water with the increasing inflation rate. It also helps the team understand our vision and value. We\u2019re a crypto company, paying our employees in crypto,\u201d Ire Aderinokun, chief operations officer at Helicarrier, says in a Live session with TechCabal.\n\nAnother startup, GetEquity, also recently gained recognition on social media after one of its employees shared photos of the period care packages the startup sent to its female employees.\n\nMy sweet office sends period care packages to all the women every month. Most thoughtful \u2764\ufe0f. @getequity pic.twitter.com/Nk4lu4jGVd \u2014 Honorable. (@Sisi_tomi) April 16, 2022\n\nWhile GetEquity\u2019s benefits sparked controversy on the cost and usefulness of company benefits, the employees and HR team believe that it works for their team.\n\nTomisin Akingboye, the head of operations at GetEquity, explains, \u201cBenefits should be curated to fit the startups. Some startups can\u2019t afford to do much while others can splurge. For us, the period care packages help our employees feel better. It\u2019s no different than maternity and paternity leaves or sick days. It works, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nUchenna Angel Kalu-Uduma, a product manager at GetEquity, explains to TechCabal that the company settled on this benefit upon interviewing several members of the GetEquity team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot the team does that is exemplary of a great culture. Other than the period care packages, there are also tailored healthcare plans that cater to employees with chronic illnesses. All of this makes us feel valued as employees.\u201d\n\nHow to get it right\n\nFor some startups, the seed of unhealthy and toxic cultures is already ingrained. Current and past employees at Bento Africa, for example, recently revealed how the company\u2014via its founder\u2014had been perpetuating years of toxic culture through verbal abuse. Employees at another startup, Flutterwave, also recently exposed a culture of abuse and harassment.\n\nFor these startups, there\u2019s always an opportunity to change.\n\n\u201cAnd it all starts from the top down,\u201d says Bucknor.\n\nBucknor explains that a recurring trope with startups is how most founders and line managers are \u201caccidental people managers\u201d. She says that being good at one\u2019s job doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people are ready to help others be better at theirs. \u201cA lot of founders and managers have business acumen, but they lack people management skills. One mistake we often make is promoting high performers to managerial roles without any formal people management training. So if you want to change, make sure the change is top-down.\u201d\n\nAkingboye believes that it all stems from founders deprioritising the roles of human resources in startups. \u201cWhen building a startup, founders hire for everything first, and then keep HR for last. And when they do finally get HR professionals on the team, founders expect HR to follow in their footsteps. That can\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTo stem this issue, Akingboye says founders should prioritise HR the same way they prioritise growth or compliance.\n\n\u201cA good human resources team will help you hire great people that can help you achieve your goals. So if you want to build a healthy startup, have HR personnel put structures in place that will help you achieve what you want.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Temitayo Samson-Grace is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), the parent company of TechCabal.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "10 lessons Emeka Ajene learned while building Gozem",
          "text": "This insightful op-ed was contributed to TechCabal by Emeka Ajene. Emeka Ajene co-founded Gozem alongside Raphael Dana in 2018.\n\nAmong the Igbo people of Southeastern Nigeria, there\u2019s a proverb that says: \u201cWhat was secret is revealed in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nThanks to a variety of experiences across African markets over the last decade, I\u2019ve become privy to a number of earned insights regarding innovation-led businesses across the continent.\n\nBuilding a super app for Francophone Africa\n\nIn 2018, I moved to Lom\u00e9, Togo to bring my various experiences to bear in service of a singular opportunity: building a super app for Africa, starting in Francophone Africa.\n\nAfter four years of advancing this vision alongside an exceptional team, I am pleased to share that I have transitioned from day-to-day management & operational role to a strategic advisor role at Gozem.\n\nFrom the earliest days of traversing the streets of Lom\u00e9 in search of informal sector motorcycle taxi drivers amenable to a quick sales pitch, to our series A fundraise and our recently announced partnership with the International Finance Corporation, to bringing to market what\u2019s now truly Africa\u2019s super app \u2013 one which operates a variety of verticals across Togo, Benin, Gabon, and Cameroon, generates multi-million USD GMV, employs hundreds of team members across West & Central Africa, and positively affects the lives of many thousands of drivers, vendors, & other partners on a daily basis \u2014 the journey has certainly been personally and professionally fulfilling.\n\nSo rather than recount past successes or detail the varied contributions of Raph, Greg, Jean-Martial, Gr\u00e2ce, C\u00e9cilia, Lionel, Manfreed, Pierrick, and many others over the years, here are some useful lessons, peppered with Igbo proverbs, I learned along the way.\n\n\u201cProverbs are the oil with which words are eaten.\u201d \u2013 Chinua Achebe, Things Fall Apart (1994)\n\nGozem Team. Image source: Emeka Ajene\n\n1. Culture is a function of leadership\n\n\u201cWhen the mother goat chews her cud, her child watches her mouth.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nOrganizational culture is a funny thing. Everyone generally agrees upon its importance, at least in theory \u2014 \u2018culture eats strategy for breakfast\u2019 and so on \u2014 but in practice, at the earliest stages of company building, there are many other pressing (and more tangible) issues that steal attention.\n\nAcross African markets where the innovation economy is still nascent and some positive aspects of Silicon Valley-style management aren\u2019t widely-adopted (yet?); it is easy for startups to fall into locally familiar paternalistic, hierarchy-driven cultures where most \u2013 or all \u2013 decision-making comes from authority.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s not uncommon to find that managers are put (or put themselves) on an unwarranted pedestal. (See, for example, the recent conversation around hostile work cultures across the Nigerian tech ecosystem spurred by Damilare\u2019s expos\u00e9 in TechCabal.)\n\nBut often, the highest and best use of authority by company leaders isn\u2019t to simply show power, but to create and empower internal leaders.\n\n2. Talent development is a differentiator\n\n\u201cKnowing but not telling is what kills old men. Hearing but not heeding is what kills young men.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nAttracting talent is a challenge for all organizations, and doubly so for early-stage companies. Newer organizations often lack the prestige, ability to pay, and perception of job security (/\u2018deriskification\u2019) that more established businesses enjoy. And for startups operating in African markets, the talent challenge is compounded by the relative lack of depth within local talent pools.\n\nStartups across the African continent must intentionally and aggressively build their talent development muscle. There needs to be a real answer to this question: \u201cHow do we rapidly upskill junior staff and systematically prepare them to grow in the company and take on new challenges?\u201d\n\nOne specific and unorthodox initiative that we undertook at Gozem was to identify promising drivers on the platform and offer them salaried roles within our operational teams. While in some sense this may be cannibalistic as it often takes the best drivers off the roads, these driver ambassadors have a unique understanding of the Gozem platform and are often able to speak and lead certain driver-facing functions in more credible ways.\n\n3. It\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s how you say it, and it\u2019s what gets understood\n\n\u201cThe voice that\u2019s used in quarreling is not the same voice that\u2019s used in making peace.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nOftentimes, when I disclose that I moved to Togo to launch Gozem despite not speaking any French, people are shocked. But it\u2019s true, and the experience taught me valuable lessons about communicating effectively.\n\nThere is great difficulty involved in leading a team of people who speak a different language\u2013 a humbling experience to say the least. For me, among other things, it served as a forcing function for trust & deferential leadership \u2013 letting junior team members make contributions in important discussions with external counterparties.\n\nIn Gozem\u2019s early days, after a few miscommunication-linked mishaps, I began sending a daily morning narrative email in French (translated via DeepL) that highlighted priorities of the day and key recent wins & opportunities for improvement.\n\nWhile oral communication certainly has its place, well-thought-out written business communication can improve comprehension, eliminate misunderstandings, and provide organization-wide clarity \u2013 it\u2019s one reason to take Amazon\u2019s business writing culture seriously.\n\nParaphrasing Jeff Bezos, \u201c[written communication] forces better thought and better understanding of what\u2019s more important than what, and how things are related.\u201c\n\n4. When you have leverage, use it\n\n\u201cIf a snake fails to show its venom, children will use it to tie firewood.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nLeverage is a dynamic thing. You have it at one moment under certain conditions, but the next moment, conditions change and you lose it.\n\nIn negotiations, potential \u2018adversaries\u2019 \u2014 employers/employees, founders/investors, business partners, etc \u2014 are often driven primarily by self-interest, so the ability to recognize where the leverage lies at a given point in time can be very valuable.\n\nTo win, one must develop a long-term and non-zero-sum viewpoint. Nonetheless, it\u2019s advisable to exploit identified leverage. While there\u2019ll likely be future consequences if a hand is overplayed, more often than not, unused leverage becomes a source of regret.\n\n5. Systems lead to success\n\n\u201cWhen a group of people expects things to be done by others, nothing is done.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nBest-selling author James Clear wrote, \u201cWe don\u2019t rise to the level of our goals; we fall to the level of our systems.\u201d By this, he means that achieving successful outcomes requires consistent faithfulness to enabling processes. And while his book primarily focuses on individuals, I find the same is true for organizations.\n\nIt\u2019s why many of the world\u2019s leading innovation-led organizations use operating/management systems \u2014 the most popular tend to be EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System), Scaling Up, and OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)\n\nAt Gozem (thanks largely to the influence of Kevin Colas), we began implementing the Scaling Up method two and a half years or so into our journey. Since then, we\u2019ve seen significant gains in terms of accountability, clarity of expectations, and cross-functional visibility.\n\n6. Become a big fish by dominating smaller ponds\n\n\u201cDrop by drop is how the palm wine fills the container.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\n\u201cWould you rather be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond?\u201d\n\nFor businesses with venture-scale ambitions, markets matter. So the only answer is to play in a big pond \u2014 one with a clear path to becoming a big fish.\n\nAt Gozem, while we\u2019ve always maintained a big fish-big pond vision since day one, our initial geographic market was Togo, a country with a population of just 8 million, and our initial focus was on the ride-hailing vertical. It\u2019s no surprise that many viewed us quizzically, with many questions about the strategy of playing small initially.\n\nA relevant French expression that I learned during my time in Togo is \u2018Petit \u00e0 petit, l\u2019oiseau fait son nid\u2018 \u2014 little by little the bird builds its nest.\n\n7. Embrace constraints & learn quickly\n\n\u201cHot soup should be sipped carefully.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nAccording to Howard Stevenson, an entrepreneurship professor emeritus at Harvard Business School, \u201centrepreneurship is the pursuit of opportunity beyond resources controlled.\u201d And, as alluded to in point 6 above, at the early stages of new ventures, it seems there are never enough resources: not enough time, not enough talent, not enough capital, and so on.\n\nConstraints often inspire better thinking, compel creativity, and force focus and (ruthless) prioritization. In many cases, this leads to quick iteration and rapid learning of what works and what doesn\u2019t, and what truly moves the needle. And when a winning formula is found, constraints push you to fully exploit the opportunity and develop a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanics.\n\nRead: Marissa Mayer\u2019s \u201cCreativity loves constraints,\u201d \u2014 a book she penned while at Google.\n\n\u201cit is often easier to direct your energy when you start with constrained challenges\u2026or constrained possibilities. \u2026 Limited investment makes it easier to move on to something else that has a better chance of success.\u201d \u2013 Marissa Mayer.\n\n8. Resilience should be a core organizational trait\n\n\u201cA palm nut that wants to become palm oil must pass through fire.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nAll businesses have to be resilient of course, but when comparing my experiences in the West to those across sub-Saharan Africa, I\u2019d say that resilience \u2014 the ability to recover quickly from sudden disturbances and adapt easily to misfortune \u2014 is much more necessary in African markets where extraneous shocks are much more common.\n\nDuring my time in Togo, Gozem experienced its share of unforeseen external bad luck, from office flooding to power outages to regular connectivity disruptions and more. Still, the exercise of planning is essential and robust processes to respond to the unplanned are recommended.\n\nWhile I love the Mike Tyson quote, \u201ceveryone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth,\u201d getting punched in the mouth is far from uncommon in a boxing match and one should certainly be prepared to respond.\n\n9. Character, reputation, and integrity are everything\n\n\u201cNot everyone who answers to the title Chief is a legitimate chief.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nOne of the most famous scenes in the critically acclaimed TV series The Wire involves ruthless crime lord Marlo Stanfield (played by Jaime Hector) exclaiming, \u201cMy name is my name!\u201d\n\nFor founders and managers of young ventures, your name is your name. Said simply, reputation matters.\n\nAs much as we\u2019d all like the freedom to be individuals, startup leaders (and business leaders in general) represent more than themselves; they represent employees, investors, and other significant stakeholders. How they\u2019re perceived among different groups \u2014 potential customers, partners, investors, etc. \u2014 can often have a real business impact, like it or not. Call it the penalty of leadership in today\u2019s connected age: \u201c[Leaders] must perpetually live in the white light of publicity.\u201d\n\nAnd in low-trust environments such as African markets, my view is that this is doubly important. Both on the individual and institutional levels, it\u2019s important to always act with integrity, deliver on promises, and avoid doubt-inducing controversies.\n\n10. As you build a business, the business builds you\n\n\u201cThe right hand washes the left hand, the left hand washes the right hand.\u201d \u2014 Igbo proverb\n\nBuilding a business is a process of discovery. You discover who your customers are and what they need and will pay for. You discover the products and services that best meet those needs. And you discover how to sustainably and profitably meet those needs.\n\nSo there\u2019s customer and market discovery, product discovery, and business model discovery, but one thing not talked about enough is self-discovery \u2014 throughout the entire process one learns and discovers things about her/himself.\n\nIn early-stage ventures, founders and early employees, at the least, tend to be unusually invested in a company\u2019s ups and downs, its peaks and valleys, its daily mishaps and milestones, and they learn things \u2014 about markets, management, and more \u2014 that ultimately shape their worldview. The intensity of the experience often brings with it earned insights that can last well beyond the lifetime of one\u2019s involvement with the business.\n\nHere, I\u2019m reminded of two quotes that I\u2019ll let speak for themselves.\n\nThe American Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote, \u201cThe mind, once stretched by a new idea, never returns to its original dimensions.\u201d\n\nAnd Greek philosopher Heraclitus is credited with the quote, \u201cNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it\u2019s not the same river and he\u2019s not the same man.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Ltd) started its weekly activities with a resolve to quickly end the incessant queues at various filling stations in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nBy this resolution, the company in collaboration with the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) stepped up the supply of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) to the FCT from 70 to 140 trucks to combat the lingering fuel queues.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen during an inspection tour of filling stations in Abuja, NNPC\u2019s Group Executive Director, Downstream, Mr Yemi Adetunji, explained that there were enough petrol in the nation\u2019s strategic reserve to last 32 days.\n\n\u201cWe have 1.9billion litres of PMS that can last for 32 day. NNPC is making every effort to ensure energy security for the country.\n\n\u201cWe have sorted out Lagos. We are working with all relevant stakeholders to bring the situation in Abuja under control; normalcy will be restored in the next few days.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, the CEO of the NMDPRA, Mr Farouk Ahmed, said that the improvement in the supply of products from an average of 70 to 140 trucks was made possible by the Presidential approval of a \u20a610 freight rate discount increase to petroleum products transporters as part of solutions to the fuel supply challenge.\n\nHe charged marketers to play by the rules as NMDPRA would not hesitate to sanction anyone found to be involved in underhand practices.\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything to bring the situation to normal. We also want to state that there is no increase in the pump price of PMS, and any such sharp practice will be sanctioned accordingly by the Authority,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tour of the filling stations was to monitor developments and ensure compliance.\n\nNMDPRA and NNPC officials inspecting filling stations in Abuja following incessant scarcity of PMS in the FCT\n\nNMDPRA and NNPC officials inspecting filling stations in Abuja following incessant scarcity of PMS in the FCT\n\nIn another development, Major stakeholders in the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry have suggested ways to mitigate the continuous rise in prices of diesel and cooking gas in Nigeria.\n\nAmong the stakeholders who spoke at a public hearing organised by the House of Representatives Joint Committees on Downstream and Gas Resources in Abuja were the Chief Executive Officer of the NMDPRA, Mr Farouk Ahmed and the Group Managing Director/CEO of NNPC Ltd, Malam Mele Kyari.\n\nLeaders of Depot and Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPMAN), Independent Petroleum Marketers Association Of Nigeria (IPMAN), Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) and Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) Gas Marketers Association, among others, were also in attendance.\n\nFielding questions from members of the committee, Ahmed said that the current geopolitical crisis in Ukraine and Russia had affected the global crude oil supply resulting in the increase of petroleum products prices across the globe.\n\nAhmed said that the rise in the prices of petroleum products was a global phenomenon and not a local problem peculiar to Nigeria.\n\nHe added that the landing cost of petroleum product was also a major factor affecting the price of petroleum products.\n\n\u201cWe need to see what can be done to alleviate the suffering of the people.\n\n\u201cIf our refineries come back on stream and make foreign exchange available at the official rate of N400 per dollar, things will definitely improve.\n\n\u201cWe also need to address the issue of vandalism,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the GMD/CEO of NNPC Ltd., Malam Mele Kyari, said the only way to tackle the rising price of diesel and cooking gas was to increase the production of crude oil.\n\nNNPC GMD Malam Mele Kyari\n\nNNPC GMD Malam Mele Kyari\n\nKyari said that acts of vandalism of oil facilities have been responsible for the decline in production which in turn was responsible for the unavailability of foreign exchange.\n\nHe disclosed that 27,000 barrels were lost in a recent attack on one of the company\u2019s facilities.\n\nAccording to him, besides the Russia-Ukraine war which is affecting the supply of products across the world, most major oil companies are also shutting down in keeping with global emphasis on the shift from fossil fuels over environmental concerns.\n\n\u201cNo one can guarantee stability of petroleum products supply; the world has never seen this kind of uncertainty. Today, countries are stockpiling products.\n\n\u201cShortly before COVID-19, the world was already facing shortfall of 3 million barrel of supply of oil but with the ongoing intervention, by the end of July we will restore production to a level that is reasonable.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman, House Committee on Downstream, Rep. Abdullahi Gaya, said that there was need to find solution to the high cost of diesel and cooking gas in order to alleviate the hardship on Nigerians.\n\nSome of the lawmakers said that although Kyari and Ahmed candidly presented the worrisome situation the industry was faced with, they, nevertheless unanimously expressed confidence in their ability to bring the situation under control.\n\nThe stakeholders present at the hearing include the Independent marketers, suggested a short, medium and long term solutions to combat the challenges.\n\nThey also pledged to work with the NNPC and the regulatory agency to redress the situation.\n\nNMDPRA NNPC Proffer solution to Rise AGO LPG Prices.mp4\n\nMeanwhile, the Management of NNPC Ltd. sensitised members of staff to the challenges and opportunities inherent in the transition from a corporation to a limited liability company.\n\nThis was in continuation of its stakeholders\u2019 engagement to achieve a smooth transition.\n\nThe NNPC GMD/CEO, Kyari, said at a town hall meeting which held at the NNPC Towers, that it was imperative for all staff to embrace the change with courage and look beyond the temporary discomfort to the huge opportunities that lie ahead of the new NNPC.\n\nHe commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the courage to have signed the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) into law, pointing out that the lack of effective regulatory framework and unbridled government interference were responsible for NNPC\u2019s losses in the past.\n\n\u201cNNPC is now free of burden.\n\n\u201cNigerians are looking up to us, they expect NNPC to lead the way in making profit and adding value for the benefit of the over 200 million stakeholders.\u201d\n\nKyari said that given the volume of the Company\u2019s assets that was signed and transferred officially on July 1, 2022, by the Ministers of Petroleum Resources and Finance respectively, the new NNPC would be the most capitalised company in Africa and would be poised to announce its first Initial Public Offer (IPO) in the next three years.\n\nHe also informed that the company\u2019s financial statement for the year 2021 would be better than that of year 2020 when NNPC reported a profit after tax of 287 billion naira.\n\nIn her remarks, the Chairman of the NNPC Ltd., Sen. Margery Chuba-Okadigbo, assured of the Board\u2019s continuous support towards the realisation of the goals of the new NNPC Ltd., while encouraging members of staff to imbibe the concepts of dynamism and creativity required for global competitiveness.\n\nShe said that deducing from her experience at the helm of the NNPC Board, she had conviction to endorse the GMD\u2019s policies on transparency and accountability, noting that the company as envisioned by the PIA can only achieve its objectives through firm commitment to excellence on the part of the entire workforce.\n\nNNPC Enlightens Staff on significance of Transition\n\nAlso in the week under review, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) concluded the marginal oil fields bid rounds kick-started in the year 2020 with the award of Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPLs) to 161 successful companies.\n\nThe commission also officially unveiled the Host Communities Development Regulations and model PPLs.\n\nSpeaking at the event in Abuja, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, said that the presentation of the Licences was part of the implementation of the PIA 2021.\n\nHe also noted that the category was being handled for the first time.\n\nThe minister who commended the management and staff of the NUPRC for ensuring the successful completion of the process, described the conclusion of the process as a giant milestone for the administration.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of the PIA 2021 is in top gear. Consequently, the new awardees should note that their assets will be fully governed by the provisions of the PIA 2021.\n\n\u201cAs you develop your assets with the special purpose vehicles (SPVs), ensure that good oilfield practice is employed, environmental considerations and community stakeholders\u2019 management are not neglected.\n\n\u201cIt is my strong belief that the awardees will take advantage of the current attractive oil prices to bring these fields into full production within a short period to increase production, grow reserves and reduce cost of production.\n\n\u201cThe onboarding of new oil and gas players in the petroleum sector is part of this government\u2019s policy to encourage more indigenous participation in our petroleum operations,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nChief Timipre Sylva\n\nChief Timipre Sylva\n\nHe added that the development would boost activities in the oil and gas sector, increase production output and create additional employment opportunities for Nigerians.\n\nOn his part, the Chief Executive Officer of NUPRC, Mr Gbenga Komolafe, said that the Marginal Field Bid Round was one of the major tasks inherited by the commission on its inauguration in 2021.\n\nHe listed some of the constraints that caused the delay in the conclusion of the exercise to include, the interruption brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, partial payment of Signature Bonuses by some awardees, and the unwillingness of some co-awardees to work together in forming SPVs for field development.\n\nRecounting the history of the marginal field\u2019s award initiative, Komolafe said that the process which began in 1999 was borne out of the need to entrench the indigenisation policy of the Federal Government in the upstream sector.\n\nHe also said that the aim was to boost local content, stressing that since its inception, a total of 30 fields had been awarded with 17 currently producing.\n\nHe disclosed that the 2020 Marginal Field Bid Round exercise raked in revenue of about 200 million naira and 7 million dollars into the Federal Government coffers.\n\nKomolafe added that the conclusion of the 2020 Marginal Fields Bid Round brought to an end the era of Marginal Field awards as stipulated by the PIA.\n\n\u201cSection 94 (9) of the Act states that no new marginal field shall be declared under this Act.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the minister shall now award PPL on undeveloped fields following an open, fair, transparent, competitive, and non-discriminatory bidding process in line with Sections 73 and 74 of the Act.\u201d\n\nMr Gbenga Komolafe\n\nMr Gbenga Komolafe\n\nHe urged the winner of the marginal fields to take advantage of the current market realities and quickly bring their fields to production, stressing that Nigeria was not benefiting much from the upswing in crude oil prices because of production disruptions occasioned by sabotage, theft, and other operational challenges.\n\nA total of 57 marginal fields were presented in the 2020 bid round out of which 41 were fully paid for and 37 fields were issued with the PPL, having satisfied all conditions for award.\n\nOut of the 665 firms that expressed interest in the exercise, 161 emerged as potential awardees.\n\nSome of the successful companies that received their licences include: Ardova Plc, Matrix Energy Ltd., Sun Trust Oil Company Limited, Deep Offshore Integrated Service Ltd., Island Energy Ltd., Sigmund Oil Field Ltd., and Shafa Exploration and Production Company Ltd., among others.\n\nMarginal Fields NUPRC Awards Licence to 161 Companies\n\nStill in the week, NNPC Ltd. said it was committed to fast-tracking efforts to identify new gas resources and develop existing ones amidst current global yearning for cleaner fuels.\n\nNNPC also said it was making efforts to identify new gas resources to boost revenues for investment in other sectors of the economy as part of its preparation for the global energy transition.\n\nThe NNPC GMD/CEO, Malam Mele Kyari, stated this in a keynote address at the First E&P\u2019s 10th Year Anniversary event which held in Lagos.\n\nThe GMD, who was represented virtually by NNPC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Mr Umar Ajiya, delivered the address with the theme, \u201cScarcity in Abundance: How Gas can Enable Energy Access in Nigeria and Africa\u201d.\n\nHe said that though Nigeria remains determined to achieve net-zero carbon emission by 2060, there was absolute need to harness the country\u2019s abundant hydrocarbon resources to actualise that objective.\n\nHe emphasised that with the enactment of the PIA, and the introduction of such initiatives as the Decade of Gas and the Gas Transportation Network Code, Nigeria sought to open up robust and quick business opportunities for both indigenous and foreign investors in the gas sector.\n\n\u201cI make bold to say that harnessing our abundant resources remains Nigeria\u2019s major pathway towards leveraging gas, the least carbon-emitting fossil fuel, as a transition fuel.\n\n\u201cTo this end, massive gas development efforts are ongoing, including the construction of a 614km gas pipeline which is aimed at enabling gas transportation to the North of the country and ultimately beyond Nigeria.\u201d\n\nKyari also congratulated the Board, Management and Staff of First E&P on the 10th anniversary of the company which he described as \u201chistoric milestone\u201d.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Prof. Uzodinma Nwala, president of the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), has decried the outcome of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential primary, noting that Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa, a renowned pharmacist who had participated in the primary, lost to what he described as the undemocratic delegates system.\n\nThe PDP presidential primary held on Many 28 and 29, produced Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, former vice president as candidate, while Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers State came second.\n\nSpeaking in a address on the occasion of the ADF reception for Mazi Ohuabunwa, chairman of the foundation\u2019s Business and Investment Committee on Friday, Prof. Nwala expressed total lack of confidence in the country\u2019s current democratic system, which he insisted was unworkable.\n\nAccording to Nwala, Mazi Ohuabunwa is one of the most qualified Nigerians, but was rigged out by the system.\n\nHe said, \u201cRight from the beginning of the current electoral process, even before and in fact until tomorrow, the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) never hides her lack of faith in the highly monetized and corrupt electoral system in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhat Sam has undergone is a brutal experience with the Nigerian electoral system which ADF has consistently referred to as the game only vampires can play.\n\n\u201cMazi Sam Ohuabunwa has been with us for several years and we know him as one of the most priceless candidates of any political party in the Nigerian political system. He and people like Mr Peter Obi, are a few of the gems in the Nigerian political history. They remind us of the late Mallam Aminu Kano, General Shehu Yaraudua, and several other nationalists who have been sounding echoes urging us to abandon the old unpatriotic order of greed self-centeredness if we must develop the needed spirit of harmonious togetherness and progress.\u201d\n\nProf. Nwala dismissed the country\u2019s political leadership as being undemocratic and selfish, noting that they are the biggest threat to national cohesion.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe greatest threat to national cohesion and peace in Nigeria today is the political leadership that is selfish and unpatriotic. In addition and in particular, the undemocratic mode of selection of political leaders in our party primaries is the greatest threat to national cohesion and unity.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the mode of selection of party candidates during elections is highly monetized. This is why leadership selection in Nigeria favors the highest bidder and often this is certainly the men who have stolen most from the National Treasury.\n\n\u201cNigeria must return to the democratic mode of selection of candidates for election through popular elections in which candidates are chosen by the entire people in popular and highly competitive electoral process. Hence, if any party is to present any one as its candidate for an election, that Party must subject each aspirant to the popular choice in which all party members vote for the candidates.\n\n\u201cThis is the system which all democratic countries adopt. And it is a method which ensures that the right candidates are selected.\n\n\u201cThe failure to abide by the zoning arrangement which in modern times patriotic leaders have designed as an equitable and just mode of representation and selection of leaders is indeed a threat to national stability,\n\n\u201cADF calls on all patriots who wish the Nigerian Federation well to jettison the highly monetized system of delegates\u2019 selection as well respect the principles of zoning and rotation of political offices to ensure that no part of the country is neglected in the choice of political leadership for the country.\n\n\u201cADF is of the view that Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa lost in the UNDOMOCRATIC DELEGATES MODE OF SELECTION IN THE NIGERIAN ELECTORAL SYSTEM, and that the MASSES OF NIGERIA HAD NO HAND IN WHAT HAPPENED AT THE NATIONAL STADIUM on May 28, 2022. In other words, ADF is convinced that in a popular democratic process for choosing candidates for the post of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa will undoubtedly score even higher than those that were selected by monetized process of delegates selection.\n\n\u201cIt is in the light of this that the ALAIGBO DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION (ADF) has decided to organize this reception for Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa, one of her leaders in the struggle to rebuild the Nigerian Federation as a home in which the various.\n\n\u201cADF urges Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa to keep his head high and not to abandon the suffering masses. They still need people like him in their struggle for a more democratic and equitable Republic.\u201d",

Reconciling with aggrieved people is a political art of brinkmanship.\u201d\n\nHe however, welcomed the setting up of a committee by the party\u2019s board of trustees to resolve the issues, while noting that the controversy surrounding Senator Iyorchia Ayu, the party\u2019s national chairman should also be addressed after the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cThe BoT is right in setting up the committee to resolve the issue. The issue of chairman should be addressed after the election because we can\u2019t remove the incumbent government with a divided house and a new chairman,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMany governors are with Wike and they must be brought in because we can\u2019t win without the governors. Wike is not alone and to ignore him is to endanger our success.\n\n\u201cOkowa was nominated by somebody and the person reserves the right and power to step down. The consultations expected in coming weeks will sort out these issues.\n\n\u201cWe should not allow personal grievances to the overshadow general party interest.

Central District Court in California has again postponed the sentencing of Ramon Abass, popularly known as Hushpuppi, for the multi-million-dollar fraud charges.\n\nHushpuppi who pleaded guilty to the charges was arrested in Dubai, the United Arab Emirate (UAE) in June 2020, subsequently flown to the U.S., and was remanded in custody pending sentencing.\n\nJudge Otis Wright has fixed September 21 as the new sentencing date.\n\n\u201cAt the request of counsel, the Sentencing is CONTINUED to 9/21/2022 at 1:30 PM before Judge Otis D. Wright II, as to Defendant Ramon Olorunwa Abbas,\u201d the court\u2019s announcement made June 24 read.\n\nThe sentencing hearing was initially moved by Judge Wright from February 14 to July 11 and has now been moved to September 21 at the counsel\u2019s request.\n\nMr. Abass, in July 2021 agreed to plead guilty to the multi-million-dollar fraud charges filed against him by the United States government.\n\nHe has been in custody since his arrest in Dubai and rendition to the U. S. in June 2020.\n\nAfter initially maintaining his innocence, Mr. Abass made a volte-face, entering into a plea bargain agreement with the U.S. government in July 2021, in the hope of getting a lighter punishment.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to Count Two which is \u201cConspiracy to Engage in Money Laundering,\u201d an offense that attracts a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment among other punishments including full restitution, his plea agreement with the U.S. government states in part.\n\nDespite pleading guilty, Mr. Abass will not be exempted from paying restitution.\n\n\u201cDefendant understands that the defendant will be required to pay full restitution to the victim(s) of the offense to which the defendant is pleading guilty.\n\n\u201cDefendant agrees that, in return for the USAO\u2019s compliance with its obligations under this agreement, the court may order restitution to persons other than the victim(s) of the offenses to which defendant is pleading guilty and in amounts greater than those alleged in the count to which defendant is pleading guilty,\u201d the plea agreement read.\n\nThe exact sentence to be imposed on Mr. Abass remains unknown. However, provided Mr. Abass \u201cdemonstrates an acceptance of responsibility for the offense up to and including the time of sentencing,\u201d the prosecution said it recommends \u201ca two-level reduction in the applicable Sentencing Guidelines offense level\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf necessary,\u201d the prosecution adds, it may \u201cmove for an additional one-level reduction if available under that section.\u201d\n\nNot being an American citizen, he will be deported after completing his jail term and paying up the amount to be restituted.\n\nThe maximum penalty for the offense which Mr. Abass hopes will be reduced at his sentencing includes: \u201c20 years\u2019 imprisonment; a 3-year period of supervised release; a fine of $500,000 or twice the gross gain or gross loss resulting from the offense, whichever is greatest; and a mandatory special assessment of $100.\u201d\n\nEarlier in June 2020, the 38-year-old known for flaunting his opulent lifestyle on social media was arrested in Dubai by special agents including the Emerati police officers and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) operatives.\n\nThe FBI stated in an affidavit obtained by PREMIUM TIMES that its investigations revealed that Mr. Abbas financed this extravagant lifestyle with proceeds of crime.",

I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nAmong other issues, petrol subsidy payments have dwindled revenue accrued to states, with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) making zero remittances to the federation account.\n\nIn the last five months, NNPC has expended N1.27 trillion on petrol subsidy, about 31 percent of the N4 trillion provision for the year.\n\nZainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget, and national planning, had said petrol subsidy was \u201churting the nation\u201d and limiting the federal government\u2019s ability to service debt.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank had also raised concerns about Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy.\n\nOn the pipeline vandalism, Mohammed said the new petroleum industry law that allocates money to oil-producing communities would stop attacks, blaming the European Union\u2019s climate change policies for stifling investment in the sector.\n\n\u201cWe believe that climate change is real and important for emission control, but there is a bit of double standard in the EU policy regarding climate change,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) had said the country lost $1 billion to oil theft in the first quarter of 2022.",

          "text": "The Coordinator, Stand Up Nigeria, Sunday Attah, on Saturday berates the action of some oil marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nAttah describe the development as most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits.\n\nThe Coordinator, in his One Day Rally Text on the Lingering Fuel Crisis in FCT and Some other States in Nigeria said, the rally became pertinent in view of the toll the fuel crisis is taking on the economy of Nigeria and the attendant socio-economic effect on citizens.\n\n\u201cQuite unfortunately, queues have resurfaced in many states including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, that many are finding it difficult to go about their normal schedule without incurring further costs.\n\nConsequently, Nigerians have expressed outrage at the build up of these queues and the resultant hardship.\n\nWhile the outrage is justifiable given Nigeria status as the 6th largest oil nation in the world and the hardship occasioned by the need to access Premium Motor Spirit, the angst is misplaced as the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC) which some are blaming for the current situation is totally blameless as it is equally worried and doing all it could to bring the situation to normal.\n\nThe NNPC under the able leadership of Mele Kyari has no hand in the resultant hardship being suffered by Nigerian in the bid to access the petroleum product as the corporation has been up and doing to ensure that Nigerians have enough fuel to power their vehicles and other devices for the well being of the citizenry\u201d the statement\u201d.\n\nThe group however, exonerated the NNPC from playing any role in the ongoing scarcity after carrying out investigation into the cause of the problem.\n\n\u201cOur investigation have revealed NNPC has not relented in its task of importing products so as to ease transportation and other challenges that have to do with the use of fuel.\n\nWe can authoritatively say that all the jetties are fully stocked as a result of these efforts and currently have no less than 1. 9 billion liters of fuel which ordinarily should serve Nigerians for 32 days non stop even if a single liter is not been imported within the intervening period.\n\nOur findings have also revealed that there is no problem with transportation of products as government has not only paid but has increased the incentives for transporters.\n\nThe problem, we have since established is not with the NNPC but with the marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nThis is most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits\u201d.\n\nFurther more, that in order to maximize the profit for transporters, the government has even increased the freight cost with N10 per liter which brings to about N24 per liter the amount it pays to transporters on every liter\n\nThis is a huge amount that when multiplied results in huge profits for the marketers and ordinarily should have encouraged them to work harder in line with government\u2019s bid to satisfy the citizenry.\n\nThis is more so as the government did that without transferring the responsibility to consumers so as not add to the hardship on Nigerians.\n\nWe therefore frown at the artificial scarcity being created by marketers all in the bid to maximize profit at the expense of millions of Nigerians who are being forced to pay double for fares in order to move from one place to the other and the man hours being wasted just to buy fuel.\n\nVital component of the economy like banks, courts, factories etc are forced to reduce their working hours due to lack of fuel.\n\nWe therefore call on the marketers to show more sense of patriotism by taking into cognisance the pains they put other Nigerians through just to make profit.\n\nWe commend the NNPC GMD for standing firm for Nigeria in this trying period and for shunning all forms of intimidation to take actions that are against the interest of the masses.\n\nLooking at other countries and the global price of PMS across the world today, we can confidently say that Mallam Mele Kyari is a miracle worker to see that Nigeria and Nigerians are still buying PMS for 165 per liter.\n\nIn the USA a gallon of PMS is sold for 5.4 dollars, in Europe it is sold for 4.9 Euro, while back home in Africa, Ghana is selling for 11.87 cedi which is about 587 naira.\n\nThe landing cost of PMS to our country today is 600 per liter and government has not added one naria to what the marketers were buying before so should the marketers think of selling above government price all in the name of transportation cost?\n\nThis is why we are calling on all oil marketers and other stakeholders in the industry to be patriotic and shun sharp practices and put the interest of Nigeria and Nigerians above their high profit-making Target\u201d, Sunday added.",

          "title": "Economy Diversification: Why Nigeria\u2019s mining sector offers robust economic potential- Adegbite",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

          "text": "The Minister of Communication and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has said that the Federal Government cannot, at the moment, remove subsidies on the Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly called petrol.\n\nMohammed, who spoke during an exclusive interview to Reuters in London, said many other nations were introducing measures to help citizens cope with high oil energy prices, hence Africa\u2019s most populous country could not be an exception.\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest oil exporter but still has to import almost all its fuel needs due to a lack of refining capacity. The Federal Government shelved plans to abolish fuel subsidies earlier this year, a move that raised concerns with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n\u201cWhen you consider the chaos, the social disharmony and \u2026 instability such an action (abolishing subsidies) would facilitate, is it worth it? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d the Minister said.\n\nREAD ALSO: ASUU Issue Not As Simple As It Seems \u2013 Lai Mohammed\n\nThe Minister believes that a new industry law that allocates money to oil-producing communities would stop attacks and blamed the European Union\u2019s climate change policies for stifling investment in the sector.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe believe that climate change is real and important for emission control, but there is a bit of double standard in the EU policy regarding climate change,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to attacks on oil infrastructure, several parts of the north are plagued by violence orchestrated by bandits while dozens were killed in church attacks in Kaduna and Ondo States last month.\n\n\u201cWe are leaving the country much more secure than we met it,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nHe equally noted that President Muhammadu Buhari administration has made progress made against Boko Haram since 2015.\n\nNigeria suffers intermittent fuel shortages and has raised its deficit forecast twice this year and increased borrowing to cover the cost of the subsidy.\n\nThe country\u2019s petroleum production has also fallen short of government targets, with $1 billion in revenue lost to crude oil theft in the first quarter of this year, according to the sector regulator.\n\nSimilarly, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) expressed worry over the rising incidents of vandalism and theft along the key pipeline conveying refined petroleum products to Mosimi, Ibadan, Ore, and Ilorin fuel depots.\n\nNMDPRA Chief Executive, Farouk Ahmed, said this when the top executives of the South-west Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) visited him in Abuja.\n\nWhile the nation suffers intermittent fuel shortages and has raised its deficit forecast twice this year and increased borrowing to cover the cost of the subsidy, its petroleum production has also fallen short of government targets, with $1 billion in revenue lost to crude oil theft in the first quarter of this year, according to the sector regulator.",

          "text": "Governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukuma Soludo has explained why he visited the detained leader of the proscribed People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody.\n\nSpeaking with Sam Omatseye on TVC Breakfast show on Monday, the former governor of Central Bank said the move was informed by his resolve to dialogue with anyone and everyone who can help his administration to restore peace and order in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I came in, I did make it a point that I am ready to dialogue with anybody and everybody who will bring security and order to the state. And in that, we met with transporters, traditional rulers and prepared to give amnesty to those in the bush.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that, Nnamdi Kanu is the leader of IPOB, and it has Eastern Security Network. It is important to have full coverage in such that we need to bring everybody on board. I paid him a visit and I am very impressed by what he said in the presence of Senior DSS officials that he is detested by the spilling of innocent blood by some criminals unfortunately operating under the names of IPOB or ESN. But it\u2019s evident to me that quite a number of criminal gangs have emerged because it\u2019s a lucrative criminality \u2013 kidnapping, stealing etc. It has become lucrative business for them. Every criminal gang now claims to be a liberation movement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne good thing is that I am happy hearing him denounce criminality, hearing him expressing regret about how things have become, he even told me he is not the one who authorised sit at home. And I didn\u2019t quite understand that initially and severally, his own officials of IPOB have been issuing statements condemning the sit at home and different gangs issuing counter statements. He has his followers but all we want is peace, law and order so that we have the desired development in the homeland.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResponding to question about Kanu\u2019s sincerity, governor Soludo said he cannot read Kanu\u2019s mind or judge him by what he has said in the past. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t have the gift to know what\u2019s going on in his mind. Whatever anybody said yesterday, may not matter, anyone could learn from history. The substance for me is hearing him regretting how the homeland has become and consequently asking his supporters to embrace peace and that\u2019s what my take away, not whatever he had said in the past. Now I have a job to do, and my primary role is to provide security for my people.\u201d\n\nMr Soludo who decried the state of criminality in the state, said his administration is determined to return peace and security to the homeland. \u201cWe are determined to return peace to the homeland.\u2019 We are pursuing security, peace and order in all fronts using the carrot and stick approach and the Anambra people are united about this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI must commend the Federal government and the security agencies. Nigeria is facing a lot of security challenges but I must commend them for the assistance. I must say so far so far, we are in sink. By the time I came, there was total silence, nobody was read to give information but that has changed now. There are seven numbers around me and people are cooperating.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the former CBN governor said his first one hundred days in office is both challenging and interesting. He however said he is not actually a fan of the 100 days in office school of thought, adding that there\u2019s nothing unusual about the days because he was fully aware of the enormous tasked ahead when he applied for the job.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWell, I am not a believer in the 100days of a thing but since you guys in the media kept asking, I think I have to create time to address some of what we have been able achieved. The 100days as I said in my address is pumping, it is challenging as expected. But I must said I applied for the job and the good people of Anambra employed me and when I applied I knew the challenges ahead. So no big surprises I must say.\n\nSpeaking on what informed his low key inauguration, the governor said governance is not about the glamour and noise people think it is about, but service to the people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201d The inaugural reminded us what governance is about. It\u2019s not about glamour, it\u2019s about service.\n\nWe just need to constantly remind ourselves of what governance is all about. On my first day in office, I spent about 8hrs plus. The first three and half hours was an extensive meeting with the security chiefs trying to review the humongous security challenges we have. I didn\u2019t come for the job to answer \u201cyour excellency\u201d I am hired to provide security, create enabling environment for business to thrive, create economic wealth. That\u2019s why they hired me. So I get to work every morning to address governance which is service to the people. We are the employees, the people are the employers.\u201d\n\nGovernor Soludo said the recommendations by his transition committee led by Dr Obby Ezekwesili are already being incorporated into his administration policies. \u201cThe Ezekwesili\u2019s committee came together and worked very hard. I must commend them for the great job they did. Basically, we have three operating documents \u2013 first, the Soludo solution, Anambra vision 2070 which I chaired and the transition committee report. Indeed these documents constitute our agenda for the state. We are determined to deliver on them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement",

He has held office at the federal level and at the state level, and he has done well in every office. He has always stood for progressive policies. He is not afraid of difficult decisions. This is a man that is running a state government with appointees from all over Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis capacity is not in doubt. His personal ability is outstanding. He is firm. He is courageous. He is principled. We know that he resisted every pressure to be dragged into the presidential race. We appreciate him and his colleagues, the APC governors from the north, for sticking to the view that gentlemen should respect agreements.\n\n\u201cEl-Rufai is a leader whose talents and energy should be brought back to the federal level.

          "text": "A rooftop shooter killed at least six people and wounded 24 more at a July Fourth parade in an affluent Chicago suburb on Monday, authorities said.\n\nAlso, a man arrested on suspicion of killing three people and wounding several others during a shooting at a shopping mall in Copenhagen on Sunday had been remanded in a psychiatric facility for 24 days, Danish police said yesterday.\n\nFor the Illinois killings, a rifle had been found and police are searching for a gunman who opened fire at Highland Park police, Commander Chris O\u2019Neill told reporters.\n\nAccording to NBC News, the city of Highland Park confirmed that there\u2019s \u201can active shooter incident\u201d and urged all, \u201cindividuals are advised to shelter in place.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies are searching for the suspect; evidence of a firearm has been recovered,\u201d the city said. \u201cNumerous law enforcement officers are responding and have secured a perimeter around downtown Highland Park.\u201d\n\nThe shooting happened \u201cin the area of the Independence Day parade route,\u201d the Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a statement posted to Twitter.\n\nIllinois State Police also responded to the scene, \u201cassisting Highland Park PD with an active shoot situation,\u201d according to a statement the agency tweeted.\n\nPolice were spotted scouring rooftops around Central Avenue near Green Bay Road and Second Street in the aftermath of gunfire.\n\n\u201cIt does appear that he was shooting from a roof,\u201d Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Chief Christopher Covelli told reporters.\n\nFourth of July events in other Chicago suburbs, Evanston and Skokie, were also called off in the wake of the Highland Park shooting.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately as you may know, we have an active shooter situation in Highland Park at their parade,\u201d Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker told reporters at the Independence Day event in nearby Evanston.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still getting reports.\u201d\n\nUnited States Rep, Brad Schneider was at the Highland Park event when shots rang out.\n\n\u201cMy campaign team and I were gathering at the start of the parade when shooting started,\u201d the lawmaker said in a statement. \u201cMy team and I are safe and secure.\u201d\n\nWitness Larry Bloom said at first people thought the popping sound was part of the parade.\n\n\u201cYou heard like a \u2018pop, pop, pop,\u2019 and I think everybody kinda thought maybe it was a display on one of the floats and then it just opened up,\u201d he told NBC Chicago.\n\n\u201cI was screaming and people were screaming,\u201d Bloom added. \u201cThey were panicking and and they were just scattering and I, you know, we didn\u2019t know. You know, it was right on top of us.\u201d\n\nSuspect in Fatal Copenhagen Mall Shooting Remanded in Psychiatric Facility for 24 Days\n\nMeanwhile, a man arrested on suspicion of killing three people and wounding several others during a shooting at a shopping mall in Copenhagen is being remanded in a psychiatric facility for 24 days, Danish police said yesterday.\n\nThe 22-year-old Danish man was known to psychiatric professionals, CNN quoted to have police said earlier.\n\nThe suspect was charged with manslaughter, Copenhagen Police tweeted. The court who heard the case yesterday, put a ban on naming both the suspect and 10 victims named in the charge, the force added in a series of tweets.\n\nThe shooting unfolded on Sunday at multiple locations inside Field\u2019s, a shopping center in the Danish capital. Social media footage showed people running through the mall and heavily armed law enforcement officers on the scene.\n\nAt a press conference, Copenhagen\u2019s Head of Police Soren Thomassen said two 17-year-old Danish citizens, one male and one female, and a 47-year-old Russian national had been killed in the gunfire.\n\nTwo other Danes and two Swedish nationals had received gunshot wounds and were in hospital in critical but stable condition, while several others sustained minor injuries while leaving the mall, Thomassen said.\n\nThe man arrested in connection with the shooting is currently the only suspect. Thomassen said there was no indication the suspect was acting with others but an investigation was ongoing.\n\nEarlier, the police had said they detained the suspect 13 minutes after receiving the first emergency call, and that he was \u201ccarrying a rifle and ammunition\u201d at the time of his arrest.\n\nAt the news conference, Thomassen said there was no indication the attack was an \u201cact of terror\u201d nor motivated by gender, and police believe the victims were chosen at random. The suspect was \u201cknown to people in the psychiatric field,\u201d he said.\n\nGun violence is relatively rare in Denmark. Copenhagen\u2019s last major shooting incident was in 2015, when a gunman attacked a free speech forum featuring controversial cartoonist Lars Vilks, killing one man and wounding three others.\n\nAs investigators piece together the circumstances that lead to Sunday\u2019s deadly shooting, questions are being asked as to how the suspected gunman could have obtained the weapon and ammunition used in the attack, as Denmark is considered to have some of the most restrictive gun laws in Europe.\n\nWhereas in the United States gun ownership is conditionally guaranteed by the US Constitution, in Denmark, the right to private gun ownership is not guaranteed by law, according to GunPolicy.org, an organisation that tracks international firearm policy.\n\nThrough restrictive licensing, Danish authorities attempt to reduce firearm violence by substantially reducing the number of firearms in circulation. An applicant for a firearm license in Denmark must pass a background check which considers criminal and mental health, GunPolicy.org said.\n\nOnly licensed gun owners may lawfully acquire, possess or transfer a firearm or ammunition. Applicants for a gun owner\u2019s license in Denmark are required to establish a genuine reason to possess a firearm, for example hunting, target shooting, collection, according to GunPolicy.org.",

          "text": "Multinational oil and gas company, TotalEnergies, has said its effort to increase oil production in Nigeria would materialise this year, disclosing that it was on the verge of connecting the 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) Ikike oilfield to the 200,000bpd-capacity Egina deepwater storage facility.\n\nDeputy Managing Director, Deepwater District, TotalEnergies EP Nigeria Limited, Mr. Victor Bandele, disclosed this Monday in Abuja, at the Nigerian Oil and Gas (NOG) Local Content Seminar, with the theme, \u201cFunding the Nigerian Energy Mix for Sustainable Economic Growth.\u201d\n\nThis was just as the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) and the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) urged oil and gas companies operating in the country to ensure compliance with the Nigerian Content Insurance guidelines for the oil sector.\n\nIn his presentation at the seminar, Bandele said TotalEnergies would continue to make significant investments in Nigeria, assuring that the Ikike oilfield would soon start producing.\n\nHe said the import of that commitment was that the company was fully integrated in Nigeria, adding that TotalEnergies produces more than 20 per cent of total oil output in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are putting in another field into Egina this year. That field, the Ikike field, has the capacity to produce about 50,000 barrels per day. For that to have happened in 2022, it means the journey started some years back when it was rough.\n\n\u201cAnd that is the kind of delivery action that I talked about, that you will decide that because we believe in something, you must step into it regardless of the challenges.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we are present in the upstream, the midstream and the downstream. You cannot get away from us and we cannot get away from you.\n\n\u201cWhat it means is that we are fully integrated in Nigeria. As I speak, we produce more than 20 per cent of total oil in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are the second highest producer and supplier of gas to the Nigerian population and the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Limited.\u201d\n\nBandele said as the world continues the transition to cleaner sources of energy, it was imperative for the government to show the direction the country should go and intensify collaboration with industry stakeholders.\n\nWhile noting that diversification to cleaner energies offers a lot of benefits, he said with the federal government of having set a target of providing electricity access to 80 per cent of the population by 2030, such action should spur industry stakeholders to work with the direction of the government.\n\nHe maintained that renewables and natural gas were positioned to lead the Africa\u2019s energy consumption growth as the continent departs from the traditional use of biomass, which currently accounts for about half of the entire energy consumption.\n\nHowever, the duo of the Executive Secretary of NCDMB, Mr. Simbi Wabote and the Chief Executive Officer of NAICOM, Mr. Sunday Thomas, formally presented the Nigerian Content Insurance Guidelines for the oil sector.\n\nWabote explained that insurance of assets and liabilities in the oil and gas industry according to Sections 49 and 50 of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act (2010) stated the requirements for players in the Nigerian oil and gas activities on the need to engage local insurance companies for insuring their assets, liabilities and so on.\n\nHe said it was in a bid to carry out its key mandate of enforcing compliance with the provisions of the NOGICD Act that the board, in collaboration with NAICOM, developed and issued the Insurance Guideline for the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe added that the guideline would contribute significantly towards promoting the development of insurance services in-country and would also drive the retention of financial spending in Nigeria, thereby contributing towards reversing capital flight.\n\nFurthermore, he noted that the guideline would also help to create a database of all insurance programmes procured by operators, project promoters, alliance partners, and Nigerian indigenous companies, to enable the board to monitor utilisation of in-country insurance capacity.\n\nWabote said, \u201cAt NCDMB, we believe that any in-county value retention realised from the insurance sector will further enhance the delivery of our 70 per cent Nigerian Content target by the year 2027.\n\n\u201cThe Implementation Framework of the Guideline highlights the specific directorates of the Board and their responsibility regarding the implementation of the insurance guideline.\n\n\u201cThe Directorates saddled with the responsibility of interpreting and enforcing the guideline will be reaching out to you shortly to provide support and clarity to bring all parties into compliance.\u201d\n\nHe clarified that the goal of the insurance guideline was not to create additional impediments for oil companies but to create job opportunities and in-country value retention to address threats to the country\u2019s socio-economic stability.\n\nWabote, who made a presentation on, \u201cStrengthening Nigerian Content Implementation with the Seven Ministerial Regulations,\u201d pointed out that one of the key lessons of the events in the last one year was the need to develop and sustain local capacities and capabilities to tackle issues of energy security, food shortages, insufficient vaccines, and other socio-economic disruptions.\n\nHe said as the global outlook tends towards prioritisation of survival at sovereign level, it was imperative for every nation to put in place strategies for local content development for its economic sustenance.\n\n\u201cWe utilise this seminar to deepen our local content practice by providing clarity, expositions, tips, and guidance to industry practitioners on provisions of the law, regulations, guidelines, tools and initiatives such as the NC Plan, NCEC, Expatriate Quota, Research and Development, NC Intervention Funds, and others,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also urged operators in the exploration and production segment of the oil and gas industry to familiarise themselves with the seven Ministerial Regulations and ensure compliance with them as stipulated.\n\nHe listed the seven regulations, gazetted and which became effective on February 2021 as Regulation for Training in the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry 2021:l; Regulation for Further Growth of Indigenous Capacity 2021; and Registration of Oil and Gas Professionals with Nigerian Professional Bodies 2021.\n\nOthers are Regulation for the Establishment of Operations in Nigeria 2021; Regulation for Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Technology Transfer 2021; Regulation for Nigerian Oil and Gas Research and Development 2021; and Regulation for Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Enforcement and Compliance 2021.\n\nHe said the seven Ministerial Regulations were meant to strengthen the implementation of Nigerian Content and would be further discussed in the upcoming panel sessions outline for this seminar.",

          "title": "Using Capacity as Parameter for Presidency, Peter Obi Not Comparable to Kwankwaso, Says Galadima",
          "text": "A prominent member of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Buba Galadima, on Monday, said if the major prerequisite for Nigeria\u2019s presidency was capacity, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi, was not comparable to the NNPP candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso, by all standards.\n\nGaladima, who acknowledged the desire of the South-east to produce a Nigerian president, however, contended that Obi should exercise some more patience, because he still had a lot to learn from Kwankwaso in leadership.\n\nAs discussions around the 2023 general election continued, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Monday, berated the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Labour Party for introducing the placeholder idea into the country\u2019s electoral process. PDP urged Nigerians to get their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and be ready to vote out the ruling party.\n\nGaladima, a former ally of President Muhammadu Buhari, was a guest on The Morning Show, where he spoke on the electoral alliance between Obi and Kwankwaso.\n\nHe said, though Obi did well, as governor of Anambra State, primordial sentiments of where he comes from should be put aside for the unity of the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cChief Peter Obi was the governor of Anambra State, and he did his best to place Anambra on the map. But if you look at it, definitely, of all the issues that we raised, we had 20 parameters to judge the two gentlemen.\n\n\u201cHowever, when we started, the issue from Peter Obi\u2019s side was that there is a sentiment in the South-east that the president must come from that extraction, and we say, no, we belong to a party called New Nigeria. Those are primordial sentiments that have never assisted Nigeria to become one.\n\n\u201cWe are not yet one nation. And our objective is to eliminate all those primordial sentiments of tribe, where one comes from and religion. It is only us that have the capacity, if given the opportunity, to make that happen.\n\n\u201cWe want to build a new Nigeria. Do we still fall back on primordial sentiments of where our work comes from and Nigeria remains what it is? We need someone with the capacity to run this country and I can\u2019t see, using this parameter, that would place the candidate of the Labour Party above Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso. But he has a lot to gain, because he is only 60 years old. Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso is 65.\u201d\n\nGaladima also addressed the notion being peddled on the social media about the presidential candidate of PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, 77, and the APC candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, 70, being too old to rule. He said, \u201cSo, if you now make Peter Obi as the president at 60, by the time he finishes his eight years, Senator Kwankwaso would have been 74 or 75 years.\n\n\u201cSo, the young man on the social media, again, will say he\u2019s too old to run for president. But if you allow Senator Kwankwaso to become the president and Chief Peter Obi becomes his vice president, it means at the time, Senator Kwankwaso will be finishing his eight years, Chief Peter Obi would have been 67 or 68 and will be strong enough to run for the president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nGaladima described the development strides and economic performance of both Kwankwaso and Obi in Kano and Anambra states, respectively, as unprecedented, saying, if Obi were made to manage the economy as vice president and Kwankwaso managed the development of the country, it would bring Nigeria together as a unified entity.\n\n\u201cIt will be a seamless transition from Kwankwaso to Peter Obi,\u201d he stated, adding, \u201cI believe that Nigerians should not use sentiments and that patience is of essence in this matter. For example, Tinubu was patient enough to wait for his time and at this age he picked up the ticket of the ruling party.\n\n\u201cI think people from the south should manage this, because it is easier and simpler for somebody from the South-east extraction to become president easily and supported by a sitting national government, which we intend to do.\u201d\n\nPDP Berates APC, Labour Party over Placeholder Creation\n\nWhile addressing some students of Junior Secondary School, Alugun-Lungu Gwarimpa, Abuja, who visited the PDP national headquarters, the party\u2019s national publicity secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said the concept of placeholder was alien to the 1999 Constitution, as amended, and the Electoral Act.\n\nAPC and Labour Party had submitted names of their presidential candidates and their running mates before the June 17 deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). But while the APC presidential candidate, Tinubu, submitted Kabiru Masari as his running mate, Obi submitted the name of Doyin Okupe as vice presidential candidate. They were both billed to replace the two running mates latest July 15, when the window for substitution would close.\n\nThe PDP spokesperson, said, \u201cToday, APC has introduced a new political lexicon into the political dictionary of Nigerian. They called it placeholder. There is nothing like placeholder in our law books. It is an imposition by the APC and Labour Party. It is nothing but an imposition on the political dictionary. It is an indication that they are not ready for the presidential election. It shows the level of their not being serious.\n\n\u201cIt is part of the confusion that the APC is introducing into the political system. Just last month, the APC presidential candidate said he graduated from a university in United States, but did not fill or indicate where he obtained his primary and secondary school education.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that you cannot graduate for studies without evidence of where you obtained your early education. Something is wrong and that is why Nigeria is asking that they provide such information.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba called on Nigerians to rally round the PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and his vice presidential candidate, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, stating that they represent a symbol of unity that would unite Nigeria and tackle the ravaging insecurity in the country.\n\nAccording to Ologunagba, \u201cAPC represents a command dictatorship that has so far offered no relief to the sufferings of the people. Rather, what the APC has done is to triple the sufferings of our people.\n\n\u201cPDP as a party believes in negotiation and manages its differences, where there is one, but the APC has a command imposition structure, which is antithetical to democracy.\u201d\n\nThe national publicity secretary told the students that Nigerians must use the opportunity of the general election to vote out APC, saying, \u201cNigerians cannot afford another four years of misrule by the APC. APC must be kicked out because we have had enough.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba described APC as a party of strange bedfellows that had nothing tangible to offer.\n\nPDP Urges Nigerians to Get PVCs, Vote Out APC\n\nIn another development, PDP said it had concluded plans to hold a roadshow on the streets of Abuja to sensitise the citizens, especially the youth, to register and be ready to vote out APC in next year\u2019s general election.\n\nAddressing a press conference to herald the roadshow, acting National Chairman of the party, Aliyu Damagun, and the Youth Leader, Mohammad Suleiman Kadede, charged the youth to arm themselves with their voter cards to vote out APC next year.\n\nDamagun said, \u201cAs you can see in this country, most of our youths today are idle. What is the cause? Bad governance? How do we change that? Go get your PVC. Go out there and sensitise people; let them come out en masse. All these ASUU strikes that we see, unemployment, banditry and what have you, are all due to bad governance. How do you change bad governance? It is to use your votes and act now.\n\n\u201cYou have to go out there, get people informed, let them come out and get their PVCs so that we vote out this senseless government that has no direction. If you look at them, they don\u2019t even have the mind to initiate this kind of thing. What they are thinking about is that come 2023, they will come and buy you off and continue to labour you, leave you at home, close down your schools and allow you to enter banditry. It\u2019s up to you now to go out there and get your PVC.\u201d\n\nKedede, on his part, said, \u201cWe can no longer deny or pretend that we are now at the lowest point in our national life. The youth of our country have become weary of the future. It is on this note that we call on all Nigerians to go out and get their PVCs, because this is the only tool to unseat them \u2013 these monsters at the corridors of power.\n\n\u201cThe rate of insecurity is alarming and calls for urgent national attention. Ladies and gentleman, the Nigerian students have been out of school for over five months, with no solution in sight. The APC-led federal government has paid deaf ear to the plight of the Nigerian student, thereby, forcing them to roam about the street and become vulnerable to negative tendencies. It is, therefore, imperative for the Nigerian youth to go out and get their permanent voter cards in order to use their votes to unseat the wicked APC-led federal government.\n\n\u201cThe persistent insecurity that has plagued the nation now for a while with no solution in sight is another manifestation of the complete incompetence and abandonment of government by the All Progressives Congress-led federal government. We call on all well-meaning Nigerians to take up their destinies in their hands and activate the office of the citizen by going all out to get their permanent voter cards.\n\n\u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party is, no doubt, the last hope for the common Nigeria on the street. And so, we encourage you all to get your PVC ready for a brighter future. Your PVC is your power. Your PVC is your strength. Your PVC is your equipment to shape the future of your country.\u201d\n\nIn her speech, National Women Leader of PDP, Professor Stella Atoe, said, \u201cEvery eligible Nigerian electorate has the constitutional right to determine who governs the country in which they are citizens. They have the power to change a bad and non-performing government through the use of their votes at the polling units during elections, and install a good one. The power through which this can be done is the acquisition of the Permanent Voter Card (PVC).\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Funmi Ogundare",

          "title": "Nigeria Risks Chaos If Petrol Subsidy Is Removed: FG",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government, on Monday, maintained that removing petrol subsidy would result in unintended consequences, insisting that this is a most inauspicious time to withdraw the price buffer.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, told Reuters that many other nations were introducing measures to help citizens cope with high oil energy prices. Mohammed said Nigeria could not be an exception.\n\nDespite the daily killings and attacks across the country, the minister said, \u201cWe are leaving the country much more secure than we met it,\u201d noting progress made against Boko Haram since 2015.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) expressed worry over the rising incidents of vandalism and theft along the key pipeline conveying refined petroleum products to Mosimi, Ibadan, Ore, and Ilorin fuel depots. Chief Executive of NMDPRA, Farouk Ahmed, said this when the top executives of the South-west Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) visited him in Abuja.\n\nMohammed\u2019s position on petrol subsidy aligned with that of President Muhammadu Buhari, who recently chided the West for demanding the removal of what the government termed under-recovery while they continued to seek new ways to relieve their own citizens of the effect of the harsh global economy.\n\nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest oil exporter, but still has to import almost all its fuel needs due to lack of refining capacity. The country recently scrapped plans to abolish fuel subsidies earlier this year, a move that raised concerns with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n\u201cWhen you consider the chaos, the social disharmony and \u2026 instability such an action (abolishing subsidies) would facilitate, is it worth it? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mohammed said in a wide-ranging interview with the news medium.\n\nNigeria suffers intermittent fuel shortages and has raised its deficit forecast twice this year and increased borrowing to cover the cost of the subsidy.\n\nThe country\u2019s petroleum production has also fallen short of government targets, with $1 billion in revenue lost to crude oil theft in the first quarter of this year, according to the sector regulator.\n\nMohammed said a new industry law that allocates money to oil-producing communities would stop attacks and blamed the European Union\u2019s climate change policies for stifling investment in the sector.\n\n\u201cWe believe that climate change is real and important for emission control, but there is a bit of double standard in the EU policy regarding climate change,\u201d he said.\n\nAlongside attacks on the oil infrastructure, much of Nigeria\u2019s north is wracked by violence committed by so-called \u201cbandits,\u201d while dozens were killed in church attacks in the northern state of Kaduna and the South-west state of Ondo last month.\n\nNotwithstanding the killings and attacks across the country almost on a daily basis, Mohammed said the current federal administration was \u201cleaving the country much more secure than we met it\u201d at the inception of the government in 2015.\n\nHe reiterated the Buhari government\u2019s call on Western countries to declare the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which campaigns for secession of part of South-east Nigeria, a terrorist group.\n\nAsked if Nigerian security forces had killed any innocent people in the country\u2019s South-east during its campaign against IPOB, Mohammed said, \u201cNot deliberately.\u201d\n\nMohammed said he would demand the return of hundreds of priceless sculptures, known as the Benin Bronzes, when he meets with the director of the British Museum later on Monday, after Germany returned the first two of more than 1,100 of such sculptures last week.\n\n\u201cI will be telling them that time is running out to return our stolen artefacts,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister added that he did not expect a result immediately, stressing, \u201cit\u2019s about when, it\u2019s not if.\u201d\n\nMohammed\u2019s comments came as NMDPRA voiced concern that incidents of vandalism and theft were rising along the main pipeline delivering refined petroleum products to Mosimi, Ibadan, Ore, and Ilorin fuel depots.\n\nThe 2B pipeline network pumps petroleum products from the Atlas Cove depot in Lagos Island through the depots in Ejigbo in Lagos Mainland, to Mosimi in Ogun State, Ibadan in Oyo State, Ore in Ondo State, and Ilorin in Kwara State.\n\nThe NMDPRA chief executive said the series of theft and vandalism had led to huge revenue losses for the government.\n\nSpeaking when the top executives of the South-west IPMAN visited him in Abuja, Ahmed described the association as a critical stakeholder in the petroleum sector.\n\nHe added that the industry regulatory authority had received complaints about private petroleum products depots selling Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly called petrol, above the approved price of N165 per litre.\n\nAhmed said the illegal price increment had disrupted the smooth operation of the entire fuel distribution and supply value chain, leading to higher prices in some areas.\n\nHe urged the association to report any fuel depot selling products to its members above the approved ex-depot prices by the government.\n\nIn his remarks, the zonal chairman of IPMAN in the South-west, Dele Lamidi, said the executive committee visited NMDPRA to seek its collaboration and support, in line with the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), 2021.\n\nLamidi listed some of the challenges faced by IPMAN to include products sharing difficulties, rise in penalties, difficulties in getting tax clearance from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), as well as the high cost of doing business in the country.\n\nHe pledged the continuous support of the group to the federal government by ensuring that petrol was available at the regulated retail price of N165 per litre at retail outlets across the country.\n\nLamidi stated, \u201cAs far as we are concerned in the South-west, we have gone beyond embarking on strikes. Strike is not the solution to any problem, because if there is a strike, it affects the masses and our businesses.\n\n\u201cWe will work together with the authority to ensure free flow of petroleum products and also make sure that products are sold at the government-regulated retail price, if we get them at the normal price.\u201d",
