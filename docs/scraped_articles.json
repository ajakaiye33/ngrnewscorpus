Some of the staff turned the place to money-making ventures for themselves.\n\n\u201cWhile some of them created a means of collecting revenue to their personal account, others engaged in vandalism of key components of the board\u2019s generating sets and stealing pipes.\n\n\u201cInfact, many of the staff attitude to work was not something that will enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the board to service delivery.\n\n\u201cOr how do you explain the situation where a staff procured her own PoS and started collecting and channelling revenue of the board to her personal account,\u201d said Ekpo.\n\nEkpo, however, noted that in spite of the challenges he inherited, he had been able to raise the revenue to N9 million.\n\n\u201cI was able to achieve this from a near comatose state I met the water board.\n\n\u201cMore can be achieved if we get the cooperation of our customers and staff who have resorted to vandalism of facilities of the board and some of our customers who bypass our meters.\n\n\u201cWe also have challenges of huge electricity bill that amount to about N12 million monthly and the over N180 million electricity debt I inherited,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile noting that privatisation remained the best option for the Cross River Water Board, Ekpo assured that strategy had been made to ensure better service delivery to the people.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are surely going to come out stronger in the next few weeks. All, but one, of our nine stations, will start pumping water to the people.\u201d\n\nHe said his target was to raise the revenue of the board to the level where it would start paying the N29 million of the staff monthly wage bill.\n\n\u201cI understand more people have resorted to sinking boreholes in their homes, but our water still remains the best.

Kashim Shettima, the former Borno state Governor and Senator representing Borno Central at the National Assembly as running mate by Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress, APC Presidential flagbearer in the forthcoming 2023 general elections.\n\nBishop Naga is the founder/Head of the Pentecostal Belivers Covenant Church (PBCC) in Borno state.\n\nOur Correspondent reports that the said story which was reported in some national dailies (not Vanguard), which also went viral on social media space had it that Bishop Naga had applauded the choice of Sen. Shettima by Sen. Tinubu, the APC presidential candidate in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe statement added that Bishop Naga said the state have never had a better deal under Shettima who was at the helm of affairs as governor in Borno state between 2011 and 2019.\n\nSome parts of the alleged statement from Naga reads, \u201d My brothers, those who are not from Borno State may not know, but you and I know better. In the history of Borno State, there is no Governor that has been fair to the Christian Community in this State as much as Governor Kashim Shettima.\n\n\u201cI am saying this in the presence of God Almighty and this is nothing but the truth. Governor Shettima, in the history of Borno, is the only Governor that has sponsored highest number of Christian Pilgrims every year since 2011.\n\n\u201cI am speaking boldly without fear or favour because as CAN Chairman I do not receive salary or kobo from Government or any institution, but the facts need to be told. This Governor has shown compassion to the Christian Community.\u201d\n\nBut reacting to the story making round on Monday in Maiduguri, the CAN Chairman, Bishop Naga denied making any commendation or issuing statement to any Journalist, and said the alleged statement was an interview he granted to some Journalists on 3rd April, 2017 while Senator Kashim Shettima was a Governor of the State.\n\nHe expressed shock that an acclaimed and unprofessional Journalist will mischievously lifted such an interview, portrayed it as if was granted on Monday being 11th of July, 2022, surprisingly prove a point for his paymaster.\n\nConsequently upon this unwholesome development, Bishop Naga said, he has summoned a meeting for all the CAN representatives in the state as well as the National body which comes up tomorrow Tuesday 12th July 2022 , after which, CAN will issue a statement or its position regarding the story.\n\n\u201d I granted no interview to anybody on Monday 11th July 2022.

          "title": "Okotie: Nigeria\u2019ll break up if i don\u2019t succeed Buhari",
          "text": "Founder of Household of God Church, Oregun, Lagos, Rev Chris Okotie has warned that Nigeria will collapse if he\u2019s not allowed to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. He said to avert a national catastrophe, he, Okotie would have to head an interim government.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, the pop star-turned cleric said the current political system in Nigeria, including the National Assembly, state assemblies and other government structures must be dismantled, noting that an interim administration headed by him would then midwife a brand new political system for the country.\n\nWhat informed this strange talk about an interim government after Buhari that must be headed by you?\n\nWe are in a juncture in our political evolution that it becomes the logical and the next step to take. The presidential system of government that we have been operating for so many years now has failed woefully. We redefined democracy to be government of the party by the party for the party. To that extent, they excluded Nigerians from the entire process and that is why things have degenerated to the level that we see today. To bring democracy back to the people; to re-establish the parameters in which we operate as a federalism, to rekindle brotherhood, to avoid war, segregation, the interim government is the only next logical step to take.\n\nWhen Chief Afe Babalola recently called for an interim government, he received knocks from across the country. Don\u2019t you think Nigerians might stone you for calling for what some could be described as a \u2018civilian coup\u2019?\n\nNot at all. What I\u2019m proposing is inspiring a conversation in the country where all our people begin to talk about the problem that we face right now. When those conversations have been collated, I will send them as a transcript to the president and to the National Assembly so that they can energise the process that can lead to a transition, not from a regime to a regime, but from this regime to an interim government because Nigeria should be fixed.\n\nAs a lawyer, you know an interim government has no place in our constitution. So how do you implement this system?\n\nThat is what I have just told you. The legislators and the president are Nigerians. Man was not made for the law, but the law was made for man. If the will of the people is that we have problems in the nation today (it is very clear, go to the streets and ask people, there is disillusion everywhere, resentment, anger), and there is the need to do something very drastic for our sake. Democracy is the ascent of the people. If the people say this process is not working, we need to do something urgently; that is why the National Assembly is there. They will now make a law signed by the president for transition into an interim government so that Nigeria can be fixed. I don\u2019t think that there is any difficulty in that.\n\nHow do you think the National Assembly would agree to throw away their jobs and support an unconstitutional arrangement?\n\nI expect that that they are patriots. There comes a time when a man must prioritise the needs of other people than himself. They were sent there as representatives of the people; the government is representing the people. So, if you find out that there is a political system that is not practicable to bring harmony in our society, it is the responsibility of these people to rectify that situation; it is a patriotic duty. I believe that with the scenario we have in the country today where things are really dilapidated, there is enmity (these politicians play the card on religion and ethnicity), we are so polarised , balkanised, I feel that they must recognise that as the only solution and therefore will rise this time as patriots and do the right thing. There comes a time in the affairs of men when you recognise that if you do not do the right thing, it would be catastrophic and cataclysmic and therefore, as intelligent people, lovers of this country, I believe that they would be galvanised by the circumstances to rise to the occasion of this reality. I also believe that the president has been kept by God in the means of all the debilitating illness that he had so that he can do something to protect this country before he leaves, and I believe that this could be his greatest legacy.\n\nDon\u2019t you think a sovereign national conference would address these problems that you have identified?\n\nNo. It is impossible because no subsisting or extant government can give that kind of latitude. It is an interim government where you do not have political considerations that usually work against that which is conducive for harmony and the wellbeing of the people. It is an interim government that can do that because it has no political agenda of its own; it is a corrective mechanism to salvage the political process, otherwise there may be great catastrophe and calamity. That is why none of these confabs has succeeded because an existing political institution like government cannot take that kind of responsibility. That is why it is inevitable at the moment that we move with the interim government for the sake of the corporate existence of our nation.\n\nMany Nigerians would no doubt consider this interim proposition a joke\u2026\n\nNot at all! You can see the signs; you can see how divided Nigeria has become; how polarised we have become. The politicians themselves have divided our nation so that they can rule. But I\u2019m saying, as a patriot, it is my responsibility to proffer solutions. The interim government would correct all of these. For instance, our democracy has been hijacked by elitism, mysticism, Satanism. Our democracy is no longer government of the people by the people for the people. It is now, government of the party by the party for the party. It is an aberration, a terminological inexactitude. So, we need to come back to democracy. That is why I\u2019m saying that this interim government will give an opportunity to proffer a solution. It is what I call, Aborigine democracy. For instance, we don\u2019t need the legislature; we can eliminate the legislature from this tripartite system of government where you have the executive, judiciary and the legislature. So the legislature is totally unnecessary. We can take power and give it back to the people because what the legislature does is to run committees; participate in committees to discuss issues that are already in existence in our polity. You have the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT), Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASSU), etc. These are institutions that are already there, you should involve them in lawmaking instead of getting people who do not understand the mechanism or dynamics of situations that confront the Nigerian people.\n\nMy suggestion is eliminate the legislatures, give the power to these institutions so that when it comes to lawmaking, go to them; they are part of the people. It is what I call, the concept of gregarious socialisation, where lawyers binding with lawyers, doctors binding with doctors, journalists binding with journalists, market women binding with market women. They understand the realities within their own firmament. If you want to make a law on health, you don\u2019t go to senators, but you go to the NMA or the affiliate, they can tell you what is necessary in their society; they emerge from that society. In this way, the financial burden that this nation has been trying to maintain will be eliminated. I call it Government of National Reconciliation and Reconstruction.\n\nWhat do you mean by this system of \u2018elitism, mysticism and Satanism?\n\nThe elites belong to echelon politics. There are those people who have a certain intellectual capacity; they are trusted by their people and have deceived them along the way because they have been in kaput with the rich men, the Plutocrats, the oligarchs, the hegemonies and they come to their people and say, this is the direction because the culture of our people is to follow people we consider to be leaders. Many of them are technocrats who are politically inclined but they pretend that they are democrats, but they only represent their masters. I call it political ventriloquism (somebody who throws his voice at a distance). When they open their mouths to speak, you hear their masters\u2019 voice. They have systematically oppressed the Nigerian people, deceived the Nigerian people and established their own personal agenda for self aggrandizement. They are problem number one. Problem number two is mysticism. These are people who call themselves juggernauts; \u2018without me, nothing will happen.\u2019 They have acquired their money, acquired everything. I call it social irredentism, where everything belongs to me \u2013 I bought this, I bought that, I have everything, I have all the money stored somewhere for the day of reckoning. These ones must be demystified. Problem number three is the Satanism. These are the ones who bring chaos; if my party doesn\u2019t win there is a state of emergency and then there is chaos and there is anarchy. This is the tripartite coalition; diabolical coalition that has militated against the democracy of our nation. But that would end when we have a government that understands its responsibility. One of the things in this interim government is that we would no longer have political parties. It is not necessary. In the definition of democracy, you will never find any reference to political parties mentioned. Political parties were engendered by the rich as a mechanism to suppress the poor, and to keep the rich in the place of power. You don\u2019t need political party system for democracy, what you need is ascent.\n\nAn example. In 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari polled over 15 million votes to become the president. What happened to other millions of Nigerians who didn\u2019t vote? But it didn\u2019t stop him from becoming the president, as long as those people agree that whoever polls the largest votes becomes the president. That ascent is democratic. If you look at the football mundial, you find out that when they were about to pair teams at a particular time in the competition, they put them in a box and people will just come and draw; they say Nigeria will play Brazil. There has never been any quarrel about it because it is a democratic process. So, we don\u2019t need political parties. As we don\u2019t need political parties, we don\u2019t also need ministers or commissioners because the civil service structure has been running for ages. They are political appointees that have no relevance; they are just there as part of the victory charm for their political parties to do whatever they want to do with those positions. If we curtail all of these political excesses, Nigeria will be better for it, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m suggesting.\n\nWhat you are saying, for instance, is that the NMA should be given the power to make laws on health?\n\nYes, that is what I\u2019m saying. Let the constitution enable these people who are within the society; you don\u2019t need other people representing them, let them represent themselves so that if you want to make a law you go to those establishments. For instance, NUT was established in 1931, NBA was established in 1933, NMA was established in 1951, they predate all these political parties; even ASUU was established in 1978. If we are truly practising democracy, then go to the people themselves, why asking people to represent people when the people can represent themselves and they are not paid? All that cost of spending billions on an institution that is a replication of what we already have will not be there again. If you empower these institutions, they will give us laws that are more appropriate and very relevant to them. That would be true democracy; it could be a presidential system devoid of an institution that is unnecessary.\n\nHow long will the interim government last if it is set up?\n\nIt depends on the responsibility and the terms of reference and terms and rules of engagement. The important thing that we need to understand is that you cannot ask a man who is debilitated by some ailments to run a race; you have to fix him first. Nigeria cannot run the race of joining the comity of nations when we are incapacitated, when we are fractured and polarised, it is not possible. We need to fix the nation first before we start talking of the political process.\n\nLook at the party primaries and the things that we have seen in the political arena, it is disheartening and it\u2019s done with so impunity right in your face and that is because we lost sight of what truly democracy is and that is why we need to pause; there has to be a hiatus. Some of our great politicians have qualified for the next election as flag bearers \u2013 Their Excellencies Atiku Abubakar, Bola Tinubu, Peter Obi and others. These are Nigerians first of all and they understand as patriots that this nation is greater than anybody and if they love this nation and I believe they do, they must align themselves with the current situation that something must be done outside what has transpired for so many years. We cannot proceed to the polls, it is a journey in futility and elusive, it is like trying to embrace an elusive phantom. Nothing is going to come out of it and we are back to square one. So, an interim government is the only way forward.\n\nBut these presidential flag bearers are saying that they are well aware of these problems and are prepared to tackle them and reposition the country.\n\nThey may have such intentions, but the concept of the political system that we are operating is faulty ab initio. It is not a question of saying that I will do this and that. I\u2019m saying, the reason we have these problems, which are symptoms of a major pathological situation that we have not addressed, is because we are always addressing symptoms. What are they going to do about the definition of federalism; how are they going to do that because the constitution that we are using doesn\u2019t support federalism. How are you going to change that; how are you going to change that fundamental issue of what is it that holds us together as a nation?\n\nSo, you have to get a new constitution and you cannot do as a sitting government; it is not possible because of political interests. You need a mechanism that is not connected to any political party; that doesn\u2019t have that kind of interest and can sit down dispassionately and say, this constitution is faulty; we need a democratic constitution and not the one that was handed over to us by the military. We need to address issues that affect our relationship. What is federalism to us? What is resource control to us? What is regional xenophobia to us? What are the forces militating against the unity and coherence of our federalism? These are things that must be done dispassionately outside the political parties.\n\nWhere and when did this rain start to beat Nigeria that we got to this level that you are talking about?\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time, but we have the tendency to sweep things under the carpet. Our political ancestors, the patriots that handed over democracy to us, made frantic attempts to bring unity to our country, but it was not that possible. Going back to Independence, you will still find out that Nigeria was balkanised along ethnic lines. It was already there and I believe that the patriots were hoping that with time, our people would rise to a place where these cleavages would diminish to a superficial laceration in terms of national integration. But it didn\u2019t happen. Then the military came in and the country became more divided. So, as we progressed, instead of sitting down and stopping the entire process, and say, let us get a holistic approach to governance, people were more eager to be involved in political offices for self aggrandisement and have nothing to do with the nation. So it has steadily degenerated; a downward spiral and that is why we are here today. Thank God that we still have another chance to rectify these aberrations and put things in proper perspective, and that is why I\u2019m here. That is why I\u2019m speaking at this time, asking our people to join hands so that we can take Nigeria back to a place where healing can occur, where we can ameliorate the opinion of the people and they can rise and say, \u2018ok, we still have faith\u2019. It can only be done with an interim government.\n\nIf political parties are not relevant, what will be the vehicle to throw up leaders?\n\nThat is the example I have given you from football situation. For instance, if we don\u2019t have political parties and we don\u2019t have ministers, you don\u2019t have commissioners, what offices will they be running for? There is only one office you can run for, which is that of the president. There will be no governors. What we will have will be people who are elders, tetrarchs ,who are about 80 years old, who are volunteers, vested in the affairs of a particular state. You look at their qualifications, you look at their antecedents; how much they served the country, you collate their names, put them into a box and there is a draw. They are working with the civil service, professional associations who have now been empowered and given legislative powers. Their role is purely supervisory. That way, politics is no longer business. Anyone who is looking for service will be these people in that age or joining an association to make sure that they promote the cause of that association. If we do so, there is no access to the money, and a lot of these people who are in politics today will have to find another profession because politics is the biggest business to them. More so, our political conscience has not been developed enough to follow an American model; that is why we are where we are. We must evolve a system that caters to the cultural sensibilities of our people; understanding how our people are, and knowing that if you give access to funds, governmental monies, you are going to breed more corruption and we are intelligent enough and that is why I\u2019m suggesting this mechanism. If we follow this suggestion you will find out that the people are in charge of their destiny and no one person will come and tell them what to do with the money of a state or how they want to dispense these monies. It will be the responsibility of the people themselves.\n\nWhy must you be the person to run this \u2018interim government\u2019?\n\nI\u2019m the person to run it because you cannot know a product better than the manufacturer. It is a concept I evolved; therefore, you cannot understand it better than I do. Secondly, I have never been a part of this problem; a part of any major political party. If I wanted a political career, I would have joined APC or PDP, but I evolved a political party so that I would have a podium to talk to Nigerians about the future of our country, not for political office. Many of these people whose names are being touted today were neophytes when I ran for president in 2003. The concept of national leadership has not even registered in the metrics of their political thoughts. If I had joined PDP or any other party at that time, I would have been a chieftain by now, but I wasn\u2019t looking for a career, I was looking for a solution for a nation that was gradually disintegrating. That is why I have sat back, prayed about it and came out with a solution. Thirdly, I have paid my dues, denominated in resilience and tenacity; I\u2019m a known face. I\u2019m successful at what I do and Nigerians need someone who has not been a part of this system, who has that compassion and intellectual capacity and understands the pain of the people. I have never been drawn into the vortex of partisan politics, and that is why I believe that I can handle the job.\n\nNow if Nigerians, the legislators and the presidency don\u2019t buy into this your proposal, what does it portend for the country?\n\nIt will bring disaster, catastrophe, calamity and tragedy. You can see where we are headed; the indicators are very clear that if we do not do something now while we have the time, this nation will break into fragments. It could even lead to war because there is so much anger, there is so much resentment. The politicians have divided us into ethnicity and religion. That is why we must do something at this point in time. Only a credible leader can have the kind of support from Nigerian people for this kind of project because they themselves know what is going on. Things are so bad. I have been a pastor for about 35 years, and I work with people and I know the pain, their anguish, the resentment that is growing in the polity; we must do something to assuage the situation. Those who know Chris Okotie know that I only stand on the truth. I believe that as I begin to expatiate and elucidate this concept, our people will listen because they know that is the only way forward. If not we are back to square one. We don\u2019t need a regime change; we need a system change. Nigeria must change its system of operation. That is the only way we can have peace, unity and prosperity.\n\nYou ran for president three times and failed. With this interim government proposal, people would ask, aren\u2019t you trying to get political power now through the backdoor?\n\nIt\u2019s such a jejune \u2018infantility\u2019; that is such a political naivety. If Buhari had run on the platform of Fresh Democratic Party, would he have won an election? No. If former President Olusegun Obasanjo had run on the platform of Justice Party, would he have won the election? No. If former President Goodluck Jonathan had run on the platform of Fresh Democratic Party, would he have won? No, because they understand that politics is a game of numbers. If I wanted a political career, I would have become a member of the dominant parties. Anybody who is making that kind of statement, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is totally illogical. Some people cannot decipher the Chris Okotie enigma and sometimes they articulate incoherent inconsistency because it is not logical. You cannot beat PDP on a platform of a political party that does not have structures. I didn\u2019t go into politics for a political career; I went into politics to teach, to demonstrate to the people that it is possible to be patriotic, to have a nation that understands nationalistic sentiments. That is why I didn\u2019t join those parties. So anybody who makes that kind of statement is na\u00efve. Why are they all struggling to be the flag bearers of APC and PDP? It is for obvious reasons that in today\u2019s politics people don\u2019t vote for personalities, but they vote for parties.\n\nGive us a glimpse of this interim government arrangement?\n\nWe are going to offer the world a new concept of democracy, which is people-oriented, which is a mechanical externalisation of the true definition of that concept. When the Greek called it democracy, they were speaking from two words: Demos \u2013 people and Cratus \u2013 invisible power. That is, when you look at governance, what you see is people and their power. But in Nigeria what you see is the party and that is not democracy. What we are going to do is to bring back the true definition of democracy by giving power to the people. The only way you could do that is to eliminate the legislature. Once we put that into practice, other parts of the world would begin to adopt it. If you take a look at the world today, politics is dominated by the rich. The party concept of politics was introduced by rich men to hoodwink the people into thinking that they were involved in the democratic process. What I\u2019m proposing will demystify this and bring democracy back to the people.\n\nBy the time this your concept is applied, what system of government do you call it \u2013 presidential, parliamentary?\n\nI call it Aboriginal Democracy because it goes back to the roots. This is government from the people for the people with the people. It will be a new concept completely; you have an executive, the judiciary and the people. If you want to become part of the lawmaking process, you join your union or association, but if you want to run for an office you don\u2019t need to join a political party, you just go by the mechanism that would be set up, maybe by the Ministry of Justice or Internal Affairs. If you qualify, your name will be put into a box and a draw is organised. You don\u2019t need to campaign.",
          "summary": "You don\u2019t need political party system for democracy, what you need is ascent.\nSo, we don\u2019t need political parties.\nAs we don\u2019t need political parties, we don\u2019t also need ministers or commissioners because the civil service structure has been running for ages.\nThey may have such intentions, but the concept of the political system that we are operating is faulty ab initio.\nFor instance, if we don\u2019t have political parties and we don\u2019t have ministers, you don\u2019t have commissioners, what offices will they be running for?",

Under these dire circumstances, I find no justification to still remain, in good conscience, a member of a political party that subordinates electoral victory, over the safety of lives and the peace of mind of its citizens.\n\n\u201cThe men and women of our party here in Rivers are the most loyal and faithful supporters I have met.

By doing this, Tinubu is saying that a Northern Christian has no electoral value. My staying means I agree.\n\n\u201cI wish you well.

The gunmen reportedly shot at the building located at Oke Imma area of the town. It was learnt by THISDAY that they came around 2am in the night.\n\nIt was further gathered that the security agents attached to the building were able to repel the attack with no one injured.\n\nLasun, who is a former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, was present at the Governorship Debate organised by Channels Television on Sunday night.\n\nSpeaking yesterday one of the aides to the former deputy speaker said that alleged that the hoodlums might have been working for a gubernatorial candidate.\n\nAccording to him,\u201d this is the second time they would unleash attacks on our Principal. I don\u2019t know what do they stand to gain.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as at the time of filling this report, calmness has been restored to the area as sympathisers were seeing visiting the politician.\n\nMeanwhile, the All Progressives Congress APC reacted on the attack on the LP candidate.\n\nThe Chief Press Secretary to Governor Gboyega Oyetola, Mr Ismali Omipidan, in press conference addressed in Osogbo yesterday charged the security agencies to properly investigate the attack and bring perpetrators to book\n\nOmipidan, who said the reaction become necessary following the allegations by the candidate accusing APC of the alleged attack said Yussuf is never a threat to Oyetola winning elections in July 16.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwhere were the security details attached to the Lasun Yussuff resident, where were they when attackers invaded his house? Why do they not repelled them. This and many more questions begging for answers.\n\n\u201cLasun Yussuf is not a threat to APC Candidate, why will they attack him for what?. I believe it is an arrangement by the complaint to divert people\u2019s attention on his plans to perpetrate fraud during Saturday governorship poll.\n\nSpeaking to journalists few minutes ,the LP candidate, who thanked God for sparing his life and that of his family members, said he has being receiving threats messages from unknown persons.\n\nHe explained that gun shots lasted for minutes even though there were security at his premises.\n\nThe LP candidate said the attack might not be unconnected with his good outings at the recent governorship debates held in the state where he called the capacity of those in the position of authorities to question on issues bordering on security and governance.\n\n\u201dSubsequent upon the series of governorship debates we had in Osun where I told those in government that people now see them as those who don\u2019t understand the act of governance. Since then, I have been receiving warnings But the last attack was beyond intimidation ,it is an attempt on my life, \u201d Lasun said.",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What to look for in a startup lawyer",
          "text": "Startups often relegate non-technology roles to the background in a bid to ship products quickly. However, these roles are often as important in the overall success of the company as the technical roles, and one such important role is that of the startup lawyer.\n\nAt the beginning of the technology boom in Africa, the standard practice was for startups to outsource their legal processes to law firms. With the increase in funding in Africa, more startups have become aware of the importance of having an in-house lawyer focused specifically on their legal needs.\n\nBeing a relatively new development, it is not far-fetched to assume that startups might not know what to look for in a startup lawyer. To identify the unique qualities a startup lawyer should have, I asked 4 lawyers what qualities startups should look for in an in-house counsel.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi is a lawyer with experience working in-house for a fintech startup and providing legal advisory for early-stage startups.\n\nOlutimilehin Olushuyi: I think startups need to begin their questions with, \u201cDo we need an in-house lawyer or a lawyer I can reach out to when needed?\u201d I say this because, while you always need a lawyer, a couple of factors determine if you need one employed with you or if you need one on a retainer. These factors include how regulated your sector of operation is. The regulations guiding fintech and food ordering companies are very different from one another. The size and stage of your startup\u2019s growth matter as well. A startup at the ideation stage has different needs from a startup that has begun operations.\n\nYou also need to be conscious and properly assess your options when engaging a lawyer due to the nature of the role. A proper assessment cannot be understated. Like with every other kind of service, there is the tendency to have a \u201cvalue mismatch\u201d if you do not engage on the terms that fit your needs.\n\nThe first thing to look out for in a lawyer is honesty, and it is the single most important feature, to me. The reason is that a lawyer holds the life of your startup in his hands. You need a lawyer that informs you of the whole reality every time a situation comes up. Brilliance is overrated; it\u2019s the law, and there will always be a solution. You want a lawyer that can tell you, \u201cI am not sure what the position of the law on this is, allow me to run some checks.\u201d Your lawyer should be comfortable enough to tell you, \u201cThis is outside my speciality, we need to bring this person in to handle this particular part of the issue.\u201d If you find a lawyer that can be this honest with you, you are in good hands, regardless of how convoluted the legal situation might be.\n\nEmmanuel Ido is an associate at Olajide Oyewole LLP (DLA Piper Africa).\n\nEmmanuel Ido: Almost every startup is unique, from its product to its people. The role of a startup lawyer is essential to support the startup from a legal perspective such that it can function at optimum capacity. Whether the startup is pre-seed, bootstrapped or VC-funded, a good startup lawyer is crucial for its day-to-day running. Aside from the practical skills, there are a few things to look out for when hiring a lawyer for your startup.\n\nFirst, the lawyer\u2019s sector knowledge is important. When hiring a lawyer for your startup, one should consider the level of sector knowledge. This will be handy when drafting and negotiating contracts, advising the startup, and general day-to-day operations. A good startup lawyer should be well-grounded in data protection, intellectual property management, labour and employment law, corporate governance, public policy, dispute resolution, etc.\n\nAnother thing to look out for is the lawyer\u2019s sector experience. A startup lawyer must have relevant experience within the tech sector. The experience will come from doing the work. For instance, a corporate and finance lawyer who has practical experience will be suited to advising a fintech company. A quick review of their deal sheet will give you an idea of the type of lawyer they are and how suitable they will be for your startup.\n\nThe lawyer\u2019s regulatory interface is also very important because it\u2019s almost impossible to operate a startup without constant regulatory interface. To this end, your lawyer should be someone with sufficient knowledge of the regulators and the relevant contacts.\n\nThe 3 categories above roughly summarise what is needed in a startup lawyer. Of course, they must have the right soft skills and are good at working in a team in a dynamic environment, as most startups are.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan is a partner at Springwoods LP.\n\nZikora Okwor-Wewan: The first thing that I think a startup should look for in a lawyer is transaction experience and compliance experience. This is not to say that a lawyer with experience in other fields should not be considered. However, that lawyer should be adaptable enough to learn.\n\nA startup lawyer should also be able to work in a startup environment, which is not as rigid as a law firm. The lawyer should ideally be someone that can think on their feet and be able to prioritise. It is not all conflicts that require a court sitting; some legal matters require collaboration. The lawyer should have a multi-faceted approach to legal matters.\n\nThe lawyer should also be able to maintain and build relationships with regulators and your competitors. This is very relevant. A startup lawyer should be aware of regulatory developments ahead of the public to navigate these developments smoothly. Unlike law firms, a startup can\u2019t afford a lawyer that doesn\u2019t have attention to detail.\n\nLastly, as the startup evolves so too should its legal needs evolve. An early-stage startup requires basic things like incorporation and a founder\u2019s contract. However, as you scale, the legal demands greatly increase. At this stage, the startup should liaise with its lawyer to understand the next steps to take to meet these demands.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye is a lawyer at Banwo & Ighodalo, and a writer.\n\n\u2018Tooni Ajiboye: The first thing to look out for is technical expertise. Knowledge of the law is the whole basis of a lawyer in a startup. As such, the first and most important thing is for the in-house counsel to be highly technical in the knowledge and application of law to issues arising out of your business. Also, a necessary plus is more industry-streamlined knowledge and awareness of current market solutions that are needed for that startup.\n\nPerhaps more useful for the startup than the lawyer\u2019s technical expertise is the lawyer\u2019s creativity, business savvy, and solutions-oriented outlook. The lawyer mustn\u2019t be restricted to the legal side of the startup only, as this may negatively impact some of the creative solutions that the product and engineering team may want to bring on board. It is therefore important for the founders to look out for the creative flair in the lawyer candidates they are speaking to.\n\nLastly, cultural fit is very important. While lawyers are inclined to be more regimented in their approach, working in a startup will require the flexibility of whatever candidate you are looking to scoop up into your team.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "In 2013, Patricia Pedhom Nono learnt one of the lessons of her life. Actually, she has learnt life-altering lessons more than once. And Patricia considers them absolutely necessary; after all, what would she be today without them?\n\nShe introduces herself to start our conversation and ends with \u201cfor now.\u201d This is probably because humans are dynamic by nature, but Patricia is very clear about her values and why they would never change.\n\nFaith, consistency, and hard work are a few of the virtues to note in Patricia\u2019s story. Patricia is the Transformation Director and Technology Leader at the international audit and consulting firm, PwC in sub-Saharan Francophone Africa. She feels strongly about empowering African youth and helping organisation heads understand what it takes to lead successfully.\n\nIt would be premature to put Patricia\u2019s exploits down to a privileged background without hearing of her journey.\n\nTapping into the genius inside a stubborn Patricia\n\nPatricia Pedhom Nono. Transformation Director and Technology Leader, PwC, sub-Saharan Francophone Africa. Source: Supplied\n\nPatricia\u2019s background is both funny and impressive. I took her heads-up of \u201cI\u2019ll tell you exactly the way it is\u201d lightly until we were deep into the conversation. A few minutes in, and we are both cracking up as she shares her story. Don\u2019t get me wrong, these are critical details to note about her childhood.\n\nAn excellent place to begin is a vital trait she\u2019s had since she was a child that has fuelled her consistent professional climb.\n\n\u201cWhile growing up, I was a very stubborn kid and tried to question everything. At that stage, my mind was just bubbling to understand the environment,\u201d she recalls.\n\nAlthough her stubbornness \u2014 okay, let\u2019s call it doggedness \u2014 often got her into trouble, it had advantages like making her independent early in life. She explains how this curiosity leaves her dissatisfied with the status quo and nudges her to do things differently.\n\n\u201cThat developed a solution and challenging type of mindset that is very important if you want to grow in technology and become a leader because things are changing so fast.\u201d\n\nIn Africa, a child with such qualities could be considered difficult; however, she regards one of her privileges growing up as having understanding parents who found how to manage and help her direct her curiosity in the right direction.\n\nPatricia is from Yaounde, the Cameroonian capital, and is the only girl of four children in a middle-class home.\n\nPatricia\u2019s love for books from childhood was one of her outstanding qualities as a student. She describes herself as a brilliant, top-of-class, A-student.\n\nDuring her final year in high school, she got a scholarship to attend a two-year preparatory programme at Telecom SudParis, a top engineering school in France. Expectedly, she aced her entrance examination and was set to resume school before her life took an unexpected turn, one from which she learnt one of many lessons in her life to date.\n\n\u201cI was shocked that as an A student, an honours student, my first mark in class was 3.5 out of 20. Then I called my dad and said, \u2018Dad, you know what? I\u2019m coming back home! This is insane; I\u2019ve never had this type of mark in my life. How come I\u2019m not even reaching the average?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe probably knew she would not have it that easy because of how seriously her dad takes success.\n\n\u201cMy dad told me something that was very crucial. He said, \u2018You know what? You got the scholarship to represent Cameroon over there, you\u2019re not there for you, but you\u2019re also there for all the people that are looking at you and expecting that scholarship to happen. Stop being childish; I know that you can do it. Running away is not a solution, Patricia, especially when you\u2019re not only doing it for yourself.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt only 18, Patricia found her father\u2019s advice difficult to accept.\n\nHowever, in a stroke of genius, he gave her an out that she could only take if she stayed in school for a while. It doesn\u2019t matter if you call it the counsel of wisdom or words of experience, but she decided to remain in school because her dad said he would only allow her to return home if she genuinely didn\u2019t like it there and not because of her poor scores. And she reasoned that the only way to confirm how she felt about the school was to first get good grades.\n\nIt would be an exciting twist in this story to say that she bounced back instantly, but her grades did not get better immediately. And while there are debates over who first said, \u201cForm is temporary, class is permanent,\u201d a statement often heard in sporting circles when one makes a resurgence following a dip in form, Patricia\u2019s class shone through, eventually, but not without encouragement from her mathematics teacher; he\u2019d noticed how tense she looked during tests and examinations and said,\n\n\u201cYou have to compete against yourself. The moment that you have given the maximum that you can give, then you should be proud of yourself. Don\u2019t try to look around and try to compete with other John and Smith.\u201d\n\nShe took what turned out to be excellent advice and was top of her class at the end of the programme; she was finally back where she felt most comfortable. After that, she got another scholarship for a three-year course equivalent to a Master\u2019s in Management and Information Systems and Finance at the same engineering school.\n\nBy the way, Patricia chose engineering for a reason.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always wanted to be a surgeon, that was my dream, but I ended up being an engineer because I wanted to be independent. When I got the scholarship, it was only for engineering school. I asked if there was one for medicine, but they said no. They told me there\u2019re so many medical doctors now, so we want to drive the engineering field in Francophone Africa. So I went with it; I didn\u2019t want to be dependent on my parents anymore.\u201d\n\nJourney to fulfilment\n\nPatricia Pedhom Nono. Transformation Director and Technology Leader, PwC, sub-Saharan Francophone Africa. Source: Supplied\n\nAnd it got even more interesting in her final year as an engineering student. Patricia had always had her eyes on going to the United States for a funny reason.\n\n\u201cAs a kid, when I looked at the music, I\u2019d say \u2018American guys are so handsome. So, I need to go to America,\u2019\u201d she recalls, laughing.\n\nObviously, this mattered little when she was to visit the US.\n\nThe opportunity came in the form of an internship at KPMG (whose consulting arm was called Bearing Point at the time) in New York. But this wasn\u2019t an easy feat either because the internship was not for students at her school.\n\nActing on a tip from a friend at another school that an American company would interview for some internship roles, Patricia promptly visited the school and was probably not turned away because of her confidence. She prepared intensely and was exceptional at all interview stages, winning the recruiter\u2019s heart and getting offered a job despite not being a student of the school the recruiter attended.\n\nAmazed, I ask why she went that far.\n\n\u201cI knew what I wanted, and I was bold enough to go after it, and it turned out well,\u201d she replies, \u201cI\u2019m a very demanding person, not only of my team, [but] demanding of myself as well. For me, [it\u2019s] excellence first.\u201d\n\nAnd this is also reflected in her career journey.\n\n\u201cToday, I describe myself as a servant-leader, a mom, and a big dreamer. And in the technology field, I\u2019m a technology and business executive. I\u2019m working for PwC, which is an audit and consulting firm, driving technology transformation for the entire team and also driving transformation for our clients.\u201d\n\nBut this isn\u2019t all that the Cameroonian technology leadership expert with 18 years of experience does.\n\nAs a consultant, she helps tech businesses discover the potential areas they should focus on that can give them massive outcomes. She is also passionate about mentoring young African leaders to build a generation that rightly expresses the continent\u2019s potential globally.\n\nThe atypical girl-child, at 23, Patricia didn\u2019t think twice about beginning her career in a country thousands of miles from home.\n\nAnd she climbed the ladder so fast that in her nine years in New York, she accomplished a lot by taking up consulting and project management roles at PwC and KPMG \u2014 two of the US\u2019 Big Four consulting firms.\n\nSoon, she began having a yearning that needed to be urgently addressed.\n\n\u201cI started looking at things from a different perspective. \u201cWhat am I doing for the continent? Which value do I bring back?\u201d I kept asking those questions, and then I wanted to try going back,\u201d she recounts.\n\nPatricia requested a 12-month family leave to go back to Cameroon. During her visit, she decided to get a feel of work by freelancing at an organisation as a mentor and coach for teenagers and youth.\n\nShe considers that period very inspiring, and after spending a little over a year back in the US, she began planning her relocation to Cameroon.\n\n\u201cI had that call; it was like the motherland was calling me. It wasn\u2019t necessarily the most rational decision to go back, and the return was very tough,\u201d she sighs, \u201cbut when I came back, I had that clash of culture because growing up outside and living in New York actually strengthened that independent mind. And from a woman\u2019s perspective, they don\u2019t expect you to be like that. It was a challenge at work and in society.\u201d\n\nTrue to herself, she did not change and try to fit the status quo. But after a while, she decided to do things differently without sacrificing her individuality. Since she\u2019d spent those years in an English-speaking environment, Patricia needed to learn the ropes in a Francophone work situation.\n\n\u201cIt took me two years to understand the environment. Shifting that mindset from Anglophone to the Francophone environment was quite the challenge. Thank God I managed to find my way and balance things.\u201d\n\nLearning leadership the African way\n\nPatricia Pedhom Nono. Transformation Director and Technology Leader, PwC, sub-Saharan Francophone Africa. Source: Supplied\n\nPatricia calls herself a stubborn servant leader who got that way through.\n\nAfter her relocation, she got into MTN Cameroon in 2011, and the first team she led was the turning point in her servant leadership career. Considering where she was coming from, she was more concerned about getting work done than having to care about what was going on with the people she was leading.\n\nAfter the first assessment survey for rating leaders, she realised the workers perceived her as mean and unkind. Consequently, she reconsidered her leadership style.\n\n\u201cAs a leader, it was challenging. Now I understand that the culture bit is quite important, and if I want to succeed, I need to leave that independent American heart somewhere and try to understand the environment.\n\n\u201cBecause success is also how you make sure you achieve within the personal, cultural, or team constraints that you have. That was another pivotal moment when I had to learn to be a bit more people-oriented,\u201d she explains.\n\nBut she had other key lessons to learn.\n\nStarting as the Chief Information Officer(CIO) at MTN Cameroon, before leading the customer operations department, she says, \u201cWe were serving about 10 million customers at that time. And I went from a team of 20 people to a team of 400. But I failed in my objectives in the first year. Because making 400 people dance in the tango is not easy!\u201d\n\nAfter analysing the situation, she realised where she might have gotten it wrong.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve been an A-profile, you tend to feel like you can control everything. That you can do it yourself. With 20 persons, if they don\u2019t do it, you do it yourself and move on. But when there\u2019s an organisation, delegation becomes quite important because you cannot do everything. If you want to achieve, you have to push people to do what they have to do and do it the right way.\u201d\n\nPatricia took the team\u2019s performance to heart.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was a personal failure; it wasn\u2019t [only] because the team was unable to deliver.\u201d\n\nShe eventually realised that an engineering background was not enough to help her excel in her new role, so she decided to develop leadership capabilities despite being in the tech space. In 2018, she started an academy where she coaches women and young people on how to achieve excellence. She regularly shares stories about her failures and the lessons they\u2019ve taught her on LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cIt was quite fulfilling,\u201d she says, \u201cnot many leaders take the blame for the underperformance of their teams. Maybe, if the team could not deliver, the problem was me. You have to take the time to nurture and coach the team to become high performers.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, she confirms that one of the skills that stand out for her is critical thinking, which she learnt as an engineer. As a consultant, she\u2019s honed the ability to present an idea, convince people to buy into it, and point out the value and impact her effort generates. She even contributed to a book titled The X Factor, where she shares how she leverages her faith to be a good servant leader while aiming for the top.\n\nAt the end of that learning phase, she had gained a lot of valuable lessons from her experience and other examples of poor leadership \u2014 she learnt patience, empathy, and consideration.\n\nAfter seven years at MTN Cameroon, she rejoined PwC, this time as the Transformation Lead for sub-Saharan Francophone Africa. In her current role, she trains core tech people to look beyond technical skills and learn leadership, management, presentation, and negotiation skills.\n\n\u201cI have gone back to the consulting field where I\u2019m helping my clients to make the technology part of their organisations perform better and also to drive business growth.\u201d\n\nPatricia says her moves across industries were circumstance-motivated, with one because a respected boss changed companies, and she was interested in moving with them. Another was due to relocation, and the last was because the company suspended her role. However, she learnt to open a new chapter at every new company instead of importing what applied at the last one.\n\nShe also insists that having performed in various roles across core tech, commercial, and customer experience, among others, her moves have made her well-rounded. Talking about the best time to move, she says,\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not growing, learning, and you do not have perspective in a company, it\u2019s time to move. Keep that in mind because you\u2019re losing valuable time, especially when you\u2019re at the start of your career. The options are still very large if you\u2019re junior or medium-level; be very open, and don\u2019t lose time. It\u2019s the growth that you will achieve in the first 10 or 15 years of your career that you will capitalise on later. Because at a certain level, people are not looking at your competencies anymore; they are looking at your reference as an expert in the field.\u201d\n\nShe explains the three levels in a person\u2019s career: the first is where you do any job that comes your way to gain experience and probably make ends meets; the second \u2014 when you dictate the kind of job you take \u2014 is when people begin to see you as an expert; and the third stage is where you\u2019re headhunted or recommended for professional roles.\n\nEverything in between\n\nAlthough Patricia is quite vocal and keen about her professional life, she has other factors that encourage her consistency. She speaks proudly of her family and partner, who, by the way, might have been a huge motivation for her relocation to Cameroon.\n\nThe proud mother of two says, \u201cThey keep me on my toes. They are the most important; I want to live my legacy through them as well.\u201d\n\nPatricia points to her experience at the preparatory school for lessons that have stuck with her for most of her life and helped her productivity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind not being at the top, but what I do mind is giving my best and being excellent at what I do to the maximum of my capacity. At the end of the day, I do the math, and I\u2019m confident that I\u2019ve given my best.\u201d\n\nIt also helps that her parents constantly reinforce the need for excellence and repeatedly tell their children to live by one goal \u2014 doing their best even though they could be the fifth on a list of five winners.\n\n\u201cIf five people win, you can be the fifth; if there are four, you should be the fourth; and if there are three, you should be the third. But if there\u2019s only one, aim to be the one.\u201d\n\nOn what she thinks about the bias she faced as a young Francophone African woman in the US, she says,\n\n\u201cBias exists. But, you should not focus too much of your energy on it; don\u2019t try to justify and prove yourself to people. Just be who you are. I\u2019m sure you will find areas where you can leapfrog your performance and move forward.\u201d\n\nOn an average weekday, she prepares her kids for school, exercises, and takes work-related meetings in the mornings before beginning work and attending to clients. Her evenings and weekends are spent with family.\n\nSurprisingly, she has quite a controversial opinion about work-life balance.\n\n\u201cWork-life balance is utopia; you can\u2019t have it all. You have to pick your top three \u2014 family, work, or personal life \u2014 and know that you have to juggle [them].\u201d\n\nTo stay productive at work, she adopts the two-minute rule and uses her calendar app consistently. She also encourages stand-up meetings and proper delegation. Patricia likes to read, travel, exercise, and have family time.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Russia and Ukraine standoff, vis a vis boycott of Russian gas has triggered significant disruptions and created a huge shortage in global gas supply chain.\n\nAvailable data indicate that Russia is the world\u2019s largest natural gas exporter; exporting 238 billion cubic meters in 2020 and accounting for about 45 per cent the EU\u2019s imports in 2021.\n\nIt implies that any dislodgement in Russia\u2019s gas supply would leave a deep crater which must be exploited by Nigeria, with natural gas reserve of 209.5 trillion cubic feet.\n\nPerceptive stakeholders hold that the economic trump card of sanctions on Russia for Nigeria, as a ranking gas producing and exporting nation, is immense.\n\nExpectedly, Nigeria is savouring the prospects of being a buffer and cashing in on the void.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, while on a state visit to Portugal recently, indicated that Nigeria is ready to fill the natural gas gaps in Europe predicated by the current Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\nBuhari said with over 200 million mainly young people, Nigeria was ready to be the hub of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA).\n\nThe president urged Portugal to consider Nigeria as a valued and trusted partner in Africa.\n\nHe identified key areas of cooperation and collaboration capable of moving both countries forward as oil and gas, tourism and hospitality industry, air travel, security and joint commission.\n\n\u201cAt a time the world is going through turbulent times, we feel that a strong friendship and partnership between Nigeria and Portugal can act as a force for good.\n\n\u201cWith the current Russian-Ukraine war, increased cooperation in oil and gas between the two countries has become vital to avoid crisis in the demand and supply chain, even as Nigeria is already a major supplier of gas to Portugal,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president added that Nigeria and Portugal could cooperate closely on a range of agricultural and renewable energy projects.\n\nTo add some verve to Nigeria\u2019s drive to reap from gap in the global gas supply chain, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) recently presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo approved for the NNPC to enter into agreement with ECOWAS for the construction of the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who made the disclosure, said that the project was still at the point of the front end engineering design, after which the cost would be determined.\n\nThe pipeline would traverse 15 West African countries to Morocco and Spain.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Petroleum Resources presented three memos to Council.\n\n\u201cThe first memo, council approved for the NNPC Ltd to execute MoU with ECOWAS for the construction of the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline.\n\n\u201cThis gas pipeline is to take gas to 15 West African countries and to Morocco and through Morocco to Spain and Europe.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe minister said that the council also approved the construction of a switch gear room and installation of power distribution cables and equipment for the Nigeria Oil and Gas Park in Ogbia, Bayelsa. The cost of the project was put at N3.8billion.\n\nHe said that the park was to support local manufacturing of components for the oil and gas industry.\n\nNigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline was proposed in a December 2016 agreement between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the Moroccan Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (National Board of Hydrocarbons and Mines) (ONHYM).\n\nThe pipeline would connect Nigerian gas to every coastal country in West Africa (Benin, Togo, Ghana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Gambia, Senegal and Mauritania), ending at Tangiers, Morocco, and C\u00e1diz, Spain.\n\nSylva also elucidated on Nigeria\u2019s readiness to offer its services as an alternative gas supplier to Europe when he received a delegation, led by Samuela Isopi, EU\u2019s Ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS.\n\nHe urged EU to increase investments in gas and hydrocarbons in Nigeria to be able to meet the bloc\u2019s energy needs.\n\nThe minister implored the EU to encourage its oil and gas companies such as Shell, Eni, and Total Energies to scale up investments in the Nigerian gas sector.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we warned against earlier was the speed with which the EU was taking away investments in fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWe warned that the speed was faster than they were developing renewable energy; you can see now that what we were warning against is what is happening now.\u201d\n\nHe told the delegation that what stunted growth in the development of gas in Nigeria was fresh investments, and called for a change of attitude on the part of the EU, if its requests to increase supplies to Europe would be realised.\n\nThe minister said that one of the biggest challenges the sector faces was lack of investments.\n\n\u201cIn the last 10 years, over 70 billion dollars worth of investments came to Africa, but sadly less than four billion dollars came to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, we are the biggest in Africa; if we cannot attract investments to Nigeria, you know where we are heading.\n\n\u201cYou have been our long time friend; as at today, our gas reserve is one of the biggest in the world; we have a proven gas reserve of 206 tcf and if we really focus on gas exploitation we can get up to 600 tcf.\n\n\u201cWe are already building gas infrastructure such as the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) pipeline project, expected to take gas to Algeria, and the West Africa Gas Pipeline project designed to take gas to Morroco.\u201d\n\nThe minister said that due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the EU must have a buffer or an alternative source of gas.\n\n\u201cWe would like to be reliable partners to solve the energy problem in Europe and we can only achieve this by working together.\n\n\u201cIt is only when investment in these areas is increased that Nigeria can meet that obligation,\u201d he said.\n\nSharing similar sentiments, Sarah Anyanwu, Professor of Development, Department of Economics, University of Abuja, said it was ample opportunity for Nigeria to increase production.\n\nAnyanwu said that Nigeria had surplus gas and called on the concerned authorities to up the ante.\n\n\u201cWe have been talking on the issues of diversifying the economy; so, these are the areas apart from oil that government should cease the opportunity and key into.\n\n\u201cWe have areas to explore and make more foreign exchange earnings.\n\n\u201cNot only Nigeria, OPEC countries should step up; that\u2019s an opportunity for us to make more money from gas; it lies in increasing production.\n\n\u201cThe glut globally is for our good. Nigeria should cease the opportunity; increase production and breakthrough from this mono-cultural economy,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nExperts are of the submission that the diversification mantra has reverberated for many years; hence the urgent need for pragmatic steps.\n\nThey say that the interregnum in global gas supply presents a gaping opportunity for Nigeria to ramp up gas export and reap bountifully from a ready market.\n\n_____________________\n\nChijioke Okoronkwo, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)\n\n(NANFeatures)\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nA living room is a place in a home that is supposed to be for family time, bonding and watching television, but men\u2019s obsession for football lately is making the living room become a war zone between couples.\n\nWith their husbands\u2019 eyes and souls glued to the television screen displaying a football match, would wives agree to share the attention of their men with football?\n\nHow do wives cope with husbands who are football fanatics? When a match is lost, how do wives cope with its effect on their husbands?\n\nFootball is a game which engages every soul interested in it, with its suspense, disappointments, shock, failure, success and at last, victory. Do wives accept to bear this cross?\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday spoke with some women in Lagos metropolis to get their feelings about this.\n\nMrs Theresa Adelusi, an agricultural engineer, and mother of four, said her husband loves football after God.\n\n\u201cIf you want to serve food to my husband when he is watching football, he will say no. He gives total attention to that football that he is watching. He doesn\u2019t give attention to anyone.\n\nAdelusi said that the mood of the house depends on her husband\u2019s favorite club.\n\n\u201cIf Chelsea loses a match, the whole house will feel the impact. But if they win, ask for anything and he will give you.\n\n\u201cSometimes I wonder how rich he would be if he got paid for his dedication, and\n\nmy question, why should a happy moment in my household be determined by the result of a football team?\u201d she said.\n\nMrs Catherine Bamgbose, CEO, Tulips Beauty Glow and mother of one, said her husband gives much attention to football and hates being disturbed when watching football.\n\n\u201cIf you disturb my husband when watching a match, he doesn\u2019t mind, he switches his phone on and watches it online.\n\n\u201cThat is the only time I get to serve him any food of my choice and he doesn\u2019t pay enough attention to complain.\n\n\u201cHe loves football to the extent that he won\u2019t eat for hours if his favorite club, Barcelona, loses,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Mrs Gloria Ndubuisi, a lawyer and a mother of four, her husband watches football with so much passion as if his life depends on it.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning of our marriage, it caused lots of problems. Sometimes, when there\u2019s power outage, he would fuel the generator with a part of the children\u2019s school fees to watch a match and I will be bitter.\n\n\u201cThere was even a time he slapped our eldest daughter for changing the channel to Zee world. It was a horrible experience,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs Lynda Essien, a business woman and a mother of one, said her husband hates it when someone changes the channel while he\u2019s watching a football match.\n\n\u201cMy husband becomes moody when his favourite club, Manchester United, loses a match. But he comes around after some time,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Mrs Martha Orakwe, a teacher and a mother of six, her husband\u2019s weakest point is football.\n\n\u201cMy husband\u2019s Achilles heel is football. He is very collected and gentle but when it comes to football, I don\u2019t recognise him and get his attention anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nOrakwe said that her husband not only watches a football match on television but also listens to the commentaries on radio,even while driving.\n\n\u201cI remember a time my husband\u2019s favourite club Chelsea lost a match. He heard this from the commentary on radio and we almost had an accident that day,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs Funmi Adekunle, a businesswoman and mother of two, said that she had no choice but love football because of her husband\u2019s obsession for the game and to avoid conflict in her home.\n\n\u201cMy husband is more than a football lover. I decided to join him and be a football fan than to be fighting with him over the television remote,\u201d she said.\n\nAdekunle advised wives to give up the fight over the remote or channels and join their husbands to watch and love the game.\n\n\u201cFootball is a game that binds people together. It brings together different nations, tribes, colour, races, and even religion. This is the same game that will bring your family together.\u201d she advised.\n\nHowever, some men, in their reactions told NAN that watching football helped them ease their stress and temporarily makes them forget their daily challenges.\n\nMr Sola Adeleke, a civil servant, told NAN that most men watch football for excitement.\n\n\u201cAs a man, there are lots of challenges we face daily, but the thought of watching your club play brings excitement; I don\u2019t think men do this thing to spite their wives.\n\n\u201cA match either at home or at bar with a chill drink relaxes the body, I stopped following a particular club because of several failures from them, so these days I just enjoy quality football and rest,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Ikenna Ofem, told NAN that the battle for television remote when he is watching his favourite club play, made him buy a dual view decoder.\n\n\u201cWith this, I can be in my room to watch my favourite sport channels without disturbance, while the rest of the family watch their favourite channels in the living room.\n\n\u201cIt was expensive getting another TV and running the whole package but it was worth it, it was almost becoming a tug of war in my household,\u201d he said.

          "text": "The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has decried Nigeria\u2019s \u2018rapid descent\u2019 into strife, violence and lawlessness, noting that although it has been a supporter of President Muhammadu Buhari, it can no longer afford to tell him what he wants to hear.\n\nThe ACF in a statement by its secretary-general, Murtala Aliyu, asked the president to reprioritise his programmes and free more resources to end the pervasive insecurity in the country.\n\nThe group said over the past few months, the security crisis in Nigeria has been deepening and there is a dangerous escalation of violence and bloodshed.\n\n\u201cCriminal gangs, bandits, armed robbers, secessionist insurgents along with those that call themselves soldiers of so-called caliphate, have laid siege to Nigeria. More so in the northern states,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cAlthough we count ourselves amongst his ardent supporters and have always wished him well, Nigeria\u2019s rapid descent into strife, violence and lawlessness is getting to a point at which we can no longer afford to tell him only what he wants to hear.\n\n\u201cWe do need to tell the president what he also needs to hear. We simply are unable to find any courteous or less painful words to describe the feeling of utter frustration among the broad masses of Nigeria, especially in the North, arising from the ineffectual management of the security crises by the president.\n\n\u201cThe regime needs to reprioritise its programmes and free more resources needed to end the pervasive insecurity that is bringing the country to its knees. We have a duty to tell the president what he needs to hear, which is that the patience of Nigerians is not limitless.\u201d\n\nAliyu said the highly coordinated attack on the Kuje Prison in the Federal Capital (FCT), Abuja, and the mass escape of hardened criminals, many of whom are Boko Haram terrorists, have triggered an unprecedented wave of apprehension and panic among the long-suffering people, particularly of the North.\n\n\u201cComing around the time the advance convoy of Mr. President heading to Daura and long after the deadly attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train on 28th March, 2022, in which many people were killed and a lot more kidnapped, the question on the lips of the public, is how and when will these crises, which are unprecedented in severity, leave us?\n\n\u201cWe noted that the response of President Muhammadu Buhari to the Kuje Prison tragedy in particular was to offer the familiar cocktail of platitudes, of sermons, condemnations and yet more sermons. As usual, the president asked the security services to \u2018investigate\u2019 the outbreak and find out what led to it.\n\n\u201cPresumably, in the view of the president, that was all that he was expected or required to do in the circumstances.\u201d\n\nHe added that the president in his Sallah message promised to deal with the situation before the end of his tenure saying, \u201cAs long as the crisis remains unabating, Nigerians will justifiably conclude that the government is ineffective and needs to do more if they will ever be able to quell the crises.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably because President Buhari is unable or unwilling to hold his appointees responsible for any deterioration of the security situation and some other socioeconomic sectors under their watch, the vast amount of money and other resources being pumped into the security agencies have largely been ineffective.\n\n\u201cThe required boost in manpower and equipment, long recognized as the missing link in the current campaign, have remained largely unimplemented to the required level needed to secure the nation.\n\n\u201cIn other countries, the Kuje jail attack and similar ones that have happened in parts of Nigeria would have led to massive reshuffle, resignation and possibly prosecution of officials who were negligent, incompetent or plainly untrustworthy.\n\n\u201cNo person other than the president has both the mandate and responsibility to ensure that the government of Nigeria maintains peace, security, order and good governance. We demand that President Buhari braces up without further delay and rise to today\u2019s occasion,\u201d he stressed.",

He mentioned that the two states were nourished by the same waterways, and lived up to the same \u2018Omoluabi\u2019 standards and ideals.\n\n\u201dThis was what spurred my brother, Governor (Dr) Dapo Abiodun and I to, in 2021, establish the Lagos-Ogun Joint Development Commission, to collaborate on key areas of mutual benefits and development, and accelerate socio-economic growth for all our communities and our people,\u201d Mr Sanwo-Olu stressed.\n\nAccording to him, the road network linking Ijebu-Ode, Epe and Lekki is another \u201cconcrete manifestation of our collaboration.\u201d\n\n\u201dThis will open up new commercial and logistic opportunities in that axis, and positively impact the lives of our people.

          "text": "A former governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Prince Tonye Princewill, has resigned his membership of the party following the decision of the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, to pick another Muslim, as his running mate.\n\nHe is the second former governorship aspirant to resign his membership of the APC after a former member of the House of Representatives, Dr. Dawari George, had done same.\n\nHowever, George did not state his reasons for dumping the ruling party.\n\nPrincewill, in a letter dated July 12, 2022 and addressed to the APC chairman in Ward 3, Buguma City in Asari-Toru local government area of the State, said the decision of the party leadership to choose a Senator Kashim Shettima as presidential running-mate has set a very wrong precedent.\n\nThe letter reads in part: \u201cI can\u2019t argue for equity in my state and defend inequity in my country.\n\n\u201cWhile I appreciate my leader Rt. Hon. Rotimi Amaechi and all his efforts, I cannot defend the decision of my party, in fielding a Muslim Muslim ticket, especially at a time like this, against all protestations from well meaning Nigerians, across religious and political divides.\n\n\u201cIt sets a very wrong precedent, it is totally insensitive and even if you win, will prove bad for good governance. Under these dire circumstances, I find no justification to still remain, in good conscience, a member of a political party that subordinates electoral victory, over the safety of lives and the peace of mind of its citizens.\n\n\u201cThe men and women of our party here in Rivers are the most loyal and faithful supporters I have met. They know right and they know wrong. And they know me. I enjoyed working with them and I\u2019m so sad to leave. But an APC party that totally disregards the basics of the same equity we preach, is alien to me.\n\n\u201cBuhari resisted the same temptation and chose a little known Osinbajo and won. By doing this, Tinubu is saying that a Northern Christian has no electoral value. My staying means I agree.\n\n\u201cI wish you well. And I remain grateful to our Leader, but I can not defend the indefensible. And to be totally honest, neither should you.\u201d",

He has done more than anyone in contributing and supporting the operations of the Army and other security agencies in protecting the people of Borno state and by extension Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs a stakeholder and former Chairman Senate Committee on the Humanitarian Crisis in the North East, I\u2019m privy to the fact that Shettima attracted massive presence and intervention of international NGOs and donor countries to the humanitarian situation in Borno.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a member of the ruling party, but the truth is that other than issues of religion, he is better qualified in terms of competence than many who were paraded.\n\n\u201cReligion is a sensitive matter in Nigeria; other than that, Nigeria\u2019s most important challenge is security, Shettima\u2019s experience can be useful and is very much needed.\u201d",

          "text": "Mixed reactions have continued to trail the choice of Borno state Governor Kassim Shettima as the running mate to the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nWhile some notable leaders applauded the choice, some Christian leaders threatened not to back the duo during the 2023 general elections.\n\nAnnouncing the choice of the serving lawmaker, Sunday, Asiwaju Tinubu said the former governor remains the best person that could help him achieve good governance for Nigerians.\n\nTinubu had said the former governor \u201cis the man who can help me bring the best governance to all Nigerians, period, regardless of their religious affiliation or considerations of ethnicity or region.\n\n\u201cMay I say this to all of you, especially to those who will be disappointed in my selection based on religious considerations. I will not and cannot ignore the religious concerns and ethnic sensitivities of our people. Taking them into due consideration is an important part of good and able governance.\n\n\u201cBut religion, ethnicity and region cannot always and fully determine our path. To forge ahead as a nation toward development and prosperity, we must break free of old binds. We must recalibrate our political calculations to where competence and fairness matter more than reductive demographics.\u201d\n\nBoost for Shettima\n\nExpressing support for Shettima\u2019s choice, Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan and the APC North East caucus described it as excellent.\n\nThey made the commendation in a statement by chairman of the caucus, Senator Lawan in Abuja Monday.\n\nShettima, the caucus added, is the right man for the job.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cOn behalf of myself and the North East Caucus of our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), I heartily congratulate His Excellency, Senator Kashim Ibrahim Shettima, on his nomination as the running mate to our presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, for the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Tinubu and our party have made an excellent choice in Senator Shettima. The former two-term Governor of Borno State entered public service with impeccable credentials, which he has burnished by demonstrating great competence, integrity and courage in all the positions that he has held.\n\n\u201cHis background in academics and the private sector prepared him for the achievements that he has recorded in politics as Governor and since his election to the Senate in 2019.\n\n\u201cA loyal and committed member of our party, Senator Shettima has what it takes to be an excellent running mate to our flag bearer, and insha Allah, the Vice President of Federal Republic of Nigeria from next year.\n\n\u201cWe of the North East Caucus of the APC attest that Senator Kashim Ibrahim Shettima is the right man for the job and that he will be an able and loyal lieutenant to our incoming President, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, insha Allah.\n\n\u201cWe as a Caucus pledge our full cooperation and support to our candidates as we march again towards another resounding victory in the general elections.\n\n\u201cWe enjoin all members of our party across Nigeria too to give the APC Standard bearer and his running mate their utmost support.\n\n\u201cWe also assure Nigerians that the choices that our party has made in our presidential ticket are for the best of our country.\u201d\n\nYouth forum\n\nSimilarly, the APC Youth Stakeholders Forum lauded the choice of the former Borno state governor, describing him as the right man for the job.\n\nA statement by chairman of the group, Abdulazeez Abubakar Kaka, said his pedigree in the financial sector and governance generally qualified him for the job.\n\n\u201cThe nomination of Senator Kashim Shettima by the APC Presidential flag bearer, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu clearly demonstrates, once again, H E Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu\u2019s strength in selecting competent people for key positions in governance.\n\n\u201cIt has proven Asiwaju\u2019s focus for effective service delivery and has also provided an insight into what a government run by Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu would be.\n\n\u201cSenator Kashim Shettima, a former two-term Governor and former Chairman of Northern Governors Forum, is an expert in economics, finance and banking with records of ensuring development strides in difficult terrains. In what can be described as a similarity in thinking, he chose a competent Prof. Babagana Zulum to be his successor. This is a very rare succession formula that has been widely praised with dividends of democracy continuously witnessed by the People of Borno State and beyond.\n\n\u201cWe wish to clearly state that this nomination has given us added confidence for success in the forthcoming 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cWhile we also congratulate our Party Members, we urge Nigerians to rally round this most suitable combination of Presidential and Vice Presidential Candidates who are way above the rest and poised to steer Nigeria out of its challenges and ensuring further holistic development of our Nation,\u201d they said.\n\nThe professionals\n\nAlso, another group of APC stakeholders \u2013 the Professionals Forum \u2013 lauded the Muslim-Muslim ticket of Tinubu and Shettima.\n\nIn a statement Monday in Abuja by the acting chairman, Board of Trustees of the forum, Nkem Okeke, they said the choice was in line with the Forum\u2019s objective of dedication to promoting professionalism, competence, and good governance in politics.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe APC Professionals Forum congratulates Senator Kashim Shettima on his nomination as the Vice Presidential Candidate of our great party. The APC Professionals Forum, dedicated to promoting professionalism, competence, and good governance in politics, welcomes your choice as a statement of good intentions for our dear nation.\n\n\u201cSenator Kashim Shettim is a patriotic, loyal, experienced, competent and team player with the capacity to add value to the upward trajectory of any progressive government. His experiences as an academic, banker and public servant will be an added advantage in our collective quest as professionals within the APC to advocate for round pegs in round holes and sustainable deliverance of good governance to the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the Forum congratulates His Excellency Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for choosing a competent and visionary running mate to complement his capacity as our next President in 2023.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, the Forum will galvanise all professionals to support this team for a resounding victory in the forthcoming elections. The Forum wishes our party\u2019s Presidential and Vice Presidential Candidates victory in the coming general elections.\u201d\n\nBishop kicks\n\nHowever, the Anglican Bishop of Calabar, Prof Nneoyi Egbe, said the APC Muslim/Muslim ticket was a direct attack on Nigeria\u2019s secularity and that proponents were telling everyone about the degree of injustice they would perpetrate when given political power.\n\nProf Egbe said this in Calabar Monday during the 2nd Session of the Eleventh Synod of the Diocese.\n\n\u201cWe absolutely do not, will not and cannot accept a Muslim/Muslim or Christian/Christian ticket. Nigeria\u2019s secularity must be respected by our leaders. As I said earlier, Nigeria is a secular State, everybody must have a sense of belonging, we must understand that this country belongs to all of us.\n\n\u201cWe all know that we are already polarized along religious and ethnic lines, and with the way the country is, you now bring Muslim/Muslim ticket. With this, you are already telling us that you want to operate on the platform of injustice.\n\n\u201cThat is why we will not accept it. When I say \u2018we\u2019, I, as a Bishop of a Church of God, I am an institution. When I say \u2018we\u2019, I mean myself, my entire lineage and all the people I represent, whatever that means to you, I say again, we will not accept it,\u201d he declared with a tone of finality.\n\nThe lecturer-cum-Church leader also expressed disappointment over the high rate of insecurity which had claimed lives of many Nigerians, and therefore advised the federal government to urgently make provision for the establishment of State Police which, he believed, is the solution to ravaging security challenges.\n\n\u201cPeople cannot travel freely across the country any longer. Even within cities, no one is guaranteed safety. People are being killed, kidnapped for ransom, harassed and traumatised.\n\n\u201cIn saner climes, this government would have resigned en masse but Nigeria is a place where the law applies to some and not others.\n\n\u201cWe need State Police. Denying Nigerians this is evidence of the government\u2019s insincerity in securing the Nigerian environment against elements that are pursuing their evil agenda,\u201d Bishop Egbe stated.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General/ CEO, National Metallurgical Development Center, NMDC, Jos, Engr. Prof. Linus Asuquo has said that research and development should be given priority if the nation was bent on achieving its goals on economic diversification.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen in an interview granted in Abuja, Asuquo noted that capacity building interms of training and retraining of human capacity was important for the growth and development of the economy.\n\nHe said that at the NMDC, there was need to renovate some of the structures to give it a conducive emblem for research and development and such efforts been put in place has ensured its effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nHe explained \u201cOn capacity building in terms of human capacity building, we have done enough to train our people for research and development, we need to train and retrain, we have done that locally and internationally, we have sent some of our staff to Australia, Japan and to South Africa for training, the essence of that is that our research and development must be productive. If you lack in training you can not go forward, and the people have stayed there for many years without adequate training, so they have now been trained.\n\n\u201cIf we are to go forward in this country for research and development, that is where our priority should be, if we really want to develop in this country. If we want to diversify our economy, we can not diversify without meaningful research and Development as a lot of research has to be done for us to go forward.\u201d\n\nThe NMDC boss who was appointed in July 2018 disclosed that the inability to analyze the materials used for building projects was one of the factors contributing to building collapse in the country.\n\nHe said that individuals and construction companies used scrap metal to produce metals without allowing NMDC to effectively carry out their job.\n\nIn his words:\u201dWe have to analyze even though we have SON, but we are the ones to analyze the type of materials , whether they are fit for building or not. So that has also been a challenge for NMDC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the development of the Centre, he continued \u201cbecause I found out that the security of that place was very poor and incident of thefts was almost on a weekly basis; so I had to beef up security of the place by contacting security personnel, the Police, the SSS, and the Civil Defence and they were ready to cooperate and since then, the theft incident reduced to the nearest minimum.\u201d\n\nHe stated that there was need to restructure the management for effective and efficient running of the Centre, hence the restructuring of departments from nine to seven and placing the right people in the right places and this he confirmed has yielded dividends.\n\nAsuquo also said \u201cwith the very poor power supply in the country and for any meaningful research, power was necessary and there was no power. We were going with a small generator and we could not do any effective research, so I had to find an alternative power source by solar system so we had to install the solar system in all the laboratories for effective analysis and now people can analyse using our equipment.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the core mandate of the Metallurgical Center, the Director General, further explained \u201cstarting with exploration, let me say that in this country we have identified 44 strategic minerals in the country, in 500 locations and therefore, for us to be effective we have to analyze, NMDC has to work on mineral processing and then in the metal sector, we have to know the type of minerals we have in the country, the compositions, and so forth. So that was a challenge for us to have a laboratory ready.\n\n\u201cBut this place was established as far back as 1973, as a research laboratory for the then steel plant , so you believe that from 1973 till the time I came, the equipment were very obsolete, some of them were not useful again, therefore there was need to find the state of the art equipment to do meaningful research and we were able to procure state of the art equipment for research and Development.\n\n\u201cAnd am pleased to inform you that right now, NMDC, even though not sufficient because the recent development is capital intensive, we now have the state of the art equipment to analyze these minerals that we have: apart from that, we also have the methodology department for some analysis.\n\n\u201cNigeria has iron ore in Itakpe, which is of very high iron concentration but this was meant for Delta State Company because it has about 250 millions turns of iron but we have another iron ore in Akpaja about three billion turns that will take so many years, no research has been done on it to find whether is suitable or not , that is our own work in NMDC, to find out whether the Akpaja iron ore will be suitable, of course is suitable, I worked on that in 1990/ 1991, to find out ways that Akpaja iron ore could be used for our Steel plant by selective calculation which we have to use cassava starch to make flux sarage, even though it has some phosphorus, it\u2019s not a problem because that can be dephosphorised during the processing.\u201d\n\nOn coal, Asuquo revealed that, \u201cone of the materials that we use for iron making is Coal and a lot of work has been done in NMDC about coal and unfortunately most of our coal, even though we have in abundance like Enugu coal, they are not prime coating coal, that is you cannot have real coal, hundred percent coke from that coal, so what we have done in our research is to use the lavia Obi coal and blend with the imported coal to form our coke, that will reduce the cost of production, importation and thus, foreign exchange will be reserved. We have also worked sufficiently on our coal.\n\n\u201cJust last week, we have acquired scanning electron microscope which is the state of the art equipment for metal and mineral processing and two people had to come from UK to train our staff, which was a human capacity training. We trained about ten people which will be enough to train others in the place on how to use this.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development for its intervention in the development of the Centre which includes renovation of seven of its buildings, procurement of equipment such as the scanning electron microscope and a lapping polishing machine adding that \u201csome teams are coming from South Africa to train our staff on this lapping polishing machine. With such capacity building, we are set to do meaningful research and Development compared to what we saw before.\u201d\n\nOn the challenges confronted so far, the DG said \u201cthere are lots of changes, research and Development is capital intensive in any country, by the grace of God I have been able to in my span of sixty eight years to travel to more than fifty six countries of the world and I have seen that research and Development is capital intensive, the whole world is putting attention in research and Development, people are budgeting between three to four percent GDP for research and Development and I want to thank Mr. President because recently, he increase form zero point one to zero point five but that is still very inadequate.\u201d\n\nProjecting into the coming years, in the steel sector, Engr. Asuquo said: \u201cLike I said, if we have adequate funding and we pay attention to what we are doing, given priority we should be expecting development in the country. Let me say this, as I have repeated many times, we should not play with the Ajaokuta Steel company. A lot of politics has been toiling with it over the years, if you know the quntoms of metals imported into this country, then you know where we are. We are spending some billions of naira to important metals, now considering the railways we are constructing, if we have Ajaokuta Steel company working, I don\u2019t think we should have been importing these metals , we would have reserved our economy, we would have created more employment for our youths, there would be skill acquisition and so on, the benefits are numerous.\n\n\u201cSo, if we start doing research and development and the Ajaokuta Steel Company is working, there will be development, without Ajaokuta working, then we are just playing lip service. Also there must be a political will in this country for us to say this is our priority.\u201d\n\nReacting to the claim that the Ajaokuta Steel Company was outdated, he said, \u201cpeople who say that are not informed, if you do a lot of research, you will know that Russia cannot do without blast furnace, even Indian cannot do without blast furnace. I was in India in the year 2000 and they were producing hundred million tonnes of steel in that year and that was the method were they using there. We just seat down at home here and criticize that our Ajaokuta Steel Company is outdated.\n\n\u201cWhat are the new methods that can be used in the production of Iron and Steel except the blast furnace, a lot of people are saying nobody is using coal, Russia is using coal, China is using coal, so what are we talking about? Everyone wants to be an engineer now, Nigerians like to talk but when it comes to practical terms to proffer solutions they go silent.\n\n\u201cAny person that have seen the amount of money spent in Ajaokuta, to scrap that place will be a colossal waste, and suicidal. Even if it\u2019s outdated, we can modernize it into sections; that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Ajaokuta Steel Company. Starting from the blast furnace, where they will produce iron , after that you produce steel, from Steel, you have a continuous casting, where you produce rods.\u201d\n\nHe further added \u201cDid you know you can generate power from the Ajaokuta Steel Company to so many States , we should not just start at once, we can think big and start small.\u201d\n\nOn NMDC\u2019s collaboration with other MDA\u2019s for wealth creation, Asuquo further stated that in December 2020, it had collaborated with Defence Industry Corporation of Nigeria, DICON and has also signed an MOU with NASENI.\n\n\u201cDICON was importing armaments from China and I wrote to them that we have that capacity to produce their raw materials, instead of importing brass from China, we could produce for them, the DG visited us twice with his team and was excited with what he saw and what we were doing, and then sent a technician team to us to evaluate and the MOU was signed on December 3rd, 2020, to produce the raw materials for them, if such a thing is implemented, I can tell you that I may not need money from government because the billions they were using in importing, if they give that to us it will be sufficient for our research and development. We can generate enough revenue when we collaborate with these organisations, recently, we have signed an MOU with NASENI to collaborate to generate revenue, the Executive Vice Chairman came with his team and we are working with them on some meaningful research. Before you talk about generating revenue, something has to be done before generating revenue which is to equip the place.\u201d",

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T.

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

About three weeks ago, Eroton confirmed an oil spill incident at Cawthorne channel wellhead 15 which was also attributed to a \u201cthird-party interference\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs was the case with the earlier reported incident, this recent spill also occurred in the Cawthorne Channel field, wellhead 047 Long string (CAWC047L),\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe CAWC-047 wild oil spill was observed in the morning hours of Sunday, July 10, 2022.\n\n\u201cCAWC047L/S is a dual string well. The Long String arm was shut-in in April 2020 due to flowline vandalisation and in July 2020, the Short String arm was also shut-in for the same reasons. A distant look at the well shows the absence of some wellhead valves on the body of the XMAS Tree.\u201d\n\nMax-Ebibai went on to add that the spill \u201cwas observed at about 0745hrs coming from the wing valve arm of the CAWC047L, which appears to have been vandalised with the valves, control panels, bean-box, actuators all carted away\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe well was observed to be releasing the uncontrolled flow of hydrocarbon to the environment from the long string due to the confirmed compromised and vandalised XMAS Tree containment valves of the wellhead,\u201d she said.\n\nThe company\u2019s spokesman also said that in spite of the high-pressure spill, the Eroton emergency team was working to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.\n\nCawthorne Channel field is one of the production channels on OML 18 situated in eastern Niger Delta, south of Port-Harcourt on behalf of the Eroton/NNPC joint venture.",

          "text": "Former British equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, has launched a bid to become the next prime minister of the United Kingdom and leader of the Conservative Party, a declaration that has continued to attract public endorsements.\n\nMs Badenoch, who was born Olukemi Olufunto in Wimbledon, London to parents of Nigerian origin, joined the race to succeed scandal-dogged Prime Minister Boris Johnson as Conservative leader on Saturday.\n\nShe was one of the nearly 60 members of parliament and aides who quit last week after Johnson apologised for appointing a senior colleague facing sexual assault claims to a prominent role.\n\nThe UK prime minister was last forced to resign, although he said he would stay in office until his successor was appointed.\n\nWhile announcing her bid for the UK\u2019s top job in an article published in The Times newspaper, 42-year-old Badenoch and MP for Saffron Walden called for change, saying the British public was \u201cexhausted by platitudes and empty rhetoric\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting myself forward in this leadership election because I want to tell the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth that will set us free.\n\n\u201cWithout change the Conservative Party, Britain and the western world will continue to drift\u201d and rivals will \u201coutpace us economically and outmanoeuvre us internationally.\u201d\n\nBadenoch is in the race to become the next UK prime minister alongside Rishi Sunak, former chancellor; Sajid Javid, former health secretary; Ben Wallace, defence secretary; and Jeremy Hunt, former foreign secretary, among several others.\n\nChains Of Support\n\nHer declaration has attracted a number of public endorsements, including by some members of the British parliament such as Neil O\u2019Brien, MP for Harborough; Michael Gove, MP for Surrey Heath; and Gareth Bacon, MP for Orpington.\n\nAs a campaigner, focused on getting colleagues re-elected I know how the Westminster bubble is so detached from voters \u2013 @KemiBadenoch will smash through this disconnect and deliver on what ordinary people want. This is how we renew as Party and win the next General Election \u2014 Justin Tomlinson MP (@JustinTomlinson) July 9, 2022\n\nI\u2019m backing @KemiBadenoch because she\u2019s brave, she stands up for common sense regardless of the flak she gets from the left (who can\u2019t work out what to do about her \ud83e\udd2f) and she demonstrates the principled, consistent values that our country needs\u2026 #KB4PM https://t.co/tY9Wr6B0kI \u2014 Cllr Ben Bradley MP (@BBradley_Mans) July 9, 2022\n\nI am backing @KemiBadenoch to lead our party and our country.

As youths, you retain the hope and future of Osun State and Nigeria at large when you support the democratic process.\n\n\u201cYour willingness to vote even during times of heightened insecurity, reflects the acceptance of democracy as the most appropriate form of governance for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that the contestants in the elections are running robust campaigns. These pre-election activities have at several times been characterised by vile comments, politics of blame, heated debates, and allegations of political thuggery.\n\n\u201cElections should and must be devoid of utterances which stir up hate and instigate violent acts, monetisation of the process but rather follow the rudiments of democracy, which is the rule of law and acknowledging the rights of every citizen.\n\n\u201cAs such, we have continued in our engagements with the candidates and political parties, to reiterate and call on them to ensure they conduct themselves with civility and patriotism, adhering to due process and not self-help. We urge that contestants approach the elections in a true spirit of sportsmanship.\n\n\u201cThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)\u2013the elections ombudsman, security agencies and other government agencies that facilitate the conduct of the electoral process should do so with transparency, particularly because the entire nation and the world is watching.\n\n\u201cAll contestants \u2013 irrespective of their political platform, should be treated with fairness and equity. We call on INEC and the security agencies to ensure inclusivity, facilitating an electoral exercise where the electorate are not disenfranchised because of gender, religious beliefs, ethnic affiliation, or disability.\n\n\u201cIt is important that public trust in the process is continually built and reinforced through free, credible and transparent elections in the state. We particularly urge that appropriate procedures are implemented to ensure the unhealthy and seemingly pervasive practise of voter inducement, commonly called \u201cvote-buying\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe law in all its capacity and requirements should be applied to those involved in such a criminal act, both the buyer and seller.\n\n\u201cFinally, we call on all other stakeholders in the traditional institutions, media, and civil society to be alert to their responsibilities as envoys of our democratic values which are the means to attaining good governance, resulting in our collective growth and development.\n\n\u201cWe believe that at the end of the contest, when the results are announced, all stakeholders will participate in the responsibility of governance, because the values and goals of democratic governance are not a zero-sum game. By such actions, Osun State will witness peace and harmony, and the dividends of democracy,\u201d the communique partly read.\n\nGeneral Abubakar on behalf of the NPC, announced that a peace accord will be signed by the various political parties and stakeholders on 13th July 2022, in Osogbo, Osun State.",

          "title": "Over 13m Nigerians Hold Cryptocurrencies, Says UN Report",
          "text": "No fewer than 13 million Nigerians are in possession of digital assets, as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has rated the West African country third among countries with the highest number of cryptocurrency holders in Africa.\n\nLatest data from the UN agency\u2019s policy brief indicated that the country was trailing Kenya and South Africa, with about 6.3 per cent of the Nigerian population owning or holding cryptocurrencies.\n\nFrom the country\u2019s estimated population of 211 million inhabitants, this meant that a little over 13 million were owners of digital currencies in 2021.\n\nThe UNCTAD policy brief put Kenya ahead of Nigeria and South Africa with the highest proportion of crypto-owning inhabitants than any other African country.\n\nKenya\u2019s digital currency ownership of 8.5 per cent as a share of the population was the highest in Africa and the fifth-highest globally.\n\nOnly Ukraine with 12.7 per cent), Russia (11.9 per cent), Venezuela (10.3 per cent), and Singapore (9.4 per cent) have a higher proportion of crypto-owning residents than Kenya globally.\n\nSouth Africa was the second-ranked country in Africa and eighth globally, with 7.1 per cent of the population that owned or held cryptocurrencies in 2021.\n\nAlthough the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) restriction on banks to allow trading in crypto currency subsist, Nigeria is currently one of the biggest cryptocurrency markets globally.\n\nSix Nigerian banks were in April reportedly fined N1.315 billion by the CBN in the 2021 financial year for failing to comply with the apex bank\u2019s directive prohibiting their customers from trading in cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently released guidelines on the liberalisation of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nOut of the 20 countries that were surveyed by UNCTAD in the latest policy brief, Australia was found to have the least percentage of its population (3.4 per cent) that owned cryptocurrency in the said period.\n\nUNCTAD acknowledged that cryptocurrencies have grown in their popularity because they are, \u201can attractive channel through which to send remittances.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations agency also revealed that it found that middle-income individuals from inflation-hit developing countries own or hold cryptocurrencies because they are seen, \u201cas a way to protect household savings.\u201d\n\nHowever, based on its findings, the UNCTAD stated that it determined that, \u201cthe use of cryptocurrencies may lead to financial instability risks,\u201d adding that their use potentially opens \u201ca new channel for illicit financial flows.\u201d\n\nThe UNCTAD policy brief added: \u201cFinally, if left unchecked, cryptocurrencies may become a widespread means of payment and even replace domestic currencies unofficially (a process called cryptoisation), which could jeopardise the monetary sovereignty of countries.\n\n\u201cThe use of stablecoins poses the greatest risks in developing countries with unmet demand for reserve currencies.\u201d\n\nTo minimise some of these risks, UNCTAD recommended the imposition of taxes that discourages crypto trading, including \u201cthe mandatory registration of crypto-exchanges and digital wallets.\u201d\n\nThe agency also recommended imposing, \u201centry fees for crypto-exchanges\u201d or levying taxes on cryptocurrency trading.\n\nDoing this, it stated, would make the use of cryptocurrencies less attractive, even as he prescribed the restriction of cryptocurrency advertisements and the issuing of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nMeanwhile, the value of global trade rose to a record $7.7 trillion in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, an increase of about $1 trillion in the corresponding period of 2021, a report by the UNCTAD has stated.\n\nThe just-released UNCTAD Global Trade Update revealed that the growth, which represents a rise of about $250 million relative to Q4 2021, was fuelled by rising commodity prices, as trade volumes have increased to a much lower extent.\n\nAccording to the report, although expected to remain positive, trade growth has continued to slow during Q2 2022.\n\n\u201cThe war in Ukraine is starting to influence international trade, largely through increases in prices,\u201d the report noted.\n\nIt affirmed that rising interest rates and the winding down of economic stimulus packages would likely have a negative impact on trade volumes for the rest of 2022, even as volatility in commodity prices and geopolitical factors would also continue to make trade developments uncertain.\n\nThe report stressed that trade growth rates in Q1 2022 remained strong across all geographic regions, although somewhat lower in the East Asia and Pacific regions.\n\nExport growth has been generally stronger in commodity-exporting regions, as commodity prices have increased.\n\nTrade in merchandise goods reached about $6.1 trillion, an increase of about 25 per cent relative to Q1 2021, and a jump of about 3.6 per cent when compared to to Q4 2021.\n\nThe value of merchandise exports from developing countries was about 25 per cent higher in Q1 2022 than in Q1 2021.\n\nIn comparison, the figure is about 14 per cent for developed countries.\n\nMerchandise trade between developing countries also strongly grew during Q1 2022\n\nTrade in services grew to about $1.6 trillion, an increase of about 22 per cent relative to Q1 2021, and a rise of about 1.7 per cent relative to Q4 2021.\n\nThe report showed that most economic sectors recorded substantial year-over-year increases in the value of their trade in Q1 2022.\n\nHigh fuel prices were behind the strong increase in the value of trade in the energy sector, it noted.\n\nTrade growth was also above average for metals and chemicals.\n\nBy contrast, trade in the transportation sector and in communication equipment has remained below the levels of 2021 and 2019.\n\nThe report stated that the evolution of world trade for the remainder of 2022 was likely to be affected by slower-than-expected economic growth due to rising interest rates, inflationary pressures and concerns over debt sustainability in many economies.\n\nThe report pointed out that the war in Ukraine was affecting international trade by putting further upward pressure on the international prices of energy and primary commodities.\n\nIn the short term, because of the inelastic global demand for food and energy products, rising food and energy prices would likely result in higher trade values, and marginally lower trade volumes.\n\nOther factors expected to influence global trade this year are continuing challenges for global supply chains, regionalisation trends and policies supporting the transition towards a greener global economy.\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",

          "text": "Europe\u2019s growing pressure on Nigeria and a handful of other African countries to produce more gas for export, while declining to fund such projects citing carbon emission reasons has hypocrisy written all over it.\n\nThis is according to a Bloomberg treatise which sampled various opinions on the matter.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nNigeria has three per cent of the world\u2019s proven gas reserves, yet has tapped almost none of it, the report said, noting that like most African countries, what has been extracted is mostly sent to Europe, which now wants to import even more to make up for supplies lost to Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nItaly, for instance, has struck fresh deals to buy gas from Angola and the Republic of Congo, while Germany has been looking to secure supplies from Senegal.\n\nBut that\u2019s despite discouraging the use of gas and other fossil fuels around the world in pursuit of global climate goals, a case some European leaders made at the United Nations\u2019 COP26 conference in Glasgow last November.\n\nWhile African leaders are eager for the millions in revenue that the gas deals are likely to bring in, they\u2019re also calling out the sudden interest in their resources as a double standard that perpetuates the West\u2019s exploitation of the region, the report hinted.\n\nThey question why Africa must move away from dirty fuels \u2014 thereby delaying access for hundreds of millions of people to electricity \u2014 even as its gas is used to keep the lights on in Europe.\n\n\u201cRich countries have been reluctant to fund pipelines and power plants that would facilitate the use of gas in Africa because of its emissions, yet haven\u2019t delivered on promises to help finance green projects that could be an alternative source of energy.\n\n\u201cEurope\u2019s awkward position was on display at the Group of Seven leaders summit last month. The world\u2019s most advanced economies walked back a climate commitment to halt financing for overseas fossil fuel projects, but indicated that exceptions would likely apply to projects that would allow for more shipments of LNG to their countries.\n\n\u201cIn another climb-down, European Union lawmakers recently voted to classify gas and nuclear energy projects within the bloc as \u2018green investments\u2019, potentially opening up billions of euros in fresh funding,\u201d it added.\n\nIt noted that that approach has irked African leaders who need fuel to lift millions out of poverty.\n\n\u201cWe need long-term partnership, not inconsistency and contradiction on green energy policy from the UK and European Union,\u201d it quoted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, as saying in written comments.\n\n\u201cIt does not help their energy security, it does not help Nigeria\u2019s economy, and it does not help the environment. It is a hypocrisy that must end,\u201d Buhari added.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, sub-Saharan African governments share the blame for their underutilised gas reserves. Few countries have seriously invested in or reformed their power or oil and gas sectors, particularly Nigeria, where the Bonny Island plant has run at least 20 per cent below capacity since 2021 because of pipeline theft and vandalism.\n\n\u201cMany African leaders support boosting gas exports to help their cash-strapped governments, but they also want access to financing that would allow them to harness the fuel\u2019s potential to create domestic natural gas market,\u201d it stressed.\n\n\u201cThey cannot just come and say, \u2018We need your gas, I\u2019ll buy your gas and we\u2019ll take it to Europe,\u2019\u201d Gabriel Obiang Lima, Energy Minister of Equatorial Guinea,was quoted to have said at a press conference in May. \u201cThey need to give something back to us,\u201d he added.\n\nGas has long been controversial from a climate perspective: it burns cleaner than other fossil fuels but still generates carbon pollution and tends to leak the super-warming greenhouse gas methane.\n\nEurope\u2019s own stance on the fuel has shifted since the war began. Its top priority now is to buy up as much LNG as it can get its hands on, while countries including Germany, Austria and the Netherlands have turned to coal as a backup.\n\n\u201cThe whole of the West developed on the back of fossil fuels \u2014 even as we speak some Western nations are deciding to bring coal back into their energy mix because of the war.\n\n\u201cSo when the world wants to transition to zero carbon emissions, who has to do more?\u201d said Matthew Opoku Prempeh, Energy Minister for Ghana, which has in the past few years made significant oil and gas discoveries. \u201cIs the West saying Africa should remain undeveloped?\u201d he added.\n\nThe African continent\u2019s share of historical global emissions would only rise to 3.5 per cent from 3 per cent even if it tapped every molecule of its known gas reserves. Universal energy access on the continent could be achieved by 2030 with $25 billion a year in investment \u2014 the equivalent of just 1 per cent of the money pouring into the energy sector globally.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s a dearth of new funding for power plants to burn gas within Africa. Governments and businesses have $100 billion in planned projects, including 35 gigawatts of gas-powered electricity, but can\u2019t find the money to build most of them.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report",

          "title": "Buhari \u2018Eager\u2019 to Leave Office, Urges University Lecturers to End Strike",
          "text": "With about 10 months to the end of his second term tenure, President Muhammadu Buhari om Monday said he was eager to leave office and retire to his home town, Daura in Katsina State.\n\nThis was just as the president called on the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to reconsider their position on the prolonged strike, expressing worry that the hiatus would have generational consequences on families, the educational system and future development of the country.\n\nThe president, who received some governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC), legislators and political leaders at his residence in Daura, said the strike by the university lecturers had already taken a toll on the psychology of parents, students and other stakeholders, throwing up many moral issues that already beg for attention.\n\nBuhari, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said: \u201cI am eager to go. I can tell you it has been tough. I am grateful to God that people appreciate the personal sacrifices we have been making.\n\n\u201cBy this time next year, I would have made the most out of the two terms, and the remaining months I will do my best,\u201d the president noted.\n\nBuhari urged those in political positions and places of privilege to be mindful in helping the many Nigerians that were looking for opportunities.\n\n\u201cIf you are greedy, you won\u2019t look around to see what is happening with those who are less endowed,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president told the governors and political leaders that he had not been to his house in Daura for close to a year due to the demands of office.\n\n\u201cThe observation that I abandoned my base was made by the Emir of Daura, Dr. Faruk Umar Faruk, at the eid prayer ground. He held the microphone and told everyone that the last time I was in Daura was during the Eid-el-Kabir of 2021,\u201d he added.\n\nBuhari said he would retire to Daura, not Kaduna, where he has a better house.\n\n\u201cIn ten to eleven months time, I will come here. I have a better house in Kaduna, but it is too close to Abuja,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSpeaking further on the ASUU strike, he said the future of the country rests on the quality of educational institutions and education, while assuring that the government understands their position, and that negotiations should continue, with students in the lecture halls.\n\n\u201cWe hope that ASUU will sympathise with the people on the prolonged strike. Truly, enough is enough for keeping students at home. Don\u2019t hurt the next generation for goodness sake,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president called on all well-meaning Nigerians, particularly those close to the leaders and members of the association, to intervene in persuading the lecturers to reconsider their position, and the ripple effect on an entire generation and the nation.\n\nBuhari said students from Nigerian universities would be faced with the challenge of competing with others in a highly connected and technology-driven work space, and keeping them at home only deprives them of time, skill and opportunities to be relevant on the global stage.\n\n\u201cColonial type education was geared towards producing workers in government. Those jobs are no longer there. Our young people should get education to prepare them for self-employment. Now education is for the sake of education.\n\n\u201cThrough technology we are much more efficient. We should encourage our children to get education, not only to look for government jobs,\u201d he added.\n\nFurthermore, Buhari said resources should be channeled more into building infrastructure and operations of the health and educational sector, not to expand the bureaucracy to create job opportunities.\n\nThe president explained that the schedule of work was much, saying he recently had to sympathise with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyema, who had to be away most of the time from his family.\n\nBuhari urged the APC stalwarts to keep working for the good of the people and the country, noting that, \u201cwe are a lucky people, and we need to reflect more on where we are coming from.\u201d\n\nThe president said relative to the resources available and compared to the last administration, the government had done well in many areas, particularly in infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI wish the person who is coming after me the very best,\u201d he said.\n\nOn security, the president said the north-west had posed more challenges, and some success had been recorded in other regions such as the north-east and the south-south.\n\nBuhari advised some of those from the south-south to stop hurting national assets, which also affect their livelihood.\n\nIn his remarks at the meeting, the Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, thanked the president for his leadership roles in improving the economy of the nation and the many successes recorded at the APC, which include two conventions to produce the party leadership and the presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cWe will work hard to ensure the success of our party. We have reasons to work very hard,\u201d he added.\n\nBagudu, who is the Governor of Kebbi State, said the favorable seasons supported the vision of ensuring food production and making agriculture a priority, with clear results in rice pyramids in various states.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the attacks by the renegades, our country remains self-sufficient in food production. We have seen investments that were not there before you came into power.\n\n\u201cNot less than 20 states now have agriculture process zones. We have rice pyramid in Ekiti, Gombe and Niger, while maize pyramids were revived in Katsina and Kano states,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said more than 54 rice meals were commissioned in various states, and 57 fertiliser plants were revived, or built afresh.\n\n\u201cAll these were achieved because of your commitment and patriotism,\u201d the governor told the President.\n\nBagudu also appreciated the president for providing ease of access to governors and political leaders, noting that the opening of the National Economic Council for more fluid exchange of ideas greatly helped in improving the economy.\n\nAPC Governors at the lunch with the president included: Katsina State, Aminu Bello Masari; Kaduna State, Malam Nasir el-Rufai; Imo State, Hope Uzodinma; Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Sule; Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello; Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje; Ekiti State, Dr. Fayemi Kayode; Plateau State, Simon Lalong, and Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Francis Sardauna in Katsina",

          "title": "Elon Musk Laughs Off Twitter Lawsuit Threat",
          "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s silence over his attempt to bail out on purchasing Twitter for $44 billion is no more.\n\nThe world\u2019s richest man went on the social media platform he claims he is no longer trying to buy and fired off a series of tweets suggesting he was gearing up for the legal battle his withdrawal from the sale was expected to spur.\n\nOne tweet contained a four-picture frame meme of him laughing, next to sentences reading: \u201cThey said I couldn\u2019t buy Twitter. Then they wouldn\u2019t disclose bot info. Now they want to force me to buy Twitter in court. Now they have to disclose bot info in court.\u201d\n\nAnother tweet was a picture of the actor Chuck Norris sitting at a chessboard with his chin resting atop his folding hands. A reply to that tweet read \u201cChuckmate\u201d \u2013 a clear pun for \u201ccheckmate\u201d.\n\nThe tweets, from Musk\u2019s verified account, served as his first comments on his legal team\u2019s Friday disclosure that he intends to nix his takeover of Twitter, which the network first resisted but then warmed up to.\n\nTwitter announced in late April that it would sell to Musk, but on Friday, lawyers for Musk publicly filed notice that he wanted out of the agreement, arguing among other things that the platform had failed to provide promised information on fake and spam accounts \u2013 so-called bots.\n\nAccording to UK-based The Guardian, the maneuver set off a firestorm of reactions, including from Donald Trump, who called Musk a \u201cbullshit artist\u201d and his deal to buy Twitter \u201crotten\u201d while the former president stumped for Republican political candidates in Alaska over the weekend.\n\nThe move also seemingly leaves Musk destined for a lengthy fight with Twitter in court. Notably, Twitter\u2019s chairperson, Bret Taylor, said his company was ready to sue Musk in a Delaware state court to enforce the purchase deal it had struck.\n\nThe agreement contained a provision that may compel Musk to go through with buying Twitter as long as he had the financing to do so, which the businessman indicated in May that he had.\n\nBloomberg reported on Sunday that Twitter had in fact gone ahead and assembled a team of attorneys to sue Musk.\n\nMusk could also face a fine of $1 billion if he pulls out of the deal, although he is trying to avoid the penalty by alleging that Twitter breached \u201cmultiple provisions\u201d of its sale agreement.\n\nHis first public appearance after Friday\u2019s filing occurred when he delivered the closed-doors keynote address at Allen & Co\u2019s Sun Valley Conference on Saturday.",
