          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nFoot drop also called drop foot entails having difficulty in lifting the front part of the foot. It is a condition that makes walking very difficult for those affected. However, living with this condition affects not only the movement but also the quality of life of those living with it. Some persons with this challenge shared the story of how the injections they were given in childhood for minor ailments resulted in irreversible nerve damage that caused the foot drop and made walking and standing difficult for them. ANGELA ONWUZOO reports\n\nWhen Chekube Ezeokafor was born in 1992, she was healthy and had no form of deformity. She had no issues with her ability to walk, run, and play normally like her peers. Moving around was not a challenge at all for Chekube when she started walking at 10 months old.\n\nThe Anambra State indigene received all her childhood immunisation without any issues. But at the age of two, she was sick and was taken to a private hospital in the state by her mother for treatment.\n\nBut little did Chekube and her mother know that the injection that was given to her on her buttocks by a nurse at the facility will cause irreversible injury to her nerve and affect her movement and quality of life for life.\n\nSharing her experience with PUNCH HealthWise, Chekube, a Higher National Diploma student of Home and Rural Economics Department, Federal Polytechnic, Oko, Anambra State, said she walked with her two legs with her mother to the hospital but couldn\u2019t lift her left leg again after receiving an injection that was given to her by a nurse for a fever that brought her to the hospital.\n\nShe, unfortunately, left the hospital with a deformity that she is still battling with to date.\n\nThe dark-complexioned lady said the injection caused the foot drop, lamenting that life has never remained the same since the unfortunate incident as walking has become a challenging task for her.\n\nShe said going to primary and secondary school was quite challenging for her as she could no longer walk a long distance, noting that she experienced excruciating pain in her knees each time she walks.\n\nAccording to the United States National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, foot drop is the inability to raise the front part of the foot due to weakness or paralysis of the muscles that lift the foot.\n\nThe NINDS says as a result of that, individuals with foot drop scuff their toes along the ground or bend their knees to lift their foot higher than usual to avoid the scuffing, which causes what is called a \u2018steppage gait\u2019.\n\nExperts say serious sciatic nerve injury or injection nerve palsy can result from improperly performed injections into the buttocks and cause foot drop, adding that the most common scenario for nerve damage is improper needle placement.\n\nAuxiliary nurses causing problems\n\nA Senior Lecturer at the Department of Paediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Dr. Beatrice Ezenwa, told PUNCH Healthwise that only trained and qualified nurses should be allowed to administer injections.\n\nAccording to her, untrained health workers and auxiliary nurses are the ones causing these problems.\n\nThe Consultant Neonatologist/Paediatrician with the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, said, \u201cThere are particular areas for giving an injection.\n\n\u201cIf somebody follows the guideline and protocol, they are not likely to cause any problems. It is those who do not know the rules that cause problems.\n\nLeg became paralysed immediately after injection at age two\n\nSharing her experience with PUNCH HealthWise, Chekube said, \u201cI was born normal in 1992. My mum told me that she gave birth to me without any form of deformity. And that I received all my childhood vaccines without any health issues. But at the age of two years, she told me that I was sick and had a serious fever which prompted her to take me to the hospital.\n\n\u201cAccording to her, when she took me there, a private hospital, a nurse gave me an injection on my buttock. She told me that after taking the injection, I fell and could not walk again. She said she tried all she could to make me stand and walk, all to no avail.\n\n\u201cShe said she screamed and started crying. She said she told everyone in the hospital that her daughter she brought for treatment came in with her two legs and was even walking around when suddenly she could not walk again after being injected by a nurse.\n\n\u201cShe told me that while she went to the nurse to confront her, she saw two women quarreling with her over the same issue. My mum said staying back and quarreling with the nurse may worsen my case.\n\n\u201cSo, she said she quickly rushed me to another hospital and after examining the leg, they told her that the injection had caused injury to my nerve and that the damage may be irreversible.\n\n\u201cMy mum was told that my nerve was injured by the injection needle which they blamed on the nurse that gave me the injection. And that is how it resulted in foot drop.\u201d\n\nChekube told our correspondent that she experiences pain in her legs often and walking a long distance is always a problem.\n\n\u201cMy mum told me that the pain that I went through after taking that injection was unbearable, wondering what type of injection could make a child writhe in pain.\n\n\u201cSo, she said after that injection, I started sitting like a toddler again because I could not walk and as I was growing up, one leg became shorter than the other.\n\n\u201cLater, she started taking me to different traditional homes for treatment to see if I could stand and walk again. My mum said it took me time before I struggled to stand and walk again.\n\n\u201cThat was what she told me when I asked her why I was not walking and standing normal like my peers and brothers.\n\n\u201cMy mum said she and my dad, however, didn\u2019t take any action against the nurse nor sue the hospital. She said their primary concern was for me to get better,\u201d she recounted.\n\nChekube told our correspondent that she feels unhappy each time she remembers that her condition was caused by a quack and that she has to live with the consequence for the rest of her life\n\nGetting married difficult\n\nContinuing, she said, \u201cWe are five in my family and I am the last and only daughter. My brothers stand and walk without issues while I walk in pain and with difficulty all the time.\n\n\u201cI am saddened by the development because my disability is man-made and no fault of mine nor my mum. The nurse that injected me, no doubt is a quack. If I had been injected by a trained nurse, I wouldn\u2019t have come down with this condition.\n\n\u201cEach time I look at myself in the mirror and see that one leg is shorter than the other, I feel unhappy. My mother is not always happy whenever she sees me walking because she gave birth to me without deformity.\u201d\n\nCoping with foot drop the undergraduate said has not been easy.\n\n\u201cAs a child, I didn\u2019t understand the gravity of having one leg shorter than the other. I felt it was just a phase, which would pass. After seeking help without a solution, at a time, it dawned on me that I was not going to walk normally and stand straight for life. It was so painful for me, I must tell you. I just had to take my fate into my hands. I can\u2019t walk long distances.\n\n\u201cMeeting up with my lectures sometimes is difficult especially when the venue is far. While others are running to get a better space and seat, I will still be struggling on the way. I feel pain in the leg most time when I walk and I also feel tired easily each time I walk. And sometimes, people make fun of me because of the way I walk.\n\n\u201cThough I can cope with my education, I can tell you that the condition has affected me in terms of getting married. I have lost three suitors because of my leg. They said their parents told them not to marry me because of the way I walk.\n\n\u201cBut I have another suitor now, though his parents are against the marriage. He has, however, assured me that he would still go ahead with the marriage because he loves me,\u201d she said.\n\nChekube who is from Anambra State told our correspondent that she has seen other people with foot drops which resulted from injections that they were given in childhood.\n\nShe urged the government at all levels to address the challenge which she said was rampant in the rural areas where quacks are operating without being sanctioned.\n\n\u201cI want the government to address the issue of quackery in our hospitals. If not for the fact that I was given an injection by a quack nurse that affected my left leg, I would have been married with children by now and would not have been struggling with everything that I do,\u201d she said.\n\nThe World Health Organisation, says there is a need to reduce the number of unnecessary injections as a critical way of reducing risk.\n\nAccording to experts, injections should only be given as a last resort to children while mothers are advised to ask questions whenever they visit the hospital and injection is suggested.\n\nAccording to them, nerve injury is a common complication following intramuscular injection, adding that the sciatic nerve is the most frequently affected, especially in children, the elderly, and underweight patients.\n\nDaily intake of painkillers to reduce pain\n\nChristian Ndiferek, 19, is another person walking with difficulty as a result of the injection given to him when he was an infant as one of his legs became shorter than the other after the injection though he was born with normal limbs.\n\nNarrating his ordeal to PUNCH HealthWise, Christian said, \u201cI can\u2019t do certain things that my mates are doing because of my leg. My mother told me that she gave birth to me without any health issues.\n\n\u201cShe said she took me to a private hospital where I was delivered for immunisation one month after I was born and a nurse gave me an injection on my buttocks and that was how my inability to walk normally and freely started. The injection affected my left leg making it shorter than the right one.\n\n\u201cThat was how I developed foot drop. Since I started growing up till now, walking has remained a major challenge to me. I experience severe pain in the affected leg often and I am on pain killers daily to ease the pain. I can\u2019t play football like my mates.\n\n\u201cBecause of the way I walk, when I approach any girl for friendship, they often refuse because of my leg. I feel unhappy each time I have pain in my leg and each time I am unable to do what my mates are doing. Even the little business that I am doing often suffers setbacks as a result of my inability to walk normally and the pain that I experience daily.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking with PUNCH HealthWise, Mrs. Glory Ndiferek, Christian\u2019s mum also shared narrated how one of the legs of her son who was born normal was later impaired after taking an injection.\n\n\u201cI gave birth to him in the village and he had no issues with his legs when I gave birth to him. But after one month, I took him to the hospital where I delivered him for Immunisation. I noticed that three days after he was immunised, the side of the buttocks that he was given an injection for became red and swollen.\n\n\u201cOne week after, I took him to another hospital and when the doctor saw him, he was angry that the injection had developed an abscess and affected his leg badly. He asked me who the nurse that administered my baby an injection on the wrong part of his buttocks. That was how my boy grew up with movement and standing challenges\u201d\n\nLekan Yusuf from Kwara State and others living with drop foot who spoke with PUNCH HealthWise shared similar experiences of how injections they were given in their childhood for fever and other minor ailments resulted in injection nerve palsy that caused them foot drop.\n\nSpeaking further with our correspondent, Dr. Ezenwa stressed that injections should not just be given in any part of the buttocks.\n\nThe paediatrician said, \u201cThere are anatomical places where you can give an injection which you learn when you are in school.\n\n\u201cBut quacks because they see people give injections in the buttocks, they feel that any part of the buttocks can be given injections and they cause problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you are to give injections, there are particular places you can give them.\u201d\n\nWhy children are given injections in the thigh\n\nAnother child health expert, Dr. Olatunde Odusote told our correspondent that there are ways to give injections.\n\nDr. Odusote who is a Consultant Paediatrician and Head of the Division of Allergy, Dermatology and Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Paediatric and Child Health, Lagos State University Teaching, Ikeja, said the risk of damage is reduced when children are given an injection in the thigh.\n\nThe paediatrician explained,\u201d If you inject somebody on the nerve, it would cause irreversible damage.\n\n\u201cNerves are not repairable once they are damaged. That is one way of causing the problem. So, that is an issue of quackery where somebody who is not trained to give injection gives injection and damages the nerve in that child especially if it is given in the buttocks.\n\n\u201cUsually, there is a way to give injections in the buttocks. When you want to give an injection in the buttocks, you have to divide it into four parts.\n\n\u201cIt is the upper outer area that you will give the injection.\u201d\n\nDr. Odusote, however, said, \u201cBut we also know from experience that although most nerves do not pass through that place, a few per cent of people, their nerves are in that area. That is why you find out that most vaccines in children now are given in the thigh. It is because of those findings.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that when a child has a polio infection and runs a fever, if he or she is given an injection, it could make polio worse.\n\nAlso speaking with PUNCH HealthWise, a surgeon and former National President of the National Association of Resident Doctors, Dr. Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi said, \u201cAny time that an injection is given at a part that is not on the upper outer quadrant of the buttocks, it can cause injury to any of the nerves in that part and that can lead to foot drop.\n\n\u201cAlso, when you have injuries to the upper part of the leg, around where the tibia and fibula meet together, mostly where there is peroneal nerve, it can also cause foot drop.\u201d\n\nHe identified trauma, fractures, tumours, among others as other causes of foot drop.\n\nIn a 2016 report published in British Medical Journal titled, \u201cCase report: An unfortunate injection,\u201d the authors said though intramuscular injection has been used to administer medications for more than a hundred years, preventable complications such as injection nerve palsies are still prevalent in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the researchers, injections account for one-fifth of all traumatic nerve injuries.\n\nIndiscriminate use of injections\n\n\u201cThese injuries largely occur due to indiscriminate use of intramuscular injections for treating common illnesses, frequently by unlicensed or undertrained practitioners administering unnecessary treatment to impoverished patients.\n\n\u201cThe sciatic nerve is the most commonly injured, and frequently the resulting muscle weakness and associated disability are irreversible. Such injuries can be prevented by proper awareness and training, the implementation of safer injection techniques, and quality assurance methods,\u201d the author said.\n\nThe BMJ is a weekly peer-reviewed medical trade journal, published by the British Medical Association.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

It is because of those findings.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that when a child has a polio infection and runs a fever, if he or she is given an injection, it could make polio worse.\n\nAlso speaking with PUNCH HealthWise, a surgeon and former National President of the National Association of Resident Doctors, Dr. Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi said, \u201cAny time that an injection is given at a part that is not on the upper outer quadrant of the buttocks, it can cause injury to any of the nerves in that part and that can lead to foot drop.\n\n\u201cAlso, when you have injuries to the upper part of the leg, around where the tibia and fibula meet together, mostly where there is peroneal nerve, it can also cause foot drop.\u201d\n\nHe identified trauma, fractures, tumours, among others as other causes of foot drop.\n\nIn a 2016 report published in British Medical Journal titled, \u201cCase report: An unfortunate injection,\u201d the authors said though intramuscular injection has been used to administer medications for more than a hundred years, preventable complications such as injection nerve palsies are still prevalent in developing countries.\n\nAccording to the researchers, injections account for one-fifth of all traumatic nerve injuries.\n\nIndiscriminate use of injections\n\n\u201cThese injuries largely occur due to indiscriminate use of intramuscular injections for treating common illnesses, frequently by unlicensed or undertrained practitioners administering unnecessary treatment to impoverished patients.\n\n\u201cThe sciatic nerve is the most commonly injured, and frequently the resulting muscle weakness and associated disability are irreversible. Such injuries can be prevented by proper awareness and training, the implementation of safer injection techniques, and quality assurance methods,\u201d the author said.\n\nThe BMJ is a weekly peer-reviewed medical trade journal, published by the British Medical Association.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Godfrey George\n\nA 23-year-old Delta lady, Efezino Patrick, shares with GODFREY GEORGE how she was allegedly poisoned at age 13 and suffered abdominal distention, which caused her unrelenting pains for seven years before help finally came\n\nTell us about yourself.\n\nMy name is Efezino Patrick. I am from Agbarha Otor community, Ughelli, Delta State. I am 23 years old. My mum and dad are divorced. We\u2019re six kids in the family \u2013 two boys and four girls. I didn\u2019t finish secondary school. I stopped at SS 2. I had to stop because I was poisoned by someone at that time and had to suffer for seven years before help came.\n\nWhen exactly did this happen?\n\nIt all began one day in March 2013. I just woke up one morning with a terrible stomach ache. I told my mum and she said, perhaps, I was about to see my menses. I was about 13 years old at that time. But the ache didn\u2019t stop. It grew worse and I couldn\u2019t even walk. I was practically begging for my life. It was excruciating. So, my mum went to the pharmacy, got some drugs and I took them. The pain subsided a bit so I could sleep. The next day, I woke up to see that my stomach had become hard overnight. It was now protruding and was as though I was pregnant.\n\nWhat did you do when you saw that?\n\nMy mum quickly rushed me to a nearby clinic for medical attention. Tests and scans were done but the doctor did not seem to detect anything from the medical examination. He told my mum to seek alternative opinions from religious houses. He, however, gave me some drugs to calm the pains.\n\nOn hearing this from the doctor, what action did you take?\n\nThat same day, because the pain did not stop despite the drugs and my stomach had increased in size, my mum decided to take me to a native home to also find out what was going on. That was where the spiritual healer said I was poisoned by a relative. My mum did not believe that because I was only 13. Why would anyone want to poison me? So, she took me home. But she then recalled that a pastor had told her in a church that she should be careful because there was a plan by a family member to poison her and destroy her destiny.\n\nDid you believe any of this?\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know if I believed it or not. I was too young to form an opinion. I felt depressed and lonely because I could not go out again. I had to stop schooling. I just stayed at home and tied a wrapper around my breast. I looked like a woman who was approaching her due date for delivery. The pain was unexplainable. I felt like taking my life.\n\nMy friends then called me all sorts of names. One of the native doctors even said I was a witch and asked me to confess. I was beaten and forced to confess to what I knew nothing about. It was a really hard time for me. I suffered.\n\nHow supportive was your family through this time?\n\nI was able to pull through all that because my mum and siblings never gave up on me. They stood by me and believed everything I told them. Despite what people said they saw about me, my mum never believed them. She would tell them, \u201cMy daughter is not a witch. She is sick and she will get better.\u201d She even lost her marriage because of me.\n\nHow do you mean?\n\nShe was not with my biological father when this whole thing happened. They had separated. She was remarried to my stepdad. He was the one who left when the situation became dire. He said he couldn\u2019t cope with all that. He was even accusing my mum and siblings of being witches since they refused to believe the prophets and seers who claimed that I was a witch from the underworld.\n\nDid these spiritualists reveal who exactly poisoned you?\n\nThey said it was a family member. I would not like to mention her name. They said she was not happy I was going to school, and that she had seen my destiny and wanted to thwart it. I really went through hell. Even my former classmates, who were now in university, stopped talking to me. They peddled all forms of false rumours about me. I cried all day and all night yet nothing changed.\n\nWhat other interventions did you seek?\n\nOne of my mother\u2019s friends took me to one spiritualist whom they said was very powerful. He said I should drink my urine every morning when I woke up and in the evening before sleeping. I did that for six months but there was no change. They gave me all kinds of leaves.\n\nOne herbal company, Greenlight or so, used to bring drugs for me. They charged me N40, 000 every fortnight but nothing changed. We had to go to another spiritualist who made tiny markings with razor blades all over my body, saying he wanted to take away the bad blood. I would be fully awake and he would strip me naked and begin the ritual. I would cry and cry but I had the hope that it would work. After making those cuts on me, he would apply some peppery substance to the wounds but all those things did not work.\n\nAnother spiritualist then used dog faeces and alcohol to make a native medicine for me to drink. I drank it for some time, too, but it didn\u2019t change anything. They also used frog and charcoal to make drugs for me to also take but it didn\u2019t seem to be working at all. Rather, I became a shadow of myself. I was getting thinner because of the many things I was taking. I became addicted to alcohol because all the drugs I took had alcoholic content.\n\nHow were you able to fund these remedies?\n\nMy mum sold all her wrappers and jewellery. Her business folded up. She became a commercial farmer. My older siblings were also supporting me in the little way they could. My biological dad was not in the picture. He was married to another woman and was part of the people who said I was a witch.\n\nAll through that period, I did not set my eyes on him. I cannot even say how much we spent searching for a cure for this problem. It must have run into millions. What church did we not go to? What spiritualist did we not visit? What hospital did we not go to for help? We even went to a popular church in Lagos and bought some holy water for a huge sum but it didn\u2019t work one bit. There was no remedy I didn\u2019t seek in this life except the one I didn\u2019t know or was not introduced to us.\n\nWhen you saw that nothing was working, how did you feel?\n\nHonestly, I just told myself that I had tried. I knew I didn\u2019t do anything to anyone to deserve that much pain. When I was 19, I just told myself that I was tired. I stopped going to all those churches and spiritual homes. I decided to seek God for myself. I prayed on my own and read my Bible in my home. I began to feel that I was not alone in that battle. I felt somewhat comforted.\n\nHow did you get the cure?\n\nDuring the time of my illness, I never saw my menses for one day. I didn\u2019t know what it feels like to go through that monthly cycle. One day, while I was home alone, after much praying, I felt a sharp pain in my stomach. It was like my time to die had come. I heard a voice in my head telling me not to move because I would not make it out alive. I was so afraid. I looked down and saw that I was bleeding. Thick black blood was coming out of me and I was crying because it was painful. I kept shouting and my mum came and helped me. She cleaned me up. Later on, I found out that it was just me seeing my menses because it flowed for days before it stopped. I was encouraged that my miracle was near. It was during that time that one of my relatives confessed that she was the one that poisoned me using juju (black magic).\n\nHow did your stomach go back to normal?\n\nOn one of those days when I was home, I just decided to go for another scan. When I told my mum, she laughed it off because I had done over a hundred different scans but nothing was seen. What made me so sure this one would be different? I just didn\u2019t know but I decided to do it on my own.\n\nI got some money from someone and went to the hospital and told the doctor on duty I wanted to do a scan. The doctor, who was familiar with my case, laughed and referred me to another clinic after doing his own examination to fulfill all righteousness. My mum refused to go with me. She said there was no need. When I got there, I was scanned and the lab scientist said he could see something. He drew it on a white paper. It was like a rock of some sort lying in my stomach. Just that it was made of flesh. He told me to go back to the first hospital which was a specialist hospital to conduct the operation.\n\nWhat was the reaction of the doctor when you came back with a scan result showing that you had something in your belly?\n\nHe didn\u2019t believe it. He kept asking me if it was really from a hospital. He checked and found out that it was real. I was then scheduled for a procedure where I paid over N250,000. It was done on a Saturday in September 2019. It was successful. The doctor was so shocked that he named me Testimony. The doctor said if not that he was the one who had monitored me from when the situation began, he wouldn\u2019t have believed that I would be alright.\n\nWhat did this experience teach you?\n\nI learnt that, in life, faith in God matters a lot. You don\u2019t need a pastor to lay hands on you before you receive your miracle. You can approach God by yourself. This experience also taught me that it is only when things are bad that you can tell who your true friends are. Many people walked out on me when I needed them the most. I also learnt to never give up.\n\nFrom your pictures, you still have scars and folds on your tummy area. Does this make you feel insecure about yourself sometimes?\n\nIt used to sometimes but I am always positive. The scars are part of the memories that I have. My boyfriend likes me the way I am. He even wants me to wear clothes that will show my scars to the world. He is proud of me. I just have to learn how to be proud in my own skin again. This situation stole my childhood from me.\n\nDo you have plans of going back to school?\n\nYes, I do. I will take WASSCE next year. I couldn\u2019t register for the last one. I am into makeup and fashion. I want to be a boss of my own and make money and take care of the people who were there for me in the time of my storm.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

At the same time it should deepen the ongoing development of the rails system to change the narrative on the operating environment from being a high cost to low production cost environment. The MAN review also asked the Federal Government to resuscitate the existing national refineries to produce fuels locally.\n\nOn the proliferation of taxes, Ahmed urged government to fully implement the Steve Oronsaye Report on the reduction and re-alignment of government agencies and parastatals to streamline the number of taxes, levies, fees and administrative charges\n\nThe report insisted that it is the duty of the government to ensure effective allocation of available forex to productive sectors, particularly the manufacturing sector for importation of raw materials and vital machinery and equipment that are not available locally.",

          "text": "Pelumi Olajengbesi, an Abuja-based human rights lawyer, has described the replacement of the name of Bashir Machina, the Yobe North Senatorial candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC) with that of the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, as unconstitutional and fraudulent.\n\nA statement issued by Pelumi Olajengbesi on Saturday said Abdullahi Adamu, the APC national chairman, was hellbent on foisting Lawan on members of the party as \u201cconsensus candidate\u201d during the buildup to APC presidential primary, announcing the Senate President against the will of members of the National Working Committee of the party and other presidential contestants.\n\nOlajengbesi, who is the Principal Partner of Law Corridor, noted that Adamu wants \u201centhrone\u201d Lawan as the party\u2019s Yobe North senatorial candidate, in spite of the fact that he (Ahmad Lawan) did not contest the Senatorial primary election.\n\nMachina, who was declared the APC candidate at the Yobe North senatorial primary election, had stated emphatically that he would not step down for the Senate President in 2023 general elections.\n\nMachina\u2019s name, however, was replaced by Lawan\u2019s on the list of Yobe senatorial candidates sent from the APC to the Independent National Electoral Commission.\n\nThe statement explained, \u201cNow that Lawan has lost the presidential primary to former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, it is shocking that the APC chairman again threw away constitutional democracy and moved on to enthrone Lawan as Yobe North senatorial candidate for the ruling party when it was apparent that the Senate President didn\u2019t participate in the Senatorial primary.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that it is a disgrace the party to allow such to happen and advised Machina to seek redress in court to ensure the proper thing is done.\n\nAccording to the statement, the APC has disgraced and embarrassed itself as a shameless party with no respect for constitutional democracy which President Muhammadu Buhari preaches.\n\nGoing by the provisions of Section 84 of the Electoral Act 2022 signed by the President, the statement explained, the APC cannot just foist anybody on other contestants, not especially in the case where Machina contested the election and won whilst Lawan was busy chasing his presidential ambition which was met with preposterous defeat as he didn\u2019t even come close to the first three in terms of votes cast by delegates.\n\nThe statement advised that APC must stop its illegalities and actions alien to decent democracy, stressing that there is nothing absolutely wrong with Lawan\u2019s 24-year rubberstamp tenure in the National Assembly coming to an end in 2023.\n\nThe human rights lawyer expressed worry that it is this sit-tight syndrome that has destroyed democracy in Nigeria and Africa as a whole.\n\nThe statement encouraged Bashir Machina to seek legal redress to reclaim his rightful mandate from Lawan, assuring that Machina has a good case and should not give in to intimidation and oppression by the high and mighty who should be taught a lesson that illegalities won\u2019t be tolerated going into the 2023 general elections.",

          "text": "BY PHILIP NWOSU\n\nThe Nigerian Military said it is working to ensure that it sustains the present tempo in the fight against insurgents in the north east, which has brought relative peace within the areas formerly controlled by Boko Haram terrorists.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor who made the assertion, maintained that the military would ensure that the tempo of the war against insurgency is sustained especially as the country moves towards electing a new president in 2023.\n\n\n\nGeneral Irabor spoke to Defence Correspondents in Lagos during the passing out ceremony of discharging Trainees of the Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Centre (NAFRC) Course 1, 2022 Stream 2.\n\nHe said: \u201cEssentially we have made huge progress, but off course there still remain a long hull to go and we will do everything possible to ensure that the state of peace will incrementally improve, leading up to next year that you there is a very important exercise that the nation is going to go through, which we believe will go on peacefully and this is precisely what we are working on.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Chief of Defence Staff warned the 316 discharging soldiers to beware of subversive elements within the society, insisting that, \u201cIt is important at this point to let you know that the level of insecurity is high in our nation. So, as you retire into the larger society, please beware of subversive elements within your environment and do not associate with them in any form.\n\n\u201cYour loyalty to the Nigerian Armed Forces and the Federal Republic of Nigeria is non-negotiable.\u201d\n\nIrabor told the discharging soldiers of the many challenges associated with post-service life, urging them to be proactive in their conduct to overcome the challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cSome of the challenges you will face include how you manage your resources, especially your retirement benefits, the influence from members of your family and friends.\n\n\u201cOthers include management of your physical and mental health, integrating with the civil society as well as the high level of insecurity in our nation.\u201d\n\nIrabor, however, charged them to be bold, courageous and remain disciplined and focused as they take full charge as planners and executors of their personal daily activities.\n\n\u201cThis may sound exciting and promising but beware; you need to properly manage your freedom and make good use of your resources in order to be successful.\n\n\u201cThe society will expect a high moral standard and discipline from you, you will also have to prove in your relationships that you passed through a highly disciplined system.\n\n\u201cAs our ambassadors, always remember that the Armed Forces of Nigeria remains your primary constituency. I believe in your capabilities to do us proud,\u201d he said.\n\nThe general also advised them to be wary of subversive elements within their environment and avoid associating with them in any form as they retired into the larger society.\n\n\u201cIt is also risky for you to embark on a new life style that is above your means, or engage in non-lucrative ventures, neither should you abstain from physical exercises.\n\n\u201cYour training has exposed you to several vocational opportunities, entrepreneurship procedures and general managerial skills to alleviate the above mentioned pitfalls for a meaningful life in retirement.\n\n\u201cIn this wise, employ the various knowledge and skills you have acquired while undergoing NAFRC training for peaceful and productive economic life as you reintegrate into the Nigerian civil society,\u201d he said.\n\nIrabor encouraged them to justify the magnanimity of President Muhammadu Buhari who had continued to support the armed forces, most especially, the retiring members as seen in the enhanced welfare packages.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\u2022EFCC arrests vote buyers\n\nKunle Aderinokun in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Victor Ogunje in Ado-Ekiti\n\n\n\nThe governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State, Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, was this early morning declared the winner of yesterday\u2019s governorship poll after sweeping 15 out of the 16 local government areas (LGAs) in the state.\n\nThe governorship election, which was held under a calm and peaceful atmosphere, also recorded a large turnout of voters.\n\nThe poll was however characterised by vote-buying in all the 16 LGAs in the state, leading to the intervention of the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), who arrested some vote-buyers.\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Oyebanji scored 187,057 votes to defeat his main challenger and governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Mr. Segun Oni, who came a distant second with 82,211 votes, while the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Bisi Kolawole garnered 67,457 votes to clinch the third position.\n\nHowever, while the APC and PDP won in 15 and one local government area, respectively, the SDP did not win any LGA.\n\nSixteen political parties participated in the election.\n\nAccording to the results announced by the Returning Officer, Prof. Oyebode Adebowale, APC won in Ado-Ekiti, Ikere, Emure, Ijero, Ilejemeje, Ekiti South West, Ekiti West, Ekiti East, Moba, Oye, Irepodun/Ifelodun, Ise/Orun, Aiyekire/Gbonyin, Ido-Osi, and Ikole LGAs.\n\nWhile Irepodun/Ifelodun is the LGA of former governor Ayo Fayose, who was the main backer of the PDP candidate, Ido-Osi is the LGA of the governorship candidate of SDP, Oni.\n\nIkole is the LGA of Kemi Elebute-Halle, the candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP).\n\nThe candidate of the PDP, Kolawole, was announced the winner in Efon Alaye LGA, while Oni of the SDP did not win a single LGA.\n\nThe winner of the governorship election, Oyebanji, is a former Secretary to the State Government (SSG), to Governor Kayode Fayemi.\n\nEFCC Arrests Vote Buyers, Election Calm, Peaceful\n\nFollowing the widespread vote-buying, which characterised the governorship election, the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested persons suspected to be engaged in vote-buying in the poll.\n\nSome of the suspects were paraded at the Oke Ori Omi Area Division of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nThe suspects were reported to have been caught with bundles of cash allegedly used for vote-buying.\n\nSome other persons were also arrested at a private residence with a book containing details of voters of a certain voting area.\n\nThough the election was said to be calm and peaceful, sponsored thugs had a field day destroying ballot boxes in the stronghold of opposition parties in Ise Ekiti and Ilawe Ekiti Polling Units.\n\nBallot boxes in Ilasa, Polling Unit 001 in Ekiti East, another stronghold of the opposition party, were destroyed by sponsored thugs.\n\nThe Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room (Situation Room), which observed the election, said in a statement that it received reports of widespread vote-buying by political party agents across the 16 LGAs in the state.\n\n\u201cIn many instances, voters were induced with money ranging from N4,500 to N10,000 by asking them to flag completed ballot papers as proof of voting in a specified manner in what they term \u2018See and Buy\u2019. Situation Room strongly condemns this blatant violation of the electoral law,\u201d said the statement.\n\nSituation Room noted that the election was generally peaceful, with voters civilly conducting themselves in most of the polling units.\n\nIt, however, observed that the redistribution of voters done by INEC still did not take care of the issue of a huge population of voters in some polling units as many new polling units had abysmally low numbers while older polling units remain overcrowded.\n\n\u201cThere were also polling units sited in private residences such as PU006 Omiragunsin\u2019s House, Okemesi Ward 1, Ekiti West LGA and PU003 in front of Ezekiel\u2019s House Iroro/Ita Alafia Iroro Imegun, Ward 3 Araromi Omuo, Ekiti East LGA,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSituation Room, which commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), noted the early arrival of poll officials and election materials in 93 per cent of the polling units observed.\n\nAccording to the group, polls commenced before 9 a.m. in at least 88 per cent of the locations, which it described as an improvement of both the Anambra State Governorship Election 2021 and FCT Area Councils Elections 2022.\n\nSituation Room observed that the Bi-Modal Verification Accreditation System (BVAS) was functional in at least 76 per cent of the voting locations.\n\n\u201cHowever, there have been many reports of delays and malfunctioning BVAS machines in some voting units especially those with many registered voters. Examples of the locations where the machines malfunctioned are PU 002 Igbaletere by Mechanic Workshop, Ward 6 Ado Okeyinmi, Ado-Ekiti LGA where the Machine was going on and off intermittently, PU 007 LA Primary School Oke Afin, Otun Ward III and PU018 Igogo Ward II both in Moba LGA where the BVAS failed, and PU 014, Ward I Okemesi, Ekiti West LGA, amongst others. Furthermore, INEC\u2019s distribution of the BVAS devices was not proportionate to the population of registered voters by polling unit,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked INEC to prosecute all those involved in vote-buying in the governorship election.\n\nSERAP in a short tweet last night said the prosecution must not end with those caught in the act but must be extended to the politicians who funded their election malpractice.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Peter Obi and the Last \u2018Big Men\u2019",
          "text": "ENGAGEMENTS by Chidi Amuta\n\nThe outcome of our presidential nominations season has produced a new landscape of mixed blessings. The two major parties have produced rival contestants straight from the dark recesses of Africa\u2019s political past. Atiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu are in many ways a throwback to the African \u2018Big Man\u2019 politician of the 1970s to 1990s. On the contrary, a minor party, the Labour Party, has positioned a presidential candidate who symbolises the urgent present and the imminent future of African political contest. Mr. Peter Obi has emerged as both a generational shift and a redefinition of both political message and medium. The politics of business as usual is about to come face to face with the politics of norm shattering conveyed through the multiple devices and platforms of the internet age.\n\nIt is hard to forget where and who we are. In Nigeria\u2019s politics of ethnic identity, Tinubu is a Yoruba candidate while Atiku is the Hausa/Fulani opposite. Peter Obi is the candidate of ethnic anonymity, a sort of political everyman with perspectives that cut across all the silly barriers that have held us hostage.\n\nThere are other benefits of the presidential nominations season. A partisan frenzy has been unleashed. The public is falling over itself either in triumphant adulation or mournful regret over the emergence of Atiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu as mascots of the dominant parties. The emergence of both men replaces the anonymity of their respective party platforms with recognisable names. Overnight, those who prefer the PDP have become Atiku devotees whether they like Mr. Atiku\u2019s nose or not. The same goes for the other side. People who a few weeks back were ready to cast stones at anything that bore a Tinubu sign are now finding justifications on why the man should relocate from his Lagos Bourdillon home to Aso Rock Villa.\n\nThe epidemic of partisanship is of course a healthy sign for our quirky democracy. Schism and alignment are perfect entitlements of an activated public in a place of democracy. Moreover, in the absence of any ideological markers to distinguish between the parties, people are better off queuing up and falling over each other behind emblems.\n\nA tragic feature of today\u2019s African democracy is the ease with which the parties\u2019 become extensions of the private political estates of their overbearing founders or leaders. At this moment, the APC is now synonymous with Tinubu while the PDP has become Atiku Abubakar by other means.\n\nTogether, both men are political Siamese twins. They represent an easily recognizable feature of Africa\u2019s political landscape. Somehow, they are in many ways our own version of the reign and rule of the African \u201cBig Man\u201d as sovereign. They will carry the imprints of the modern African nation state mostly as pseudo traditional chiefs disguised as elected presidents. Both are immensely wealthy men. Their political prominence is mostly a product of their awesome economic power. They have used economic power to buy into and invoke the major classic indices of power. They have bought into primordial traditional authority by overwhelming the traditional institutions. They even influence the appointment of some traditional rulers. They control and endorse religious authority by donating churches and mosques. They own media houses and powerful information platforms and channels. They have amorphous families sometimes with multiple spouses and offspring. Both men have an identical political trajectory with many previous attempts at the top job. Their humongous wealth spans all major sectors. Those interested in following their big money usually get lost in the confusing hazy borderline between private fortune and the public treasury. Some inquisitive people end up in the confusing intersection between private fortune and privileged access to the public treasury in one way or the other.\n\nThe political gravity of both Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar is ultimately more a function of their economic and financial leverage than the ideas and policy propositions they are associated with. In each case, the emergence of a personality cult is well within reach despite the constraints of constitutional conformity. African history is littered with the nasty footsteps of a succession of African \u2018Big Men\u2019. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea. Paul Biya of Cameroun. Denis Sassou Nguesso of Congo Brazaville, Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, Mobutu Sese Seko of former Zaire. These are the more memorable variants of the Africa Big Man president.\n\nThe African Big Man as modern-day ruler of the nation state is a quaint anomaly, the cultural continuation of the fabled African Chief in most traditional African cultures and societies. The Chief is the inheritor of privileges beyond reproach or questioning. He has a natural entitlement to communal assets and benefits. The chief expects to be gifted the best maidens, the fattest cows, the most fertile communal lands, and the best harvests from those who toil. These entitlements are hardly subject to questioning. The modern African Big Man president feels a similar sense of entitlement.\n\nIn practice, the existence of a national constitution hardly regulates or limits the powers and entitlement of the African Big Man President. In most cases, the rule of law, the power of due process and the requirements of standard public accountability and the observance of a code of public conduct are mostly observed in breach. Civil society activists and rights lawyers who insist on these matters are quickly lumped with the political opposition \u2018enemies of the people\u2019 and could end up with endless prison terms.\n\nThe classic African Big Man ruler did not quite materialise centre stage in Nigerian politics in the 1980s and 1990s. This coincides with a period in which Nigerian politics and governance, like in Argentina and much of Latin America, was dominated by a rival but equally fearsome power contender: Big Generals. From the 1970s up to 1999 and even till President Buhari, Nigerian politics and power was straddled by Big Generals either in uniform or as elected democracy converts. As a rule, civilian political Big Men and Big Generals do not sleep on the same bed. This is one reason why the military neutralized the threatened emergence of Chief M.K.O Abiola in the early 1990s. In the current nominations of Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar, the Big Man has re-emerged centre stage in Nigeria\u2019s political arena through the democratic process.\n\nHowever, the reign and rule of the few remaining African Big Men is doomed to imminent end. A combination of biological extinction and technological substitution will see to that. The few of this specie left are mostly in their mid-70s to 80s. They are being challenged and replaced by younger politicians with support bases rooted in a new demographics and new messaging. African democracy is now appealing directly to a broad popular demographic base with an egalitarian consciousness. A younger generation of leaders and aspiring leaders empowered and connected by the internet and an array of new technologies is on the ascent. International best practices are increasingly beaming the searchlight on African governance and politics. African democracies are being compelled, through peer pressure, to shape up to global standards of citizens\u2019 rights and public accountability.\n\nThe younger generation of African political activists and leaders is no longer frightened by decadent myths, ancient customs or the deployment of medieval intimidation and repression strategies. Nor are they impressed by long motorcades, authorized state gangsters in the name of security or the sickening opulence of Big Men.\n\nOut of the loud and wide expectation of a Third Force to counter Nigeria\u2019s dominant two-party politics, something unexpected has reared its head. The real unexpected tale from our season of presidential nomination primaries is the emergence of Mr. Peter Obi. Beyond being the flag bearer of a little-known fringe Labour Party, Mr. Obi has materialized as a one-man political squad. Somehow, the lone scraggy voice of an ex -state governor has risen above the national political noise to reach the usually fractious Nigerian public. A new message that is both refreshingly new and unifying is afloat.\n\nWith no retinue of groveling followers, no intimidating motorcade of glimmering SUVs, no political fellow travellers in over embroidered flowing gowns, Mr. Peter Obi broke loose from the suffocating embrace of his former PDP. At a disarming final moment before the presidential nomination primaries, he had the uncommon decency to say a polite goodbye to Atiku Abubakar whose running mate he had been in the 2019 race. At another political event where Atiku declared his presidential intention, Mr. Obi described his former principal as \u2018my brother\u2019 and \u2018leader\u2019 only to take his leave of both the PDP and Mr. Atiku shortly afterwards.\n\nPrior to leaving the PDP, Peter Obi had gradually emerged as the darling of the Nigerian Online Republic. He is easily the most followed and admired political figure among Nigerians on Twitter where he has a following of over 1,000,000 and still counting. His Facebook, Instagram and Tik Tok followership is growing by the moment. So far, his few open forum events are packed with active audiences who only seem to want more of his inspirational political messages. He is already a cross between a power preacher and a rock star.\n\nThe Peter Obi phenomenon is a timely reversal of the old African Big Man narrative. Enter the youthful politician clad in simple outfit. He is determined to shorten the length of the presidential motorcade, curb wasteful governance, live modestly in simple circumstances, resist corruption, shun the filthy lucre, empty opulence and gradiosity of public office and avoid or curb the pomposity of state ceremony. Here is a leader who has undertaken to connect with the people as one of them. This is the regular Bayo, Emeka, Abu or Joe next door who wakes up early to pray for his nation, undertake his morning exercise, make his own coffee. Mr. Obi carries his own bag at the airport and holds up his own umbrella in the rain. Peter Obi\u2019s increasing magnetism lies mostly in the fact that of all the political salesmen at our doorstep these days, he alone embodies the highpoints of this new anti-Big Man narrative.\n\nPeter Obi is communicating and connecting directly with ordinary Nigerians on the streets and in the markets. His catchment is a new strategic demographics of youth and the internet generation, the urban unemployed who see their hopeless situation because of the years of wasteful governance by Big Men politicians. But the traditional party membership and configuration still gives an advantage to the rural grassroot poor who remain in the vice grip of the politics and parties of Big Men.\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s emerging democratic culture, Mr. Pater Obi is the galvanisation of the convergence of new realities and new technologies. Mr. Obi is merely the embodiment a new spirit and the carrier of a generational burden. An entirely new generation and vast population of Nigerians feel challenged to reject decades of bad politics and worsening social and economic conditions. Peter Obi is merely the current embodiment of a spirit that was hinted at by the spontaneous outburst of the ENDSARS protests. He may be the first political expression of the new spirit of protest bad government and ugly social and economic conditions.\n\nPeter Obi is still a fad, not quite a movement yet. There are pitfalls and obstacles. His solo dance is not yet a movement. His party platform still lacks a nationwide structure at the base. He fits rather untidily into the labour camp. No one knows his links to the Nigerian labour movement nor his ideological affinity to the movement\u2019s leftist and left of centre inclination. His proposition remains at best a solo flight. His perspective are personal convictions. His lifestyle and frugality are more of a personal choice. In his political train, there are no fellow travellers or disciples to convert his personal message into a creed. Beyond his instinctual appeal as a more frugal, unassuming, and more accountable leadership proposition, we are waiting for a systematic worldview and alternative perspective in a world full of models and options.\n\nMeanwhile, questions abound: Is Peter Obi a socialist? Not at all. Is he a social democrat? No one is certain. Is he a laissez faire capitalist or random trader who made good and stumbled into the government house in Awka? Not quite sure. Given his business antecedents as a bank owner, wine merchant, general importer, retailer of sundry wares and serial global investor, Mr. Obi would at best be a left of center politician with a personal lifestyle of frugality, modesty, and simplicity. All these qualities appeal naturally to a Nigerian public that has spent decades longing for a minimum level of modesty and accountability on the part of our leaders.\n\nThe immediate political risk confronting Mr. Obi is that of insulating his movement from ethnic pigeonholing. An Igbo mass who cannot find their own among the major political figurines of this season may want to own Peter Obi. His communicators must duck that trap by sustaining his nationalist and popular message.\n\nOn closer examination, there may be issues arising from the alternative leadership style and culture that Mr. Obi is increasingly symbolizing. The politician with a disciplined Spartan lifestyle and compulsive frugality in government may be new in these parts but it is not entirely a novelty in other places. It is in fact a common feature of post-industrial European countries. When industrialisation and economic development has created reasonable egalitarianism and prosperity, material glamour and glitz stop impressing most citizens. Leaders become more of everyman. Utilitarian functionality replaces grotesque opulence and senseless gadgetry. Substance replaces appearance and the lofty insensitivity of kings and princes gives way to the modesty of republican equality. Nigeria is not an industrial let alone a post -industrial society. Government remains the cash machine that sustains the economic life and livelihood of most citizens.\n\nPeter Obi\u2019s message is mostly about shrinking government and freeing resources for development. But government and its wasteful ways employs a multitude. Our huge public service is more of a social insurance mechanism than an engine of growth or bureaucratic functionality and efficiency. Sometimes the foolish ceremonies of government create employment. When a Nigerian government stages an elaborate ceremony to dish out awards to \u2018deserving\u2019 Nigerians in an annual festival, all the multiplier effect of moving a crowd of people from various parts to Abuja are activated. Hotels. Airlines, transporter, food vendors, dressmakers etc reap a harvest.\n\nMr. Peter Obi has come to serve notice on our behalf: Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar (whoever wins in 2023) are perhaps the last Big Men that will rule Nigeria. Similarly, we have seen the last Big Generals in power. After this season, political contest and power will revert to a majority in a true republic. Mr. Obi\u2019s emergence has value as a timely signal of the direction in which a new consciousness and new technologies will lead Nigeria long after the last Big Man has exited the central place of power.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

With this, nobody will have any fear of interception at the collation centres and that will add to the integrity of our election\u201d, he said.\n\nSpeaking further on the pervasive serenity in Ekiti and massive turnout of voters, Bamidele added: \u201cFrom the reports I heard from the start of the voting. It has been a peaceful process. We owe it a duty to collectively protect the integrity of this process.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll of us are bothered with the kind of tension in town before this election, but I am personally happy for the way it has turned out peacefully\u201d.\n\n11:47 am\n\nI\u2019m Confident of Winning, Oyebanji Boasts After Voting\n\n\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nThe All Progressives Congress Governorship candidate in today\u2019s election in Ekiti State, Hon Biodun Oyebanji, has expressed confidence that he will win the keenly contested election.\n\n\n\nOyebanji spoke in Ikogosi Ekiti, Ekiti West Local Government Area of Ekiti State after voting at Okelele ward 06 unit 003 in the town.\n\n\n\nHe was accompanied with his wife, Dr. Olayemi Oyebanji to the unit.\n\nHe praised INEC for improving on the electoral process through Bimodal Voter Authentication System technology innovation, saying this has made the process faster and credible.\n\n\n\nHe hailed the voters for enthusiastically trooping out en masse to cast their vote, saying there wasn\u2019t any case of apathy with the reports he had been getting across the 177 wards\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is an improvement and my expectation is that I will win . I am happy that there was no case of apathy. The security build up has also been impressive, so the process has been good and fine.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am coming with a change agenda and my manifesto is clear about the changes I am bringing\u201d, he said.\n\n10:44 am\n\nPDP candidate, Bisi Kolawole at Ward 8 unit 1, Efon Alaaye, casting his vote\n\n10:14 am\n\nVoters on Queue\n\n10:13am\n\nTight Security, Early Arrival of INEC Officials, Massive Turnout of Voters as Guber Election Holds in Ekiti\n\n\n\n*EFCC deploys operatives to prevent vote buying\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha in Ado Ekiti\n\n\n\nWith over 75 percent of voting materials and INEC officials arriving at the polling stations across the local governments of Ekiti state, voting for the next governor of the state have commenced in most of the areas visited by THISDAY .\n\nAs a preemptive measure against vote buying, officials of the EFCC were seen at the Police Command in their red reflective jackets.\n\n\n\nReports by Yiaga Africa said that out of the 250 polling units at 8.38 am, that 246 were already open for business, while the remaining four within the Ado Ekiti metropolis were awaiting arrival of INEC officials.\n\nLater at 9.30nam, Yiaga Africa posted from its situation room that at the 250 polling stations earlier visited accreditations and voting had commenced .\n\n\n\nSecurity was tight with vehicular movement partially restricted. There were operatives of security agencies like Policemen, Civil Defence officials seen in most of the polling centres visited.\n\nSamples of voting situations in places visited:\n\n*Voters not coordinated at this polling unit 017 ward 10 Bashiri, Security agents have ordered stoppage of exercise, pending when normalcy will be restored.\n\n\n\n*At Ward 13, unit 01, Itanla beside delight hotel, Ilawe road, Ado Ekiti there is confusion as to whether their polling unit has been moved. Prospective voters who claimed that they had been voting there could not see INEC officials or voting materials.\n\n\n\n* At the same polling 17 in ward 10 of the Ado local government, gunshots were fired to disperse the agitated crowd due to rowdy situation.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has deployed its operatives in Ekiti state to monitor today\u2019s governorship election with a view to addressing the possibility of vote buying.\n\nSome of the operatives and armed police personnel attached to the commission were sighted in a convoy of vehicles within Ado Ekiti, the state capital.\n\n9:40am\n\nVoting Begins as Voters Lament Slow Accreditation\n\n\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nVoting has commenced in some polling units in today\u2019s governorship poll in Ekiti State, as voters have queued up in some units to exercise their voting rights.\n\nIn some units in Ado Ekiti, Ilawe, Igede and Iyin Ekiti, voters were being accredited with the aide of Bimodal Voter Authentication System(BVAS) and given the ballots to vote.\n\n\n\nThere was impressive turnout of voters in virtually all the polling units.\n\nAlso, despite the peaceful conduct of voters, there were complaints in some of the units that the BVAS was slow and keeping voters on the queue for too long.\n\nHowever, the presiding officers in areas where BVAS seemed to be slow have complained to the Independent National Electoral Commission for proper and swift action.\n\n\n\nMilitary personnel were also stationed at entering points between Ado and Iyin Ekiti and at border towns .\n\nOperatives of the Department of State Services were also seen moving around to ensure orderliness and peaceful conduct of the poll in all the towns.\n\nSome of the agents were also seen complaining about reported cases of vote buying and such complaints were being handled by security operatives.\n\n8:09am\n\nVoters Trek Long Distance to Polling Units\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nAs the Independent National Electoral Commission prepares to conduct the Governorship poll in Ekiti State today, it was observed that voters were resolute to cast their votes by trekking several kilometres to exercise their franchise.\n\n\n\nThe candidates of the All Progressives Congress, Biodun Oyebanji, People\u2019s Democratic Party, Bisi Kolawole and Social Democratic Party , Segun Oni, are the leading candidates in the impending electoral battle.\n\nThe election is billed to begin at 8am going by INEC time table .\n\n\n\nBut as early as 6am, those living along Federal Polytechnic road and Afe Babalola University areas, with a distance of about eight kilometres to the voting centres, were seen trooping out and trekking long distance to exercise their franchise in today\u2019s election.\n\n\n\nSome of them were compelled to go on foot owing to the 18-hour restriction placed on the state by the Inspector General of Police, Mr Usman Alkali Baba.\n\n\n\nOne of them, who identified himself as Ojo Adeniyi said he was trekking to his polling unit at Ori -Ekiti, which was about six kilometres to his residential area.\n\n\n\nWhen THISDAY visited some polling units at Odo Ado, Oke- Ori Omi, Okeyinmi, Irona and Oke- Ila areas in Ado- Ekiti, voters trooped out in large numbers to the extent that the polling units were becoming overcrowded.\n\nUnarmed Policemen were also deployed in all the polling units as early as 6am, while armed policemen were also noticed in some strategic areas to prevent violence.\n\n6:50am\n\nEkiti Decides: Oyebanji, Oni, Kolawole in Three-Horse Race\n\n*INEC promises free, fair poll, orders staff to resist unethical behaviour\n\n*Police impose 18-hour curfew, deploy 17,000; NSCDC 9,747\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nThousands of voters will today file out in Ekiti State to elect a new governor that will succeed Kayode Fayemi who is at the tail end of his second four-year tenure.\n\n\n\nNo fewer than 16 political parties are fielding candidates for the election, but it is expected to be a fierce battle involving Biodun Oyebanji of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC); Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Bisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high across the state, with voters bitterly divided among the three leading candidates. Fear of violence was palpable.\n\n\n\nFor seamless conduct of today\u2019s election in Ekiti State, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, yesterday ordered the restriction of vehicular movements along entry and exit points to the state from 12:00am on 18th June, 2022 to 6:00pm of the same day.\n\n\n\nThe police added: \u201cTo this end, operatives of the Nigeria Police Force and the military, as well as other security agencies have been deployed across the state borders to enforce the restriction order to the letter and ensure criminal minded individuals do not infiltrate the State.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police, Johnson Kokumo had earlier disclosed that Ekiti State would be properly secured to avoid any breakdown of law and order during the poll.\n\n\n\nHe also revealed that a total of 17,000 personnel had been deployed for the poll.\n\nThe DIG added that soldiers would be at the borders of the communities to prevent any form of intrusion.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, all security operatives with VIPs should be withdrawn and returned to base for the purpose of the election. The DIG called on the people to be law abiding and to respect all the processes of the elections to be able to have a peaceful governorship election in the state.\n\n\n\nINEC Says it is Ready\n\nINEC spent most of yesterday moving sensitive voting materials to the wards, while assuring all that the election would be free and fair.\n\nThe electoral umpire had earlier revealed that 988,923 voters captured in the Commission\u2019s register would decide who becomes the new Ekiti State Governor.\n\nINEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu appealed to staff of the commission to be neutral and abide by the code of conduct signed by them.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of responsibility and professionalism; remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further charged them to ensure that no political party or candidate was accorded any advantage over the other.\n\n\u201cWe must also always stick strictly to the oath of neutrality to which we have all subscribed and continually live up to the trust that Nigerians repose in us,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\n\n\nThe National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said 734,746 persons had collected their Permanent Voters Card for the election.\n\n\n\nOkoye assured electorates of the commission\u2019s readiness to conduct a free, fair and credible election.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is now a matter of common knowledge that we have 16 LGAs in Ekiti State and the election will be staged in 177 registration areas.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, yesterday said it would deploy 9,747 personnel drawn from FCT, Lagos, Ondo, Ogun, Osun, Oyo, Kogi, Kwara and Edo commands to provide security for the election.\n\nAddressing personnel at the Ekiti State Command headquarters of the NSCDC in Ado Ekiti, before they moved to their respective places of deployment, Acting Deputy Commandant General Operations, Lawal Haruna, disclosed that some flash points had already been identified and would be properly monitored.\n\n\n\nOni Alleges Intimidation\n\nThe SDP candidate yesterday alleged that some desperate politicians were already violating the peace accord signed this week before the Abdudalami Abubakar-led National Peace Commission.\n\nOni said rather than adhering to the tenets of democracy in the conduct of the June 18 Ekiti election, those he described as \u201coppressors\u201d, had allegedly been dehumanising and demobilising his supporters through unlawful arrests.\n\n\n\nOni, who addressed pressmen in Ado Ekiti, alerted INEC, international community, security agencies, observers and other stakeholders, saying \u201cfor this election to be acceptable, the REC must stamp and sign all forms EC8A, EC8B, EC8C and EC8D and not by any other agent or staff. Once the REC stamps and signs, nobody will be able to smuggle any form of fake results.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the imperative of peace for the election to be successful, Oni said: \u201cI will keep to the peace accord. But when you are kidnapping people, it renders every peace document invalid. Let us tell them not to set this state on fire.\n\n\u201cThose who had been going round to kidnap my supporters should be called to order now. They are testing the patience and tolerance of the people. They shouldn\u2019t set this state on fire. If anybody commits an offence and they think they are the authorities to go round and arrest people at night, then the peace accord becomes shattered immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow the Battle will Be Fought\n\nThe APC looks good to win Ekiti South Senatorial District, comprising six local governments \u2013 Gbonyin, Ekiti East, Ikere, Ekiti Southwest, Emure and Ise/Orun. Oyebanji\u2019s running mate, Mrs Mojisola Afuye hails from Ikere. With the votes from Ikere and party chieftains in the area, APC may likely win the zone.\n\n\n\nIn Ekiti South, the APC boasts of bigwigs like the Speaker, Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon Funminiyi Afuye; two members of House of Representatives \u2013 Hon Femi Bamisile and Yemi Adaramodu; the APC State Chairman, Paul Omotoso; former Minister, Dayo Adeyeye and Chief Afolabi Ojuawo. These big wigs that can make things happen for the APC.\n\n\n\nOyebanji and Kolawole are from Ekiti Central Senatorial District, comprising five local government areas \u2013 Ado, Irepodun/Ifelodun, Efon, Ijero and Ekiti West. This is going to be a battleground. Oyebanji is from Ekiti West while Kolawole is from Efon.\n\n\n\nIn the last election, APC won four local governments in the senatorial zone and may still retain at least three this time, with the exception of Efon and Ado Ekiti.\n\n\n\nThe PDP may spring surprise in Efon because Kolawole hails from the town.\n\nThe influence of Segun Oni\u2019s Deputy, Ladi Owolabi in Ado Ekiti is also enormous. The large concentration of pensioners and civil servants, who seem to be backing Oni may also help the SDP tremendously in Ekiti Central.\n\nIn Ekiti Central, the APC also parades political heavyweights like the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo; Deputy governor, Bisi Egbeyemi and Senator Opeyemi Bamidele; These people are capable of doing the magic for APC. Victory for APC Ekiti Central may be by a narrow margin.\n\n\n\nEkiti North Senatorial District has always been a natural habitat and stronghold of Oni since 2007. The district has five councils \u2013 Ido/Osi, Moba, Ilejemeje, Ikole and Oye local governments. Oni is from Ido/Osi.\n\nAPC won the five councils in Ekiti North in the last election, but Oni was still in the ruling party then. As strong as Oni is in Ekiti North, he will meet a match in Fayemi, who is from the area.\n\n\n\nThe Director General, Biodun Oyebanji campaign council, Cyril Fasuyi, is also from Ekiti North. But Segun Oni still has visible and electrifying presence in Ido/Osi, Moba and Ilejemeje\n\nAPC also has influential politicians in Ekiti North. Whichever way it goes, Oni may likely carry the day in Ekiti North.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A Nigerian American student, Rotimi Kukoyi, has been accepted into 15 universities including Harvard University, Yale University, and Stanford University.\n\nHe was also awarded over $2 million in scholarships for the scheme.\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Rotimi Kukoyi \u2014 a high school freshman at the time \u2014 was one of the gifted students selected to appear on the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d Teen Tournament.\n\n\n\nHarvard, Yale, Stanford and Johns Hopkins were among the top universities he had to choose from, but he eventually selected the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to pursue a career in public health.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Abena, a voice assistant wants to preserve African languages",
          "text": "Like many kids who grew up with an elderly relative, Nana Ghartey was used to helping his grandmother out around the house. He was 9 years old, and they lived together in Winneba, a small town in Ghana about 65 kilometres east of the capital city of Accra. Ghartey told TechCabal that because his grandmother didn\u2019t have the best eyesight and had trouble walking around, he regularly had to support her in completing basic tasks and functions: turning the lights in her home on and off, operating the radio and TV, and dialling numbers on her mobile phone on her behalf, and helping her check her phone credit balance. Another reason Ghartey needed to assist his grandmother was that she primarily speaks Fante, a tonal language native to the Akan tribe in Ghana and had trouble understanding the Western languages predominantly used by tech devices.\n\nBut in addition to being a dutiful young boy, Ghartey was also a budding computer geek. His late mother was a programmer at Wang Computers, so even as a toddler, Ghartey was used to being surrounded by them. With time, he slowly began to teach himself how to operate them; once he learned how to type, he was able to help his mum out with small tasks on Microsoft Word.\n\nGhartey, who is now 32, told TechCabal that he credits the needs of his grandmother during his adolescence and his early exposure to computers through his mother\u2019s profession as the inspiration and catalyst, respectively, of the artificial intelligence products he created, initially to help his grandmother out, Kofi, and the one he made for the wider public, Abena. They are the first voice assistants offered in Fante and Twi, respectively.\n\nFor all the opportunities technology affords to customise experiences by catering to users\u2019 needs with hyper-specificity, millions of Africans like Ghartey\u2019s grandmother, who either don\u2019t speak English or other Westernised languages or simply prefer not to, are often excluded from these benefits. The linguistic dominance of Western languages also threatens indigenous African languages; as big, Western-based tech companies spread their influence across Africa, both as service and product providers, and as job creators, indigenous languages are often deprioritised and nudged into the background.\n\nThe invention of the first voice assistant in 1992, Radio Rex, marked an era where computers developed the ability to translate on-screen actions or words into text. By 2010, the wealthiest American tech companies had launched language technologies: Siri was released that year, Google Now in 2012, and Alexa in 2014. But these voice technologies support only Western languages and are unavailable in African languages because of the low-revenue opportunities in African markets.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though these behemoth tech companies lack the means to build products that support indigenous African languages. And, to be fair, some have made efforts to catch up, slowly but surely, like Google Translate\u2019s addition of 10 African languages to the platform last month. Some language experts argue that these companies are the only entities, along with robust AI labs (though often the two are linked), that can solve what they characterise as a \u201clow resources\u201d problem.\n\nGhartey has his own theories about that.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they can\u2019t build such systems for African languages. Surely they can,\u201d he told TechCabal from Accra, where he now lives. \u201cThey\u2019ve prioritised the languages that they want to focus on first.\u201d\n\nSo rather than wait for big tech to do all of the problem solving, he\u2019s been working towards a solution for nearly a decade\u2014with a much smaller team and significantly fewer resources\u2014and has already made headway.\n\n\u201cWorking on voice tech for African languages has been a completely different ball game. Data set out there are based on religious text, so you end up building a system that has a bias for biblical words.\u201d\n\nBy the time Ghartey reached his teenage years, he was consumed by a desire to learn as much about computers as he could. In high school, he was the designated tech guy, often helping his classmates do things like connect to the internet on their phones. (This was 2005 when such functions weren\u2019t yet second nature.) Sometimes, because he wasn\u2019t allowed to use the campus computer lab, he skipped class and sneaked off to internet caf\u00e9s just to spend more time tinkering with them, he recalled to TechCabal. After years spent assisting his grandmother, he had become accustomed to using his skills to help anyone who needed it.\n\nHe still graduated, though, and went on to study Information Technology at the Ghana Telecom University in Accra. But Ghartey taught himself mobile app development and built desktop applications, websites, and eventually mobile games, none of which were part of his school curriculum, by reading the programming textbooks which an uncle who came visiting from the US had left behind. By the time graduation came around, Ghartey graduated top of his class and secured a scholarship to do a master\u2019s in software development, in a partnership programme between his alma mater in Accra and Coventry University, UK.\n\nHis prolonged stay in Accra meant that he would not be able to go back home to continue helping his grandmother. For a while, his younger sister stepped in to assist her, but eventually she moved out, too. Even after Ghartey received his master\u2019s, he stayed back in Accra and went on to build his mobile app development company, Mobobi LLC. But he knew he needed to come up with a solution to assist his grandmother in operating her tech devices and performing little chores, and quickly. After years of obsessive learning about computers, he knew the solution would be AI-driven, but at the time, he knew nothing about AI development.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. I remember the sleepless nights reading research papers and benchmarking frameworks and tools to find the right solution for my grandmother. I knew that if I intended to bootstrap and ship a production build to the masses, I\u2019d need to further hone my skills in AI, so I set on a mission to educate myself on what was required, \u201d Ghartey told TechCabal.\n\nFirst, he addressed the most immediate need: that of his grandmother. Using her voice and that of his sister\u2019s as data, he built Kofi, a voice assistant that supported Fante, his grandmother\u2019s preferred language and one spoken by 6 million Ghanaians. The product enabled her to use mobile apps without having to scroll through the home screen, which was difficult for her due to her impaired vision. All she had to do was tap the side of the button to launch the Kofi app, and she could instantly receive news updates, play music, stream radio programmes, and follow Twitter trends\u2014curated by the AI with human moderators to prevent misinformation\u2014without having a Twitter account.\n\nGhartey said that when he introduced her to Kofi and asked her to try it out, she initially thought she was interacting with a real person and became frustrated at times when the voice assistant didn\u2019t comply with some of her commands. Ghartey had to explain to her some of Kofi\u2019s limitations, but that process helped him recognise how useful a native voice assistant could be for the wider public. In order to serve them, he would need to build a voice assistant in Ghana\u2019s most widely spoken language: Twi.\n\nThis would prove to be a much larger undertaking than Kofi. First of all, Ghartey didn\u2019t have nearly as much data to work with initially, and he already knew the next iteration would require a large data set so that he could offer the product in several different dialects in order to avoid bias toward certain intonations. Secondly, Twi, like many other languages in the south of the Sahara, is tonal; accent marks dictate tones and make a difference in communication, which demanded even more research.\n\nAnother important factor to consider was access. In Winneba, where he lived with his grandmother, internet connection was patchy and inconsistent. Ghartey didn\u2019t want his users to worry about constantly having to purchase data in order to use the app, which meant that Abena would need to function offline. (For context, with Apple\u2019s Siri, this offline feature is only available to users with iOS 15.) Abena\u2019s offline operation was also an effort to cut costs on his end; online operation would have required a server that processed thousands of user requests from users in real time, and thus enormous computing power from costly cloud servers.\n\nBut Ghartey knew his efforts would be worth it. He spent 6 years building Abena AI, and released it in the Google Play Store this April as a Mobobi product. (At that point, Mobobi had already gained some traction for Real Piano Teacher, a popular game that has amassed more than 20 million downloads and is the first Ghanaian-made game on Google Play Pass.) Just like the features offered on Kofi, users can check trending news on Twitter; follow weather reports; check, transfer, and recharge their airtime balances; and transfer money with their preferred mobile payment app, all using voice commands on Abena AI. The offline mode also supports an in-app community feature that allows users to send text messages, images, and videos with each other.\n\nThe reception was immediately enthusiastic. Just a few days after launching Abena AI, a health influencer shared a demo of the app on Twitter, which catapulted it to trending topic popularity and demonstrated the need of a voice assistant offered in a language that was the second most spoken in the country after English.\n\nSimilar to the way his grandmother benefitted from Kofi, Ghartey realised that in addition to being more linguistically inclusive, Abena AI also served people with visual impairments who speak or preferred to speak Twi, many of whom were elders. They became fast fans of Abena AI, he said, because it made it easier for them to check and recharge their credits from their phones, which otherwise required tech-savviness or Western language literacy.\n\nOnce Abena AI was out in the world, it was time to refine it, a task that turned out to be just as challenging as building the voice assistant in the first place. He couldn\u2019t afford to pay professional linguists to help him with the training data for Twi, so he crowdsourced translation data from users by using third-party pop-up apps that requested translations. That proved unsuccessful when he discovered that the responses users provided were either inaccurate, or complete diversions of the words he asked them to translate. He tried incentivising users by offering to pay 5 cedis ($0.6) per translation, which worked for a while, but eventually he ran out of money. He remained tenacious, though, and eventually hired religious translators who worked on church-related translations in Twi. Still, he said he is always on the lookout for more ways to gather information about the language.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress,\u201d he said, adding that he accounts for the context of every word and crowdsources information about dialects from Abena AI app users. \u201cYou need lots of data to build these models.\u201d\n\nLike Google Nest and Amazon Echo\u2014both hardware using their respective company\u2019s voice recognition software\u2014Abena also functions as a home automation system. Abena AI works with smart lights, smart plugs, and other smart home devices.\n\nIn the nearest future, Ghartey is looking to ship an update that will see Abena support 5 more Ghanaian languages and hire professional natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning engineers to speed up his work and help him ship updates to other African languages like Swahili, Kinyarwanda, Afrikaans, Sesotho, and isiZulu.\n\nGhartey works on Abena AI for 3 hours on workdays, while working full time at his company Mobobi, to allow him to keep bootstrapping it.\n\n\u201cThe feedback from a few people who tried Abena AI out before it was released kept us going. That smile on a 60-year-old\u2019s face as he listened to his airtime being read out without stress\u2014it was paving the way for people to perform tasks easily, tasks they\u2019d never been able to do in the past,\u201d Ghartey said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was co-authored by Koromone Koroye, Hannatu Asheloge, and Ngozi Chukwu\n\nAfrica\u2019s technology ecosystem as we know it is thriving and primed for astronomical growth and success in this decade. Over the past 5 years, our ecosystem has celebrated several key milestones:\n\nExits and acquisitions in the millions.\n\nImpressive funding rounds ranging from seed to Series C.\n\nThe arrival of new angel investors and venture funds eager to serve African entrepreneurs.\n\nBusiness and product expansions into multiple regions within Africa.\n\nWhile these milestones are valid and deserve amplification, we cannot ignore the diversity elephant in our meeting rooms, tech conferences, pitch stages, and panel sessions. Funding received by female-owned startups is still significantly low compared to what their male counterparts receive from foreign and local investors. In this widely-read piece by Max Culliver and Africa: The Big Deal, they paint a gloomy picture of existing gender disparities within Africa\u2019s venture funding space. In 2021, 93% of the funding in Africa went to male-led startups \u2013 a pretty shocking figure by any standard.\n\nBut the news isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. This year alone, we\u2019ve seen more African female founders raise capital for their startups and get accepted into reputable accelerators like Techstars Toronto Accelerator (Techstars Toronto) and Y Combinator (YC). This article aims to recognize some African female founders making great strides across various industries and sectors on the continent.\n\nThis list comprises women who are mothers, advocates, readers, dancers, hikers, swimmers, entrepreneurs, founders, and so much more.

But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Many questions are currently running riot in the minds of many Nigerians about the next job of the out-going Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State.\n\nWith the conclusion of the off-season gubernatorial election in the state Saturday to early morning of Sunday (today), his exit from the Government House Ado-Ekiti has become sacrosanct.\n\nFayemi has enjoyed his tenure as the job has taken him to every part of Nigeria by virtue of his position as Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF).\n\nBefore he mounted the soap box the second time to seek for a fresh mandate in 2018, Kayode had been a made-man, having held different influential positions across the globe.\n\nAs he takes a bow from office in a few months time, having installed a successor, he must have envisioned his future, part of which must have informed his recent foray into the presidential race that suffered a hiccup.\n\nIndeed, he must have wished to step up on the nation\u2019s political ladder when he purchased his party\u2019s form to contest for its presidential ticket for the 2023 general election. But the high wire politics in the All Progressives Congress (APC) forced him to recant, stepping down at the eleventh hour for Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a development many analysts have described as a trade off.\n\nFayemi was among the 23 presidential aspirants screened by his party. While a number of them were reportedly not cleared, he was among the lucky ones that scaled through.\n\nRead also: Ekiti elects 7th governor since return of democracy\n\nIn Nigeria, the dream of many governors in their last tenures, is to go to the Senate, where elder politicians who had been everything in the nation\u2019s political arena, retire to after active service. But Fayemi neither picked a form for the senatorial race nor coerced the headquarters of his party to retrieve a mandate already given to another person to enable him be at the Senate by all means. Observers say that the only hope for him to remain politically relevant could be if his party wins the presidential election in which case he could be given a ministerial slot.\n\nFayemi was minister of Solid Mineral Development before he stepped back to Ekiti to contest the 2018 gubernatorial election and won.\n\nIt is unlikely if he would return to his teaching or journalism profession or other fields of endeavour where he had excelled before venturing into politics, after the expiration of his tenure of office.\n\nThe experience in Nigeria is that political office holders who left their professions never return to such professions. They hang around the corridors of power.\n\nIt is also expected that he would take active role in the presidential campaign of Tinubu by investing time and resources for an expected harvest.\n\nHaving nursed and helped Oyebanji to win a resounding victory at the election, Fayemi must however, avoid the mistake of his colleagues who failed to realise that yesterday is no longer today.\n\nBeing meddlesome has created a lot of bad blood between many predecessors and successors. He will do well to resist the urge to think he is still in charge of Ekiti when Oyebanji should be calling the shots.\n\nA peep into Fayemi\u2019s life\n\nAfter his first degree in 1984, he proceeded on the mandatory one year National Youth service Corps from 1985 to 1986, during which he was a lecturer at the Nigeria-Police Training College in Sokoto. After his service year, he served as a Research Officer at Development & Management Consultants in Ikeja between 1987-1989.\n\nWhen he moved to the UK to pursue his doctoral studies between 1991 to 1993 he worked as a Research Officer at the African Research and Information Bureau in London. In 1992, he was a Tutorial Fellow at the War Studies Department at Kings College, London during his doctoral studies. Later between 1993 to 1995, he was the Strategy Development Adviser of Deptford City Challenge in London and later served as the Secretary General of the Media Empowerment for Africa (The Radio Foundation) in London between 1995-1997.\n\nHe was also a journalist with The Guardian and City Tempo; and the Editor of Nigeria-Now, a defunct political monthly magazine.[6] In 1997, Fayemi returned to Nigeria where he established the Centre for Democracy and Development Centre for Democracy & Development, a research and training institution dedicated to the study and promotion of democratic development, peace-building and human security in Africa, where he served as Director from 1997 to 2006.\n\nKayode Fayemi has taught in Africa, Europe, the Americas and Asia. He has also served as an adviser on transitional justice, regional integration, constitutionalism, security sector reform and civil-military relations issues to various governments, inter-governmental institutions and development agencies. He was the main technical adviser to Nigeria\u2019s The Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission (Oputa Panel), which investigated past abuses and served on the Presidential Implementation Committees on Security Sector Reform, NEPAD and the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nFayemi was technical expert to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on small arms and light weapons and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa on governance issues.[7] At other times he has served as a consultant to the OECD on Security Sector Reform and chaired the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative\u2019s Committee of Experts on developing guiding principles and mechanisms of Constitution making in Commonwealth Africa.\n\nNow, with a robust international exposure, would Fayemi return to his forte in the academia of continue to loiter on the corridors of power.\n\nIt is said that once one is politically exposed in Nigeria, the aroma of free food and perks of office no longer allows one to leave the arena. This can be confirmed from the array of old politicians who before their forays into politics were accomplished technocrats, medical doctors, among others, but who after leaving political office refused to go back to their professions.",

          "text": "Sunday, June 12, 2022, was Democracy Day. It provided a fresh chance for Nigerians to reflect on the events surrounding June 12, 1993. It was also a time to reflect on the story of Nigeria since that red-letter day, and to think about what might have been, perhaps.\n\nNigeria as a nation, and Nigerians as a people, are not good at stock-taking. There is no agreed, common narrative concerning the past. This includes a bloody civil war in which more than one million souls perished. It also includes pogroms in which several citizens of a part of the country were mercilessly hewn down by citizens of another part of the country. It includes military coups, and IPOB and herdsmen, and warped events that have led the country to its present sad pass.\n\nNobody has agreed to any version of the story. Nobody has apologised for anything. The Oputa Panel, which was allegedly meant to be Nigeria\u2019s equivalent of the Archbishop Tutu-led Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, did not go anywhere towards showing Nigerians embracing the spirit of Truth, not to speak of Reconciliation. The Nigerian nation itself, it seems, is founded on a fragile lie, and if the roots of the structure are scrutinised too closely, there is a realistic fear that the whole superstructure could crumble.\n\nThe Nigerian nation itself, it seems, is founded on a fragile lie, and if the roots of the structure are scrutinised too closely, there is a realistic fear that the whole superstructure could crumble\n\nWhat is heard, regularly, is about the \u2018unity\u2019 and \u2018indissolubility\u2019 of the Nigerian entity. The first item is non-existent, and the second is clearly bogus as things stand.\n\nJune 12 is now being celebrated annually in Nigeria as \u2018Democracy Day,\u2019 with a public holiday and the ritual of public events celebrating the life of Bashorun MKO Abiola.\n\nBut to show the absurdity of Nigeria\u2019s relationship with its history, even June 12 itself is unfinished business, almost 30 years after it happened. While some of the actors have since died, many of the principals are still very much alive. The man who is quoted publicly to have said he would shoot MKO Abiola if the power was handed over to him, later went on to become the president of the Nigerian Senate, and is still very much alive. The military \u2018president\u2019 who oversaw the whole charade \u2018stepped aside\u2019 and retired to his hilltop redoubt in Minna. There is no remorse, no apology, no contrition. So,what exactly is the nation celebrating?\n\nA big fish among the villains of the piece, who may be dubbed \u2018the contractor,\u2019 for it would be stretching credibility to its elastic limits to pretend he was acting out of conviction, was a billionaire from Oguta who lived a colourful, controversial life, and died at the ripe old age of 84, barely one month ago. His name is Francis Arthur Nzeribe.\n\nNzeribe was born in Oguta, Imo State, on the 2nd of November 1938. He lost his mother while still a student in primary school. His father was away in the United Kingdom, studying for a law degree. Catholic priests close to the family took over his care, and on completing primary school, he attended Bishop Shanahan College, Orlu, and later Holy Ghost College, Owerri. He moved to Lagos in 1957 and started work with Nigerian Port Authority. A year later, he obtained a scholarship to study Marine Engineering in England.\n\nWithin two years he was making money selling insurance policies to black people who had immigrated to the UK.\n\nHe returned to Nigeria in 1961. He did various jobs, including short stints with some oil companies.\n\nBut he was restless, and soon he was back in the UK. This time he opened a Public Relations firm known as JEAFAN with some friends. The firm worked with some African diplomatic missions. Arthur, who was always smartly dressed and perfectly groomed, wormed his way into the affections of some African leaders. He impressed Ghanaian leader, the Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah, and started doing Public Relations work for him.\n\nThose were heady days in nationalistic and pan-African circles in London and Accra.\n\nBut in a manner that showed the transactional nature of the man, he had no qualms about deploying his company to burnish the image of the government of General Joseph Ankrah, which came to power after Nkrumah was dethroned in a military coup.\n\nAfter Ankrah himself was forced to resign from office, Nzeribe set up a company known as FANZ in London with a wide-ranging portfolio which included arms trading, oil brokerage, construction, publishing, and property. He had interests in the Middle East and the Gulf States. His wealth grew exponentially.\n\nIn Nigeria too, Nzeribe set up some companies. He also became involved in politics, to which he brought the same unemotional, Machiavellian attitude he had exhibited earlier. He was reputed to have spent several millions of pounds to win a senatorial seat in his home-state of Imo.\n\nHis lasting impact on Nigerian history was to set up a shadowy, quaintly named organisation known as the Association for Better Nigeria (ABN). The richly funded group claimed to have millions of followers and carried out all manner of activities in aid of General Babangida\u2019s agenda to elongate his rule, the high-point of which was obtaining a midnight ruling from Justice Bassey Ikpeme\u2019s High court in Abuja on June 10, 1993, designed to stop the election that would be won by Chief MKO Abiola. This, with other actions, would lead to the annulment of the election and the death of Abiola.\n\nNzeribe would go on later to serve two terms in the Senate and be appointed as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party of Nigeria.\n\nBut what he will be remembered for in years to come is the role he played in the sinister, high-stakes skullduggery that aborted the election of 1993 and, most ironically, resulted in the designation of June 12 as Democracy Day in Nigeria.",

          "text": "The World Bank has said that inflation shock is projected to push about 15 million more Nigerians into poverty between 2020 and 2022.\n\nThe Washington-based bank said this in its latest Nigeria Development Update report, titled, \u2018The Continuing Urgency of Business Unusual\u2019.\n\nThe report read in part, \u201cOverall, the \u2018inflation shock\u2019 is estimated to result in about 15 million more Nigerians living in poverty between 2020 and 2022.\u201d\n\nThe lending bank stressed the need for reducing the rising rate of inflation, which is pushing millions of Nigerians into poverty.\n\nAlthough the World Bank says inflation in 2022 is projected to be 15.5 per cent, Nigeria\u2019s inflation as of May this year is 17.71 per cent, which is higher than the World Bank\u2019s projection.\n\nThe lending bank further said that Nigeria has one of the highest inflation rates in the world.\n\nAccording to the bank, inflationary pressures in the country are driven by certain policy distortions.\n\n\u201cInflationary pressures were compounded by policy distortions, in particular (i) lack of flexible foreign exchange management, (ii) trade restrictions, and (iii) conflicting monetary policy goals.\u201d\n\nIt further disclosed that global supply shocks exacerbated inflationary pressures and increased the urgency.\n\nAside from the policy distortions, the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have contributed to rising inflation.\n\nIt was also stated that the financing of the fiscal deficit and trade restrictions by the Central Bank of Nigeria contributes to fuelling inflationary pressures, and Nigeria will have one of the highest inflation rates in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2022.\n\nThe bank also said that poverty might be becoming entrenched in certain Nigerian households, particularly in rural areas in the north.\n\nIn combating poverty, certain reforms were recommended, which include fiscal, trade, and exchange-rate policy that could help diversify the economy; invigorating structural transformation; and creating good, productive jobs, especially wage jobs.\n\nWorld Bank economists, Jonathan Lain and Jakob Engel, have said that rising inflation, persistent population growth, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine are threatening Nigeria\u2019s poverty reduction aspiration.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had in June 2021 inaugurated the National Steering Committee of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nThis, he said, re-echoes his commitment to lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years, with a well-researched framework for implementation and funding.\n\nDespite this, the rate of poverty in the country seems to be on the rise, driven significantly by inflation.\n\nIn its \u2018A Better Future for All Nigerians: 2022 Nigeria Poverty Assessment\u2019 report, the World Bank said that poverty reduction stagnated since 2015, with more Nigerians falling below the poverty line over the years.\n\nThe Washington-based bank added that the number of poor Nigerians is projected to hit 95.1 million in 2022.\n\nThe World Bank also warned that many non-poor Nigerians were only one small shock away from falling into poverty.\n\nAccording to the lender, such a shock can be induced by the issues of climate or conflict which could further threaten Nigeria\u2019s poverty reduction efforts.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) had also projected that the rate of inflation in Nigeria is expected to remain elevated in 2022.",

          "text": "Olusesan Laoye\n\nAt last the Ekiti governorship election has been held and a winner has emerged.\n\nIt was a history making election, which saw a political party taking over from itself, which has never happened before in the history of the state.\n\nAt the end of the polls in which the result was announced early morning on Sunday June 19 2022, the All Progressives Congress retained power with its candidate Abiodun Oyebanji beating his two other strong rivals.\n\nThis means that the incumbent governor Kayode Fayemi would hand over to his anointed political son in the same political party, which is historical in the politics of Ekiti State.\n\nBefore now no incumbent has handed over to another person from the same party and no incumbent has won a straight second term but they have always come back to complete their second term. Ayo Fayose and Kayode Fayemi are clear examples.\n\nThe third person who contested the just concluded election under the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Engineer Olusegun Oni who also left the government house and now wanted to come back like Fayose and Fayemi lost in his bid to the APC Oyebamiji who beat him and his Party the (SDP) to second place.\n\nOyebamiji the former Secretary to the Government under the present governor Kayode Fayemi, scored 187,057 votes, defeating his two closest challengers \u2014 Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) who polled 82,211 votes, and Bisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who got 67,457 votes.\n\nThe result came as it was predicted that the real battle was between the APC and the SDP. Before the election Segun Oni was the most favoured and it was said that the only way that could prevent him from clinching the governorship is money, since elections in Nigeria today comes with money and the highest bidder.\n\nAlthough it was said that if the people of Ekiti vote their conscience, nothing would stop Oni who was said to have had no money to spend for the election but relied on the good will of the people to win.\n\nHe was even regarded as the best candidate of the three hot contenders, being a former governor who had ruled the state and is adjudged the best the State ever had.\n\nWhat the election actually meant to him was that he may end his political journey in the State and he may not want to go for the governorship again. Even if he wants to, age and subsequent events which may have over taken his ambition may not be in his favour.\n\nAnother big wig in Ekiti politics who would be seriously battered with the result of the election is former Governor Ayodele Fayose.\n\nIt is said that with the election not favouring his political party, PDP, he would lose control of the party, since he has not been in good terms with other notable leaders of the party who actually patched things up with him for the purpose of the election.\n\nNow that the the party and his annointed candidate, Bisi Kolawole who was believed to have been forced on the party against the wishes of members, a situation which made Oni leave for SDP has lost, it will be difficult for Fayose to hold the party together and he would be blamed by all that he made the the party to lose through the imposition of unpopular candidate against the wishes of the numerous party members and leaders.\n\nThe notion of the members and top shots of the party was that if Oni who had the support of the entire members had not left the party and was given the ticket, the party would have come back to power.\n\nAccording to a member of the party who was contacted on phone by the Business Hallmark last night, \u201cthe arrogance of Fayose made the party to lose to APC. You can imagine the number of votes pulled by Oni and if all of us had come together, it would have been easy victory for the PDP. This means that the party will have to wait for another four years to aspire to be in power.\u201d\n\nThe source hinted that the process of derobing Fayose as the leader of the party in Ekiti State has actually startedo.\n\n\u201cIt will not take long before he looses control because he made us to lose out,\u201d he said.\n\nThe source said the party would now have to work hard for it to do well in other elections coming up in 2023.\n\n\u201cIt is the 2023 elections into various assemblies in the country that can sustain the PDP as a party in the state and make it relevant. Otherwise, I will say that Fayose has killed the party with this governorship election, which ordinarily ought to have been an easy ta\u0137e for the PDP.\u201d\n\nThe person who will benefit greatly from this election is Fayemi because he has proved that he controls the state and this would swell his political pedigree at the national level.\n\nWhat this victory may also indicate is that the State is sure for the Presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nIf the APC had lost the governorship election it would have been a minus for his political ambition and clout in the party both in the state and at the national level, as he would not be a force to reckon with.\n\nBut now he has shown that he is in control of the state, which he governed for eight years. Though not consecutively.\n\nWith the final result below it was said that the last may not have been heard about the election and that the SDP is likely to contest the result in the law court.\n\nThough no official statement has been made as at the time of filing this report one of the stalwarts of the party and the Director General of the Segun Oni Campaign organisation, Ambassador Dare Bejide who had the assurance that the people of Ekiti State would vote Oni who he regarded as the best, hinted that the party would not accept the result as he believed that there were discrepancies and manipulation in the result announced.\n\nHe claimed that the strong pillars of the SDP were intimidated and arrested a day to the election with the influence of those in power at the top and in the state.\n\nThe governorship candidate of the SDP, Oni had said the same thing on Friday afternoon claiming that his members were being arrested and taken to an unknown destination.\n\nMeanwhile reports indicated that there were jubilations and merriment in Ado Ado Ekiti, the State capital and other parts of the state yesterday, by the APC members in respect of the victory of their candidate Oyebamiji.\n\nBelow are the final results of the election in all the local governments of the state.\n\nIjero LG\n\nAPC 13754\n\nPDP 4897\n\nSDP 5006\n\nEmure\n\nAPC. 7728\n\nPDP. 2610\n\nSDP. 3445\n\nEKITI SW\n\nAPC \u2013 9679\n\nSDP \u2013 4577\n\nPDP \u2013 4474\n\nIKERE\n\nAPC \u2013 12086\n\nSDP \u2013 1943\n\nPDP \u2013 3789\n\nILEJEMEJE\n\nAPC 4357\n\nSDP. 2344\n\nPDP 1157\n\nMOBA\n\nAPC 11609\n\nSDP. 4904\n\nPDP. 3530\n\nEFON\n\nAPC 4012\n\nSDP 339\n\nPDP 6303\n\nEKITI WEST\n\nAPC 15322\n\nSDP. 3863\n\nPDP 3386\n\nIREPODUN\n\nAPC 13125\n\nSDP. 5010\n\nPDP 4712\n\nOYE LG\n\nAPC 13396\n\nSDP 5391\n\nPDP 4122\n\nISE\n\nAPC 8074\n\nSDP 5909\n\nPDP 2588\n\nIDO/OSI\n\nAPC 10321\n\nSDP 9489\n\nPDP 2871\n\nIKOLE\n\nAPC 16417\n\nSDP 5736\n\nPDP 6266\n\nADO LG\n\nAPC 23831\n\nSDP 15214\n\nPDP 7575\n\nEKITI EAST\n\nAPC 12099\n\nSDP 4982\n\nPDP 5230\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition parties have alleged that the election was with a lot of malpractices as they accused one the political parties of vote buying.\n\nSecurity operatives was also said to have arrested some people alleged to be agents of the ruling APC for an undisclosed offence at some polling units\n\nEven the candidate of the APC was alleged to have been involved, the allegations which he denied saying there was nothing like vote buying by any member of his political party.",

          "text": "The People\u2019s Republic of China and Nigeria have mapped out ways to strengthen the movie industries of both countries as collaborative means of poverty alleviation in Nigeria.\n\nThis was the focus of the launch of the Doc-China Festival, co-organised by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China and China Global Television Network (CGTN) in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCultural Affairs Counselor of the Chinese Embassy and the Director of the China Cultural Center in Nigeria, Mr Li Xuda, in his remarks said the effort is to boost Nigerian Nollywood with some assistance to help use the platform to fight poverty in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor many years, the Nigerian government has been working hard to lift more ordinary people out of poverty. From what I know, in 2021, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari Inaugurated the Steering Committee of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) to achieve his mission of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within a decade,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event presented a documentary entitled \u201cvoices from the frontline: China\u2019s War on Poverty\u201d jointly produced by CGTN and the Kuhn Foundation of the United States. The documentary provided an intimate portrayal of China\u2019s historic anti-poverty campaign, which in the last 40 years has removed over 800 million people out of extreme poverty and the lessons for Nigeria.\n\nThe collaboration was also aimed to promote the cultural exchange between China and other countries, and let the world better understand China, people as well as its culture. Over 50 of the CGTN\u2019s best video production including award-winning documentaries will be screened at selected television channels from around the world during the Doc-China Festival, which will kick off with a grand ceremony in Beijing in June and go on till the end of this year.\n\nThose video productions will explore themes including food, travel, people\u2019s lives, social development etc.\n\nXuda said \u201cAs we know, both China and Nigeria are large countries with developed film and television industries. There are not only many film studios, productions companies in the two countries, but also numerous excellent professional talents including screenwriters, directors and movie stars. In 2021, China\u2019s movie industry produced over 700 movies.\n\n\u201cThanks to the rising living standard and entertainment demand in China, there were over 10, 000 cinemas in China. From this you can imagine how many moviegoers there are in China. The Box Office revenue was growing as well.

          "text": "The People\u2019s Republic of China and Nigeria have mapped out ways to strengthen the movie industries of both countries as collaborative means of poverty alleviation in Nigeria.\n\nThis was the focus of the launch of the Doc-China Festival, co-organised by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of China and China Global Television Network (CGTN) in Abuja on Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCultural Affairs Counselor of the Chinese Embassy and the Director of the China Cultural Center in Nigeria, Mr Li Xuda, in his remarks said the effort is to boost Nigerian Nollywood with some assistance to help use the platform to fight poverty in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor many years, the Nigerian government has been working hard to lift more ordinary people out of poverty. From what I know, in 2021, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari Inaugurated the Steering Committee of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) to achieve his mission of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty within a decade,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event presented a documentary entitled \u201cvoices from the frontline: China\u2019s War on Poverty\u201d jointly produced by CGTN and the Kuhn Foundation of the United States. The documentary provided an intimate portrayal of China\u2019s historic anti-poverty campaign, which in the last 40 years has removed over 800 million people out of extreme poverty and the lessons for Nigeria.\n\nThe collaboration was also aimed to promote the cultural exchange between China and other countries, and let the world better understand China, people as well as its culture. Over 50 of the CGTN\u2019s best video production including award-winning documentaries will be screened at selected television channels from around the world during the Doc-China Festival, which will kick off with a grand ceremony in Beijing in June and go on till the end of this year.\n\nThose video productions will explore themes including food, travel, people\u2019s lives, social development etc.\n\nXuda said \u201cAs we know, both China and Nigeria are large countries with developed film and television industries. There are not only many film studios, productions companies in the two countries, but also numerous excellent professional talents including screenwriters, directors and movie stars. In 2021, China\u2019s movie industry produced over 700 movies.\n\n\u201cThanks to the rising living standard and entertainment demand in China, there were over 10, 000 cinemas in China. From this you can imagine how many moviegoers there are in China. The Box Office revenue was growing as well. In the same year, China reported the highest box office revenue worldwide, at over $7 billion.\u201d\n\nThe Director, International Cultural Relations of the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, Memunat Ladi Idu-Lah in her remarks praised the efforts of China in the movie industry.\n\n\u201cChina and Nigeria have huge potential for cooperation in the film industry.

The court ordered that the bank should pay him because the state banks with us. The judge in his judgement barred the defendants from appealing and ordered 24 hours for the implementation of the judgment\u201d.\n\nAs a result of that judgment, the three branches of Zenith Bank on bank road, Douglas and Wetheral were sealed from Thursday, June 2nd to Friday, 3rd.\n\nApparently, irked by the inability of bank customers to access transactions, officials of the Imo state government allegedly led by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Special Duties, Nze Chinasa Nwaneri accompanied by a team of Police operatives allegedly attacked and abducted the four officials.\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association Owerri branch in her press statement raised an alarm over the disappearance of the said four officials who were later discovered at the Anti-kidnapping unit of the Imo State Police command.\n\nNBA Owerri Secretary, Chinedu Agu, in a press release regretted that \u201cIn a manner most brutish and saddening, reminiscent of the Stone Age, the said Mr. Chinasa Nwaneri, armed with the order of the state high court, led a legion of heavily armed policemen and fierce-looking thugs to unseal the bank, and in the process brutalized and arrested the said Court Officials, who while on official duty, stopped by the bank to inquire the reason for the heavy presence of security men and thugs in a Bank sealed by a subsisting Order of their court\u201d.\n\nFurther, the statement read \u201cWe, therefore, register our collective disaffection with the role played by the State Government, its agents, and the Court, who assumed appellate jurisdiction over a judgment delivered by another court of coordinate jurisdiction, in a manner that ridicules the sacred tenet of court hierarchy, disparages our judicial system, mocks the principles of rule of law and scorns our noble legal profession.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Leadership, Agu maintained that the National Industrial Court Owerri branch was still under lock and key as directed by the President, saying \u201cNo, he has not vacated the order yet. You can quote me, I have no problem with that. I am giving you a fact\u201d.\n\nThough the banks have been unsealed, activities are yet to return to normalcy at the National Industrial Court as the place is still under lock and key while lawyers scramble for new hearing dates.\n\nUnfortunately, those bearing the brunt are innocent citizens battling illegal dismissal by employers or the reverse, not forgetting the cost of appearances of lawyers by already stretched litigants.\n\nOne of the victims is the two factions of the Nigerian Union of Journalists in the state who are currently at loggerheads over who are the constitutionally elected officials of the union, and several thousands of litigants.\n\nUnfortunately, while litigants worry themselves to death, the state government and concerned authorities appear to be far from an amicable solution.\n\nAccording to the state Commissioner for Information, Chief Declan Emelumba, the NICN officials were on an illegal assignment. He said in a statement \u201cunfolding facts indicate that the police that sealed the Zenith bank offices in Owerri on Wednesday were on an illegal operation\u201d.\n\nAccording to Emelumba, \u201cfrom the emerging facts it was clear that the former Deputy Governor, Eze Madumere was in concert with some opposition politicians to sabotage the state\u2019s economy and ultimately embarrass Governor Hope Uzodinma who had pledged to pay workers and pensioners promptly at the end of every month.\u201d\n\nEmelumba maintained that the Garnishee order which led to the sealing of branches of Zenith Bank in the state was a calculated attempt to cripple the economy of the State by denying workers their pay for the month of May 2022.\n\nTo compound issues, a group, Imo Coalition For Justice, Peace and True Democracy took to the streets of Owerri, to protest against what they called \u2018an attempt to corner N1.9 Billion of Imo State funds by the former Governor of Imo State Senator Rochas Okorocha through His former Deputy, Prince Eze Madumere.\n\nThe group chanted solidarity songs in support of the state government and walked round the state capital including the official lodge of the judge to protest the judgement of Justice Galadima.\n\nThat singular action in front of the official residence sent fear and apprehension into the jurist who probably for fear of his safety has ordered the sealing of the NICN till further notice.\n\nSecretary of the group, Mr. Ahumaraeze Ikechukwu had accused the presiding judge of collusion with the past administration of Rochas Okorocha to swindle the state of the funds public opinion termed outrageous.\n\nHe said \u201cWith profound humility to your Lordship. We raise that Justice Suleiman Galadima has given a contentious judgement against the state government of Imo State likely to cause grievous, economic sabotage for his personal benefit. We pray my lord to address the issue in the interest of justice.\u201d\n\nAlready, condemnation has trailed the action of the state government especially since Governor Hope Uzodimma assumed office through the pronouncement of the Supreme court.\n\nA renowned political commentator, Barr. Kissinger Ikeokwu had this to say, Court officers were whisked away to unknown destinations. Their crime is that they performed their lawful duties. This is the same man that became governor by virtue of our courts. These same people would criticise Okorocha for not obeying Court orders. But today they are unravelled as the biggest abusers of the rule of law and due process.\u201d\n\nAlready NBA Owerri branch had condemned the state government for using a court of coordinate jurisdiction to vacate the order.\n\nChinedu Agu, the NBA scribe had said \u201crather than challenge the same judgment in the Court of Appeal, the Imo State Government, obtained a Court Order from a High Court sitting in Owerri (a court of coordinate jurisdiction) restraining Zenith Bank Plc from obeying the judgment of the National Industrial Court, Owerri.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, register our collective disaffection with the role played by the state government, its agents, and the Court, who assumed appellate jurisdiction over a judgment delivered by another court of coordinate jurisdiction, in a manner that ridicules the sacred tenet of court hierarchy, disparages our judicial system, mocks the principles of rule of law and scorns our noble legal profession.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Court of Appeal in Owerri has ordered the unsealing of the bank and adjourned the hearing to June 30th.\n\nJustice Rita Pemu also granted the relief sought by the Imo state government to enable it to file its appeal before the appeal court against a judgement of the National Industrial Court in Owerri ordering the state government to pay N1.9billion to a former deputy governor of the state, Eze Madumere, being his benefits while in office.\n\nThe two reliefs granted were: a stay of execution on the unsealing of Zenith Bank branches in Owerri and the right for the Imo state government to appeal the absolute garnishee Order in favour of Madumere.\n\nLike the proverbial saying \u201cwhen two elephants fight, the grass suffers\u201d may be playing out, as wrongly dismissed staff wait endlessly for another cycle of dates to avenge their maltreatment.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn continued efforts to grow the economy through the mining sector, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite, Thursday, has wooed investors abroad with huge gold, lead-zinc, iron-ore and barite deposits in Nigeria.\n\nAdegbite made the revelations\n\nin his paper titled \u2018The Mechanisms of Transparency and Commitment in Mining Governance as Tool for Attracting Foreign Direct Investment to Nigeria\u2019 on the Nigerian Day at the \u20182022 Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada, PDAC, International Convention, Trade Show and Investors Exchange\u2019 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nHe also assured them of the Buhari-led administration\u2019s resolve to give the best of incentives never found anywhere in the world to interested and serious investors.\n\nHe made it clear that Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals are ranked among the best in quality and quantity as these minerals are rated highest in return on investment, because they are closer to surface and low cost in production.\n\nHe added that the Nigerian Government was seriously focusing on the solid minerals sector, which investors and investments bare top on its priority list as as far as policies are concerned which make the mining sector very business friendly because of mechanisms put in place to promote ease of doing business as this is built on strong policy and regulatory structure is very the years.\n\nMeanwhile, according to him, the robust structure, line by line, was the reason Nigeria has been seeking to attract investment into the sector.\n\nHowever, the Minister acknowledged the the fact that global economies have experienced unprecedented challenges since the break out of COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result the conference is holding in June.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has been part of this event for several years because of our determination to see exponential growth of the mining sector\u2019s contribution to our GDP more than it has done in the past forty years.\n\n\u201cWe are here to collaborate and network with global leaders, professionals, investors, Chief Executives of junior, mid-tier and major mining companies. It is also on this premise that the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, vowed to pull resources and consolidate on the 2016 Roadmap for the Growth and Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry.\n\n\u201cIn pursuit of the goals set forth in the roadmap, the government initiated an ambitious reform regime in the sector, the flagship of which was the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP, designed to rapidly generate bankable geoscientific data with the aim of de-risking the sector and attracting high caliber investments.\n\n\u201cTarget minerals under the first phase include Gold, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore, and the Battery Minerals, among others. The contractors have executed and completed the exploration works on Gold, Platinum Group of Elements, PGEs, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore and Barites.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is an ongoing review of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act 2007, aimed at bringing legislation into conformity with global best practices, limiting the role of government to that of regulation, and creating the space for the private sector to maintain a more expansive presence in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe early evidence that our framework is on the right track is the inflow of notable investments.\n\n\u201cThese include Thor Exploration Limited\u2019s Segilola Gold Mine Project, in Osun State, which has an initial production capacity of 80,000 ounces of gold annually, representing the first large-scale Gold Mine in Nigeria.In June last year, we commissioned the Dukia Gold & Precious Metals Refinery, DGPMR, Project.\n\n\u201cThe company set out to be a foremost indigenous refiner and trader of gold and other precious metals. Its potential impact on the gold sector is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\n\u201cBy providing offtake opportunities through the establishment of Precious Metals Buying Centres, it serves as a spur for more small and medium scale mining investment, while its refinery symbolizes its focus on value addition in the gold and precious metals industry in Nigeria and West Africa.\n\n\u201cA similarly remarkable investment is the integrated Iron Ore Mining and Processing Plant set up by African Natural Resources and Mines Limited (ANRML) in Kaduna, which has an initial production capacity of 4.704 million tons of iron per annum and will scale up to 5.88 million tons per annum by 2025.\n\n\u201cIn line with the economic diversification plan of the Government, my Ministry has issued a Request for Qualifications for bidders interested in receiving concessions to begin the production of bitumen in Nigeria as the country possesses about 42 billion tons of proven reserves of bitumen, estimated to be the sixth largest in the world.\n\n\u201cThese blocks are located close to key ports for export purposes and import of mining equipment, and railways cutting across areas with bitumen deposits.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we seek for suitably qualified investors with pre-requisite experience, technological expertise and financial capacity for the development of bitumen resources in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdegbite also made it known that, \u201cResults on Greenfields and Brownfields are on process to be declared for investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe have also commenced the process of retrieving Nigeria\u2019s colonial geological data from the United Kingdom by engaging the British Geological Survey, BGS, to build a national electronic geo-data archiving management system to be called the Nigerian Geo-Data Center at the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA.\n\n\u201cThis would provide easy access to geoscience data for prospective investors on potential areas to target for exploration and mining within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, he made it known to that there are a lot of incentives enshrined in the Nigeria Minerals and Mining Act, 2007, which include:Customs and import duties waiver for plant, machinery and equipment imported for mining operations; Tax holidays of between three to five years as applicable;Free transferability of funds and permission to retain and use earned foreign exchange;Capital allowances of up to 95% of qualifying capital expenditure; Deductibility of Environmental Costs (money meant for environmental remediation will be tax free); and100% ownership of mineral properties.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, part of our modest efforts towards achieving the desired aim is repositioning the Mining Cadastre Office to promote transparency in mineral title administration.\n\n\u201cThe processes have been streamlined to enable investors to apply online and obtain licenses and leases within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom the revenue drive perspective, the Nigerian Mining Sector has demonstrated a marked improvement despite the challenges of the pandemic. The secret of the sudden jump can be attributed to the introduction of \u201cFirst Come, First Served\u201d and \u201cUse it or Lose it\u201d in the licensing administration,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe further stated that this has helped to re-organize, eliminate speculators, and led to the revocation of about 1,566 mineral titles, activated many dormant licenses and increased revenue inflow into the treasury.",

Vote buying and other forms of electoral corruption freeze out the less wealthy candidates and parties.\u201d\n\nSERAP said, \u201cWealthy candidates and their sponsors ought not to be allowed to profit from their crimes. We are concerned that impunity for vote buying and electoral bribery is widely prevalent in Nigeria, as perpetrators are rarely brought to justice.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Ekiti Election: Incidences Of Vote-Buying Not Synonymous Only With APC \u2013 Keyamo\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cIf voting is as important as INEC always claims it is, now is the time to end the buying of democracy by wealthy politicians and their sponsors.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cVote buying encourages poor governance and weakens citizens\u2019 capacity to hold their \u2018elected officials\u2019 accountable for their actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen political candidates or their sponsors decide to buy the support of the people rather than contest fairly for their votes, there are possibilities that such candidates and sponsors will show a disregard for democratic rules and a disposition to adopt illegal means becomes inevitable.\u201d\n\n\u201cVote buying is entirely an act of election malpractice connected with vested interest since an election can be said to be free and fair when it is devoid of vote buying, ballot snatching, and intimidation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour commitment to these issues will demonstrate to the voters that INEC is ready, willing and able to combat vote buying and electoral bribery and reassure Nigerians that INEC will do everything within its mandates to ensure that the 2023 general elections are not tainted by corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnding impunity for vote-buying, undue influence, ballot snatching, intimidation, and other electoral malpractices would contribute to free and fair elections and show that INEC would not tolerate these illegal practices during the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are reports of a brazen pattern of vote-buying and electoral bribery in several polling units during the just concluded Ekiti governorship election. There are reports of bargaining prices for votes and payments made in uncompleted buildings and bags of foodstuff being shared after votes have been cast.\u201d\n\n\u201cActing swiftly to address the brazen impunity and reports of vote-buying and electoral bribery and other electoral offences during the Ekiti state governorship election would also send a strong message to politicians that INEC under your watch would not tolerate such practices during the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP is concerned that the failure of INEC to rein in vote buying, electoral bribery and intimidation is illustrated by the fact that the body has not seriously addressed similar incidents in previous elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cVote buying and electoral bribery is a threat to fair and representative elections. Vote buying amounts to undue influence and improper electoral influence.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy engaging in vote buying and electoral bribery in so blatant a fashion, the politicians involved and their sponsors have clearly influenced voters to vote for him, contrary to the Electoral Act, thus raising serious questions about the legitimacy and validity of the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cA corruption-free electoral process is essential for building public confidence in the electoral process, and the credibility and legitimacy of the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the people\u2019s most sacred rights is the right to vote. INEC has a constitutional and statutory responsibility to ensure the effective exercise of the right of all eligible voters to participate in their own government in free and fair elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreventing and combating vote buying and electoral bribery would advance the people\u2019s right to vote and to participate in their own government, as well as bolster the ability of INEC to discharge its constitutional and statutory mandates effectively and satisfactorily.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany years of allegations of vote-buying, undue influence, ballot snatching, intimidation, and other electoral malpractices, as well as entrenched impunity of perpetrators have undermined public confidence in the electoral process.\u201d\n\n\u201cProsecuting allegations of vote-buying, undue influence, ballot snatching, intimidation, and other electoral malpractices during the Ekiti state governorship election would be entirely consistent with the Nigerian Constitution, the Electoral Act, and the country\u2019s international human rights anti-corruption obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cProsecuting those that have been arrested and identifying and arresting those who sponsored, aided and abetted them and bringing them to justice would act as a deterrent against vote buying and electoral bribery and other electoral malpractices and offences in the February 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgents of the three dominant political parties in the state, namely All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Social Democratic Party (SDP), were reportedly involved in buying votes across the state. According to reports, agents of the three parties in Ward 007, PU 001, Ado LGA offered voters as high as N10,000 in exchange for their votes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are also several reports of ballot box snatching including in polling units with codes 13/05/06/005 and 007 in Ilawe Ward IV, near St. Patrick\u2019s School. In several voting units, party agents for the APC, PDP and SDP reportedly clustered around the voting cubicle and saw how voters marked their ballot papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cVote buying and electoral bribery, intimidation of voters, ballot snatching and other electoral malpractices and offences undermine the ability of INEC to discharge its responsibilities under Section 153 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and paragraph 15(a) of the third schedule of the Constitution, and the Electoral Act 2022.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution provides in Section 14(1)(c) that, \u2018the participation by the people in their government shall be ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 145(2) of the Electoral Act provides that, \u2018a prosecution under this Act shall be undertaken by legal officers of the Commission or any legal practitioner appointed by it.\u2019 Under section 2(b), the commission \u2018shall have power to promote knowledge of sound democratic election processes.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 7 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall consider appropriate legal actions to compel INEC to comply with our request in the public interest.\u201d",

I am deeply honored. Your words in that letter were reassuring, reenergizing, and reinvigorating.\n\nYour Excellency, one must admire the sense of purpose, composure, and maturity you demonstrated in the weeks and months preceding the primary elections of our great party. As aspirants and party leaders, we all pleaded with you to \u201cchoose\u201d your successor.\n\nNaturally, this is expected especially in African democracy. Up until the 6th of June, 2022, the day of the APC Presidential primaries, the whole of Nigeria, including myself, was waiting for you to announce your preferred candidate. All of us thought and believed this was a very simple matter.\n\nHowever, it was only as the primary went into the night and as the candidates walked up to the podium and spoke that I fully and truly appreciated your position and stance to be neutral and non-aligned to any of us. As the first person to speak, I also had the special vantage point to carefully hear, without any distraction, what the other candidates had to say.\n\nAs the hours rolled by that evening, it became clear to me that all of us were your preferred candidates. As you captured it aptly in your letter to me, the \u201cspirit\u201d of 2013 and 2014 when we created and built APC was there for all to see.\n\nIn your letter and in our many meetings over the years, you fondly reminisced on fraternal attitude in the days and months before and after formation of the APC, when we all worked day and night to create, sustain and nurture our nascent movements into a credible opposition party and ultimately, become the ruling party. That time, no one spoke about tribe; no one spoke about religion. That was not what drove us. We were driven by a common desire to save and transform Nigeria.\n\nOne by one, I saw my colleagues and partners stand on the podium, full of the same passion and patriotic zeal they had in 2013/2014, presenting their ideas on how to build on your successful legacy. Back then, as it is now, we were from all parts of the country, all tribes, and all religions. We all had deep personal and strong bonds with you. We were together back then and our bonds remained strong up till now.\n\nMr. President, as the night of 6 June turned to morning of 7 June, I fully understood and appreciated your stance. \u201cYou belonged to everybody in the party and you belonged to none of the individual candidates of the party.\u201d A true leader, brother and friend.\n\nMr. President, the delegates from all over the country nominated my humble self to be their candidate. I must acknowledge that my nomination would not have become a reality without your support and that of the party leaders across the country. Indeed, as I reflect on my political journey, most of the 2022 APC presidential aspirants, members of the Progressive Governors Forum and National Assembly leaders and members all had a role to play in my successes and achievements thus far.\n\nI will forever be grateful to them for shaping my political journey over the decades. I want to assure you that I will continue to work with them going forward. My emergence as a candidate is also a victory for them.\n\nI have met most of them in the past few days and will continue these engagements as we plan for the general elections. Mr. President, APC is united and will remain united as we move towards the general elections.\n\nI have taken note of the message you sent to all Presidential Candidates in your Democracy Day speech to the nation on the 12th June, 2022. Our country is going through a very sensitive period and no one should put their personal desires above and beyond the nation\u2019s peace and prosperity. As you said, the \u201cmessage we set at the top will be replicated in our followers.\u201d At this point, I will take this opportunity to assure Your Excellency of my commitment to running an issue focused campaign as we move into the general elections. I will personally engage the candidates from other political parties to urge them to do same. Voters should elect us based on our policies, programmes, and projects. By the grace of God, we as candidates will avoid having divisive, destructive and disruptive campaigns.\n\nI will conclude by once again thanking you for being there for all of us. By the grace of God and with your leadership, guidance and support, I am confident that we will lead our great party, the APC, to victory in the February 2023 general elections. We will ride on the back of your successes. We will build on the foundations of transparency and integrity which you have laid.\n\nMr President, together, side by side, in the spirit of 2014, we will win and Nigeria will move forward to a progressive, peaceful and prosperous future.\n\nAsiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu\n\nAPC Presidential Candidate",

          "text": "President Volodymyr Zelensky has made his first trip to Ukraine\u2019s war-torn southern frontline, as his forces mount a slow-moving advance in the region.\n\nVisiting the hold-out city of Mykolaiv, he inspected damaged buildings and met soldiers, officials and health workers.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader also visited the western city of Odesa, which has been subjected to periodic Russian shelling since the war began.\n\nBoth cities are targets in Russia\u2019s efforts to seize the Black Sea coast.\n\nMr Zelensky has regularly met with international leaders in Kyiv since Moscow pulled its forces away from the capital city, having decided to refocus its efforts on capturing the eastern Donbas region.\n\nBut he has also defied Russian troops by going to areas where fighting has been raging, and in recent weeks has visited other front-line cities, including Kharkiv in the east.\n\n\u201cIt is important that you are alive. As long as you live there is a strong Ukrainian wall that protects our country,\u201d the Ukrainian leader told troops in Odesa.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you from the people of Ukraine, from our state for the great work you are doing, for your impeccable service.\u201d\n\nIn Mykolaiv, Mr Zelensky handed out medals to soldiers and urged them to \u201ctake care of Ukraine \u2013 the only thing we have. And take care of yourself \u2013 only you can do it\u201d.\n\nThe city has long been a key target for Russian forces and has been subject to heavy rocket and artillery bombardments.\n\nIt also lies just 100km (62 miles) north-west of Kherson, a city occupied by Russia since the opening days of the war \u2013 but which is now subject to a slow-moving but determined Ukrainian advance.\n\nEarlier this week, Mykolayiv Governor Vitaliy Kim claimed Russian troops were blowing up bridges near Kherson to slow Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensive on the city.\n\nLocal officials say any Ukrainian advance is dependent on long-range weapons promised by the West arriving in time.\n\nElsewhere, the UK\u2019s Ministry of Defence said on Saturday that Russia was likely to be renewing its efforts to advance into the Donetsk region \u2013 which, alongside the Luhansk, makes up the Donbas.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said it had \u201crepelled Russian attacks\u201d near Krasnopillya, in Donetsk, and Syrotyne, in Luhansk, with operations continuing around Severodonetsk.\n\nGovernor Serhiy Haidai told AFP news agency Russian forces were \u201cjust shelling our troop positions 24 hours a day\u201d in the city, now the final Ukrainian holdout in the province.\n\nAnd pro-Russian officials in the eastern, separatist-held city of Donetsk said five civilians were killed and 12 injured by Ukrainian bombardment.\n\nThe secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security Council has dismissed reports from certain government officials that as many as 500 Ukrainian soldiers could be dying every day.\n\nOleksiy Danilov said the officials didn\u2019t have access to the relevant information. Previously Ukrainian officials have spoken of up to 100 deaths a day.\n\nIn Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko has told the BBC his country will only enter peace talks after the \u201clast Russian soldier has left Ukraine\u201d.\n\nThe former boxer said the Russian people would eventually realise their own soldiers were dying for nothing more than President Vladimir Putin\u2019s ambition.\n\nAfter returning from his trip to Kyiv on Friday, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned against \u201cUkraine fatigue\u201d setting in, saying it was important to show that allies were standing with Ukraine for the long haul in its war against Russia.\n\nHe said it would be a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d if Mr Putin was able to secure territorial gains already made.\n\nRussia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, saying it aimed to \u201cde-Nazify\u201d and \u201cdemilitarise\u201d its former Soviet neighbour.\n\nIn the ferocious war which has followed, the UN says that more than 4,500 civilians have been killed and nearly 5,600 have been injured. Thousands of combatants have also been killed or injured on both sides.\n\nMore than 13 million people have fled their homes, according to the UN.\n\nThe West has responded to the invasion by imposing severe sanctions on Moscow and supplying weapons to Ukraine but has not intervened directly in the war against Russia, a nuclear superpower.\n\nBBC",
          "summary": "Visiting the hold-out city of Mykolaiv, he inspected damaged buildings and met soldiers, officials and health workers.\nThe Ukrainian leader also visited the western city of Odesa, which has been subjected to periodic Russian shelling since the war began.\nBut he has also defied Russian troops by going to areas where fighting has been raging, and in recent weeks has visited other front-line cities, including Kharkiv in the east.\nThe city has long been a key target for Russian forces and has been subject to heavy rocket and artillery bombardments.\nPreviously Ukrainian officials have spoken of up to 100 deaths a day.",

As aspirants and party leaders, we all pleaded with you to \u2018choose\u2019 your successor,\u201d the letter reads.\n\n\u201cNaturally, this is expected especially in African democracy. Up until the 6th of June, 2022, the day of the APC presidential primaries, the whole of Nigeria, including myself, was waiting for you to announce your preferred candidate. All of us thought and believed this was a very simple matter.\n\n\u201cHowever, it was only as the primary went into the night and as the candidates walked up to the podium and spoke that I fully and truly appreciated your position and stance to be neutral and non-aligned to any of us. As the first person to speak, I also had the special vantage point to carefully hear, without any distraction, what the other candidates had to say.\n\n\u201cAs the hours rolled by that evening, it became clear to me that all of us were your preferred candidates. As you captured it aptly in your letter to me, the \u201cspirit\u201d of 2013 and 2014 when we created and built APC was there for all to see.\n\n\u201cMr President, as the night of 6th June turned to the morning of 7th June; I fully understood and appreciated your stance. You belonged to everybody in the party and you belonged to none of the individual candidates of the party \u2013 a true leader, brother and friend.\n\n\u201cI will conclude by once again thanking you for being there for all of us. By the grace of God and with your leadership, guidance and support, I am confident that we will lead our great party, the APC, to victory in the February 2023 general elections. We will ride on the back of your successes. We will build on the foundations of transparency and integrity which you have laid.\u201d\n\nTinubu thanked delegates and other party leaders for their support during the presidential primary, adding that his emergence as flagbearer was a victory for all members of the APC.",
