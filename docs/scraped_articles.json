          "title": "APC congresses: Adamu reverses Buni\u2019s decisions, directs withdrawal of court cases",
          "text": "The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has begun reversing some of the decisions taken by his predecessor and Caretaker Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni, Saturday PUNCH has learnt.\n\nThe move comes less than a week after Adamu disclosed his plans to look into the finances of the party.\n\nSaturday PUNCH learnt that before leaving office, Buni had given standing instructions to lawyers representing the APC to appeal court judgments challenging the conduct of congresses supervised by the caretaker committee.\n\nOne of the appealed judgments was that of the Federal High Court recognising the Akwa Ibom State faction of the APC led by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, over that of the erstwhile Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe.\n\nHowever, in a letter signed by the Head, Legal Services of the APC, which was addressed to Adeniyi Akintola (SAN) & Company dated April 6, 2022, it was stated that the new chairman had directed that all cases appealed by Buni\u2019s committee be immediately withdrawn from court.\n\nThe letter titled, \u2018Notice of Withdrawal of Instruction\u2019, relates to a case marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1635/2021 between Stephen Ntukekpo and three others vs. the APC and three others\n\nIt read in part, \u201cI have the instruction of the national legal adviser to convey the decision of the leadership of the party to obey the judgment in respect of the above captioned suit having been served with the same.\n\n\u201cOur instruction on the above matter was terminated at the Federal High Court. Consequently, the party is not interested in pursuing the appeal in respect of the above matter.\n\n\u201cI have further instructions of the national legal adviser to request that you withdraw all the processes filed on behalf of the party and H.E. Mai Mala Buni, the erstwhile national chairman of the CECPC, at the Court of Appeal.\u201d\n\nOur correspondent learnt that the APC had begun withdrawing all the cases from the Court of Appeal.\n\nOn Thursday, the APC lawyer, Adeniyi Akintola, informed the court that the party would be withdrawing its appeal, effectively recognising Akpabio\u2019s faction over that of Akpanudoedehe.\n\nThe Court of Appeal Abuja subsequently dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal.\n\nThe court presided over by Justice Haruna Tsamani alongside Justice Ugochukwu Ogakwu and Justice Bature Gafai said that was the right thing to do since the APC had withdrawn from the case.\n\nCounsel for the plaintiffs, Chief Umeh Kalu, SAN, and counsel for the Independent National Electoral Commission, Umar Farouk, SAN, did not oppose the withdrawal.\n\nHowever, the court ordered that the status quo be maintained until the determination of the motions for jurisdiction and stay of execution, which comes up on May 17.\n\nTop sources in the APC said Adamu\u2019s new approach could destabilise the party.\n\nAn APC chieftain, who spoke on condition of anonymity said, \u201cThe best thing for Senator Adamu to have done was to allow the cases to run their course. There are over 200 cases in court at the moment. He should have let them continue.\n\n\u201cWhat the new national chairman is doing now is to reverse Buni\u2019s actions and those who feel slighted will be forced to leave the party,\u201d the source said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Amina, wife of the Nigerian atheist, Mubarak Bala, jailed for 24 years for blasphemy has said she has not been able to eat or sleep since her husband was sent to prison.\n\nBala, a 37-year-old President of the Humanist Association of Nigeria, was jailed on Tuesday (April 6) by a High Court in Kano after pleading guilty to all 18 charges and asking for leniency.\n\nHe has been in detention since 2020 after a group of Muslims filed a petition to the authorities accusing Bala of posting uncomplimentary messages about Islam and the Prophet Mohammed on Social Media.\n\nIn an interview with one of our correspondents, the 37-year-old civil servant said she has been scared \u2018to her bones\u2019 since she learnt of the judgment.\n\n\u201cI see my husband (Mubarak) whenever I close my eyes. I cannot sleep. I cannot eat. It still seems like a nightmare to me. I have no choice but to be strong. I feel bad not being with my husband for long. My son is growing up without seeing his dad. The mental torture is just too much for me.\n\n\u201cWe got married in August 2019. We did not even celebrate our 1st anniversary when it happened. My son was just six weeks when my husband was whisked away. I was in Abuja to have our baby when one of his friends called me to that the police took him away for a post he made on Facebook about Prophet Mohammed and Islam. I was confused. I am still confused as I speak to you.\n\n\u201cFor eight months after he was \u2018kidnapped\u2019, we didn\u2019t know where he was until we learnt he had been transferred to Kano detention facility. His parents are sad about it. I am from Kogi State. My son is just two years old. Whenever I show him his dad\u2019s picture, I would have to tell him to call him \u2018daddy\u2019. He does not understand what is going on. It has been traumatising for me, but I have to be strong for my son and my darling husband,\u201d she said.\n\nAmina also noted that they would appeal the judgment by the High Court, and would pursue it to the Supreme Court.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe owner of Facebook should be aware of this crime. He should know that someone was arrested because of his platform and jailed for 24 years. The government is aware. They just pretend as if they do not know about it.\n\n\u201cWe will appeal the case. I don\u2019t accept that judgment against my husband. We will pursue it to the Supreme Court.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri, Abuja\n\nJustice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, on Friday, barred journalists from covering the ongoing trial of the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe court is billed to rule on an application Kanu filed to quash the 15-count treasonable felony charge the Federal Government preferred against him.\n\nSecurity operatives from the Department of State Service, DSS, and the Nigeria Police Force, had blocked all access routes to the high court premises.\n\nThough accredited journalists were allowed to enter the press centre situated in the court\u2019s basement, they were however denied entry into the courtroom.\n\nA security operative who pleaded anonymity told Vanguard that the order for journalists not to be allowed into the courtroom came from the trial judge, whom he said based her decision on the new practice directions the court issued on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, we have the list of all the journalists here. We did not block anyone on the list from entering the court premises\u201d.\n\nEfforts by the Chief Information Officer of the court, Dr Catherine Oby Christopher, to help select journalists to enter the courtroom around 12pm, proved abortive, as DSS operatives insisted that the judge was already sitting.\n\nThe court had in the new practice direction, maintained that proceedings in terrorism cases, would henceforth, be held in camera or as may be ordered by the trial judge.\n\n\u201cProceedings of offences of terrorism, subject to the provisions of section 232 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015 and section 34 of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2011 (as amended), shall be held in camera or as may be ordered by the Court.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nBreaking: Court bars journalists from covering Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s trial\n\n\u201cThe names, addresses, telephone numbers and identity of the victims of such offences or witnesses in the proceedings shall not be disclosed in any record or report of the proceedings and it shall be sufficient to designate the names of the victims or witnesses with a combination of alphabets.\n\n\u201cIn any proceedings where the Court deems it necessary to ensure the safety and/or protect the identity of the victim or a witness, it may take any or all of the following protective measures:\n\n\u201cHold its proceedings at any place to be designated by the Chief Judge and in the case of the Abuja Judicial Division, the venue, for the time being, shall be the premises of the Code of Conduct Tribunal;\n\n\u201cReceive evidence by video link; Permit the witness to be screened or masked; Receive written depositions of expert witnesses; Direct that all or any part of the proceedings of the Court shall not be published in any manner;\n\n\u201cExclude from the proceedings any person other than the parties and their legal representatives;\n\n\u201cMake order as to any electronic devices that would be allowed during the proceeding\n\n\u201cMake an order on any other measure that the Court considers appropriate in the circumstances\u201d.\n\nOn the coverage of proceedings in terrorism cases, it read: \u201cThe coverage of proceedings under these Practice Directions is strictly prohibited, save as may be directed by the Court.\n\n\u201cA person who contravenes an order or direction made under these Practice Directions shall be deemed to have committed an offence contrary to section 34(5) of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2011 (as amended)\u201d.\n\nKanu, in the application he filed through his team of lawyers led by Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, maintained that the charge against him was legally defective.\n\nHe argued that the court lacked the jurisdiction to try him on the strength of an incompetent charge.\n\nOzekhome, told the court that his client was \u201cunlawfully, brutally and extraordinarily renditioned from Kenya without his consent\u201d.\n\nHe argued that since some of the allegations FG levelled against Kanu, were purportedly committed outside the country, the high court, therefore, lack the jurisdiction to entertain the charge.\n\n\u201cThe charges appear to give this court a global jurisdiction over offences that were allegedly committed by the Defendant, without specifying the location or date the said offences were committed\u201d.\n\nHe argued that under the Federal High Court Act, such a charge must disclose the specific location where the offence was committed.\n\nMore so, Ozekhome contended that Kanu could not be charged with belonging to an unlawful organization since the action of FG, in proscribing the IPOB, is still subject to legal dispute at the Court of Appeal and therefore subjudice.\n\nConsequently, Ozekhome urged the court to dismiss the charge, as well as to discharge and acquit the Defendant of the entire 15-count charge pending against him.\n\n\u201cThis case is hollow, there is nothing in it. It is dead on arrival. Elements constituting the offence must occur within the jurisdiction of this court\u201d, he argued.\n\nHowever, FG\u2019s lawyer, Mr Shuaibu Labaran, prayed the court to strike out Kanu\u2019s application and order the Prosecution to open its defence.\n\nHe argued that the application would touch the substance of the case that is yet to be heard.\n\n\u201cThe position as of now is that the IPOB is a proscribed organization which was duly proscribed through the due process of law\u201d.\n\nHe argued that Section 32 of the Terrorism Prevention Act imbued the court with the requisite jurisdiction to handle the trial.\n\n\u201cWe urged my lord to refuse the application to pave way for the commencement of the trial in Ernest.\n\n\u201cThis is a matter that has been pending for over five years now\u201d, the Prosecution counsel added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, on Friday disrupted the Nigeria Governors Forum and Speakers of the State Houses of Assembly meeting in Abuja over autonomy for local government and state judiciary.\n\nRecall that the organized labour has been advocating for the granting of autonomy to local government areas and state judiciary and had taken the protest to the National Assembly.\n\nThe NLC at about 3 pm Friday had taken over the entrance of Fraiser Suites by Grand Square Supermarket, Central Area Abuja with placards and banners of different inscriptions.\n\nSpeaking at the protest rally, President of NLC, Comrade Ayuba Wabba said workers were at the place to impress it on the governors and the State Assembly Speakers that autonomy for local government and state judiciary must be part of their agenda.\n\nWabba noted with dismay that the neglect suffered by the local government councils has contributed to the worsening security situation in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cAll of us could recall that the issue of autonomy and independence for these three arms of government to operate independently, has been an issue in Nigeria. And that has led to a lot of challenges.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n\u201d I can say as a matter of fact, that because the local government system is not working. That is why the security architecture of Nigeria today has collapsed.\n\n\u201cThere is no security anywhere because that tier of government that should provide all the necessary information is not functioning. Some of their responsibilities, including fixing roads and creating employment opportunities have been taken over.\n\n\u201cAnd that is why you see people now moving enmass from the state capitals and the local governments to the city centers, it is a very chaotic process.\n\n\u201cWe must put this to an end. We can have the system reversed because we have competent people, people well educated that are in our local governments. In the local government, we have all carriers, we have professors.\n\n\u201cAnd that tier of government if given the chance, it will be able to attend to all these challenges that now bedevil in development of our system.\n\n\u201cAnd that is why we have taken it as a major campaign to every nook and cranny that every politician, be chairman of a local government, be it members of the State Assembly must endorse this bill, on the autonomy of the local governments.\n\n\u201cThey must endorse this bill for the autonomy of the judiciary and theyvmust endorse the bill for the autonomy of the parliament.\n\n\u201cWe said this with passion because we know it is going to improve the problems that Nigeria is going through today, it is not only about siphoning their funds, it\u2019s also about having a credible election in the local government system because that is why true democracy has been practiced.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cIf we destroy democracy at the local government level, then you are assured that what we are going to have at the center will be a mirage.\n\n\u201cDo we want this to happen? So that is why we are here as I said we are here because the governors Forum and the speakers of the assembly, will be meeting here. If they are meeting here, they must put the issue on the agenda, that is why we are here.\n\n\u201cWhat is our demand? Autonomy must be on the agenda of the meeting. That is why we are here. The next level of our campaign comrades, because I\u2019m aware that the meeting is supposed to be here, anybody coming in must be able to listen to us. I will tell them why we are here is because of autonomy. We must remind them why we are here to. We will do that very peacefully.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Member representing Yagba East/West/Mopamuro Federal Constituency of Kogi State, Hon Leke Abejide, has said the amended Electoral Act has thrown thugs out of business in 2023 elections.\n\nHe said one of the best legislative activities that has taken place was the courageous amendment of the Electoral Act by the 9th National Assembly, which he said has strengthened political processes.\n\nHon. Abejide, who is the House Committee Chairman on Customs and Excise, spoke at a media interview on his perspective on the next elections, argued that the next general election was going to be personality-based than political party advantage as used to be.\n\nAccording to him, the amended Electoral Act has put confidence in the people, such that well meaning citizens are now making themselves available to contest for political offices.\n\nThe lawmaker, who won election on the minority Action Democratic Congress (ADC) in 2019 general election amid alleged rigging and electoral irregularities in Kogi State and who still maintained his party platform was asked if he envisaged a free and fair election in 2023.\n\nHe insisted that the narrative of rigging has changed, even as votes cast would now be electronically transmitted, while he urged voters to cooperate with the system in the interest of the nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe electioneering process has been strengthened through the electoral act. It has more benefits now. That\u2019s why you see more credible people coming out now for elective positions because they see that votes now will count.\n\n\u201cYou see, elections before now were usually rigged from collation centres, but now, the election is going to be won from the polling units.\n\n\u201cThe moment you vote, the results are already counting. Even if you are voting from the other side, the situation room they are seeing it. If they like they should come and scatter and take the ballot box, the results are there.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow all electronic gadgets can be used during elections. So they can be used as evidence in the court. It\u2019s going to be more transparent.\n\n\u201cElection is going to be clean and clear. It will help the masses to enjoy more because anybody in power will know that if he or she did not perform, he will not come back.\n\n\u201cThe thugs will have less work this time. Their mode of operations is to waylay ballot boxes and when you are popular, it\u2019s difficult for any thug to thrive because when they look at what is on ground and see that they cannot operate, they will go quietly.\u201d",

          "text": "From Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nThe trending video on social media in which attackers of Abuja-Kaduna bound train of March 28, 2022, threatened to kill all the hostages in their custody if the federal government refuses to meet their demands, has sent shivers into the hearts and minds of their relatives and sympathizers.\n\nThis comes as efforts are being made to raise money to pay the terrorists even if it is not the whole amount being asked for. This will be done by relatives acting as ransom-bearers and who are courageous enough to follow the abductors far into the forests.\n\nWhen Saturday Sun contacted some of the embattled relatives, they avoided him like a leper. \u201cPlease save us the additional trouble. Do you want these guys to come after us? Whatever we say here can be misquoted by them and they may kill the people we are struggling to free.\u201d\n\nThough they refused to speak on record, they would, however, want the Federal Government to meet the demands of the terrorists in order to save the lives of their loved ones who have been in captivity for almost two weeks.\n\nWhen the reporter spoke with other concerned individuals and organisations, they lent their voices to the call by the relatives of the hostages on the Federal Government to do everything within its power to get them freed.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSpokesman of Southern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU), Mr. Luka Binniyat told Saturday Sun, that, \u201cgovernment should come out in plain terms and explain its relationship with the outlaws.\u201d\n\nSOKAPU, he added, was of the belief that \u201cpowerful people in government are in bed with these bandits and terrorists. We believe that what has been said over the years that these cruel people were imported into the country in 2015 to make Nigeria ungovernable should then President Jonathan Goodluck continue in office is true.\u201d\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

If government or people in power are not the owners of the bandits, the solution is very simple: they should train the hundreds of thousands of idle young persons in all affected states, give them basic discipline, arm them and let them loose on the bandits and let\u2019s see if they can last a week.\u201d\n\nFormer Secretary General of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Mr Anthony Sani, asked the bandits not to carry out their threat. He said: \u201cThe terrorists who go by the name kidnappers should not dare it. Those of them who threaten to kill all the abductees are those who are ignorant of the conversations going on now as to whether the Air Force should bomb all hideouts of the terrorists in all the forests or to tread softly to avoid collateral damages that will come by way of killing innocent people whom the terrorists use as human shields. So, the terrorists should not behave as if the government and the security agencies have no option. The government has other options of dealing with them but for the heavy collateral damage.\u201d\n\nIn his own view, a Kaduna-based conflicts resolution manager, Mr Patrick Lawson, urged the President to enter re-negotiation with the bandits \u201cbecause their statement that has gone viral on Facebook suggested that there was a discussion or agreement which appeared to have been breached by government. Whatever government can do to ensure total return of peace and peaceful coexistence in the country is what Nigerians are after now.\u201d",

          "text": "The Mosque Steering Committee of Apo Legislative Quarters Mosque, Abuja, last week, sacked the Imam of the Mosque, Sheik Muhammed Nuru Khalid, popularly known as Digital Imam, accusing him of preaching an inciting sermon. The Imam in the sermon accused the Federal Government of playing with the lives of the people through their actions, hence the need to reawaken the consciousness of the government to their constitutional responsibilities.\n\nIman Khalid advised his followers to avoid the polling centres if the level of killings being experienced in the country does not stop.\n\nIn an Interview with FRED EZEH, Sheikh Khalid, maintained that he would neither back down nor compromise his position despite the fact that he was relieved of his job by the management of Apo Legislative Quarters Mosque.\n\nYou\u2019ve been on the lips of Nigerians in past few days due to your recent sermon about the insecurity in Nigeria. What was your reason for the strong sermon?\n\nThe outburst was simply because we can\u2019t continue the way we are going. Insecurity is fast consuming all of us. No one is safe anymore. Neither roads nor train, or air travels is safe. We have to do something about it. The country is in a serious problem and people who are supposed to speak loudly have kept quiet. People, including security personnel are being killed on daily basis by bandits who are fast overrunning some states in the North-West and North-Central. We can\u2019t continue like this, hence we have to speak the truth to the government. I was doing my God given responsibilities to speak the truth to the people in government, reminding them about their responsibilities and the oath they swore to before entering office. Regrettably, many people are not comfortable with my choice of words and position regarding what should be done by the government to protect the lives of the people of Nigeria that voted for them.\n\nAt what point did your relationship with the Mosque committee degenerate to the point of termination of engagement?\n\nI think they had bottled-up anger, and were waiting for the right opportunity to express it. The sermon of last week provided that opportunity. They capitalised on the recent sermon that highlighted the issues of insecurity across the country which generated lots of conversation both on social and in the conventional media.\n\nUnfortunately, the sermon led to your disengagement by the Mosque Committee..\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nYes! It did, but I was happy I spoke my mind and my conscience is happy for that. I was disengaged some days ago by the Mosque Committee. But shortly after my formal disengagement, an intervention from the Supreme Being came through someone who provided a brand new mosque for me to handle. I heard that someone else is even building a new mosque for me at the centre of Abuja which will be handed over to me soon. We appreciate God for that timely intervention.\n\nWhat would you have done if such intervention didn\u2019t come?\n\nFirst or all, I wasn\u2019t expecting the new mosque but God did it. Besides, without the mosque, I will still be doing my thing effectively and efficiently. I have already established a platform through which I pass my messages across to my large followers, online and offline. I engage the women and children in the morning hours and men in the evening hours, especially during this Ramadan period.\n\nBefore the sack, did you have any form of meeting with the mosque committee to iron out grey areas?\n\nYes! We met once and discussed issues they raised. They called it an advisory meeting. They asked me to tone down my criticism of the government and not to be harsh to them. But I know the members of the mosque committee. They are all politicians who approach government for one need or the other. They might have approached the government for a contract or something else, and want to show the government that they are doing something about my kind of preaching. But I consider the masses more than them, and that is their problem with me. I consider Nigeria more than any other person. I consider the unity and security of Nigeria more than any person. And that\u2019s my problem.\n\nDo you suspect that the Federal Government might have acted through the Mosque Committee?\n\nI don\u2019t have any evidence to prove that. But one of the Mosque Committee members told me that they acted because of pressure from people in high places which he didn\u2019t mention to me. But to me, they have their own agenda and interest to protect. I know the government is not happy with me, so, anything can happen through anybody.\n\nThe Committee said in your suspension letter that you didn\u2019t show any remorse. Why was that?\n\nWhy should I be remorseful when I know I am doing the right thing and pleasing my conscience? Do they want me to apologise and make a promise that I will support killings and other misgovernance going on? I can\u2019t do that for whatever reason.\n\nDo you have any regret for your action?\n\nNo! I have no regret for the outburst. How will I regret my action that was meant to protect the interest of the people? Many widows and orphans are being produced on daily basis in Nigeria as a result of the unending killings. How will I regret speaking for them, standing for the truth? How will I regret that I am the only Imam that is speaking and calling for peace and unity of Nigeria? I will never regret that. Besides, people are happy with me for speaking their minds. My conscience is clear and I have peace of mind.\n\nDon\u2019t you think the government is overwhelmed by this insecurity?\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nWhatever may be the case, the government knows more than we do, and they have the necessary things needed to tackle these people who have made life unbearable for the people. Government have more credible intelligence and information than what we could access. They should utilise that. We really need to remind the government of their constitutional responsibilities of security and welfare of Nigerians. Our lives are important, hence they should sit up and tackle the issue of insecurity. The security of the nation is our concern too because this is the only country that we have.\n\nWhat are the responsibilities of the citizens regarding this insecurity?\n\nAs masses of this country, we owe the country prayers and doing other right things to assist the government. But the government has to rise to the challenges because people are being slaughtered like chicken everyday and little or nothing is being done about it. Any successful attack on individuals or soldiers is an indication that someone failed in his or her duties. So, such person should answer questions. Our only request is for the government to be proactive instead of being reactive.\n\nBut many people believe you always look for opportunities to verbally attack the government because you never liked the administration. Is it true?\n\nThat perception is totally wrong. I have realised that some people are particularly concerned about my strong criticism of the Buhari administration. I have nothing personal or hatred against the President or any of the cabinet members. I am only concerned about the fate of this country which is fast going the wrong way. At this point, the country is evidently on the brink of collapse, and we should work to rescue it.\n\nSome say you\u2019ve never shown open support for the Buhari administration\n\nThat statement is not also true. It depends on how you view the issue and your definition of support. I must not go about with posters or placards in the name of support for Buhari\u2019s administration. I have supported this administration in different ways but they seem to be getting it wrong on all fronts. Cost of living has skyrocketed beyond the reach of the average man. Power supply, health care system, education, and other indices have read negative compare to what we had in 2015 before the coming of the administration.\n\nIn what way have you supported the government openly?\n\nBeing a renowned Islamic cleric, the only platform I have is the mosque which I use effectively to promote national unity, peace, tolerance and societal morals. At various occasions during the sermon in my mosque, I have taken it upon myself to appeal to the people to be patient with the government. I have led prayers several times for peace, unity and development of Nigeria, and for the government to succeed in its quest to better the lives of the people. I have asked and championed attitudinal change from the people. That\u2019s huge support for the government as far as I am concerned. I mustn\u2019t be shouting Buhari everywhere to be a supporter of the government.\n\nYou have been accused of being biased in your judgements and that you show it through your sermons\n\nMany people know and believe in my philosophy. You can see the massive support that I got this period. I am the only Imam that Christians celebrate, and that\u2019s because I am not biased in my judgement of political affairs in Nigeria. I want a good Nigeria that is united, peaceful and give justice to all, irrespective of political status, religious beliefs or other differences.\n\nWhat\u2019s your general assessment of Buhari\u2019s administration?\n\nMy assessment of this administration is the people\u2019s assessment. You and I know the people\u2019s assessment of the Buhari administration. Evidently, the country is at the brink of collapse but we won\u2019t allow it. That\u2019s why we would continue to talk loudly to hold the government to account. The masses of Nigeria are suffering severely in midst of plenty of God\u2019s blessing. This is more than before. Hardship and poverty have overwhelmed the people, inflation has weakened the currency, among several others poor records. Most worrisome is the level of killings in Nigeria. The President still has the opportunity to make amends before the end of his tenure. It\u2019s for his own good because the reality would dawn on him few minutes after he leaves office next year. All those hypocrites that surrounded him would abandon him for the new government. But for us, we love Nigeria more than any other President because Presidents come and go but Nigeria remains.\n\nSeveral promises were made by this administration before 2015. Can you compare the past government and what we have now?\n\nYes, I can do that comfortably. For instance, I came close to the former FCT Minister, Bala Mohammed, because I criticised him heavily. He tried to bring me closer to him because I was criticizing and pointing out his lapses so he could make amends.\n\nWhen I met with him, he encouraged me to always speak the truth to people in government, including himself. He only appealed that I shouldn\u2019t be too harsh and uncivil in my words. We became more friendly because he accept criticisms and doesn\u2019t see it the other way round. That character was what I expected from the current administration. They need to understand that criticism is part of people and society.\n\nConstructive criticism is very important if we are to talk about democracy.\n\nIf you are summoned for a meeting with the President, what will you tell him?\n\nI will honour the invitation because the President is the father of the nation and our leader. I will listen to him and share my experiences and suggestion with him on how to move the country forward.",

          "text": "From GODWIN TSA, Abuja\n\nThe Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, has fixed May 18 as the day to rule on the application for bail by the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu. This is even as it struck out eight out of the 15-count treasonable felony charges brought against him by the Federal government.\n\nJustice Binta Nyako, in her ruling, struck out counts 6,7,9,10,11,12,13 and 14 of the charge. She, however, retained seven counts against him. Her ruling followed an application Kanu filed to quash the entire charges against him. In the application which he filed through his team of lawyers led by Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), he insisted that the charge against him was legally defective. He also argued that the court lacked the jurisdiction to try him on the strength of an incompetent charge.\n\nHowever, FG\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Shuaibu Labaran, prayed the court to strike out Kanu\u2019s application and order the Prosecution to open up its defence. He argued that the application would touch the substance of the case that is yet to be heard. He noted that, \u201cthe position as at now is that the IPOB is a proscribed organisation which was duly proscribed through the due process of law.\u201d\n\nHe argued that Section 32 of the Terrorism Prevention Act imbued the court with the power to handle the trial. Based on that, he urged the court \u201cto refuse the application to pave way for commencement of the trial in earnest.\u201d But in her ruling, Justice Nyako held that the prosecution did not present sufficient materials before the court to sustain the eight count charges brought against Kanu.\n\nWith the current ruling of the court, Kanu will now be standing trial for a seven-count charge. They are, as follows: one, that he committed an offence punishable under Section 1(2)(b) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013, by making a broadcast received and heard in Nigeria as a member and leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, a proscribed organisation, and committed an act in furtherance of an act of terrorism against the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the people of Nigeria\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nTwo, that he issued a deadly threat to anyone who flouted his sit-at home order to write his/her Will,\u201d with the intent to intimidate the population. As a result, banks, schools, markets, shopping malls, fuel stations domiciled in the Eastern States of Nigeria were not opened for businesses, citizens while vehicular movements were grounded and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 1(2)(b) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act. 2013.\n\nThree, that he, on diverse dates between 2018 and 2021, professed to be a member and leader of IPOB, a proscribed organisation and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 16 of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act. 2013.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

Five, that he incited the same members of the public through broadcasts asking them to kill members of the families of Nigerian security personnel and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 1 (2) (h) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013.\n\nSix, that he directed members of IPOB to manufacture bombs and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 1 (2) (f) of the terrorism (Prevention) (Amendment) Act 2013.

          "title": "Soyinka Denies Asking Nigerians to Vote for Buhari in 2015",
          "text": "*Says he only urged Nigerians to vote out Jonathan\n\nNobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, has denied asking Nigerians to vote for President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. Following the poor performance of the President Buhari-led administration, characterized by hardship and worsening insecurity, Soyinka has been at the receiving end of criticisms from Nigerians. Some Nigerians have been blaming him for the role he played in the election of President Buhari in 2015.\n\nHowever, he said he never endorsed President Buhari\u2019s candidacy in 2015.\n\n\u201cIt is false to say that I supported the election of Buhari,\u201d he said, adding that what he said at the time was \u201cdo not vote for Jonathan.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that although he didn\u2019t support Jonathan\u2019s second term bid, he now believes the former president \u201credeemed himself in such a magnificent way. Buhari never won the election, Jonathan lost it.\n\n\u201cThere are those who see a problem and say let\u2019s tackle the problem now and there are others who see a problem and say who is responsible for that problem? In other words, they are looking for someone to blame. Jonathan had a chance to win that election, but he blew it,\u201d he noted.\n\nAccording to him, what he said in 2015 was that if Nigerians elected Mr Buhari, they should support him as a born-again democrat and be allowed to carry out his duties.\n\nHe, however, said President Buhari failed Nigeria at its critical moments. \u201cHe failed when he went to Benue, after the killings by herdsmen, and told the people to live with their neighbours. Having been on the other side of power, he should have had a rethink, but alas, Buhari failed,\u201d he declared.\n\nMeanwhile, Soyinka has criticized the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) over the election of ex-Osun State deputy governor, Chief Iyiola Omisore, as its National Secretary. He expressed willingness to be involved in legal proceedings to unravel the killers of a former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Bola Ige.\n\nAccording to him, the former deputy governor\u2019s choice was like \u2018rubbing the death of late Chief Bola Ige on the faces of Nigerians\u2019 and raised questions over President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s pledge to reopen the investigation into the case.\n\nIge, an ex-governor of old Oyo State, was assassinated by gunmen at his Bodija, Ibadan home on December 23, 2001. In 2002, Omisore was arraigned for Ige\u2019s murder but was later acquitted alongside 10 others.\n\nSoyinka, had in a statement last Saturday, said the resumption of an investigation into Ige\u2019s murder was already hamstrung and disrobed of credibility with the emergence of a prime suspect in the case as the National Secretary of the ruling party.\n\nOmisore, who replied to Soyinka\u2019s position in a statement, instructed his lawyer, Kayode Ajulo, to write the Nobel Laureate, demanding a retraction of the comments.\n\nAlso yesterday, Ajulo, in an advertorial published in a national daily, explained how Omisore was discharged by Oyo State High Court of all allegations of complicity in the murder of Ige and going forward, \u201che has been instructed to activate legal processes against anyone for defamation and probable prosecution of any person who continues to make disparaging comments about Omisore not in tandem with the true representation of facts. \u201d\n\nBut Soyinka said there was a need to unearth the circumstances surrounding the death of Ige, which he believes would be of enormous value to the course of democracy and education.\n\n\u201cWe are talking of somebody who was capable of attacking a Minister of Justice, taking off his cap in the palace of the spiritual head of a large group of people, that person is not fit to be seen as national secretary of a ruling party.\n\n\u201cActions of disgracing and humiliating a highly respected individual, a traditional chief, a minister, who was a guest at the revered palace, that action alone and the consequence of it disqualifies whoever initiated that action from aspiring to a respected position.\n\n\u201cWe heard a case of the judge who kept the diary, recording the pressure that he was receiving from very high quarters during that period. There are cases of vanishing witnesses and retraction of statements.\n\n\u201cI say to the leadership of the APC, I\u2019m not talking to Buhari alone, I am saying what has happened to your sensibilities, were you so short of materials even within your party that you have to unleash scorpions on our memories, which we are just managing to forget since that event?\u201d he asked.\n\nHe stated that such a person should have been made an envoy if the party desired to give him a post, but not the secretary of a ruling party. \u201cEven if President Buhari or the APC wanted to reward Omisore, he ought to have been given an ambassador appointment, even if it is to Ukraine and not a national secretary of the ruling party.\n\n\u201cWe are talking of the party of those in charge of the governance and justice of this country; the leadership of APC and I am not talking of Buhari alone. Do you have to unleash scorpions on our memory? It is not Soyinka who provided this. It\u2019s those who were so insensitive, who rubbed that murder in our faces. I will be delighted to go to court so that we can go into details.

          "title": "New Revenue Formula Proposes Reduction of FG\u2019s Allocation By 3.33%",
          "text": "\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe nation\u2019s 30-year-old revenue allocation formula would soon be reviewed with a proposal by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) for the reduction of the allocation to federal government by 3.3 percent while the allocation to the 36 states and the 774 local government councils would be increased by 3.07 per cent and 0.44 per cent respectively.\n\nThis is just as President Muhammadu Buhari has declared that he would await the final outcome of the constitutional review process before presenting the report of the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula to the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment.\n\nThe vertical review of the revenue formula also affected Special Funds, with the RMAFC proposing an increase of 0.2 per cent for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and a decrease of 0.38 per cent for Development of Natural Resources.Speaking yesterday at the State House, Abuja, while receiving the report by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), from its Chairman, Elias Mbam, Buhari stressed that for the nation to have a lasting review of the present revenue allocation formula, there must first be an agreement on the responsibilities to be carried out by all the tiers of Government.\n\nIn particular, he noted that the proposal seeks a 3.33% reduction in the current federal government\u2019s allocation and on the other hand an increase of 3.07 per cent and 0.44 per cent for the states and local governments on the other hand.He added that with regards to the Special Funds, the report by the RMAFC proposed an increase of 0.2 per cent for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and a decrease of 0.38 per cent for the Development of Natural Resources.\n\nThe president recounted that the federal government also made its input into the process of reviewing the vertical revenue allocation formula based on existing constitutional provisions for roles and responsibilities for the different tiers of government.\u201cWe must note the increasing visibility in Sub-national level responsibilities due to weaknesses at that level, for example:\n\nPrimary Health Care; Basic Primary Education; Levels of insecurity, and; Increased remittances to State and Local Governments through the Value Added Tax sharing formula, where the Federal Government has only 15 per cent and the States and Local Government share 50 per cent and 35 per cent respectively\u201d.Buhari said he would have gone ahead to present the revenue allocation report to the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment.\n\nHe, however, explained that since the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula was a function of the roles and responsibilities of the different tiers of government, \u201cI will await the final outcome of the constitutional review process, especially as some of the proposed amendments would have a bearing on the recommendations contained herein.\u201dHe listed some of the recommendations in the report to include:\n\n\u2018\u2018Establishing local government as a tier of government and the associated abrogation of the state/local government account; moving airports; fingerprints, identification and criminal records from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent legislative list, empowering the RMAFC to enforce compliance with remittance of accruals into and disbursement of revenue from the Federation Account as well as streamlining the procedure for reviewing the revenue allocation formula.\u2019\n\n\u2019The president assured members of the Commission that the federal government would immediately subject the report to its internal review and approval processes, while awaiting finalisation of the efforts by the National Assembly.According to him, this strategy, rather than issuing an Executive Modification order, as was done in 1992, was more in line with entrenching our democratic tenets.\n\nHe commended the RMAFC for a job painstakingly done, pledging his unwavering commitment and support to them in carrying out their constitutional mandates.The president also thanked Nigerians, especially the state and local governments, for making their inputs through the broad stake-holder engagement processes that produced the report. \u2018\u2018I am aware that the present revenue allocation formula has not been reviewed since the last exercise carried out in 1992.\n\n\u2018\u2018Considering the changing dynamics of our political-economy, such as privatisation, deregulation, funding arrangement of primary education, primary health care and the growing clamour for decentralisation among others; it is necessary that we take another look at our Revenue Sharing Formula, especially the vertical aspects that relate to the tiers of government.\u2018\n\n\u2018This becomes more compelling as we need to reduce our infrastructural deficit, make more resources available for tackling insecurity, confront climate change and its associated global warming and make life more meaningful for our rapid growing population.\u2019\u2019Buhari said as an advocate for grassroots development, he has always remained committed to ensuring that all tiers of Government are treated fairly, equally and justly in the sharing of national resources.\n\n\u2018\u2018I want to let you all know that I have keenly followed most of the discussions held in the geo-political consultative process and one thing that struck me clearly was the agreement that a review of our vertical revenue formula cannot and should not be an emotional or sentimental discussion and it cannot be done arbitrarily.\u2018\u2018All over the world, revenue and resource allocation have always been a function of the level of responsibilities attached to the different components or tiers of government. \u2018\u2018I am, therefore, happy to note that the discussions were held along these lines and rested squarely on roles and responsibilities as spelt out in the 1999 Constitution (as amended). \u2018\u2018However, I also note that in reaching the final decisions at most of these engagements, not much emphasis was placed on the fact that the Second Schedule of the Nigerian constitution contains 68 items on the Exclusive Legislative List and the remaining 30 items on the Concurrent List requiring both the Federal and State Government to address.\n\n\u201dEarlier in his remarks, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, said the RMAFC followed due process in undertaking the exercise, and sought the opinion of the federal government before finalising the report.Giving a synopsis of the report, Mustapha said it was in four volumes, including a summary in the main report.He added: \u2018\u2018Volume 1 contains the various memoranda submitted by the Federal and State Governments as well as the FCT. Volume 2 details the presentation from the academia, civil society, professional bodies, traditional rulers, individuals, as well as women and youth council.\n\n\u2018\u2018To complete the inclusiveness of the stakeholder participatory processes adopted, Volume 3 is a research that captures the body of knowledge that supported the review while Volume 4 is a further distillation of submissions by the State and Local Governments as well as NGOs and Area Councils of the FCT.\u201dAlso speaking, RMAFC Chairman Mbam said the leading philosophy behind the proposed review was guided by the need for distributive justice, equity and fairness as enshrined in relevant Sections of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\nHe added that the principles took into cognisance the indivisibility of the country, public opinion and weighted Constitutional responsibilities and functions of the three levels of Government.He announced that the proposed vertical revenue allocation formula advised 45.17 per cent for the federal government, 29.79 per cent for state governments and 21.04 per cent for the local governments.Under Special Funds, he said, the Report by the Commission recommended one per cent for Ecology, 0.5 per cent for Stabilisation, 1.3 per cent for Development of Natural Resources and 1.2 per cent for the FCT.\n\nIn arriving at the new vertical revenue allocation formula, Mbam told the president that the Commission had wide consultation with major stakeholders, public hearing in all the geo-political zones, administered questionnaires and studied some other federations with similar fiscal arrangements like Nigeria to draw useful lessons from their experiences. According to the RMAFC chairman, the Commission also visited all the 36 States and the FCT, the 774 local government areas to sensitise and obtain inputs from stakeholders.\n\nHe added that literature reviews were conducted on revenue allocation formula in Nigeria dating back to pre-independence period while the Commission received memoranda from the public sectors, individuals and private institutions across the country.\n\nExplaining the major reasons for the exercise, Mbam noted that since the last review was conducted in 1992, 29 years ago, the political structure of the country has changed with the creation of six additional States in 1996, which brought the number of States to 36.Correspondingly, he said, the number of local governments councils also increased from 589 to 774.\u2018\n\n\u2018There have been considerable changes arising from the policy reforms that altered the relative share of responsibilities of the various tiers of government such as deregulation, privatisation and the lingering controversies over funding of primary education, primary healthcare.\u201dThe RMAFC chairman noted that while Section 32(b), Part 1 of Third Schedule of the 1999 Constitution 9 (as amended) empowers the Commission to review from time to time the revenue allocation formulae; the inadequate and decaying infrastructure, as well as heightened widespread internal security challenges across the country also necessitated the exercise, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Demobilises 30 illegal refineries\n\n*Kyari foresees return to normal production in two months, urges collective action\n\n* Insists pipeline vandalism an elitist business\n\n\n\nKingsley Nwezeh, Udora Orizu in Abuja and Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nAs the battle against crude oil theft, a development that has resulted to severe revenue to the country as well as its inability to meet its production quota, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) yesterday disclosed that it had launched a special operation code named \u2018Operation Dakatar da Barawo\u2019 in order to curb crude oil theft and illegal oil bunkering in the Niger Delta region.\n\nIt also revealed that 30 illegal oil refineries had been demobilised in the region by the naval troops in the last two weeks.This was just as the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr. Mele Kyari, yesterday expressed optimism that the country would return to normal crude oil production in the next two months, even as he stressed the need for collective action to address the unfortunate situation.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing in Abuja, the Director, Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Maj Gen Benard Onyeuko, said the new operation in the Niger Delta region was aimed at reinvigorating the already existing operation Delta Safe, with a view to containing economic saboteurs in the region.\n\nOther objectives of the new operations include, \u201cto secure critical maritime infrastructure, create enabling environment for the sustenance of desired level of hydrocarbon production, safe shipping and economic activities, and restore investor confidence in Nigeria\u2019s Maritime domain, among others\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that troops of Operation Delta Safe had continued to dominate the zone and had conducted anti-crude oil theft and anti-illegal oil bunkering related operations at different locations. He listed the locations to include Opuama Celestial, Lolomu Ruler in Warri North Local Government Area, Obodo water-ways in Warri South West Local Government Area of Delta State.\n\nOther locations are: Egbeda, Ibaa, Oduoha, Rumekpe in Emohua Local Government Area, Elele; Ikwere Local Government Area of River State and Brass Creek in Ozobo community in Ekeremor Local Government Area of Bayelsa State.\u201dAccordingly, troops discovered and destroyed 30 illegal refining sites, 37 reservoirs, 31 ovens, 12 large wooden boats, two cooling systems, three receivers, three storage pits and a metal drums. \u201cCumulatively, troops within the period under review recovered 12,150,000 liters of illegal refined Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) 4,000 liters of stolen crude oil, three tankers, three vehicles, 73 galvanised pipes, two motorcycles, one bus, one Toyota Camry, Mercedes Benz car,\u201d he revealed.\n\n\n\nKyari Foresees Return to Normal Oil Production in Two Months\n\nMeanwhile, Kyari, while addressing members of the House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Upstream investigating reasons why Nigeria had not been able to meet its production quota, said the federal government was not only working on recovery of its production quota, but its sustainability as well.\n\nHe explained that the scale of crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism seen in the host communities was beyond explanation, and has rendered the oil and gas industry unworkable. The GMD while describing vandalism as an elitist business, lamentedthat nefarious activities were forcing production shutdown. Kyari said, \u201cYes, we have not gotten back production, but today, with activities that are going on, we promise that within the next one or two months, we will restore some level of normalcy.\n\nWhat is going on has nothing to do with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\u201cIt is purely activities of thieves, act of vandals which has rendered the industry unworkable and taken us to the level where today, our production is around 1.49 million barrel.\u201cWhat this did also as you may be aware is that the diesel that you see until last week, when we clamped down on some of these illegal refineries were actually coming from these illegal refineries. Until last three weeks ago, most of the diesel that you used in your homes are coming from these refineries and that why when we took them out, we cut off the line of supply by stopping the movement, that\u2019s when you heard that AGO got to N900 per litre.\u201cThat\u2019s not the market price for AGO.\n\nThen obviously, once supply becomes constrained, prices will go up and we are happy that NNPC\u2019s intervention has brought down the price of diesel to normal market price and we are happy to do.\u201cWhy people bought it was because it was cheaper when it was being sold in the market. We are happy that this intervention is working and hopefully in the one or two months, we will bring sanity back. The act of vandals and thieves has gotten to a level where we had to shut down the pipeline and declare force majuro on it.\n\n\u201cAlso the FXTL pipeline. So, as we speak now, there is no production going on there because we can no longer sustain the operation. This is not because we don\u2019t go back to replace pipeline that are damaged. But as we do, we have repeated insertions on these pipeline. It got to a point that when we inject 239,000 barrel per day, we only receive 3,000 barrel per day. There was simply no business for anyone to continue to produce.\n\nWhen you loss about 200,000 barrels per day, even at an average price of $65 per barrel, we lost close to $1 billion between January and March.\u201cFrom January till date, we lost an average of 250,000 barrel per day and at the current price of about $100 to the barrel, even within this short period, we have lost close to $1.5 billion.\u201dHe further revealed:\n\n\u201cIn January 2021, we were producing 239,000 barrel from the line linking Bonny Terminal and we only received 190,000 barrel meaning that we lost about 19,000 barrel to thieves then per day. This situation deteriorated to the extent that by March 7, 2022, it came to zero and so, we shut down the line and declared force Majeure.\u201cEven on our most reliable pipeline, which is the Forcados pipeline, we still loss about 7,000 barrel per day. Needless to say that these are all coming as a result of act of vandals and oil thieves.\n\nSo many interventions have taken place and we have continued to remove the insertions. To put it in context, within a distance of less than 20 kilometers, we removed 85 insertions. So, you can imagine when you are running a pipeline of about 300 to 400 kilometers.\u201d Kyari called for establishment of a special and independent court for speedy prosecution oil thieves.He warned that without speedy prosecution and conviction of the criminals, it would have an impact on the country\u2019s economic outlook and its ability to generate foreign exchange.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number of arrests made by the JTF, even vessel operators have made some arrests and also the Nigerian Navy in the last two weeks. Even more arrests have been made. Many of these illegal refineries are being taken down and also the insertions are being constantly removed and we believe that these interventions will pay off.\u201cAnd we will able to restore production. And this is centrally coordinated.\n\nThere is a coordinated action now because we are using a number of strategies including community-based security outfits. \u201cNo doubts it is a very difficult time and that\u2019s why despite the good intentions of the PIA, no one will produce oil, recover zero and put money back into the business. And that\u2019s why investments are very weak despite the good environment that the PIA has brought. All we need to do is to increase the advocacy so that the legal process takes its cause and prosecutions are done timely.\u201cI will recommend that we set up a special court for this. Such cases will be speedily dealt with, so that it is not just the ordinary \u2018small\u2019 people that you see at those locations that are prosecuted. We know that to sell crude oil in the international market, it is not the business of the ordinary people that you see in these illegal refineries; it is an elitist business and we must have the courage to set up very independent special courts to try cases related to this.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, the impact it has on our economic outlook \u2013 our ability to generate foreign exchange and in terms of energy security for this country \u2013 is threatened by a very few people.\u201dSpeaking further, the GMD reiterated President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s directive that the NNPC should strengthen its collaboration with security agencies and other stakeholders to tackle oil theft and illegal refineries in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are not helpless. Yes, it\u2019s a very daunting situation, no doubts, Mr. President in his wisdom directed the Chief of Defence Staff to lead a war, clearly it is a way to contain this situation and bring it to the barest minimum. So much is going on needless to say and I can share with you.\u201cThere is a massive activity going on by some government security agencies in collaboration with the industry, NNPC, two regulatory institutions and the Nigerian Army, Navy and Airforce and DSS with the collaboration of another agencies including NIMASA and others. \u201cThey are all working together to contain this situation.\n\nEvery agency of government is involved now. The DSS, EFCC to trace and track the movement of funds, NFIU to also trace movement of funds from all levels and we believe that this will pay off and ultimately, we will contain this situation,\u201d he added\n\n\n\nUrges Collective Action against Oil Thieves\n\nIn a related development, Kyari in his goodwill message at the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), 5th Quadrennial Delegates\u2019 Conference with the theme, \u201cJust Energy Transition: For Oil and Gas Workers Social Welfare and Security,\u201d in Asaba, yesterday, called for urgent collaborative effort of all stakeholders to stem the tide of oil theft. He said the NNPC would continue to partner NUPENG to sustain the production of oil and gas, adding that the sector would remain relevant at all times irrespective of emerging transitions in the energy sector.According to him, though global energy transition was going on, oil would still be available and in high demand till year 2050 and beyond.Kyari said: \u201cLocally, our industry is seriously being challenged.\n\nWe have seen vandalism around our areas of operation not just in the Niger Delta but across the various corridors of our product supply.\u201dThe activities oil thieves that have got to limit that we haven\u2019t seen before, almost bringing this industry to its knees today. \u201cThe NNPC GMD noted that with the current dismally low levels of production, every stakeholder must join hands to fight to sustain the industry to enable it survive for all.\n\nOn his part, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, who was represented by the Secretary to State Government (SSG) Chief Patrick Ukah, while declaring the event open, noted that NUPENG remains a critical and respected trade union in the oil and gas industry, urging the union leadership to always forget harmonious working relation with the management cadre in the oil and gas industry in order to stave off needless friction.The governor stressed the need for all the workers to be abreast of the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act in the overall interest of the nation.\n\nAlso, The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President, Ayuba Wabba, vowed that labour union would continue to engage the political class to ensure improved welfare for workers.He said that the strike action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) was not unpatriotic, even as he urged the federal government to get back to the negotiation table with a view to addressing the long-standing demands of the university teachers.\n\nHe also described casualisation of workers as evil and tantamount to slavery that must be resisted by workers.Also speaking, the Edo State Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu, noted that the petroleum sector plays a key role in the country\u2019s economy and called for diversification from oil to agriculture to address the economic and social crises from the oil and gas industry. He said only a formidable workforce with good welfare could rebuild the failing economy and address all the the challenges in the various sectors including the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe Minister of Labour, Dr Chris Ngige, represented by the Delta State Controller of Works, Mrs. Eucharia Ozurumba, lauded NUPENG for its welfare activities but charged the union to sustain struggles for welfare of workers and the fight against casualisation. Earlier in his welcome address, Prince Williams Akporeha, President of NUPENG, said the union would sustain fight against casualisation of oil workers even as he lamented other worrisome aspects of the national life including insecurity.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "He pointed out that troops of Operation Delta Safe had continued to dominate the zone and had conducted anti-crude oil theft and anti-illegal oil bunkering related operations at different locations.\nHe explained that the scale of crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism seen in the host communities was beyond explanation, and has rendered the oil and gas industry unworkable.\nSo, as we speak now, there is no production going on there because we can no longer sustain the operation.\nIt got to a point that when we inject 239,000 barrel per day, we only receive 3,000 barrel per day.\nHe said only a formidable workforce with good welfare could rebuild the failing economy and address all the the challenges in the various sectors including the oil and gas industry.",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

Last month, Microsoft launched a new office for its African Development Centre in Lagos, it\u2019ll house the company\u2019s product engineering, ecosystem development and innovation teams. In 2021, Huawei also announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia.\n\nIn Kenya, organisations such as Cisco and Philips also run similar innovation studios in Nairobi, while the Kenyan government is building a technology city, Konza City, to drive innovation in the country.\n\nThe launch of Visa\u2019s first African innovation studio and others serves as a boost to the African tech ecosystem as it\u2019ll encourage the creation, development, and implementation of novel ideas.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nCounselling Awareness Month is observed in the United States in April. Today, Friday, April 8, 2022, is Teal Day. Everyone is encouraged to wear teal \u2013 a dark greenish-blue colour \u2013 to support the nationwide effort to raise counsellor awareness and promote mental health.\n\nWhile we are not in the US, I believe now is an excellent time to sensitise you on the importance of counselling.\n\nSo, what is counselling? Counselling \u2013 also known as therapy \u2013 is a therapeutic approach that focuses on a client\u2019s emotional and intellectual experience: how they feel and what they think about the issue for which they have sought help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, there is a widespread misconception that therapy is only for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness. This is wrong; people seek therapy for various reasons, including discussing their lives and emotional upheavals, resolving conflicts, healing from trauma, and having a safe space to talk with someone who is not a part of their personal life.\n\nCounselling can offer immediate solutions and support. It\u2019s a collaborative effort between the client and the counsellor to clarify issues, explore options, develop strategies, and raise self-awareness.\n\nMost importantly, it isn\u2019t a waste of time because talking about your problem helps you feel better. So, why not give therapy a shot? While you\u2019re thinking about it, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll be discussing today:\n\nNIN-SIM linkage deadline extension\n\nImaliPay\u2019s $3 million seed\n\nFolklore Group\u2019s shift to B2B\n\nUnrelated, but an update is needed. Help Techpoint Africa determine how much African tech workers earn by filling out this form.\n\nIs the NIN-SIM linkage deadline extension really over?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat appeared to be an order that would never be carried out due to its deadline extension is now in effect. That came unexpectedly!\n\nWhat is the gist? On Monday, April 4, 2022, the Nigerian federal government barred all outgoing calls from all Subscriber Identity Modules (SIM) cards not linked to the National Identification Number (NIN) of the telecom subscriber.\n\nFollowing the continuous extension of deadlines, one might have concluded that the government wasn\u2019t serious about the NIN-SIM linkage. To put things in perspective, the deadline has been extended NINE times.\n\nThe initial January 19, 2021 deadline was pushed back to February 9, April 6, May 6, June 30, July 26, October 31, December 31, and finally, March 31, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the minister, the March 31, 2022 extension was granted in response to requests from stakeholders, including citizens, legal residents, and Nigerians in the diaspora. He also revealed that 71 million Nigerians had obtained their NIN, with an average of three to four SIMs per NIN.\n\nAs the famous phrase goes, \u201ceverything that has a beginning has an ending.\u201d I think we might have come to the end of the SIM-NIN-linkage deadline extension. B-but could this really be it?\n\nI mean, won\u2019t some stakeholders and Nigerians in the diaspora file an appeal, given that only 125 million subscribers had their NINs submitted for immediate linkage, verification, and authentication when the order was issued?\n\nMoreover, as of February 2022, Nigeria had 197,768,482 active mobile subscribers across all networks, according to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the telecoms industry regulator.\n\nGiven that a single subscriber has more than two lines registered to their name, it appears that approximately 37 million telecom subscribers across networks have been affected.\n\nInterestingly, yesterday, April 7, 2022, at the National Identification Management Commission\u2019s (NIMC) headquarters in Alausa, Lagos State, a crowd gathered at the gate, with issues ranging from enrolment to validation to corrections of an error on their NIN slip. Nonetheless, it appears that a larger number were there to register for their NINs.\n\nTechpoint Africa went on a short trip to confirm the situation but encountered some unpleasant scenes. For an in-depth look at the drama, please read here: NIN-SIM linkage: Worrying scenes at NIMC office, as the Nigerian government directs telcos to block defaulting subscribers\n\nImaliPay\u2019s $3 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to careers, most countries consider full-time work to be the norm. And if you don\u2019t have a 9-5, in some cases, you aren\u2019t regarded as employed and unlikely to be treated with respect. Also, if you appear younger than your age \u2013 as I do \u2013 know that you\u2019re just another adolescent on the street.\n\nAs an example, last year, a 200-level medical student approached me. To them, I was just another student in class 9 (JSS3). This might surprise you, but I get things like that or related to it, and they can be amusing or humiliating.\n\n2020 heralded a new era where the world transitioned to remote work, with COVID-19 leading to an increase in informal employment through digital platforms and innovation, thereby boosting the gig economy.\n\nConsequently, the gig economy in Africa has grown significantly, serving as a temporary measure for consumers when businesses closed during the lockdowns and providing employment for those who are excluded from formal and even informal opportunities.\n\nFor context on the gig economy in Africa, please, read: The gig economy is a big boost, but still a different story in Africa\n\nWhile the gig economy is growing, per research, gig workers in Africa do not have access to certain financial services. And ImaliPay, a \u201cone-stop-shop financial services platform,\u201d claims it addresses this issue.\n\nFounded in late 2020 by Tatenda Furusa and Oluwasanmi Akinmusire, the platform which provides financial services to ride-hailing companies to drive productivity has announced that it has raised a $3 million seed round in debt and equity.\n\nImaliPay, which is already present in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, will use the funds to expand its 50-person team, improve its technology, and expand into new markets such as Ghana and Egypt.\n\nFolklore Group\u2019s shift to B2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing The Folklore Group\u2019s $1.7 million pre-seed announcement yesterday, Thursday, April 7, 2022, the company also revealedf a shift from business-to-consumer (B2C) to business-to-business (B2B) wholesale.\n\nDo you know what B2B and B2C are? If you don\u2019t, please, read this: B2B vs B2C Ecommerce: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nThe funding round was led by Slauson & Co., a Los Angeles-based Venture Capital firm focused on early-stage technology investments, with participation from the Fearless Fund and other notable Black angel investors, including WNBA star Nneka Ogwumike.\n\nFounded by Amira Rasool (CEO) in 2018, the e-commerce company previously sourced, shipped, and did last-mile delivery to customers in 20 countries, including the US. However, that didn\u2019t allow it to grow quickly enough.\n\nWhat changed? A surge in demand for the fashion and lifestyle items the company sold accelerated the startup\u2019s transition to B2B wholesale. Now called Folklore Connect, the company will connect luxury fashion brands in emerging markets with bulk retailers in North America and, later, Europe.\n\nThe company is also launching a new marketplace for fashion brands or platforms to become affiliate partners and The Folklore Edit, an online media site that will feature fashion stories.\n\nThe CEO claims that the Folklore Group is opening up new markets for luxury and emerging brands from Africa and worldwide while also meeting the growing demand from retailers who value diversity and inclusion.\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\neLimu (CcHub) is hiring a mid-level Game Developer.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, April 4, 2022, after nine deadline extensions, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government directed all telcos to block Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) cards that have not been linked National Identity Numbers (NIN) from making outgoing calls. A decision that seems to have spurred Nigerians into action.\n\nAt the National Identification Management Commission\u2019s (NIMC) headquarters, Alausa, Lagos State, today, April 7, 2022, a crowd gathered at the gate, with problems ranging from enrolment to validation to corrections of an error on their NIN slip. However, it appears that a larger number were there to enrol for their NINs.\n\nIn December 2020, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) ordered all mobile subscribers to link their NINs to their SIM cards. People without NINs were to quickly register or risk being blocked by December 30, 2021.\n\nA decision that seemed questionable, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have your NIN, linking your SIM to your NIN is relatively seamless and can be done by dialling a code specific to your telecom provider or by calling customer care.\n\nHowever, going by the unhappy crowd at NIMC\u2019s office, the prospect of a NIN-SIM linkage could still be a long way off for some people.\n\nTechpoint Africa embarked on a little trip to confirm the situation but met with some unpleasant scenes.\n\nMembers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were on the ground to disperse the crowd. It took over 45 minutes to make it across the gate, even when we had an ID card with PRESS boldly written on it.\n\nUsing forceful methods for crowd control, the Civil Defence Corps flogged Nigerians in the crowd. Sadly, our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi Kolawole, also received a few strokes and a shove on the chest from the trigger-happy corps member.\n\nWhips and batons are used in riots and other violent situations. However, for a civil action like registering for a national identity, we find it worrying that whips, and not more humane solutions, are the preferred method for crowd control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn NSCDC member using a whip on Techpoint journalist\n\nUnnecessary NIN-SIM linkage crowds\n\nA lady at the scene confirmed that her SIM had been banned from making calls. While she could receive calls and use the Internet, she has been unable to make any calls since Monday.\n\nAccording to another lady, she has been coming to the NIMC office since the directive was given on Monday and has not been able to move past the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince Monday, there has been a crowd here. I\u2019ve been coming since Monday.\u201d\n\nA glance at the NIMC website reveals that these crowds and the ensuing whipping by Civil Defense staff could have been significantly avoided.\n\nInterestingly, one of our reporters, who had two of his SIMs blocked was able to quickly remedy this after dialing the respective NIN-SIM linkage codes for both service providers. One of his network providers is yet to block him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the NIMC compound. Some of these people have been here since Monday\n\nFrom the lady\u2019s explanation, she went to an agent enterprise to enrol for her NIN, had received her NIN, and linked it to her SIM. However, she has not been able to make calls since Monday.\n\n\u201cIf you want to use money and to do it in another place, when you bring it, they will say that one is fake,\u201d she said.\n\nNIMC licenses these agents to serve as registration centres for enrolment and retrieval, among other things.\n\nHowever, going by the lady\u2019s story, even people who have registered and gotten their NIN are also affected.\n\nWe also noticed that people who lost their SIMs and had to retrieve them also faced the same predicament.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government is now projecting to spend N7.35 trillion more than it will earn this year as it makes room for a nine-fold jump in petrol subsidy costs.\n\nThat effectively takes the 2022 budget deficit closer to 5 percent of GDP, the highest since 1999, according to data from the Central Bank compiled by BusinessDay.\n\nThe implication of the increased budget deficit in 2022 is that the government may end up spending less on capital projects and human capital which are critical in spurring economic growth and delivering jobs.\n\nThe latest figure presented to lawmakers Thursday, April 6, by President Muhammadu Buhari, who plans to borrow to make up the difference, marks an increase of N965 billion from the N6.3 trillion initially planned for 2022. It\u2019s also a 4 percent increase compared to an actual deficit of N7.05 trillion in the eleven months ending 2021, with the full year figure yet to be published.\n\nThe biggest contributor to the increased budget deficit is the petrol subsidy bill, provision for which increased nine-fold to N4 trillion from N442.72 billion.\n\nAs a percentage of GDP, the projected budget deficit of 5 percent for 2022 eclipses the record set in 2021 of 4.3 percent (as at November) and 4 percent in 2020, which is higher than the 3 percent threshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act for the third year running.\n\n\u201cWe have raised our fiscal deficit forecast for 2022 from 4.5 percent of GDP to 5 percent of GDP, largest since the 1990s, reflecting high expenses related to petrol subsidies and low crude production limiting revenue despite high world prices,\u201d analysts at the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a report.\n\n\u201cThe cost is unsustainable, but an election in early 2023 has sharpened the government\u2019s resolve to continue with price regulation,\u201d the EIU analysts noted.\n\nThe last time Nigeria\u2019s fiscal deficit exceeded 4 percent was in 1999 when the government opened the taps on infrastructure spending to give the economy a boost after years of military rule.\n\nRead also: Buhari seeks fresh borrowing as budget deficit increases to N7.35trn\n\nThat year, the government spent more on capital expenditure (N498bn) than recurrent expenditure (N449bn). The actual deficit amounted to N285 billion, 5.2 percent of GDP.\n\nIn 2022, however, the government will spend 29.84 of its total expenditure on capital projects and 70.16 percent on recurrent expenditure including salaries, debt service and the wasteful petrol subsidy. The petrol subsidy alone adds up to 24 percent of the government\u2019s projected N16.6 trillion total expenditure.\n\nIn reality, the government spends less on capital projects than it budgets. In 2020, for instance, it ended up spending about 4 times more on recurrent expenditure (N8.1 trillion) than on capital expenditure (N1.6 trillion) amid lower than planned revenues.\n\nNigeria\u2019s rising fiscal deficit is another stark reminder of how the petrol subsidy bills continue to eat into the earnings of the cash-strapped government.\n\nPetrol subsidy payment gulped about N1.67 trillion in 2021, according to data from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. This year it will rise more than two-fold, much faster than the government\u2019s revenues can cover.\n\nThe government had initially said the 2022 budget would only provide for subsidy till June but is now set to maintain it till next year when the current administration would have left office.\n\nOil prices shot above $100 per barrel for the first time in years as Russia invaded Ukraine but this has not benefitted Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer as the country has also been battling with weak oil production. Rampant oil theft has also worsened the country\u2019s precarious situation.\n\nNigeria\u2019s budget deficit is widening when it should narrow due to higher oil prices. Some other oil exporting countries are eyeing a surplus. Algeria for instance started to pay unemployed persons some money this year thanks to the excess cash derived from higher oil revenues.\n\nNigeria is also bucking the trend of some other African countries that are seeking to narrow their budget deficits this year.\n\nGhana announced plans last month to cut spending in order to reduce its budget deficit. The government said it would reduce discretionary spending and lower salaries for top public servants in a bid to reduce its budget deficit to 7.4 percent of GDP from an estimated 12.1 percent last year.\n\nThe West African nation\u2019s belt-tightening measures bolstered investor confidence and helped government bonds to their longest rally in two months.",

          "text": "Energy giant Shell has recorded an increase in its oil spills by a factor of two, to 3.3 thousand tonnes from 1.5 thousand tonnes in 2020, according to the organization\u2019s most recent sustainability report.\n\nThe company, in its 2021 sustainability report, said all sabotage and theft-related spills in 2021 occurred in Nigeria. The number of spills dropped to 106 in 2021, down from 122 in 2020, it noted.\n\nShell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC) manages a network of wells and pipelines across the Niger Delta and produces oil and gas through its SPDC joint venture (SPDC-operated, with Shell equity of 30 per cent).\n\nAccording to the report, the overall number of operational spills in the Niger Delta has decreased dramatically over the last 11 years, from more than 60 in 2011 to 9 in 2021. Third-party involvement and other unlawful activities continue to be a concern for the SPDC JV, which is working to prevent spills.\n\nIt said, \u201cWith operational spills, SPDC pays compensation to affected people and communities. When a spill is caused by illegal activities, SPDC provides relief to the communities affected on a case-by-case basis.\n\nRead also: Map story: Tracking crude oil theft in Nigeria\n\n\u201cThis relief can include food, health checks and clean water supply. In 2021, the time needed to complete the recovery of free-phase oil \u2013 oil that forms a separate layer and is not mixed with water or soil \u2013 was around six days,\u201d the report noted.\n\nMeanwhile, the company reported that by the end of 2021, a total of 283 wellhead cages had been built, with 62 of them being upgraded with closed-circuit television (CCTV). In comparison, by the end of 2020, there were 364 cages installed.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe year-on-year reduction of 81 cages was attributable to the 2021 divestment of the OML-17 licence. SPDC continues to review its portfolio options for onshore oil in Nigeria. In the last decade, SPDC has reduced its licences in this area by half.\n\n\u201cThe JV has increased security and surveillance and implemented several local initiatives to address the underlying causes and raise awareness of the damage caused by sabotage and theft. Regardless of the cause of a spill, the SPDC JV cleans up and remediates areas affected by spills originating from its facilities.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nRecently, the Edo State Deputy Governor, Rt. Hon. Comrade Phillip Shaibu flagged-off Lassa fever eradication campaign at Auchi. He called for total neatness and cleanliness within our environments and complete adherence to all preventive measures.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are here again to deal with the disease which is a major concern to government at the moment. Today, we decided to flag off Lassa fever eradication campaign. In 2018, we did a similar thing when Auchi was almost becoming an epidemic centre. With the cooperation of all major stakeholders at all levels, we were able to reduce the impact to a single digit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time, it is not to eliminate Lassa fever but to sustain the process to arrive at a zero digit. This time, we decided that our Royal father, the Otaru of Auchi should host us to quicken the message down to the various communities.\u201d\n\nLassa fever has caused Edo State more harm than any other diseases that has affected this state. Over twenty one persons have died of Lassa fever this year. This disease is preventable because it is transmitted to humans via rats even when it has ravaged our communities.\n\nLassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease. It was first discovered in Nigeria, when two missionary nurses became ill with the virus in 1969. Its name is derived from the village of Lassa, where it was first documented. Lassa fever is a viral infection carried by a type of rat that is common in West Africa. This is one of the most common rodents in equatorial Africa, found across much of sub-Saharan Africa. Lassa fever mainly occurs in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Nigeria. However, the Mastomys rat is common in neighboring countries, so these areas are also at risk.\n\nOnce a Mastomys rat is infected with the virus, it can excrete the virus in its faeces and urine, potentially for the rest of its life. As a result, the virus can spread easily, especially as the rats breed rapidly and can inhabit human homes. The most common method of transmission is by consuming or inhaling rat urine or faeces. It can also be spread through cuts and open sores.\n\nThe rats live in and around human habitation, and they often come into contact with foodstuffs. Sometimes people eat the rats, and the disease can be spread during their preparation. Person-to-person contact is possible via blood, tissue, secretions or excretions, but not through touch. Sharing needles may spread the virus, and there are some reports of sexual transmission. Lassa fever can also be passed between patients and staff at poorly equipped hospitals where sterilization and protective clothing is not standard.\n\nSymptoms include: Malaria, sore throat, bleeding in the gums, nose, eyes, or elsewhere, difficulty in breathing, a cough, vomiting and diarrhea, both with blood, difficulty swallowing, hepatitis, swollen face, pain in the chest, back, and abdomen, shock, hearing loss, which may be permanent, high or low blood pressure etc.\n\nDeath can occur within 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms due to multiple organ failure. However, health organizations hope that current work on vaccine development will be successful. Rehydration and treatment of symptoms can improve the chances of survival if there is an early diagnosis.\n\nThe main focus of prevention is \u201ccommunity hygiene,\u201d to control the rat population. These include: regular hand-washing, storing foods in rodent-proof containers, keeping garbage away from the home, keeping pet cats, avoiding blood and other bodily fluids when caring for sick relatives, following safe burial procedures, using protective equipment in a healthcare setting, including masks and eyewear. There is a test centre at Irrua Specialist Hospital, Irrua, Edo State University, Uzarue and the Edo State Government is presently planning a healthy to establish a centre at Auchi Central Hospital. .\n\nThe Mastomys rat is so widespread that it cannot realistically be eradicated. As a result, the main aim is to avoid these rodents and prevent them from sharing human habitation.\n\nComrade Shaibu said: \u201cIf we have a clean environment, then we are sure of having a healthy living.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

This was achieved by utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) solution, and Virtual Private Network (VPN) by using various Internet Service Providers (ISP).\n\n\u201cThis temporary use of the Network Automation System was deployed to assist TCN in conveying critical operational measurements data from remote stations to NCC using Web Technology, which is an integral component of the IoT. So far, the data received from remote stations has enabled NCC to obtain more insight into the situation of the power flow on the grid and has enabled NCC to make decisions that have impacted positively on the security and integrity of the Grid.\n\n\u201cThe stop-gap solution became necessary as TCN could not access and receive comprehensive operational data of the entire power grid for managing the fast-growing system. The existing inadequate SCADA System cannot provide adequate grid visibility, as parts of the existing SCADA system are moribund and damaged, coupled with an ineffective telecommunication network infrastructure.

It should be a public trial which the whole world must watch.\u201d\n\nThe new practice direction stipulates that court proceedings of offences of terrorism, subject to the provisions of section 232 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015 and section 34 of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2011 (as amended), shall be held in camera or as may be ordered by the Court.\n\nIt reads, \u201cThe coverage of proceedings under these Practice Directions is strictly prohibited, save as may be directed by the Court.\n\n\u201cA person who contravenes an order or direction made under these Practice Directions shall be deemed to have committed an offence contrary to section 34(5) of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act, 2011 (as amended),\u201d the statement partly reads.",

Pinkett Smith has alopecia, a skin condition that can result in hair loss. After striking Rock, Smith returned to his seat and screamed profanities at his fellow star.\n\nThe academy\u2019s board was initially set to convene on April 18 to discuss possible disciplinary actions, including a potential suspension or ban from the organization. However, last week Smith resigned from the group calling his own actions \u201cshocking, painful, and inexcusable.\u201d\n\nSmith apologized to the academy and his fellow nominees during his acceptance speech for the best actor award, which he won for his portrayal of Richard Williams in \u201cKing Richard.\u201d He apologized to Rock via social media the day after the ceremony.\n\nRock, meanwhile, has refrained from making public comments about the slap. He told a crowd at a comedy show last week in Boston that he was \u201cstill processing what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring our telecast, we did not adequately address the situation in the room,\u201d academy executives said in the letter Friday. \u201cFor this, we are sorry. This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short \u2014 unprepared for the unprecedented.\u201d\n\nThe academy has said that Smith refused to leave the ceremony after he struck the comedian. However, there are conflicting reports about whether Smith was actually asked to leave or if it was just suggested that he depart before his award category was called.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department was ready to arrest Smith at the awards ceremony, according to a producer of the show, but Rock declined to press charges.",

Preliminary results from the latest round of the Cadre Harmonis\u00e9 (CH) analysis project further deterioration of the food security situation in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (BAY) states in 2022, where more than 8.4 million people require humanitarian assistance and protection.\n\n\u201cThe March 2022 CH projects 4.1 million people in need (IPC Phase 3 or above) during the peak of the 2022 lean season, of whom an estimated 587,955 people are projected to be in an emergency situation (Phase 4). According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) acute malnutrition analysis (IPC AMN) from September 2021 \u2013 August 2022 the number of acutely malnourished children and women is expected to significantly increase in the year 2022 and further worsen in the lean season.\n\nThese are anticipated to be the highest levels observed since the emergency period of 2016. The analysis indicates that 1.74 million children aged 6-59 months will need treatment for acute malnutrition in 2022.\n\n\u201cDeteriorating food consumption patterns are contributing to the worsening food security and nutrition situation. The March 2022 CH analysis showed severe consumption deficits, extending beyond Borno State, and the February 2022 Mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (mVAM) revealed that 42.1% of households in BAY states had insufficient food intake, as compared to 37.8% at the same period in 2021.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 HRP is seeking $1.1 billion to support 5.5 million people. $351 million is urgently needed to deliver life-saving food security and nutrition assistance to the most affected people.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigerian Military Launches New Operation to Curb Record Levels of Crude Oil Theft in Niger Delta",
          "text": "As the battle against crude oil theft, a development that has resulted to severe revenue to the country as well as its inability to meet its production quota, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) on Thursday disclosed that it had launched a special operation code named \u2018Operation Dakatar da Barawo\u2019 in order to curb crude oil theft and illegal oil bunkering in the Niger Delta region.\n\nIt also revealed that 30 illegal oil refineries had been demobilised in the region by the naval troops in the last two weeks.\n\nThis was just as the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr. Mele Kyari, on Thursday expressed optimism that the country would return to normal crude oil production in the next two months, even as he stressed the need for collective action to address the unfortunate situation.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing in Abuja, the Director, Defence Media Operations (DDMO), Maj Gen Benard Onyeuko, said the new operation in the Niger Delta region was aimed at reinvigorating the already existing operation Delta Safe, with a view to containing economic saboteurs in the region.\n\nOther objectives of the new operations include, \u201cto secure critical maritime infrastructure, create enabling environment for the sustenance of desired level of hydrocarbon production, safe shipping and economic activities, and restore investor confidence in Nigeria\u2019s Maritime domain, among others\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that troops of Operation Delta Safe had continued to dominate the zone and had conducted anti-crude oil theft and anti-illegal oil bunkering related operations at different locations.\n\nHe listed the locations to include Opuama Celestial, Lolomu Ruler in Warri North Local Government Area, Obodo water-ways in Warri South West Local Government Area of Delta State.\n\nOther locations are: Egbeda, Ibaa, Oduoha, Rumekpe in Emohua Local Government Area, Elele; Ikwere Local Government Area of River State and Brass Creek in Ozobo community in Ekeremor Local Government Area of Bayelsa State.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, troops discovered and destroyed 30 illegal refining sites, 37 reservoirs, 31 ovens, 12 large wooden boats, two cooling systems, three receivers, three storage pits and a metal drums.\n\n\u201cCumulatively, troops within the period under review recovered 12,150,000 liters of illegal refined Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) 4,000 liters of stolen crude oil, three tankers, three vehicles, 73 galvanised pipes, two motorcycles, one bus, one Toyota Camry, Mercedes Benz car,\u201d he revealed.\n\nKyari Foresees Return to Normal Oil Production in Two Months\n\nMeanwhile, Kyari, while addressing members of the House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Upstream investigating reasons why Nigeria had not been able to meet its production quota, said the federal government was not only working on recovery of its production quota, but its sustainability as well.\n\nHe explained that the scale of crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism seen in the host communities was beyond explanation, and has rendered the oil and gas industry unworkable.\n\nThe GMD while describing vandalism as an elitist business, lamented\n\nthat nefarious activities were forcing production shutdown.\n\nKyari said, \u201cYes, we have not gotten back production, but today, with activities that are going on, we promise that within the next one or two months, we will restore some level of normalcy. What is going on has nothing to do with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\n\u201cIt is purely activities of thieves, act of vandals which has rendered the industry unworkable and taken us to the level where today, our production is around 1.49 million barrel.\n\n\u201cWhat this did also as you may be aware is that the diesel that you see until last week, when we clamped down on some of these illegal refineries were actually coming from these illegal refineries. Until last three weeks ago, most of the diesel that you used in your homes are coming from these refineries and that why when we took them out, we cut off the line of supply by stopping the movement, that\u2019s when you heard that AGO got to N900 per litre.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the market price for AGO. Then obviously, once supply becomes constrained, prices will go up and we are happy that NNPC\u2019s intervention has brought down the price of diesel to normal market price and we are happy to do.\n\n\u201cWhy people bought it was because it was cheaper when it was being sold in the market. We are happy that this intervention is working and hopefully in the one or two months, we will bring sanity back. The act of vandals and thieves has gotten to a level where we had to shut down the pipeline and declare force majuro on it.\n\n\u201cAlso the FXTL pipeline. So, as we speak now, there is no production going on there because we can no longer sustain the operation. This is not because we don\u2019t go back to replace pipeline that are damaged. But as we do, we have repeated insertions on these pipeline. It got to a point that when we inject 239,000 barrel per day, we only receive 3,000 barrel per day. There was simply no business for anyone to continue to produce. When you loss about 200,000 barrels per day, even at an average price of $65 per barrel, we lost close to $1 billion between January and March.\n\n\u201cFrom January till date, we lost an average of 250,000 barrel per day and at the current price of about $100 to the barrel, even within this short period, we have lost close to $1.5 billion.\u201d\n\nHe further revealed: \u201cIn January 2021, we were producing 239,000 barrel from the line linking Bonny Terminal and we only received 190,000 barrel meaning that we lost about 19,000 barrel to thieves then per day. This situation deteriorated to the extent that by March 7, 2022, it came to zero and so, we shut down the line and declared force Majeure.\n\n\u201cEven on our most reliable pipeline, which is the Forcados pipeline, we still loss about 7,000 barrel per day. Needless to say that these are all coming as a result of act of vandals and oil thieves. So many interventions have taken place and we have continued to remove the insertions. To put it in context, within a distance of less than 20 kilometers, we removed 85 insertions. So, you can imagine when you are running a pipeline of about 300 to 400 kilometers.\u201d\n\nKyari called for establishment of a special and independent court for speedy prosecution oil thieves.\n\nHe warned that without speedy prosecution and conviction of the criminals, it would have an impact on the country\u2019s economic outlook and its ability to generate foreign exchange.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe number of arrests made by the JTF, even vessel operators have made some arrests and also the Nigerian Navy in the last two weeks. Even more arrests have been made. Many of these illegal refineries are being taken down and also the insertions are being constantly removed and we believe that these interventions will pay off.\n\n\u201cAnd we will able to restore production. And this is centrally coordinated. There is a coordinated action now because we are using a number of strategies including community-based security outfits.\n\n\u201cNo doubts it is a very difficult time and that\u2019s why despite the good intentions of the PIA, no one will produce oil, recover zero and put money back into the business. And that\u2019s why investments are very weak despite the good environment that the PIA has brought. All we need to do is to increase the advocacy so that the legal process takes its cause and prosecutions are done timely.\n\n\u201cI will recommend that we set up a special court for this. Such cases will be speedily dealt with, so that it is not just the ordinary \u2018small\u2019 people that you see at those locations that are prosecuted. We know that to sell crude oil in the international market, it is not the business of the ordinary people that you see in these illegal refineries; it is an elitist business and we must have the courage to set up very independent special courts to try cases related to this.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, the impact it has on our economic outlook \u2013 our ability to generate foreign exchange and in terms of energy security for this country \u2013 is threatened by a very few people.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the GMD reiterated President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s directive that the NNPC should strengthen its collaboration with security agencies and other stakeholders to tackle oil theft and illegal refineries in Nigeria. \u201cWe are not helpless. Yes, it\u2019s a very daunting situation, no doubts, Mr. President in his wisdom directed the Chief of Defence Staff to lead a war, clearly it is a way to contain this situation and bring it to the barest minimum. So much is going on needless to say and I can share with you.\n\n\u201cThere is a massive activity going on by some government security agencies in collaboration with the industry, NNPC, two regulatory institutions and the Nigerian Army, Navy and Airforce and DSS with the collaboration of another agencies including NIMASA and others.\n\n\u201cThey are all working together to contain this situation. Every agency of government is involved now. The DSS, EFCC to trace and track the movement of funds, NFIU to also trace movement of funds from all levels and we believe that this will pay off and ultimately, we will contain this situation,\u201d he added\n\nUrges Collective Action against Oil Thieves\n\nIn a related development, Kyari in his goodwill message at the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), 5th Quadrennial Delegates\u2019 Conference with the theme, \u201cJust Energy Transition: For Oil and Gas Workers Social Welfare and Security,\u201d in Asaba, on Thursday, called for urgent collaborative effort of all stakeholders to stem the tide of oil theft.\n\nHe said the NNPC would continue to partner NUPENG to sustain the production of oil and gas, adding that the sector would remain relevant at all times irrespective of emerging transitions in the energy sector.\n\nAccording to him, though global energy transition was going on, oil would still be available and in high demand till year 2050 and beyond.\n\nKyari said: \u201cLocally, our industry is seriously being challenged. We have seen vandalism around our areas of operation not just in the Niger Delta but across the various corridors of our product supply.\n\n\u201cThe activities oil thieves that have got to limit that we haven\u2019t seen before, almost bringing this industry to its knees today. \u201c\n\nThe NNPC GMD noted that with the current dismally low levels of production, every stakeholder must join hands to fight to sustain the industry to enable it survive for all.\n\nOn his part, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, who was represented by the Secretary to State Government (SSG) Chief Patrick Ukah, while declaring the event open, noted that NUPENG remains a critical and respected trade union in the oil and gas industry, urging the union leadership to always forget harmonious working relation with the management cadre in the oil and gas industry in order to stave off needless friction.\n\nThe governor stressed the need for all the workers to be abreast of the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act in the overall interest of the nation.\n\nAlso, The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President, Ayuba Wabba, vowed that labour union would continue to engage the political class to ensure improved welfare for workers.\n\nHe said that the strike action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) was not unpatriotic, even as he urged the federal government to get back to the negotiation table with a view to addressing the long-standing demands of the university teachers.\n\nHe also described casualisation of workers as evil and tantamount to slavery that must be resisted by workers.\n\nAlso speaking, the Edo State Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu, noted that the petroleum sector plays a key role in the country\u2019s economy and called for diversification from oil to agriculture to address the economic and social crises from the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe said only a formidable workforce with good welfare could rebuild the failing economy and address all the the challenges in the various sectors including the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe Minister of Labour, Dr Chris Ngige, represented by the Delta State Controller of Works, Mrs. Eucharia Ozurumba, lauded NUPENG for its welfare activities but charged the union to sustain struggles for welfare of workers and the fight against casualisation.\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, Prince Williams Akporeha, President of NUPENG, said the union would sustain fight against casualisation of oil workers even as he lamented other worrisome aspects of the national life including insecurity.\n\nKingsley Nwezeh, Udora Orizu in Abuja and Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba",
