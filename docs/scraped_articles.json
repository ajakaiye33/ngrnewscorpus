          "title": "Tinubu returns to Nigeria after three-month UK medical trip",
          "text": "The National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, returned to Nigeria on Friday after about a three-month medical trip to the United Kingdom, where he underwent a knee surgery.\n\nThe former Lagos State governor arrived in Lagos barely 24 hours after the incumbent Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, inaugurated the South-West Agenda 2023 (SWAGA \u201823), a group rooting for Tinubu as the APC presidential candidate in the 2023 election.\n\nThough Tinubu had yet to declare his intention to contest any office in 2023, there have been rumours and veiled indications that he might be interested in the exalted seat.\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives from the North who endorsed Tinubu\u2019s candidacy when they visited him in the UK recently also lent credence to his purported interest.\n\nWhile he was in London, he was visited by a number of politicians, including the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.); Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Governors Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), and Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti).\n\nOthers who visited Tinubu included a former governor of Ogun State and incumbent Senator representing Ogun Central, Ibikunle Amosun; former governor of Borno State and Senator representing Borno Central, Kashim Shettima; and member representing Gubio, Kaga and Magumeri Federal Constituency of Borno State, Usman Zanna.\n\nAlso on the list are Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Obafemi Hamzat; Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa; Chief of Staff to Lagos State Governor, Tayo Ayinde; Deputy Chief of Staff to Lagos State Governor, Gboyega Soyannwo; Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor on Education, Tokunbo Wahab; and a former APC National Legal Adviser, Muiz Banire.\n\nIt was learnt that Tinubu arrived in Lagos on Friday evening unannounced, two days earlier than his reported plan to return to the country.\n\nA statement from the Tinubu Media Office on Friday, titled, \u2018Asiwaju is back\u2019, said the ex-governor underwent surgery on his right knee as well as rigorous post-surgery physiotherapy, adding that he was now fully healed.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cContrary to unfounded rumour, he underwent no other surgical procedures and contemplates none in the future. His recuperation has been without complication and ahead of the schedule by the attending surgeon.\n\n\u201cHe has returned fully healed from the knee surgery and fully committed to doing his modest part of advancing the cause of progressive democratic good governance throughout our beloved nation.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju, first and foremost, would like to thank President Muhammadu Buhari for taking the time to visit him in London to express his wishes for a speedy recovery from the knee operation.\n\n\u201cHe is also not forgetting others who would have loved to visit him but couldn\u2019t make it and his numerous friends, associates, supporters and well-wishers who have been with him in prayers and supplications to Allah.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, SWAGA 23 has said Tinubu already has 12 million votes in the bag ahead of the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe chairman of the pro-Tinubu group, Senator Adedayo Adeyeye, made this known on Friday as a guest on Channels TV\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019 programme monitored by The PUNCH.\n\nAdeyeye, a former Minister of State for Works and Housing, boasted that just like Buhari who raked in 12 million votes from the North before the 2015 elections, Tinubu also had at least 12 million votes from the South-West.\n\nHe said traditional rulers in the South-West were also in support of Tinubu\u2019s 2023 presidential bid.\n\nThe SWAGA chairman, however, said his group was not launched by Tinubu but they were prodding the ex-Lagos governor to run for Presidency in 2023.\n\nAdeyeye said, \u201cWhen this movement started, we wanted our candidate who some people, particularly in Abuja and some circles, have been saying has no home base; he is no longer popular and all that. We wanted to prove to them that the man is very acceptable, not only in his home base but throughout the country.\n\n\u201cWe want everybody in the South-West to rally around this man and support him and so far we have been very successful.\n\n\u201cWe have moved round the palaces to see most of our top traditional rulers who have endorsed him.\n\n\u201cCharity begins at home; we wanted to solidify the home base. Once the home base is solidified, I believe other Nigerians, particular in our party, will feel more comfortable to field this candidate, knowing that he can win the election for them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the chances of Tinubu in the 2023 elections, the APC chieftain said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that one of the selling points for President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 was that he already had 12 million votes in his pocket (in previous elections) particularly in the North-West and North-East. So, it was easy with support from a few other places for him to win the presidency.\n\n\u201cWe are also saying that come 2023, the man we are projecting already has at least 12 to 13 million votes in his pocket and so it will be easy.\u201d\n\nAsked how sure he was about his statistics, Adeyeye said, \u201cI am giving it (figure) based on what I have seen on the ground, having to transverse the length and breadth of the South-West and having seen people from political parties saying that when it comes to the issue of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, they will shed their partisan toga and embrace him and vote for him. I have seen that in the palaces of the Obas, amongst artisans and market women.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the issue of the Presidency in 2023, all of these people in unison, they will shed every difference and vote for this man.\n\n\u201cThe votes in the South-West are more than 20 million votes. I am only saying 12 to 13 million votes are already assured and I say it with all sense of responsibility without fear of contradiction that those 12 to 13 votes are already in the bag.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "2022 Budget: Defence, infrastructure, education lead with N5.15trn allocation",
          "text": "\u2026INEC gets N100 b for 2023 elections\n\n\u2026Revenue not debt is the biggest challenge -FG\n\n\u2026Agencies face sanction over targets\n\nBy Emmanuel Elebeke & Obas Esiedesa\n\nTHE Federal Government has prioritized spending on defence & security, infrastructure and education with the sectors getting a combined N5.15 trillion allocation in the 2022 Budget proposal.\n\nFrom the proposal, defence and security got N2.41 trillion (15%); infrastructure N1.45 trillion (8.9%); education N1.29 trillion (7.9%); health N820 billion (5%) and Social Development and Poverty Eradication N863 billion (5.3%) of the entire allocation.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed disclosed this at the public presentation and breakdown of the highlights of the 2022 appropriation bill at the ministry\u2019s auditorium in Abuja on Friday.\n\nRecall that President Muhammadu Buhari had on Thursday presented the 2022 aggregate expenditure projected to be N16.39 trillion which is 12.5% higher than the 2021 budget to the National Assembly.\n\nA breakdown of N16.39 trillion estimated budget shows that recurrent spending for the projected year is N6.83 trillion, repressing 41.7% of total expenditure and 18.5% higher than the 2021 budget.\n\nFrom the estimate, aggregate capital expenditure of N5.35 trillion is earmarked, representing 32.7% of total expenditure.\n\nThis provision is inclusive of capital components of statutory transfers, Government Owned Enterprises capital and project-tied loans expenditures.\n\nThe Minister said a total sum of N10.132 trillion revenue is expected be raked in within the year under review to fund the budget, while N3.60 trillion was earmarked to fund debts.\n\nParameter & Key Assumptions\n\nOil price was benchmarked at $57 per barrel in the year in view daily oil production was pegged at 1.88 million barrels per day for 2022. Exchange rate was put at N410.15 per US dollar and GDP growth rate was projected at 4.20%, while inflation was put at 13%.\n\nAlthough, Nigeria\u2019s total oil production capacity is put at 2.5mbpd, current crude production is about 1.4mbpd and additional 300,000bpd of condensates, totaling about 1.7mbpd.\n\nKey project allocations\n\nA further breakdown of allocations to critical projects and programmes of the Federal Government showed that allocation for construction and rehabilitation of roads in every geo-political zone was N168 billion; N58 billion for renovation and construction of bridges.\n\nIn Education, N108.1 billion was provided for the Universal Basic Education, N1.2 billion for rehabilitation of classrooms/hostels, N392 million as takeoff grants for six federal science and technical colleges; N4.5 billion as scholarship allowances; and N2 billion as payment to 5,000 Federal Teachers Scheme Allowance.\n\nIn the Social Investment subsector, the government provided N410 billion for Federal Intervention Programme including home grown school feeding programme, government economic empowerment programme, conditioner cash transfers among others.\n\nFor regional programmes, the government allocated N65 billion for Presidential Amnesty Programme for ex-militants in the Niger Delta, N46.2 billion to North-East Development Commission, and N98.7 billion to the Niger Delta Development Commission.\n\nN10 billion was also provided for the East-West road in the Niger Delta with another N15 billion provided for other critical infrastructure, agriculture and health system projects in the region.\n\nIn the power sector, N300 billion was provided to bridge tariff revenue shortfall, N1 billion for the expansion of distribution infrastructure, and N114 billion for the completion of renewable energy projects by the Rural Electrification Agency.\n\nMrs. Ahmed explained that government expenditure projection for 2022 also increased following additional provisions of N100 billion for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) towards preparation for the 2023 general elections; N400 billion for national poverty reduction, N178.1 billion for population and housing census scheduled for 2022, N54 billion for the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI), and N305.99 billion for TETFUND.\n\nRevenue not debt is the biggest challenge\n\nThe Minister also moved to allay fears over Nigeria\u2019s rising debt profile, saying generating more revenue rather than debt level was the country\u2019s biggest challenge.\n\nAccording to her, Nigeria\u2019s budget deficit to GDP (-4.7%) and debt to GDP (21.6%) ratios were the lowest among African countries.\n\n\u201cHowever, Nigeria\u2019s Debt Service/GDP ratio (73% as at August 2021) is the highest among same African top economies; This is proof that what we have is not a classic debt sustainability problem, but a revenue challenge\u201d, she added.\n\nShe stressed that to boost government\u2019s revenue more Nigerians needed to pay tax, saying the tax base was abysmally low with just N41 million people paying tax in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is now critical to fix our revenue challenge, because cutting expenditure is not currently a viable option, as our Public Expenditure /GDP ratio is also the lowest among same Africa\u2019s leading economies;\n\n\u201cWe must however continue to rationalise our expenditures as we cannot afford waste; In reality, our largest expenditure items are currently personnel cost, debt service and capital expenditure, which between them account for 85% of the 2022 budget; There is very little scope for cut in any of these over the medium term;\n\n\u201cThe most viable solution to our fiscal challenge therefore remains to grow our revenues and plug all leakages.\n\n\u201cOur target over the medium term is to grow our Revenue-to-GDP ratio from about 8 \u2013 9 percent currently to 15 percent by 2025. At that level of revenues, the Debt-Service-to-Revenue ratio will cease to be a critical concern\u201d, she stated.\n\nOn why government has continued to borrow, the Minister said administration is borrowing for the right reasons and would ensure the funds are properly utilized to achieve the targeted goals.\n\nShe said Nigeria has not exceeded the borrowing limit to GDP ratio but admitted that the administration exceeded the limited once due to the advent of COVID-19 pandemic which posed additional financial burden on the government.\n\nShe disclosed that government was going to improve its revenue tracking and monitoring system to ensure that revenue generating agencies meet their revenue target for the year.\n\nWhile warning that sanctions would be imposed on agencies that consistently fail to meet their revenue targets, she disclosed that the leadership of such agencies would face consequences.\n\nCorroborating the Minister\u2019s position, the Director General of Budget, Ben Akabueze said, there was a moral underpinning the budget, hence the need for government to borrow in absence of expected revenue to meet the basic needs of the country.\n\nHe insisted that government had no option than to borrow to fund critical projects like security and infrastructure.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mohammad Nami, said the service had collected a total of N4.2 trillion revenue as at 30th September 2021. Out of this sum, he said 950 billion was collected from oil related taxes, while N3.63 trillion was collected from non-oil sources.\n\nOn the sum, he disclosed that a total of N1 trillion was collected from 41 million tax payers so far captured in its tax net as against 40 million that paid same amount in 2020.\n\nExpected impact\n\nOn the expected impact, Ahmed said the 2022 budget estimate is expected to further accelerate the recovery of our economy; attain more inclusive GDP growth that would lift millions of our citizens out of poverty.\n\nDespite revenue challenge, she assured that government remains committed to the effective implementation of the Strategic Revenue Growth Initiatives, plugging of drainages and ensuring more effective independent revenue monitoring.\n\n2021 budget performance\n\nIn her review of the 2021 budget performance, she disclosed that at the end of August 2021, Federal Government retain revenue was N3.93 trillion which was 73% of target.\n\nA breakdown showed that Federal Government share of oil revenue was N754.2 billion (56.3% of target), non-oil tax revenue was N1.15 trillion (115.7% of target)\n\nCompanies income tax and value added tax brought in N547.54 billion (121%) and N235.77 billion (148%) respectively. Customs generated N338.66 billion (99% of target).\n\nOther revenues amounted to N1.71 trillion, of which Federal Government Independent revenues was N691.36 billion while government owned enterprises\u2019 (GOEs) retained revenues was N873.52 billion.\n\nOn the expenditure side, she disclosed that N8.14 trillion (or 84%) has been spent out of the N9.71 trillion prorata budget. \u201cThis performance is inclusive of expenditure estimates of the GOEs but exclusive of Project-tied loans\u201d, she added.\n\nMrs. Ahmed explained that of the expenditure, N2.87 trillion was for debt service, and N2.57 trillion for personnel cost, including pensions.\n\n\u201cAs at August 2021, N1.759 trillion had been expended for capital. Of this, N1.723 trillion represents 81% of the provision for MDAs\u2019 capital, and N36.01 billion as GOEs capital expenditure\u201d, the Minister explained further.\n\nRegional and domestic development\n\nDespite the adverse impact COVID-19 pandemic, the Minister said economic activities in Sub Sahara Africa region are expected to pick up from 2021 to 2022 albeit unevenly and GDP is projected to expand by 3.4% in 2021 and 4.1% in 2022.\n\nOn the local front, she said Nigeria\u2019s economy grew by 5.01% in Q2 2021 signaling rebound, with the non-oil sector contributing significantly to the economic performance in the Q2 with growth of 6.74% in real terms.\n\nShe however, informed that several measures are being instituted under the administration\u2019s strategic revenue growth initiatives to improve government revenue and entrench fiscal prudence with emphasis on achieving value for money.\n\nSome of the measures include: improving tax administration framework including tax filing and payment compliance improvements; evaluation of the process and policy effectiveness of fiscal incentives; ensuring that MDAs appropriately account for and remit their internally-generated revenue; plugging fiscal drainers like subsidy; leveraging technology and automation and setting annual ceilings on tax expenditures to better manage their impact on already constrained government revenues.\n\nTo further enhance independent revenue collection, she said government aims to optimize the operational efficiencies and revenue generation focus of Government owned Enterprises (GOEs).\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Abubakar Haruna, Garkuwan Kabi (MD/CEO Kaduna Electric).\n\nA Lecture will also be delivered from 10.30am to 12.00noon at Emir\u2019s Palace, to be followed by the Special Prayer & Wedding Nikkah after Jummu\u2018ah Prayer at the Muhammad Mera Central Mosque.\n\nA book detailing the rich cultural heritage and history of one of the oldest Emirate in Nigeria Argungu was also presented to Senator Orji Uzo Kalu.\n\nIt was also announced at the gathering which had the presence of journalists at the National Assembly that President of the Senate, Senator Ahmed Lawan will also be Honoured alongside Orji Kalu with a traditional title.\n\nIn his remarks, Senator Kalu appreciated the Argungu emirate in considering him worthy of receiving the traditional title.\n\nKalu described the gesture as a laudable testament that Nigeria will continue to exist as one indivisible entity. He thanked His Royal Highness, Alhaji Samaila Muhammadu Mera for the honour conferred on him and congratulated the emir on the upcoming wedding fathiha of his daughter, Habiba.\n\nHe further informed that the traditional conferment will be second traditional title in Kebbi saying that the first one was bestowed on him by the Gwandu emirate council in 2004 in Gwandu area of the state.\n\nKalu stressed that the unity of Nigeria was being strengthened and hence politicians must focus on sustaining it.\n\n\u201cI would like to use this opportunity to call on politicians to focus on the unity of the country, focus on the problem of banditry, focus on the problem of the people rather than focusing on the election coming on in the two year\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cPeople of Nigeria should focus on the unity of Nigeria today because the unity of the country is more important to us today than any other thing we are going to do.\n\n\u201cIf we are overrun by bandits, we will not be able to run for election.\n\n\u201cThose who are sabotaging the government should stop henceforth, so that we will live in a very conducive environment.\u201d\n\nHe urged Nigerians to support the governments at all levels and the security agencies in the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe government alone can not do this fight,it is for everybody to fight and win, and so we must report back to our security agencies, where we find any challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former Governor also used the opportunity to engage journalists to address national issues most especially the spate of violence and attacks in the Southeast region.\n\nAs a means of addressing the challenges Senator Kalu advised President Buhari to conciliate \u2018Ndigbo\u2019\n\nThe Senate Chief Whip,described the resurgence of attacks and insecurity in the Southeast as unfortunate, saying the impasse was not beyond a discussion that could restore peace and tranquility in the region.\n\nHe said, the situation cannot be solved politically, but through pacification of the people of the Southeast, adding that a committee should be set up to interact with the aggrieved.\n\nKalu asserted that President Buhari as a father of the nation should look into the grievances of the people of the Southeast with passion.\n\nHe said : \u201cMy position has always been that Buhari is the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and he is a father. As a father, the President should look passionately towards that Southeast.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing special about people not being listened to. Buhari is the president of Nigeria. The problem can be solved not by political means and the South East governors should do more than they require. I was a governor and not just a senator. Governors should interact more with the people, as it\u2019s not just the work of the President.\n\nKalu said governors should not abdicate from doing all they could to ensure peace, but should show commitment, instead leaving security issues to President Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, it was normal that good and bad children exist anywhere, but depending on how they were handled, the nation needed unity more than anything else now.\n\n\u201cOur governors should do more, the President being the father of the nation. They might have some good children, some bad children. In the kingdom of a.King, you may have all kinds of people, so I want the President to look passionately into that area.\n\n\u201cLet him look back as a father of the nation and see how he can set up a small Committee and pacify the area, because this country needs unity more than anything that we needed.\n\n\u201cWithout unity, those who are planning to run for House of Assembly election, Senatorial election and Presidential election are going nowhere. So it\u2019s a thing that the president as a father and the people of the Southeast should sort themselves out.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

The party\u2019s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, disclosed this while addressing newsmen on the outcome of the NEC held in Abuja.\n\nOlogbondiyan said the NEC considered and adopted Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi-led Zoning Committee\u2019s report, ahead of the party\u2019s national convention, scheduled for October 30. The committee had recommended that the current elective National Working Committee (NWC) positions in the party should be swapped between the north and the south. Ologbondiyan, however, clarified that what was approved was not about the executive and legislative positions in the 2023 general elections, but the elective NWC positions for the forthcoming convention.\n\nAsked if the date for the national convention was still sacrosanct, Ologbondiyan said there was no contrary decision regarding the date of the convention during the meeting.\n\n\u201cSo far, nothing has been said to alter the date of the convention, which is Oct. 30, \u201d Ologbondiyan said.\n\nOn when the aspirants would start obtaining forms, Ologbondiyan said what was adopted was the recommendation of zoning between the north and the south. He said what was expected was for the regions to go and micro-zone the positions to the geopolitical zones, after which aspirants can start obtaining forms.\n\nOlogbondiyan, however, said that the report of Gov. Bala Mohammed committee on PDP performance in the last general elections would be considered in another meeting of the NEC.\n\nPDP acting national chairman, Yemi Akinwonmi, in his opening remarks, charged party leaders to bury their differences in the interest of the party.\n\nHe said Nigerians were waiting for the opposition party to rescue the country from the problems created by the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nMeanwhile, embattled chairman of the PDP, Uche Secondus, said he was at the Appeal Court to fight for his fundamental rights and seek redress for wrongs done to him.\n\nSecondus, in a statement by his media aide, Ike Abonyi, alleged there were unrestrained blackmail against him.\n\n\u201cSince the orchestrated plan to hijack the soul of our great party by one of the governors, there has been unrestrained blackmail against the person of Prince Uche Secondus.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst was the baseless lies that Prince Secondus as National Chairman was not meeting up with his obligations at his ward level in Rivers State. It was based on such ridiculous lies that they approached the court to get the purported interim order. After the interim order based on such frivolous story, the said governor and his errand boys went ahead to get the court ruling against Prince Secondus.\n\n\u201cFor being so treated and victimized without any justification whatsoever after almost four years of selfless service to the party, Prince Secondus is left with no option but to fight for his fundamental rights by approaching the court to seek redress and correct the blackmail and concoctions.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, revealed plans to review existing tax laws in the country.\n\nHe stated this when he presented a N16.39 trillion budget proposal for the 2022 fiscal year to a joint session of the National Assembly.\n\nDuring the presentation of the Appropriations Bill 2022 at a joint session attended by members of both chambers of the National Assembly, Buhari said the country\u2019s debt profile was rising because the Federal Government had to spend its way out of recession.\n\nThe president disclosed that efforts were being made by his administration to partly support the realisation of fiscal projections by reviewing the current tax and fiscal laws to produce a draft Finance Bill 2022.\n\n\u201cIt is our intention that once ongoing consultations are completed, the Finance Bill would be submitted to the National Assembly to be considered alongside the 2022 Appropriation Bill,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari, who tagged the Appropriations Bill 2022 \u201cBudget of economic growth and sustainability,\u201d said allocations to MDAs were guided by the strategic objectives of the National Development Plan of 2021-2025.\n\nHe said the plan included diversifying the economy with robust MSME growth, investing in critical infrastructure, strengthening security and ensuring good governance, enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace, reducing poverty and minimising regional, economic and social disparities.\n\nHe said defence and internal security would continue to be top priority for his administration.\n\n\u201cWe remain firmly committed to the security of life, property and investment nationwide. We will continue to ensure that our gallant men and women in the armed forces, police and paramilitary units are properly equipped, remunerated and well-motivated,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nHe explained that the parameters and fiscal assumptions of the 2022 Appropriations Bill were based on the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper.\n\nHe said oil price benchmark was pegged at $57 per barrel, oil production estimate at 1.88 million barrels (inclusive of Condensates of 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day), exchange rate at N410.15 per US Dollar and projected GDP growth rate at 4.2 per cent and 13 per cent inflation rate.\n\nBased on these fiscal assumptions and parameters, total federally-collectible revenue was estimated at N17.70 trillion in 2022, he said.\n\nThe president said while total federally distributable revenue was estimated at N12.72 trillion, total revenue available to fund the 2022 federal budget was estimated at N10.13 trillion, an amount which includes grants and aid of N63.38 billion, as well as the revenues of 63 government-owned enterprises.\n\nHe said oil revenue was projected at 3.16 trillion, non-oil taxes estimated at N2.13 trillion and federal government independent revenues projected at N1.82 trillion.\n\nHe said out of the total expenditure of N16.39 trillion proposed for the Federal Government in 2022, N768.28 is for statutory transfers of N768.28 billion; N6.83 trillion is for non-debt recurrent costs and N4.11 trillion for personnel costs.\n\nOthers are N577.0 billion for pensions, gratuities and retirees\u2019 benefits; N792.39 for overheads; N5.35 trillion for capital expenditure, including capital component of statutory transfers; N3.61 trillion for debt service, and N292.71 billion for sinking fund to retire certain maturing bonds.\n\nHe, however, emphasised that the expected total fiscal operations of the Federal Government would result in a deficit of N6.26 trillion, an amount representing 3.39 per cent of estimated GDP, which, according to him, was slightly above the three per cent threshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, we have witnessed two economic recessions within the period of this administration. In both cases, we had to spend our way out of recession, which necessitated a resort to growing the public debt. It is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have grown as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded by debt.\u201d\n\nBuhari said Nigeria does not have a debt sustainability problem, but that of generating revenue.\n\nSince Buhari assumed power in 2015, Nigeria\u2019s economy has slipped into recession twice.\n\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) said Nigeria\u2019s total public debt (federal and state governments) climbed to N35.46 trillion at the end of the second quarter of 2021.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has urged the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) to reduce revenue accruable to the Federal Government from the federation account to 40 percent and increase those of states and local government councils to 40 and 20 percent respectively.\n\nHe spoke through his deputy, Mrs. Ipalibo Banigo, at the public hearing on review of revenue allocation formula for South-South zone, organised by RMAFC, held in Port Harcourt, yesterday.\n\nWike said the current revenue sharing formula that allows the Federal Government to take 52.68 percent, while states and local government councils take 26.72 percent and 20.60 percent respectively was unacceptable.\n\nThe governor had earlier made the assertion when members of the commission led by its chairman, Elisa N. Mbam, visited him at the Government House.\n\nHe observed that despite the changes that the country had been through in the past 29 years, it was regrettable that it has continued to use the 1992 revenue formular prescribed by the military.\n\nGovernor Wike faulted the use of 1992 population figure, public school enrolment and public hospital bed spaces and land mass as formular for allocation of revenue.\n\nHe argued that a more equitable formula should also take into cognisance current population figure as well as enrolment in private schools and number of bed spaces in private hospitals.\n\n\u201cUsing the same formular of 1992 as a basis for revenue allocation in this country is so unfortunate. And to worsen the situation under a democratic dispensation, since 1999 till now, our country has not reviewed the revenue allocation formula.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike urged the commission to reduce the revenue accruable to the federal government to 40 percent because the it has abdicated its responsibility of providing security and basic infrastructure to the federating states.\n\n\u201cYou people should reduce the percentage of the federal government. Give them 40 percent. Give the states 40 percent, give Local Government 20 percent. In that way, most of the responsibilities that belong to the federal government will now be taken away and given to the States.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the current centralised federal system in operation in Nigeria has made it impossible for most states to look inwards and harness their potentials.\n\nAccording to him, the country\u2019s vast resources, will continue to amount to nothing if the states are not allowed to use their resources to drive and determine their development.\n\n\u201cWe cannot talk about operating a federal system without having a fiscal federalism. It is practically impossible. Let\u2019s cancel that word federalism; we are operating a unitary system. But, you cannot be saying we are operating a federal system, at the same time operating a centralised system.\u201d\n\nThe governor expressed reservation about the willingness of the present federal government to implement the recommendations of the revenue mobilisation and fiscal commission, which is currently holding public hearing on new revenue sharing formular across the six geopolitical zones.\n\nEarlier, RMAFC chairman, Mbam, explained that one of the major mandates of the commission is to review from time to time the revenue allocation formula to conform with changing realities.\n\nMbam explained that it had become necessary to review the current formula because the last review was done in 1992.\n\nHe observed that there has been a lot of changes in the political and socio-economic situation of the country.\n\nAccording to him, the data that would be collated from the states will help the commission to arrive at a fair revenue formula.\n\n\u201cWe believe that what we will get from states will help us to come up with a revenue formula that will be fair, just and equitable.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

Femi Gbajabiamila, assured the president of quick consideration of the estimates by the National Assembly.\n\nSimilarly, the ruling party All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday said the proposed 2022 budget was designed to accelerate government\u2019s on-going efforts to diversify the economy.\n\nBut the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) described the proposed budget as another budget of sorrow and pain to Nigerians.\n\nCoalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) slammed the budget presented by the president, saying though his last full year budget, it does not have items that can at least see him leave office with some element of pride.\n\nThe 2022 Appropriation Bill was tagged \u201cBudget of Economic Growth and Sustainability.\u201d\n\nBuhari recalled that in March 2020, the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) had announced that market forces would henceforth determine the price of petrol.\n\nHe stated, \u201cHowever, as the combination of rising crude oil prices and exchange rate combined to push the price above the hitherto regulated price of N145 per litre, opposition against the policy of price deregulation hardened on the part of labour unions in particular.\n\n\u201cGovernment had to suspend further upward price adjustments while engaging labour on the subject. This petrol subsidy significantly eroded revenues that should have been available to fund the budget.\u201d\n\nBuhari said allocations to Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in the budget were guided by the strategic objectives of the National Development Plan of 2021-2025. He said the plan prioritised diversification of the economy with robust Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) growth; investing in critical infrastructure; strengthening security and ensuring good governance; enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace; reducing poverty; and minimising regional, economic and social disparities.\n\nThe president stressed that the security sector would still take a chunk of the 2022 budget, saying, \u201cDefence and internal security will continue to be our top priority.\n\n\u201cWe remain firmly committed to the security of life, property and investment nationwide. We will continue to ensure that our gallant men and women in the armed forces, police and paramilitary units are properly equipped, remunerated and well-motivated.\u201d\n\nThe president commended the National Assembly for the expeditious consideration and passage of the supplementary appropriation bill 2021. He said that underscored the federal legislature\u2019s commitment to collective efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and address the various security challenges facing the country.\n\nHe also commended the National Assembly for the quick consideration and approval of the 2022-2024 Medium-term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper.\n\nThe president said, \u201cOur hope is that the National Assembly will continue to partner with the executive by ensuring that deliberations on the 2022 Budget are completed before the end of this year so that the Appropriation Act can come into effect by the first of January 2022.\u201d\n\nBuhari said over the past few days, consultation was made with the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 and the leadership of the National Assembly on how best to present the 2022 budget proposal, keeping in mind the deep-rooted tradition in place and the guidelines for safe mass gatherings.\n\nHe said it was decided that the most responsible and respectful approach was to hold a shorter than gathering while allowing the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to provide fuller details of the proposals at a smaller event.\n\nAccording to him, the 2022 to 2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF/FSP) set the parameters for the 2022 Budget.\n\nHe noted that oil price benchmark was pegged at $57 per barrel; with daily oil production estimate of 1.88 million barrels (inclusive of Condensates of 300,000 to 400,000 barrels\u201d per day projected.\n\nBuhari said the exchange rate was pegged at N410.15 per dollar; and projected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 4.2 per cent and 13 per cent inflation rate. He added that based on these fiscal assumptions and parameters, total federally collectible revenue was estimated at N17.70 trillion in 2022.\n\nThe president pointed out that total federally distributable revenue was estimated at N12.72 trillion in 2022, while total revenue available to fund the 2022 budget was estimated at N10.13 trillion. This includes grants and aid of N63.38 billion, as well as the revenues of 63 government-owned enterprises.\n\nBuhari noted that oil revenue was projected at N3.16 trillion; non-oil taxes estimated at N2.13 trillion and FGN independent revenues were projected to be N1.82 trillion.\n\nThe president explained that a total expenditure of N16.39 trillion was proposed for the federal government for 2022.\n\nHe said the proposed expenditure comprised: Statutory Transfers of N768.28 billion, Non-debt Recurrent Costs of N6.83 trillion; Personnel Costs of N4.11 trillion; Pensions, Gratuities and Retirees\u2019 Benefits N577.0 billion; Overheads of N792.39 billion; Capital Expenditure of N5.35 trillion, including the capital component of Statutory Transfers; Debt Service of N3.61 trillion and Sinking Fund of N292.71 billion to retire certain maturing bonds.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cWe expect the total fiscal operations of the federal government to result in a deficit of N6.26 trillion. This represents 3.39 per cent of estimated GDP, slightly above the three per cent threshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007. Countries around the world have to of necessity over-shoot their fiscal thresholds for the economies to survive and thrive\n\n\u201cWe need to exceed this threshold considering our collective desire to continue tackling the existential security challenges facing our country.\u201d\n\nBuhari said the federal government planned to finance the deficit mainly by new borrowings totalling N5.01 trillion, N90.73 billion from privatisation proceeds and N1.16 trillion drawdowns on loans secured for specific development projects.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cSome have expressed concern over our resort to borrowing to finance our fiscal gaps. They are right to be concerned. However, we believe that the debt level of the federal government is still within sustainable limits. Borrowings are to specific strategic projects and can be verified publicly.\u201d\n\nBuhari explained that the country had witnessed two economic recessions within the period of his administration, stressing that in both cases, the country had to spend its way out of recession, which necessitated a resort to growing the public debt.\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have grown as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded by debt,\u201d he said.\n\nOn parameters and fiscal assumptions, the president said the target over the medium term was to grow the country\u2019s revenue-to-GDP ratio from about eight per cent currently to 15 per cent by 2025. He said at that level of revenue, the debt service-to-revenue ratio would cease to be worrying.\n\n\u201cPut simply, we do not have a debt sustainability problem, but a revenue challenge which we are determined to tackle to ensure our debts remain sustainable,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nThe president noted that his government had used loans to finance critical development projects and programmes aimed at improving the economic environment and ensuring effective delivery of public services to the people.\n\nHe said his government focused on: the completion of major road and rail projects; the effective implementation of power sector projects; the provision of potable water; construction of irrigation infrastructure and dams across the country; and critical health projects such as the strengthening of national emergency medical services and ambulance system, procurement of vaccines, polio eradication and upgrading Primary Health Care Centres across the six geopolitical zones.\n\nBuhari said his government in 2022 would further strengthen the frameworks for concessions and public private partnerships (PPPs), adding that capital projects that are good for PPP by their nature would be developed for private sector participation.\n\nOn the performance of the 2021 budget, Buhari said in the 2021 Fiscal Framework, a total revenue of N8.12 trillion was projected to fund aggregate federal expenditure of N14.57 trillion (inclusive of the supplementary budget), while actual revenues were 34 per cent below target as of July 2021, mainly due to the underperformance of oil and gas revenue sources.\n\nBuhari pointed out that the federal government\u2019s retained revenues (excluding Government Owned Enterprises) amounted to N2.61 trillion against the proportional target of N3.95 trillion for the period.\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, Lawan said the 2020 and 2021 budget provided for significant infrastructure development across the country. He added that it was imperative that the government prioritises the completion of on-going projects on the development of infrastructure, adding that the 2022 budget should be targeted at completion and consolidation of the projects embarked upon.\n\nLawan lamented that generating and collecting revenues had remained major challenges in the country\u2019s quest for development. He said for the deficit in the country\u2019s budget to be drastically reduced, concerted effort must be made by the executive and legislature to explore alternative sources of funding to reduce borrowing.\n\nThe senate president explained that such sources of funding could come by way of Public-Private Partnerships on infrastructure projects, as well as compulsory remittances of generated revenues by MDAs.\n\nLawan stressed that equally important was the recent position taken by the legislature and the executive to insist on zero allocation for MDAs that failed to remit/upload their revenues for the 2022 Appropriation.\n\nHe said he saw an increase in the contribution of the MDAs by over N400 billion, saying he believed that MDAs could contribute to the federation account much more than that.\n\nLawan added, \u201cMr President, the need to enhance revenue generation and collection cannot be overemphasised. The level of budget deficit is high, and both the legislature and the executive should work to reduce this deficit through the availability of more revenues.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the security of life and property of Nigerians was still a challenge. She assured that the National Assembly was ever willing to work with the executive arm for better security for the citizens.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe recent changes in the leadership of the armed forces is a clear testimony of the collaboration between the legislature and the executive to overhaul the security architecture for better outcomes in our fight against the myriads of security challenges.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila assured that the National Assembly would give the 2022 Appropriation Bill prompt consideration. He warned heads of ministries, departments and agencies that the determination of the National Assembly to deliver a timely budget would not derogate from its responsibility to ensure exhaustive consideration of the bill.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe will demand a thorough accounting for the funds previously appropriated, disbursed and expended. And we will take steps to hold to account those who fail to provide the records we need to make informed decisions on the Appropriation Bill. This is the responsibility of the National Assembly, and we will live up to it.\u201d\n\nAPC: 2022 Budget Proposal Will Accelerate Economic Diversification\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday said the proposed 2022 budget was designed to accelerate government\u2019s on-going efforts to diversify the economy.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, in a statement, expressed confidence that the ninth National Assembly would sustain the patriotic disposition by speedily considering and passing the 2022 Appropriation Bill into law to meet the January-December budget cycle achieved by the Buhari-led administration.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe proposed budget is designed to accelerate government\u2019s on-going efforts to diversify the economy through more support for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); continued investment in vital infrastructure; strengthening security; enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace; reducing poverty through targeted social investments and ultimately ensuring good governance.\u201d\n\nThe ruling party called on Nigerians to keep track of the progress being made by this administration in delivering services and countless dividends of democracy all over the country.\n\nPDP: Another Budget of Pain, Suffering for Nigerians\n\nIn its assessment of the 2022 Appropriation Bill, PDP described its contents as another budget of sorrow and pain to Nigerians.\n\nIn a brief reaction on the budget presentation, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the budget would cause more pains to Nigerians because it would be financed from loans, thereby inflicting the people with more loans.\n\nThe PDP urged the National Assembly to refocus the budget by making it a people-oriented fiscal plan.\n\nCUPP Says Proposed Budget Empty\n\nCUPP criticised the content of the budget presented by the president. In a statement, the spokesperson of CUPP, Ikenga Ugochinyere, said the only highlight of the budget was that the government has allegedly admitted that it was overwhelmed by its failures and has no solution at hand.\n\nAccording to the CUPP spokesman, \u201cThe only thing the budget is clothed with is new loans and borrowings and nothing more. It does not inspire any hope in Nigerians rather it sinks the country further into economic woes.\n\n\u201cRecurrent expenditure and capital expenses, like purchase of cars, computers and accessories, and other unnecessary and white elephant projects, are all the budget contains because the ruling party will use the budget to fund their 2023 election campaigns.\n\n\u201cAt N16.39 trillion, the budget contains debt service of N3.61 trillion, non-debt recurrent costs of N6.83 trillion while there is only capital expenditure of N5.35 trillion. New borrowing in the budget is totalling N5.01 trillion with an extra N1.16 trillion drawdowns on loans secured for specific projects. This is the highlight of the uninspiring speech of the president as it cannot add any productive value to the economy.\u201d\n\nCUPP said a close look at the budget speech would show Nigerians that Buhari had been perpetually funding the same set of projects without ever completing them. \u201cAfter borrowing over N33 trillion, Buhari is still declaring to Nigerians that he is borrowing to fund Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Abuja-Kano Expressway, East-West Road, 2nd Niger Bridge etc. Nigerians should, please, ask President Buhari when will these projects which have been in the budgets since 2016 ever be completed?\n\n\u201cNigerians are hereby called upon to bear yet again another year of suffering but have hope that when the opposition takes over, Nigeria will get back on its feet.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Signalling a southern presidency\n\n*Defers attempt to present Bala report\n\n*Let the people decide, says Atiku\n\n*Northern members disagree over micro-zoning\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe 94th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, rose in support of the governors of the party, and unanimously adopted the report of the National Convention Zoning Committee (NCZC), chaired by the Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, which last week, zoned the national chairmanship of the party to the north.\n\nBy implications and standard practice in the PDP, the development might have further brightened the possibility of a southern presidential candidate, being the fallout of other zoning options that could be open to the party as it journeys to the 2023 elections.\n\nThe meeting also pulled a smart one, when it declined to consider a report by the Governor Bala Mohammed committee, which recommended throwing the presidential ticket open, but deferred the decision to yet another NEC meeting at a later date.\n\nThese, nonetheless, former Vice President and presidential candidate of the PDP in the 2019 general election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has lent support to the idea of open presidential ticket, insisting that the people should be allowed to decide who their presidential choice would be.\n\nThis is as the meeting of the Northern PDP stakeholders and their elected governors, last night, failed to reach an agreement on the micro-zoning of the office of the national chairman, because everyone wanted to take their chances at the opportunity.\n\nIn a related development, the suspended national chairman of PDP, Uche Secondus, said he was in court to stop an alleged blackmail, planned hijack, and plot to destroy PDP. His case is currently at the Court of Appeal.\n\nBriefing newsmen after the NEC meeting, National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the report of the Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi committee was unanimously adopted.\n\nOlogbondiyan maintained that the zoning committee was given the mandate to zone national offices to be contested by all PDP members at the party\u2019s National Convention scheduled for October 30 and 31.\n\nThough the decision was unanimous, it was gathered that Senator Abdul Ningi from Bauchi State and Shuiabu Oyedokun from Osun State spoke briefly against the zoning of the party\u2019s leadership offices.\n\nBut Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde was said to have quickly countered Oyedokun, stating that anyone from the South-west, who spoke against the zoning arrangement was speaking for himself.\n\nAnother NEC member told THISDAY that most of the party\u2019s stakeholders from the North could not present any strong opposition to the zoning, because some of them had started seeing themselves as national chairmanship candidates.\n\nThe NEC meeting mandated the stakeholders to meet at the zonal level and share the offices allocated to them and thereafter inform the party of the decisions reached.\n\nBut on the zoning of the presidential ticket, Ologbondiyan said the report was referred to another NEC meeting, where it would be decided.\n\nAnother source at the meeting said although the northern PDP members wanted to initiate a discussion around the Bala Mohammed committee report, knowing full well it would lead to discussing the presidential ticket, the meeting immediately shut it down and insisted it should be moved to the next NEC.\n\nThe NEC meeting had a large attendance.\n\nMeanwhile, Secondus, in a statement by his media aide, Ike Abonye, claimed his legal effort was to stop the hijack of the party. He alleged that he had been the subject of blackmail since the onset of the plan to hijack the soul of PDP by one of the governors.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cFirst was the baseless lies that Prince Secondus as National Chairman was not meeting up with his obligations at his ward level in Rivers State. It was based on such ridiculous lies that they approached the court to get the purported interim order. After the interim order based on such frivolous story, the said governor and his errand boys went ahead to get the court ruling against Prince Secondus.\n\n\u201cFor being so treated and victimised without any justification whatsoever after almost four years of selfless service to the party, Prince Secondus is left with no option but to fight for his fundamental rights by approaching the court to seek redress and correct the blackmail and concoctions.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the frivolous nature of the allegations, Secondus on his own as a strong believer in the rule of law decided to respect the court by staying away while seeking the necessary right that should correct the judicial ambush against him and the party.\n\n\u201cWhile awaiting the outcome of the case presently at the Court of Appeal, the blackmail has continued unabated with fabrications and all kinds of laughable lies to the fact that Prince Secondus is romancing with the opposition.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Secondus had maintained a clean record in the party from his days as State Chairman, National Organising Secretary, Deputy National Chairman, to National Chairman in December 2017.\n\nSpeaking earlier at the 94th NEC meeting, Atiku said fairness should decide the party\u2019s presidential candidate. He stated, \u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party has the right to determine its rules on how the party should be governed. The people of Nigeria also have the right to determine who governs them. Where the president comes from has never been the problem of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe spoke on how PDP had managed the question of zoning, saying, \u201cI can cite examples, neither will it be the solution. There is no such thing: he is a president from southern Nigeria, or a president from northern Nigeria. There is only one, a president from Nigeria, for Nigeria and by Nigerians.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Atiku said, \u201cTalking about inclusions, I would like to see a new National Working Committee of our great party that has sizable numbers of our youths and woman. The decision of NEC today will either see PDP into the villa in 2023 or not. Since inception, this party has faced serious challenges, and has risen above sentiments to solve those challenges and move forward.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president narrated, \u201cNow, let me come to historical events, which I said I was going to cite. Those of us who served in the constitutional conference, which drafted the current constitution of Nigeria, should remember that after we finished drafting the constitution, we all met as members of the constitutional conference and resolved to correct the injustice that was done to a particular part of this country.\n\n\u201cAnd we said, in whichever party you found yourself, your presidential candidate must come from the South-west, because Abiola had won election, it was annulled. Not only was he annulled he was killed.\n\n\u201cSo, we all agreed as members, and we went out of the constitutional conference and we formed our parties: those of us who formed PDP from PDP; those who formed AD from AD\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, two parties emerged. PDP picked General Obasanjo and AD picked Olu Falae. All of these showed you that Nigerians have a sense of fairness. Professor Jerry Gana, is that not what happened? More or less?\n\n\u201cDistinguished members of NEC, in 2003, all the PDP governors met at the villa and said they were not going to support President Obasanjo for a second term, that I should run. I now referred them to the resolution of NEC, where NEC decided that power should remain in the South-west for eight years. How do you now want me to go against the resolution of NEC? And I turned it down. And we moved on.\n\n\u201cSo, this country has a sense of fairness. This country has a sense of justice. This country has a sense of equity. Therefore, this thing that is inbuilt in our party, we should be able to use it, to imbibe it to make sure today\u2019s deliberations are in the best interest of our party, in the best interest of Nigeria, which will ultimately give us the victory that we asked for, to go back to the villa.\u201d\n\nMinority Leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, said the recent political reports and speculations on the PDP had generated widespread public debate regarding the direction of the party ahead of the national convention and the 2023 general election. He explained that such public interest in activities of the PDP strongly pointed to the huge confidence Nigerians reposed in the party.\n\nElumelu lamented the current security and economic challenges faced by the country under the All Progressives Party (APC).\n\nInterestingly, a meeting of the Northern PDP stakeholders, held last night, has thrown up another challenge over its national chairmanship, with many of their major players already showing interest in the office.\n\nThe meeting held at the Bauchi State governor\u2019s lodge, Abuja, saw the northern stakeholders reject the proposals by the governors of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed; Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom and the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, that the North Central zone should swap offices with those in the South-south zone.\n\nAfter the stakeholders had rejected the swapping of the offices between the North Central and South-south, the meeting decided that what position to micro-zone to which state should be among the 19 northern states.\n\n\u201cThere was a disagreement. They tried to zone it to the North Central, which was rejected by the committee. So, what they did was that the 19 states and the FCT nominated one person each into a committee.\n\n\u201cThe committee is to sit down with the governors to review individuals, who would show interest in positions zoned to the north so as to decide, who among them is the most suitable for the positions, so as to back the person,\u201d a source, who attended the meeting said.\n\nAs a result, the meeting gave all persons from the north till this morning (Friday) to decide and indicate to the group what post he or she sought to vie for.\n\nAlready, four persons have indicated interest in the job. While two were from the North East, the other two were from the North West.\n\nFrom North West were a former Governor of Kaduna State, who also served as PDP Caretaker National Chairman, Senator Ahmed Makarfi, and the former Governor of Katsina State, Ibrahim Shema, who was deputy national chairman of party.\n\nHowever, from the North East were the incumbent PDP Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Suleiman Nazif and former Governor of Gombe State, Dr. Ibrahim Dankwambo. There is also talk of a a former President of the Senate, David Mark indicating interest in the top job of the party. But this is unconfirmed. Mark hails from North Central.\n\nIn another breath, a statement by the Chairman, Electoral Sub-Committee and Governor of Adamawa State, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, has scheduled a meeting of all sub-committee members for this weekend.\n\n\u201cIn preparation for the 2021 National Convention of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), all members of the Electoral Sub-Committee are invited to a meeting scheduled to hold as follows: Saturday the 9th of October, 2021. The venue is NEC Hall of the PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza and the time is 11.AM prompt.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

While some federal lawmakers, especially the House of Representatives Minority Caucus, described the budget estimates as drab and uninspiring, others, including senators and House of Representatives members, said the appropriation bill signified hope for the teeming populace.\n\nThe House Minority caucus, in a speech by its leader, Hon Ndudi Elumelu, at the 94th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of PDP in Abuja, said the budget had no solution to the challenges facing the nation.\n\nElumelu said the president \u201cridiculously\u201d asked for debt forgiveness, on the one hand, and on the other, he was busy seeking more loans, thereby making a mockery of the country as an, \u201cunserious country led by a clueless government.\u201d\n\nHe assured that the caucus would do all in its powers to lobby for the redirection of the budget for the benefit of Nigerians.\n\nElumelu said, \u201cAs representatives of the people, our caucus took the president to task on his speech, in which he failed to present the ugly reality of the failures of his administration to the world body.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, innocent and defenseless Nigerians are being killed on daily basis by terrorists and bandits. Our citizens can no longer move freely across their country. Today, our economy is in shambles; there is anger, frustration and hopelessness everywhere.\n\n\u201cMost Nigerian families can no longer afford their daily meals and other basic necessities of life; they go to bed on empty stomach and wake up with no hope of breakfast or even lunch. Our productive sectors have been wrecked by the APC. Their only hope of survival is to have the PDP back in power.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, Hon. Babatunde Ayeni said the main expectation was on security, saying the country is going nowhere without adequate funding of the security sector.\n\nAyeni stated, \u201cOn the budget of N16.39 trillion, our expectation is especially on security. This time around, everybody in Nigeria is talking of security and if you do not fund that aspect of the budget well, we are not going anywhere.\n\n\u201cThe police need more funds that even last year. I am the Deputy Chairman of Police Affairs (committee. If you say police must perform, automatically they must be funded.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, Senator Ayo Akinyelure said he believed that the budget was aimed at fixing the country, saying the lawmakers have done their best to meet the January \u2013 December budget cycle.\n\nSenator Olamilekan Adeola described the fiscal plan as a budget of hope.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe hope it will take us out of misery, given critical attention to education and security. He (Buhari) has given assurance that the deficit will be financed by borrowing. He has said we have nothing to fear, the borrowed tied to specific verifiable projects. We are convinced it will take care of our needs.\u201d\n\nAdeola said he was not bothered about the debt profile, because the president had given an outline of how to finance the loans, adding that with time the direction of the budget will take would be unveiled.\n\nOn his part, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele said the budget estimate as laid yesterday showed consciousness on the part of the leadership that it was not yet Uhuru.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe must spend our ways out of recession. Recurrent is taking more money, and giving the government a human face. But capital spending will help to develop our infrastructure.\n\n\u201cBy and large, what is important is implementation by ensuring that MDAs are able to implement diligently and we don\u2019t fail in our oversight to monitor the spending and for Nigerians at large, to monitor in their various constituencies.\n\n\u201cWe must all ensure that every naira borrowed is spent on capital projects that will percolate to the ordinary Nigerians and take us out of recession.\u201d\n\nAdding his voice, Senator Uba Sani said infrastructure development and education were key to the country\u2019s growth and development.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly needs to increase the level of oversight to ensure that key revenue generating agencies add value to the federation account\n\nSenator Ishaku Abbo said, \u201cThe 2022 budget is to stimulate economic recovery. By the passage of the PIB, we are confidence that Nigeria will now have more money.\n\n\u201cI believe the budget should be more. I know you will ask about the issue of borrowing. Nigeria is not the only country that borrows money.\u201d\n\nAbbo said he had no problem with borrowing to fund the budget in as much as money borrowed would not be used for payment of salaries, but for infrastructure development.\n\nIn his contribution, Senator Abdullahi Adamu said since the budget was the last budget the present administration would implement fully, the government would ensure that projects started were completed.\n\nAdamu said, \u201cEvery country is borrowing. England is owing over \u20ac3 trillion. So, we must borrow about N6 trillion to fund the budget. Every country is borrowing.\u201d\n\nOn her part, House Deputy Chief Whip, Hon. Nkiruka Onyejeocha, expressed excitement that the 2020 budget had gender issues incorporated in it.\n\nAccording to Onyejeocha, \u201cThe president said this is the first time that gender issues are being included in the budget. I\u2019m excited because what it simply means is that this president has decided to work the talk. We are going to look at the details and key in from there.\u201d\n\nOnyejeocha said the budget gave her hope that the president had been listening to women, saying all Nigerian women are excited about this budget.\n\nShe added, \u201cThis is about the second time that the budget is being released 100 per cent. I don\u2019t know if you know what that means. What it simply means is that we are not going to have abandoned projects because when you release 40 per cent, it means the work will be done 40 per cent, but when you release 100 per cent, it means a lot of projects will be concluded.\u201d\n\nOnyejeocha also highlighted the president\u2019s political will to fund the projects.\n\nShe added, \u201cPeople are saying it is loan, everybody takes loan. The most important thing is that when you take the loan, then you use it judiciously and as parliament, we are going to make sure that we track our money.\u201d\n\nHon. Ben Igbakpa said there was need for the lawmakers to assist the president through their oversight function in ensuring that the MDAs were monitored to ensure that there was no revenue leakage.\n\nIgbakpa said, \u201cA budget is a statement of intention, so we hope to get 100 per cent. We are going to ensure in our oversight function that every MDA does what they are ought to do and stay on the executive to ensure, especially those revenue generating agencies to ensure that they bring the funding because if there is no money, there is nothing anybody can do. We must ensure that the revenue comes in to ensure the implementation of the budget as envisaged by Nigerians. We are looking at 100 per cent.\u201d\n\nAdding his voice to the debate, Hon. Babajimi Benson stressed that no country could develop without infrastructure.\n\nBenson said, \u201cThey say that a nation that has infrastructure is a rich nation. Nigeria should do whatever it can to ensure that borrowed funds are used to fund infrastructure. I\u2019m happy today that Mr. President also said that the 2021 budget will be funded 100 per cent and that before the end of his administration all on-going infrastructure will be completed, that is good news for Nigerians. It is good news if we complete all the road projects, it is good news when we complete all the rail projects.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it is for the betterment of our citizenry. We should all pray that Mr. President completes these projects as said. So once that is done it will be a new dawn of prosperity for us in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "James Emejo in Abuja\n\nAnalysts yesterday commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the timely transmission of the 2022 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly.\n\nThey also expressed satisfaction over the benchmarks in the appropriation, describing them as realistic.\n\nIn separate interview with THISDAY, the analysts, however expressed hope that the legislature would reciprocate the president\u2019s gesture by concluding work on the budget before the end of the year to enable implementation to commence in January following the president\u2019s assent.\n\nBuhari, yesterday presented the N16.3 trillion 2022 Appropriation Bill to the Joint Session of the National Assembly.\n\nReacting to the development in a chat with THISDAY, Chairman, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Abuja Branch, Prof. Uche Uwaleke, said the mending of the hitherto broken budget cycle remained a major achievement by the current administration.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think the budget benchmarks are largely realistic with respect to crude oil price of $57, exchange rate of circa N410 and real GDP growth rate of 4.2 per cent.\n\n\u201cFirst, let me commend the President for presenting the 2022 appropriation bill in relatively good time.\n\nHe also called on the National Assembly to expedite action on the bill.\n\nHe said, \u201cIndeed, the mending of the hitherto broken budget year is a major achievement by this administration.\u201d\n\nUwaleke, however, pointed out that inflation projection of 13 per cent appeared unrealistic considering the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) requiring the complete removal of fuel subsidy.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs the president admitted, the concern about increasing deficit financing through borrowing is justified. \u201cThe consolation however is that all new borrowings are tied to critical projects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s equally noteworthy that the government has made provision for use of Green bonds as well as PPP arrangements in financing infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting to the budget proposal, Managing Director/Chief Executive, Dignity Finance and Investment Limited, Dr. Chijioke Ekechukwu, said with enough fiscal discipline, the anticipated gains from the oil price differential could fund part of the budget deficit, thereby reducing the amount of money to be borrowed.\n\nHe said, \u201cFirst, I commend the president for sending the budget on time to the National Assembly so that the fiscal calendar could still be maintained.\n\n\u201cI am satisfied with the benchmarks of oil price of $57 per barrel and the output level of 1.88million barrel per day, exchange rate at $410.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we will continue to operate at the whims and caprices of oil price volatility.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Managing Director/Chief Executive, SD&D Capital Management Limited, Mr. Idakolo Gbolade, pointed out that the, \u201cN16.3 trillion is going to throw Nigeria into more debt trap as a substantial part of it will be financed by additional borrowing.\u201d\n\nHe noted that this comes at a time when almost 100 per cent of the country\u2019s revenue was being used for debt servicing, adding that the price of crude oil though high at the moment, could still be affected, leading to lower returns from oil revenue.\n\nHe said,\u201dThe present agitations by some states for VAT revenue to be collected by states presently in the supreme court could lead to further dip in federal government revenue if the states win the case.\n\n\u201cThe government is also spending more on recurrent expenditure in 2022 and most of the capital expenditure might not yield returns in the 2022 fiscal year.\n\n\u201cI foresee a challenging year for the government\u2019s fiscal policies in 2022 and the government mostly likely might not implement more than 50 per cent of the budget due to various constraints ahead.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FG: Energy Transition Must Take Cognisance of Nations\u2019 Peculiarities",
          "text": "*Seplat unveils new brand identity, incorporates renewables into operations\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday insisted that it would be unfair for richer nations to stampede developing countries like Nigeria into abandoning their resources for the current energy transition, urging its advocates to consider the peculiar circumstances of every nation.\n\nSpeaking at the Seplat Energy Summit 2021 with the theme \u201cGlobal Trends in Energy Transition and the Africa Perspective,\u201d the Minister of State, Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, maintained that the continuous exploitation of the country\u2019s oil resources would be crucial in supplying world markets with a broad portfolio of energy options.\n\nDuring the hybrid event, Sylva noted that Nigeria requires fossil fuel as its base-load energy source.\n\nHe explained that while this was a major concern for climate activists in developed nations, the clamour to emphasise only renewable energy as the sole pathway to energy transition was a source of concern for African countries.\n\nSylva explained that Nigeria was still working to achieve industrialisation, address energy poverty and ensure reliable power supply, emphasising that the call to jettison fossil fuels all together may not be feasible for now.\n\n\u201cThis is why in Nigeria, we reject the concept of a single pathway to the energy transition. Indeed, we prefer the concept of \u2018just\u2019 energy transition which takes into cognisance the specific circumstances of each nation in developing the energy transition pathway that best achieves the environmental, social, political and economic objectives of the transition in that specific nation.\n\n\u201cMultiple pathways to the energy transition should and must exist in order to ensure that no country is left behind in the process of achieving net-zero by 2050.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, the position above recognises the possibility of a structural decline in the price of oil and consequential fiscal vulnerabilities that may arise, as well as the increased risk exposure therefrom, and is responding to it in several ways,\u201d the minister explained.\n\nThe former Bayelsa governor pointed out that Nigeria would continue to focus on gas, which he said is at the heart of the energy transition and represents the first step in the journey to renewables away from oil.\n\nSylva averred that gas was not just a transition fuel for Nigeria, but also represents a destination fuel, as the country envisages that it will be part of its energy mix by 2050, given the vast resources that can be commercialised and utilised.\n\nFurthermore, he stressed that generous incentives have been proposed in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 to enable development, distribution, penetration and utilisation of gas.\n\n\u201cOur proven gas reserves are sufficient to cover current demand levels and support plans for the construction of nine new gas-fired power plants with a combined name-plate capacity of nearly 6,000 MW by 2037,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile congratulating the leadership and staff of Seplat on the formal unveiling of the new brand identity, he noted that it bears testament to the company\u2019s movement with the times, evidenced by its full transition to an energy company.\n\nHe stated that the PIA would assist in harnessing Nigeria\u2019s potential to achieve its plan of increasing oil production to four million bpd and oil reserves from 37 billion barrels to 40 barrels while also drawing on the country\u2019s estimated 600TCF of natural gas reserves to provide clean and efficient energy.\n\nSylva noted that the provisions relating to voluntary conversion, production allowances, lower royalties and taxes, cost optimisation focus in the PIA have been enshrined to address the envisaged fiscal vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, who was represented at the event by the Minister of State, Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, said over the next decade, every aspect of national energy system was expected to be affected by changes in climate and energy policy, financing, continuous technological advancement, and shifts in energy supply and demand.\n\nHe argued that energy transition could no longer be limited to incremental steps, but must become a transformational effort based on rapid upscaling and implementation of all available technologies to innovate for the future.\n\nOsinbajo said Nigeria has now developed its energy transition plan, through the Cop 26 plan which has the three core objectives of achieving universal access to energy by 2030, net zero emissions by 2050 and industrialisation to alleviate poverty and drive economic growth.\n\nHe added that the transformation of the energy sector offers ample opportunities for sustained economic development, social inclusion, energy security, improved health, job creation, and other societal benefits if achieved in a just and inclusive manner.\n\n\u201cHowever, this would require careful management and broad engagement in order to balance delicate and diverse interests. This brings to the fore the vulnerability of workers, communities, government sectors, and enterprises.\n\n\u201cIt also underscores the necessity for comprehensive and coherent policies and measures to address the multifaceted challenges involved and to pursue environmentally sustainable growth, while at the same time ensuring a just transition for those affected,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, in his comments, argued that the mistake being made all over the world was that people see net zero as zero fossil fuel in the future.\n\nHe noted that there must be fair and practical steps to close the energy gap in Africa, explaining that there must also be a transition fuel in form of gas to close the huge energy poverty in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, even in the next 50 years, oil and gas would still be relevant, noting that what should be done was to make them much more climate friendly with efficient mechanisms in place, assuring that the NNPC would continue to lead the conversation in that direction.\n\nIn an executive dialogue session anchored by the Chairman, THISDAY Newspapers and Founder Arise News Channel, Prince Nduka Obaigbena and the Chief Executive Officer of Seplat, Mr. Roger Brown, noted that the company would continue to evolve as it embraces renewables.\n\nHe said that Seplat has a strategy as summarised in its upstream oil and gas, in which it is continuing to cut costs, the midstream which is mainly gas processing business and the third which is its renewable energy side.\n\nBrown noted that the focus on renewables remains real, describing it as the energy of the future, but maintained that one fuel source was not the solution to the transition, but a combination of many sources.\n\nHe stated that solar power has bright prospects in the country, noting that Seplat was looking at both on-grid and off-grid sides of the business which has gone beyond paper work.\n\nAlso on the panel, a non-Executive Director of Seplat Energy, Mr. Bello Rabiu, noted that 80 per cent of emissions were being carried out by the industrialised nations, while the rest of the world does a paltry 20 per cent, saying that African countries cannot suffer for the irresponsibility of some developed nations.\n\nAccording to him, Africa has to continue to deploy its resources efficiently, arguing that net zero in 2050 does not mean oil and gas will no longer exist.\n\nRabiu said that monies from fossil fuels when spent on importation is not sustainable, explaining that Nigeria needs technology, investment and the cooperation of the international community.\n\nObaigbena who got intermittent applauses for his handling of the session, however argued that none of the factors mentioned was within Nigeria\u2019s control, which again raises the issue of over-reliance on foreign aid.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu returned quietly to Nigeria on Friday after spending months overseas for medical care.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported his planned return to a \u201cgrand welcome\u201d organised by his political associates\n\nTinubu in London\n\nHowever, due to his inability to stand the rigours of a physical rally, the ex-Lagos governor quietly entered into the country, shunning any fanfare.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that a grand welcome was being arranged at the Nigeria Police College in Ikeja, Lagos for the politician.\n\nHowever, top sources confirmed his \u2018early\u2019 return to SaharaReporters on Friday.\n\n\u201cTinubu has quietly returned tonight. He returned quietly but can\u2019t stand the rigours of a physical rally.\n\n\u201cHe arrived on a Falcon jet with registration number CP-CBT. The tracking for the jet is blocked on aviation tracking platforms,\u201d a source disclosed.\n\nIt was also learnt that among those at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos to meet Tinubu was the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nSaharaReporters further learnt that the APC chieftain did not get down from his aircraft after his arrival.\n\n\u201cHis passport was stamped from Quits Aviation but he departed from Evergreen hangar at the airport,\u201d a source said.\n\nMeanwhile, the APC in Lagos State had sent out a circular to its leaders across the state informing them that the Sunday welcome party being organised for Tinubu would not be held as earlier scheduled.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the APC sent the circular, signed by Alhaji Tunde Balogun (APC State Chairman), and Alhaji Maroun Are (GAC Secretary) to the party leaders believably at the ward and local government levels, without giving a specific reason for the change of plan.\n\nSaharaReporters, however, gathered that the cancellation was due to the exclusive report published by this medium, which forced them to abort it abruptly.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve cancelled the police college event meant to welcome Tinubu back to Nigeria. It was due to the expos\u00e9 of the media report by SaharaReporters,\u201d a top source revealed.\n\nIn the circular obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, the APC leaders were told that a new arrangement for welcoming Tinubu would be announced later.\n\n\u201cDear leader/GAC member, you are hereby informed of change in plans/arrival of our National Leader billed for Sunday. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the plans/arrival have been put on hold. A new plan/arrival will be unfolded soon. Sorry for any inconvenience this hold may have caused. Thank you,\u201d the notice said.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Tinubu confirmed that he went through a challenging health crisis, saying his \u201cphysiotherapy was gruesome.\u201d\n\nTinubu said this while addressing members of the House of Representatives northern caucus who visited him in London last Friday.\n\nThe former governor, who had been in the United Kingdom for the last three months since undergoing knee surgery, told the gathering, \u201cBecause of God and people like you, I am well. It is just the physio (physiotherapy) that is gruesome.\u201d\n\nSince his departure, Tinubu\u2019s London home has become a mecca of sorts as he has been visited by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Governors Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), and Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti).\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that Fayemi confirmed that Tinubu had surgery recently and he (Fayemi) was in London to show solidarity with him.\n\nThe governor had said, \u201cHe (Akeredolu) and I were in London together to see our leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, but it had absolutely nothing to do with 2023 presidential plans whatsoever.

          "text": "The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu returned quietly to Nigeria on Friday after spending months overseas for medical care.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported his planned return to a \u201cgrand welcome\u201d organised by his political associates\n\nTinubu in London\n\nHowever, due to his inability to stand the rigours of a physical rally, the ex-Lagos governor quietly entered into the country, shunning any fanfare.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that a grand welcome was being arranged at the Nigeria Police College in Ikeja, Lagos for the politician.\n\nHowever, top sources confirmed his \u2018early\u2019 return to SaharaReporters on Friday.\n\n\u201cTinubu has quietly returned tonight. He returned quietly but can\u2019t stand the rigours of a physical rally.\n\n\u201cHe arrived on a Falcon jet with registration number CP-CBT. The tracking for the jet is blocked on aviation tracking platforms,\u201d a source disclosed.\n\nIt was also learnt that among those at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos to meet Tinubu was the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\nSaharaReporters further learnt that the APC chieftain did not get down from his aircraft after his arrival.\n\n\u201cHis passport was stamped from Quits Aviation but he departed from Evergreen hangar at the airport,\u201d a source said.\n\nMeanwhile, the APC in Lagos State had sent out a circular to its leaders across the state informing them that the Sunday welcome party being organised for Tinubu would not be held as earlier scheduled.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the APC sent the circular, signed by Alhaji Tunde Balogun (APC State Chairman), and Alhaji Maroun Are (GAC Secretary) to the party leaders believably at the ward and local government levels, without giving a specific reason for the change of plan.\n\nSaharaReporters, however, gathered that the cancellation was due to the exclusive report published by this medium, which forced them to abort it abruptly.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve cancelled the police college event meant to welcome Tinubu back to Nigeria. It was due to the expos\u00e9 of the media report by SaharaReporters,\u201d a top source revealed.\n\nIn the circular obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, the APC leaders were told that a new arrangement for welcoming Tinubu would be announced later.\n\n\u201cDear leader/GAC member, you are hereby informed of change in plans/arrival of our National Leader billed for Sunday. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the plans/arrival have been put on hold. A new plan/arrival will be unfolded soon. Sorry for any inconvenience this hold may have caused. Thank you,\u201d the notice said.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Tinubu confirmed that he went through a challenging health crisis, saying his \u201cphysiotherapy was gruesome.\u201d\n\nTinubu said this while addressing members of the House of Representatives northern caucus who visited him in London last Friday.\n\nThe former governor, who had been in the United Kingdom for the last three months since undergoing knee surgery, told the gathering, \u201cBecause of God and people like you, I am well. It is just the physio (physiotherapy) that is gruesome.\u201d\n\nSince his departure, Tinubu\u2019s London home has become a mecca of sorts as he has been visited by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Governors Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Rotimi Akeredolu (Ondo), and Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti).\n\nSaharaReporters had also reported that Fayemi confirmed that Tinubu had surgery recently and he (Fayemi) was in London to show solidarity with him.\n\nThe governor had said, \u201cHe (Akeredolu) and I were in London together to see our leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, but it had absolutely nothing to do with 2023 presidential plans whatsoever. That\u2019s not the reason why we went there.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju had just surgery; it is simply proper etiquette or behaviour both in the part of the country where I come from but also generally that when a friend and elder is undergoing health challenges, it would be improper on your part not to show solidarity and support.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari also made a surprise visit to Tinubu in London where he was seen leaning on a walking stick.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Tinubu underwent knee surgery at the John Hopkins University Hospital in Maryland, US.\n\nThe APC chieftain, it was learnt, left the US for the United Kingdom on crutches, a few days after the surgery.\n\nSources close to Tinubu told SaharaReporters that he wanted the surgery in Paris, France but changed his plan after rumours of his death spread in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTinubu had his second surgery at John Hopkins University in Maryland recently.

It\u2019s market capitalization value is currently US$922 billion.\n\nFrom Belgrade to Baghdad, from Zamfara to Bangalore, from Jerusalem to Jakarta, from Zurich to Aba, the most visited social media sites are owned by Facebook led by Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nChido Nwangwu\n\nThe three most visible and almost unavoidable platforms on the Internet are Instagram, WhatsApp,\n\nand the ubiquitous social app itself, Facebook!\n\nThere are, at least, 30 other smaller companies with critical technology engagement functions working and ferreting information for the behemoth call Facebook.\n\nOnly four days ago, the influence, power and leverage of the Facebook corporation were manifested in the form of a worldwide outage.\n\nZuckerberg & Company classified the curious outages as an error from a \u201cconfiguration change\u201c. The fact of the matter is that some people did not believe that Facebook would let three of its mega-sites to go down, at the same time \u2014 arising from some configuration updates! Anything is possible.\n\nThe world was largely quiet on Monday October 4, 2021. This was the day after the Sunday, October 3 explosive interview on the most-respected and highest-rated news show in America, 60 Minutes.\n\nFacebook critic at this time came in the person of Facebook\u2019s former product manager Frances Haugen.\n\nShe\u2019s the evidently credible and persuasive whistleblower! She appeared before the U.S Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on Monday. That is, regardless of the global outage.\n\nShe argued that the acquisition and retention of millions of users are the foremost driving factors for the social media giant. She specifically made it clear that Facebook puts profits over safety and well-being of its users \u2014 including teenagers on Instagram. Repeatedly, Haugen said Americans deserve transparency and respect for privacy from the tech powerhouse. Therefore, she called on the lawmakers to pass new, tough regulations for all of America\u2019s social media corporations. She called out what she categorized as Facebook\u2019s reckless disregard for public safety, citing the point that only a few days before the January 6th Capitol Hill insurrection unleashed mainly by the supporters of ex President Donald Trump, Facebook turned off internal settings meant to fight election misinformation.\n\nThe bottom line is that Facebook has two faces.\n\nThere is the face of Facebook which opens and connects people to Instant and live social interactivity across the world.\n\nThe second face of Facebook is the one which relentlessly and without any meaningful and consistent restraints to its deviously calibrated addictive\n\ndigital packages to get more clicks, more hits and more users and exponential financial returns!\n\nAnyway, for now, it is Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s world and we all live in it.\n\nAt least, he\u2019s running a \u201cdemocracy\u201d of sorts because the young man allows us to like and comment on cat videos, taco brands\u2026. And, you never know, maybe tomorrow he add a new feature to allow us to like and comment on which of the Taliban leaders has the longest and sexiest mustache?\n\n*Dr. Chido Nwangwu, author of the forthcoming book, MLK, Mandela & Achebe: Power, Leadership and Identity, serves as Founder & Publisher of the first African-owned, U.S-based newspaper on the internet, USAfricaonline.com, and established USAfrica in 1992 in Houston.

          "title": "Aggregators are enabling independent voices in Kenya\u2019s controlled news circuit",
          "text": "Kenya is all about the news. No, literally, \u201cHabari\u201d, a common greeting in Swahili, means \u201cAny news?\u201d in English.\n\nEveryone has their favourite publication. And every publication has a different story.\n\nData-driven digital media is taking the place of print in Kenya. As the world becomes busier and more digital, the consumption of media has changed. Emerging to take the place of rifling through the morning newspaper are scrollable, swipeable news aggregators that have the potential to change Kenya\u2019s media landscape.\n\nWho owns the headlines? The origins of Kenyan media\n\nIn a country of 52 million people, only a few formal media houses run print news. At an average cost of $0.54 per paper, reading the news can become expensive.\n\nNation Media Group publishes Daily Nation. With a daily circulation of 200,000, it stands as Kenya\u2019s most popular news publication.\n\nThe Standard Group comes in second, with three spin-offs: The Standard, The Standard on Saturday, and The Standard on Sunday. At its inception, more than 100 years ago, it was a colonial newspaper focused on British news. In 1970, African editors took over the running of the paper and shifted its focus to local reporting.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe news circuit\n\nIn an increasingly digital society, news aggregators are offering a new avenue for readers to access diversified content and human stories.\n\nNews aggregators use AI to collate news from different sources, placing them in one, central, scrollable feed. The rise of the news aggregator has, without a doubt, changed the global news industry.\n\nIn 2005, the Agence France-Presse (AFP), sued Google and sought an order barring Google from placing their content on Google News, claiming that the reproduction of the site\u2019s pictures and articles was copyright infringement. AFP and Google settled the suit and the two parties entered a licensed content deal after two years of litigation.\n\nOpera News is another digital news aggregator focused on capturing newsreaders in Africa. It sits under the Opera technology umbrella. If the name sounds familiar it\u2019s because Opera is also the creator of Opay, who raised $400 million from Softbank Vision Fund 2 in late August. The aggregator models itself after a popular app in China, Jinri Toutiao (in English, \u201cToday\u2019s Headlines\u201d). Opera News hit 10 million users in Africa in 2018 and expanded into Kenya in 2020.\n\nMuch like other aggregators, like Google News and Flipboard, Opera News\u2019 AI crawls the internet for content. But unlike other news aggregation giants, Opera News focuses on the curation of original, local, news-pulling stories from local media and fostering a band of content creators that are paid based on a set of parameters that include article clicks.\n\nPositive feedback loops\n\nAggregating digital news in an environment that tends towards the latest and greatest political stories calls for a shift in focus. In the world of news aggregation, moving the needle is as easy as a tweak in the algorithm.\n\n\u201cSome of the parameters that we had before [were] pretty much based on\u2026a lot of people are clicking this [and] our AI picks this up. So what happens is that people who are not doing that cannot get traffic\u2026\u201d said Anthory Ilari, Team Lead of Opera News East Africa.\n\nIlari found that this directly demotivated Opera News\u2019 content creators from reporting stories on broader topics in Kenya.\n\nTo deal with this, Ilari\u2019s team adjusted the algorithm to give original, non-political pieces a boost in the ranking system and feed.\n\nAlbert Bittok, a trained journalist that contributed to Opera News in his spare time, said that, from his experience, articles that received the most views and highest payout were focused on human interest and other topics like politics, sports, and agriculture.\n\nAfter a quick scroll through the headlines page on the Opera News app, TechCabal found that 35% of the headlines were non-political, focused on Kenyan celebrity gossip. On the For You page, on the other hand, 70% of the recommended posts were political in nature.\n\nAgitating aggregation\n\nBut news aggregators are not the be-all and end-all for news diversification in Kenya. Aggregators, like most technology, have their pitfalls. According to Dr. Dinesh Balliah, Acting Director of the Wits Centre for Journalism at Wits University, aggregators point to the growing need for \u201cconvenience in the global economy\u201d, but much like print media, reliance on a single aggregator can be counterproductive.\n\n\u201cNews consumers are not reading intertextually and are therefore getting a single narrative if they are reliant on a single aggregator,\u201d she wrote to TechCabal over email. \u201cAggregators, like social media platforms, must assist the news media to sustain itself,\u201d she added.\n\nNews aggregation requires constant tweaking, learning, and development in a world where millions of clicks come within a few hours. In 2020, Kenya\u2019s internet penetration rate was 85%, with 76% of the internet being accessed by cell phones. As Kenya\u2019s 2022 elections draw near, content moderation will become harder than ever and the nation\u2019s news aggregators will have to rise to the challenge.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at Konga,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nNabsolute\u2019s SpinHeard\n\nUber\u2019s expansion\n\nKlasha\u2019s $2.4m seed\n\nNabsolute\u2019s SpinHeard aims to help independent artists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala, Founder of Nabsolute. Source: Supplied\n\nA peculiar situation. It\u2019s interesting how a career path as a recording artist can be full of uncertainty. You start with a passion for your craft, but to stay afloat, you need to find known agents and big record labels and hope to land that dream record deal.\n\nYour biggest woe is either unheard songs or a flash in the pan success. Luck aside, how can a budding artist navigate the crowded world of music business and get exposure?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what Nabsolute Media, a media communications and marketing agency based in Nigeria, is looking to do for independent artists with its recently launched platform, SpinHeard.\n\nVictor Okpala, a former music journalist and the founder of Nabsolute Media, understands the massive cost of getting one\u2019s music in front of the right crowd, especially with big name agencies.\n\nWith SpinHeard, independent artists can connect directly with listeners, learn the art of the music business with the starter kit provided when they sign up and get free social media publicity at a subsidised rate. But what\u2019s the economics of this? How does it work?\n\nOur senior reporter, Oluwanifemi, wrote a detailed feature on the SpinHeard launch. Read more here.\n\nUber is now present in five Nigerian cities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? US-based technology company, Uber, known primarily for its ride-hailing service, has announced an expansion into Ibadan and Port Harcourt. With this move, the company is now present in five Nigerian cities, including Lagos, Benin City, and Abuja.\n\nAs much as these expansions mean more transportation options and employment opportunities for prospective drivers, I wonder if we would see a repeat of several events.\n\nRecall that in April, Uber and Bolt drivers in Lagos went on a warning strike to protest the high commission fees they had to pay, which led to Uber increasing the prices for riders in Lagos.\n\nTwo-edged competition? On the one hand, competition between autonomous vehicles offering ride-hailing services and Uber is expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, because traditional cabs are much cheaper in these cities, they might retain their hold regardless of Uber\u2019s presence. And with Bolt available in 24 Nigerian cities, including Ibadan and Port Harcourt, it won\u2019t be surprising if there is stiff competition between these parties.\n\nUber\u2019s giveaway: To mark this latest foray, the platform is giving a 50% discount off eight trips with the codes MOVEIBCITY and MOVEPHCITY for riders in Ibadan and Port Harcourt, respectively.\n\nKlasha\u2019s $2.4m seed round will be used to bolster cross-border payments infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Anuna, Klasha\u2019s Founder\n\nFirst, the news: Klasha, a US-based, Africa-focused cross-border payments startup, has announced raising $2.4m in seed investment.\n\nLed by American VC firm Greycroft, the round saw participation from 2.12 Angels, AVG Basecamp Fund, Berrywood Capital, Seedcamp, Plug and Play, Practical VC, MiLA Capital, First Fund, and Expert Dojo. Some Angel Investors also partook, including former TechCrunch\u2018s Head of Product, Santosh Ankola.\n\nWhat does Klasha do? Jessica Anuna founded the company in 2018 as a platform for Africans to shop for fashion items on online stores globally.\n\nAt present, however, it allows Africans to make online and offline purchases in their local currencies using cards, bank accounts, and mobile money providers like M-Pesa, while the merchants receive payment in their currencies in two business days.\n\nThe startup also partners with third-party logistics companies to help merchants in Europe and the US ship to Africa in five to nine working days.\n\nNotable eCommerce platforms like WooCommerce and OpenCart have integrated Klasha\u2019s plugins, with the startup also having an official partnership with BigCommerce.\n\nWith this seed financing, the startup wants to build plugin libraries that will be integrated into platforms like Zara, ASOS, and H&M to enable payments across Africa. Also, plans to foray beyond Nigeria into three African countries are underway.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nThe Attention Diet. Read.\n\nCrazy New Ideas.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s it like to be an average independent artiste, trying to work your way into the limelight or get proper attention? It could involve gate-crashing events looking to get noticed by a record label or putting in the effort to gain financial or mentorship opportunities \u2014 basically, trying to get the right contacts.\n\nFor most artistes, balancing creativity and business could be an uphill task. While the former could be what someone likes to do, the latter is not always within the control of an artiste. When it becomes challenging to get the right contacts to showcase one\u2019s talents, those that can afford it use the services of public relations agencies \u2014 whose rates can be pretty expensive \u2014 to get the exposure.\n\nNabsolute Media, a Nigerian media communications and marketing agency, is one of these companies. However, after running for a little above two years and handling rollout for famous clientele, the business has decided to make communications options open to independent artistes at an affordable rate with the launch of its platform, SpinHeard.\n\nWhy SpinHeard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSpinHeard is the next frontier for us. We\u2019re trying to automate what we do for a lot of artists,\u201d former music journalist and founder of Nabsolute, Victor Okpala, tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a person who had to stick his neck out in the early days to get someone to bet on his capabilities, Okpala understands the importance of having a viable platform and the right contacts.\n\nStill, he believes that the times have become nicer such that the deal-breaker could just be time and chance. And the likelihood that exposure could come in easier ways has repeated itself as music becomes mainstream with the Internet.\n\nThis Harvard Business Review (HBR) piece makes a bold statement about the power of luck in any business. And Okpala strongly agrees with this, especially in music.\n\nA more recent case is how 17-year-old Salle\u2019s music broke the Internet and attracted huge attention, even from CNN, in less than a month. The young Nigerian\u2019s short performance was captured and posted by someone who\u2019d heard of her talents, and for her, that was all she needed.\n\nBut what are the odds if artistes leave it all to luck?\n\nWhile Nabsolute leverages storytelling, tech tools, and a network of influencers to amplify and market content within the creative industry, Okpala admits that these services might not be affordable for the average independent artist.\n\n\u201cWe know that an agency like Nabsolute is elite, which means there\u2019s a cost that comes with it if you want us to do a job for you.\u201d\n\nFor instance, running an entire campaign for four weeks could cost up to $1,500.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd that is a fee that a lot of independent artistes cannot afford,\u201d Okpala explains, \u201cThis group makes up a large percentage of the industry. This means we have a big market that we can\u2019t help. We needed to extend our solution to more people.\u201d\n\nGiven what this process entails, the burden would be massive on the agency and might not be economical for someone with a lean budget. Hence, a need to automate all these processes on a platform.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a platform that will help independent artistes to break the barrier to music curators \u2014 journalists, OAPs, influencers, DJs \u2014 across all levels.\u201d After all, for him, \u201cevery song deserves a fair chance of being heard.\u201d\n\nHow SpinHeard works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeking coverage across different platforms can be a monumental task. Even though the two-year-old business has built a name for itself and has a ready network of \u2018doers\u2019 that can be onboarded, I expressed my worries about the risk of these employees getting a heavier workload for less pay.\n\nAccording to Okpala, SpinHeard comes with incentives for these curators, especially to simplify their jobs. The web app will include tools that will organise and automatically prioritise requests based on release dates, deadlines, genre, regions, and other sorting attributes.\n\nA SpinHeard account can be owned by an artist, a manager, or a curator.\n\nThink of Upwork but for music creators and curators. A platform where artistes can pitch directly to people to get their content across to listeners. What is more significant than an assurance that people will hear them?\n\nThe platform also contains some starter kits that could help artists present their pitches in acceptable formats. This includes press release guides, pitch templates, and press kit templates.\n\nGiven SpinHeard\u2019s value offering, Okpala says the attached costs will be hugely subsidised compared to the standard PR cost. However, since the product is still in its beta phase, the charge is yet to be defined.\n\nBut Okpala makes an interesting case for getting your craft under the radar of an influencer or an OAP with $1, without having to worry about rejection, as long as the quality of the work is good. If the pitch is ignored, there is also a chance to get a refund.\n\nAsides from that, there is an option to pitch for free, with the decision to feature left to the curator\u2019s discretion.\n\nFor starters, SpinHeard will help independent artistes upload their content to the popular video-sharing app, Triller and get promoted for free, of course, after content vetting.\n\nOkpala talks about how this leverages an existing partnership between the social networking platform and Nabsolute. This would expose these independent artistes to the perks the company already offers clients it runs comms for \u2014 in terms of push notifications, banner support, and other home page features.\n\nOkpala confirms that curators will be onboarded later this month; this will arrive along with payment features.\n\nWhat\u2019s the economics of this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m curious about what\u2019s in it for Nabsolute.\n\nLike every new venture, profit isn\u2019t the main goal for now. Okpala believes that starting Nabsolute is risk enough, so the initial focus is on onboarding. Sometimes, the reward might have to come from testimonials telling of the impact on the independent artiste who might have gone unheard without a platform like SpinHeard.\n\nStill, as a business, there\u2019s a plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pad the agency service charge into what users pay to the curators through a percentage share. The model is going to be the typical split-share percentage.\u201d\n\nHowever, this is yet to be decided. The company is still in talks with the curator community, and Okpala can\u2019t confirm if these rates and percentage commission would vary from one curator to another.\n\nWhile his expectations aren\u2019t lofty, Okpala speaks of this product as a risk worth taking since it is the first in the industry, and the company would be willing to experience both the first-mover advantage alongside its disadvantages.\n\nWith an initial focus on Nigeria, the platform would ultimately be open to artists across the globe.\n\nOkpala and his love for music and storytelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala, Founder of Nabsolute. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a music head,\u201d Okpala recalls.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t the whole story, so I probe further. After all, loving music doesn\u2019t always translate to being passionate about telling the story behind a song.\n\n\u201cI had an issue with the way music was being released. I felt like there was no storytelling interwoven in the rollout processes, and people could do better. Rollout felt like an afterthought compared to what happens in the US and other countries,\u201d he explains.\n\nBut he could not act on this until he founded Nabsolute, a story to be told later. In the meantime, let\u2019s talk about what he did before then.\n\nOkpala opens up about a phenomenal change that a Kanye West song gave him in 2016 during a challenging time.\n\n\u201cThere was a part in the song, titled \u2018Waves\u2019, that felt like somebody was gasping for air,\u201d he pauses to imitate a beat, \u201cand that particular part of the song felt like it was me trying to find expression for something inside me that there were no words for.\u201d\n\nAnd the song helped him break out of what he would later get to know was depression.\n\nBefore officially becoming a journalist with Lagos-based online news and entertainment company, thenet.ng in September 2017, Okpala reviewed songs on his YouTube channel. He often criticised people\u2019s works, holding strong opinions, which he says have become more objective.\n\n\u201cI have always done my thing on YouTube. Documenting music, doing album breakdowns and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nBut his issue with the lack of storytelling in music rollout lingered in his mind.\n\nWhile working as a reporter, he felt something was missing, and the void needed to be filled. Okpala decided he had to be more active than just writing about music. So, he took a bold step; at that point, he had made quite a name for himself on the entertainment reporting scene.\n\nFor his first shot, he handled a project by Seyi Shay called Electric Package. He happened to be at the album listening event, where he approached her former manager, Kamal Ajiboye, offering to help them do better. He weaved a story around the EP\u2019s release and rolled it out with a mini-documentary that formed the backstory.\n\nThe success of the project gave him the clarity he had always looked for.\n\n\u201cThat was how I knew that what I was going to do next was to run a communications agency.\u201d\n\nIn May 2019, he resigned and founded Nabsolute in July. Nabsolute is coined from the phrase, \u2018Not a Basic Solution\u2019, which he lived by while conceptualising what else to do. So far, the company has acquired notable clients like Runtown, Ycee, Reekado Banks, Skales, Darey Art Alade, K1 De Ultimate, among others.\n\nDespite the success recorded with Nabsolute, Okpala doesn\u2019t expect SpinHeard to be a walk in the park. And, in figuring out how to get things done, he and his team will make peace with the outcome.\n\nSo, fingers crossed. What do you think about this product?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\neNaira and private blockchains\n\nGoogle\u2019s $1b plan for Africa\n\nChari\u2019s $5m seed raise\n\nThe eNaira dilemma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Central Bank of Nigeria revealed its plans to launch eNaira on October 1, 2021, it also said it would be using a private blockchain \u2014 The Hyperledger Fabric.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the thing, a private blockchain means there\u2019s no room for transparency. And although blockchain is known for its security and decentralisation, when it\u2019s private, whoever is in control of it can manipulate records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy not use a public blockchain? That could work, of course, but that would mean sacrificing speed, amongst other things.\n\nWhat would a private blockchain entail for the eNaira? Are there alternatives?\n\nThese questions and more have been answered. Click here: eNaira: How much control does a private blockchain give the CBN?\n\nGoogle plans to invest $1b towards a digital Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, Google announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa to support digital transformation in the next five years.\n\nThe announcement was made by Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, at the company\u2019s first-ever Google for Africa event.\n\nHow will it happen? Well, the money will be distributed across different sectors \u2014 including eCommerce and telecommunications \u2014 with Google partnering with other African companies as well.\n\nFor example, a subsea cable dubbed Equiano would be built to enable affordable Internet access. It would run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria, and St Helena to connect the continent with Europe. A Device Financing plan would also be implemented.\n\nDevice Financing? Yes. Google says affordable Internet is good, but in the grand scheme of things, being able to buy cheap data would mean nothing if you can\u2019t afford a phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, free iPhones? Well, it\u2019s definitely going to be Androids, but I wouldn\u2019t bank on something fancy. However, the Device Financing plan will be in partnership with Safaricom and will start in Kenya.\n\nIt will be expanded across other parts of Africa through partners including Airtel, M-KOPA, MTN, and Orange. According to Google, \u201cThese partnerships will help millions of first-time smartphone users gain access to quality, affordable Android smartphones.\u201d\n\nAnything else? Google plans to launch the Africa Investment Fund to invest $50 million in African startups. It will also be providing $10 million in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nNon- profits solving different challenges in African communities will also receive $40 million to keep up the good work.\n\nSo, why the generosity? \ud83e\udd14 According to Pichai, the company wants to make \u201cthe Internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve seen companies like Facebook investing in providing Africa with better Internet with its 2Africa subsea Internet cable, but with Africa\u2019s projected population of 2.2 billion by 2045, are these acts of kindness just investment in potential customers?\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, gives a detailed analysis on the subsea Internet cable here: With its massive subsea Internet cable, Google says it\u2019s playing the long game in Africa\n\nChari closes $5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChari Co-Founder. (L-R) Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat. Source: Supplied\n\nMoroccan B2B eCommerce startup, Chari, has announced the close of a $5 million seed at a $70 million valuation to expand into more African countries.\n\nThe seed funding saw investments from Rocket Internet, Plug and Play, Y Combinator, and Orange Ventures, among others.\n\nWhat does Chari do? The startup is digitising the distribution of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) from local manufacturers to local mom and pop stores.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, the duo got the idea for Chari during a trip to understand how FMCG worked in sub-Saharan Africa. They discovered how hard it was for mom and pop stores to get their products and decided to make things easier.\n\nPer TechCrunch, small shops order products via the startup\u2019s mobile app and receive them in less than 24 hours.\n\nIt also partners with FMCG Multinationals like American Consumer Goods company, Procter & Gamble (P&G), giving exclusive access to some products.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, \u201cP&G works with Chari exclusively. So in case any other player wants to sell P&G products, either they have to go through Chari, or they have to buy the goods from the supermarket,\u201d\n\neCommerce in North Africa: eCommerce startups in the region have been on the radar of investors for some time now. We\u2019ve seen massive funding and acquisitions like MaxAB\u2019s $40 million funding and its purchase of WaystoCap\n\nChari plans to expand into Francophone Africa and offer more financial services.

          "text": "Africa\u2019s film industry could contribute $20 billion to the continent\u2019s revenue and also employ 20 million Africans but its potentials remain untapped, according to a report by UNESCO.\n\nAfrican countries have some of the highest unemployment rates in the world with South Africa and Namibia rank the highest with 34.4 percent and 33.4 respectively while Nigeria ranks third-highest with the unemployment rate at 33.3 percent.\n\nDespite its huge potentials, piracy, limitations on freedom of expression, and poor internet connectivity continue to hinder growth.\n\nAccording to the report, Africa is the most underserved continent in terms of movie theatres. Currently, there is only one cinema screen per 787,402 people.\n\nMost creative industries in Africa are grossly underserved, in part due to the failure of policymakers and local authorities to protect and invest in audio-visual industries, the report stated.\n\nThe UNESCO report estimates that 50 percent to over 75 percent of revenue is lost to piracy, though precise data does not exist. Additionally, just 19 out of 54 African countries offer financial support to filmmakers.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s potential as a film powerhouse remains largely untapped, despite significant growth in production across the continent, the report argues. Nigeria alone produces around 2,500 films a year,\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s Nollywood is the second largest film producer globally in terms of value, number of annual films, revenue, and popularity, second only to India\u2019s Bollywood.\n\nThe industry\u2019s radical growth in movie production occurred in 2020 when the pandemic hit and cinemas were shut.\n\nRead also: Nigerian film industry can produce content of global quality- Ihidero\n\nNollywood produced 635 movies in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 626 movies produced in the same period last year. Its growth in Q2 is the highest compared to the same period in previous years.\n\nThe sector has been identified as one of the priority sectors in the 2017 2020 Economic Recovery and Growth plan because it represents a potential growth driver for the economy. However, its growth has been limited by piracy\n\n\u201cPiracy tops the list of film industry\u2019s many challenges fuelled by weak enforcement of Nigeria\u2019s copyright law. In the digital era of today, piracy has morphed into illegal download and distribution of movies without paying for them. Other challenges include lack of financing, poor infrastructure, and inadequate capacity,\u201d analysts at FBNQuest said.\n\nErnesto Ottone, Unesco\u2019s assistant director-general for culture also explained that a significant concern was that much of the money generated by African film industries do not go back into local economies, the report said. Two-thirds of African countries acknowledged that more than half of the proceeds were lost to illegal avenues such as piracy. \u201cCreatives do not receive copyright payment in return for their work. There needs to be much stronger legislation,\u201d he said.\n\n30 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries lacked national film commissions or recognized audio-visual institutions that can champion creatives and fair usage rules, the report said, making reforms hard to achieve.\n\nThe report outlines further challenges in the African film industry, including limitations on freedom of expression, as well as education, training, and internet connectivity.\n\nUnesco\u2019s director-general Audrey Azoulay said in the report, \u201cWe need to strengthen international cooperation to enable film-makers of all countries to express themselves and develop viable and competitive cultural and creative industries.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must raise our voice to reaffirm that films are indeed \u2018public goods\u2019 that require public support and investment to ensure equal access to creation, production, distribution, dissemination, and consumption,\u201d she said.",

He pushed himself to the limit to achieve greatness, building an impressive business empire and transforming the lives of numerous people, most of them of Edo origin.\u201d\n\n\u201cLate Captain Okunbo was a trained pilot who mastered the air early in life and set for the land and the maritime sector, prevailing in all spheres. Captain Okunbo was an embodiment of hard work, perseverance, dexterity and acumen, which espoused his Edo heritage.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cCaptain Hosa was a philanthropist who gave lavishly of himself and his resources. He will be remembered for his dying love for Edo people.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s mounting security problem is compounding the country\u2019s economic woes in varied ways and is particularly responsible for the government\u2019s ballooning budget deficit, the finance minister, Zainab Ahmed, has said.\n\nThe government expects about N10 trillion in revenue in 2022 but plans to spend over N16 trillion, leaving a deficit of over N6 trillion. The shortfall for 2021 stood at N5.2 trillion.\n\nThe balance is to be covered principally from borrowings \u2014 and in part from privatisation proceeds \u2014 at a time public debt has reached its highest levels in more than two decades.\n\nWorse, actual revenue in recent years have been just about 30 per cent of the expected figures, meaning more than 70 per cent of available earnings have been used to repay lenders.\n\nMrs Ahmed said Friday the government\u2019s huge spending on security equipment and operations was fueling the budget deficit and pushing the government to borrow more.\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have been as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded partly by debt,\u201d she said at the public presentation of the budget in Abuja.\n\n\u201cTo compound matters, the country has technically been at war, with the pervasive security challenges across the nation. This has necessitated massive expenditure on security equipment and operations, contributing to the fiscal deficit. Defence and security sector accounts for 22 per cent of the 2022 budget.\u201d\n\nThe deficit will be financed with borrowings from domestic and foreign sources, including multilateral and bilateral finance organizations.\n\nAccording to her, loans from domestic and foreign revenue sources are projected to contribute about N2.51 trillion each, while loans from multilateral and bilateral groups will provide about N1.1trillion and privatization proceeds about N90.7 billion.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari while presenting the 2022 budget estimate to a joint session of the National Assembly earlier justified the borrowings.\n\n\u201cThis represents 3.39 percent of estimated GDP, slightly above the three percent threshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007. Countries around the world have of necessity over-shot their fiscal thresholds for their economies to survive and thrive.\n\n\u201cWe need to exceed this threshold considering our collective desire to continue tackling the existential security challenges facing our country.\u201d\n\nOf the total budget, the defence and security (military, police, intelligence and paramilitary) will receive N2.41 trillion.\n\nBudget parameters\n\nThe underlying drivers of the 2022 fiscal projections, such as oil price benchmark, oil production volume, exchange rate, GDP growth, and inflation rate remain unchanged as in the previously approved 2022-24 medium-term fiscal framework.\n\nThe framework was revised based on the need to reflect the new fiscal terms in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, as well as other critical expenditures in the 2022 budget. The fiscal effects of PIA implementation are assumed to kick in by mid-year 2022.\n\nRecurrent (non-debt) spending, estimated to amount to N6.83 trillion, is 41.7 per cent of total expenditure, and 18.5 per cent higher than the 2021 budget.\n\nAggregate capital expenditure of N5.35 trillion is 32.7 per cent of total expenditure.\n\nAt N3.61 trillion, debt service is 22 per cent of total expenditure and 35.6 per cent of total revenues.\n\nProvision to retire maturing bonds to local contractors/suppliers of N292.7 billion is 1.79 per cent of total expenditure.\n\nProjections\n\nConsumption is projected to surge in the medium-term, growing from a revised N136.57 trillion in 2021 to N149.35 trillion by 2022, about a 9.36percent increase. This growth momentum is projected to be sustained reaching N179.64 trillion in 2024.\n\nNominal GDP is projected to rise from N168.60 trillion in 2021 to N184.38 trillion in 2022 and then up to N221.78 trillion in 2024.\n\nReal GDP growth forecast is 4.2 per cent in 2022. Inflation is expected to remain above the single digit in the medium-term given structural issues impacting the cost of doing business, including high food distribution costs. The steady decline is however expected to be sustained, seeing the inflation rate drop to 13percent in 2022 and 10 percent by 2024.\n\nAlthough Nigeria\u2019s total oil production capacity is 2.5 mbps, current (year to date) crude production is about 1.4mbpd (slightly short of the OPEC+ production quota), and an additional 300,000bpd of condensates, totaling about 1.7mbpd.\n\nOil production is projected to average 1.88 million barrels per day (including condensates) in 2022.",

Out of this amount, CIT and VAT collections were N547.5bn and N235.7bn respectively representing 121 percent in the case of CIT and 148 per cent in the case of VAT of the prorated target.\n\n\u201cCustom collections 338.6bn represents 99 per cent of prorated target. Other revenues amounting to N1.7tn of which the federal government independent revenue of N691.36bn while GEOs revenue was N873.5bn.\n\n\u201cOn the expenditure side, N8.14tn representing 84 per cent of the N9.71tn prorated expenditure from January to August has been spent. This performance includes expenditure estimates of Government Owned Enterprises (GEOs) but doesn\u2019t include project tied loans\n\n\u201cOf the expenditure, N2.89tn was utilized for debt servicing, while N2.57tn was utilised for personnel cost including pension and gratuities. As at the end of August, N1.75tn has been expended for capital projects, of this amount, N1.723tn represents 81 per cent of the aggregate provision for Ministries Department Agencies\u2019 capital prorated, while N36.01bn is expenditure from GEOs.\n\n\u201cSo the story here is that the revenue performance aggregate is 73 per cent but the fact is that the non-oil revenue performing very well above the target, while the oil and gas revenue is lagging.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe pointed out that the government borrowed the sum of N3.65 trillion between January and August to finance its N4.3 trillion fiscal deficit.\n\nShe noted that the outstanding deficit was made up with proceeds from the sales of government assets through the privatisation process and a drawdown of bilateral and multilateral tied loans.\n\nShe said, \u201cAs at August we had a fiscal deficit of N4.29tn, this is against the prorated target of N4.61tn and we financed this deficit by utilization of N136.77bn from proceeds of the sales of government assets through the privatisation process, also by drawdown of bilateral and multilateral tied loans in the sum of N473.12bn and new borrowings of N3.65tn from both domestic and foreign sources.\u201d",

We only have the potential to be rich, because we have a very huge population of about 200 million.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia with a population of about 35 million people has an oil firm, ARAMCO that raked in 49 Billion Dollars in profit in 2020. At our official rate, that is roughly about 20 Trillion Naira in profit: more than the total budget sum for 2022 that was submitted by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cDespite the above statistics, Saudi Arabia still earns revenue from several other sources including religious tourism and Value Added Tax which is as high as 15 percent as against Nigeria\u2019s 7.5%.\u201d Nami stated.\n\nThe FIRS Executive Chairman emphasized that the best way to fund budgets globally was through payment of taxes by citizens particularly personal income tax which is a direct tax as against indirect taxes; he further noted that personal income taxes in other countries account for over 50 percent of the funds available to their respective governments for funding expenditure.\n\n\u201cOur total taxpayers today is in the region of about 41 million people and the total personal income tax paid last year was less than N1trn by 40 million people.\n\n\u201cIf you also compare that with our own brother South Africa where they have a total population of about 60 million people, with just 4 million taxpayers, the total personal income tax paid in South Africa last year is about N13trn. You can now see that these things are not adding up.\n\n\u201cThe number of billionaires in Lagos alone are more than the number of billionaires in the whole of South Africa but yet what Lagos State generated as Personal Income Tax was just less than N400bn in 2020.\n\n\u201cSo if we don\u2019t pay these taxes, there is no way the government will be able to provide the social amenities required, the critical infrastructure required for the wellbeing of the country.\u201d Nami stated.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "Teaching Hospitals Grapple With Battered Image After NARD Strike",
          "text": "The impact of the fourth industrial action by the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) in the space of 15 months, the first being in June 2020, is spreading across the entire health sector, affecting not only the resident doctors, but consultants, nurses, patients and even the viability of the residency programme itself.\n\nMany families whose loved ones were caught up in the NARD have spoken of their anger, frustration and pain at how they were neglected in their hour of need by those who swore an oath to save them when they are sick.\n\nFindings by LEADERSHIP Weekend showed that patients, some critically ill, who were turned away from teaching hospitals, and some that didn\u2019t get the best of attention from the government hospitals are now shunning the hospitals in preference for more stable private hospitals.\n\nSome families turned to traditional healers to meet their health care needs.\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend spoke with the patients, the doctors and hospital management which at a point tried to co-opt house officers into the protest.\n\nEven as resident doctors have suspended their two-month strike and returned to work, Nigerians are increasingly losing confidence in government-owned hospitals as strikes have become a common practice in the country\u2019s health sector, LEADERSHIP Weekend checks revealed.\n\nOne woman, Abigail Amaechi, said she has not recovered from the shock at how her father, Mr Amaechi Mba, passed on after the authorities at University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, quickly discharged her father who had been on oxygen for two weeks when the strike began.\n\n\u201cHe was in critical condition but he was stable before they summarily discharged him. We rushed him to a private hospital but his condition just got worse and worse. He was dead before daybreak. My family will never forget that terrible strike. And we are not the only ones that lost family members to the strike,\u201d she said, adding that she will think twice before taking somebody to public hospitals in the future.\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend reports that mostly general and teaching hospitals offer the residency programme, which needs not only consultants and the resident doctors, but also patients whose cases are studied and diagnosed.\n\nResident doctors in Nigeria are medical school graduates who are training to become specialists in particular fields, under the supervision of consultants.\n\nThese doctors play a major role in hospitals as they make up almost a half of all working doctors in the country and 90 percent of the workforce in some teaching hospitals.\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend gathered that because of the significant role they play, whenever they go on strike, it impacts heavily on hospital operations even though consultants and house officers can attend to patients whenever the resident doctors embark on strike. House officers are newly graduated medical officers who are mandatorily attached to hospitals for a period of one year as a form of internship.\n\nAccording to the founder, Alliance hospital, Dr Christopher Otabor, a resident doctor is any doctor that is less than the rank of a consultant.\n\n\u201cMost of them are undergoing training, specialising to become a specialist. Because of the fact that they are residents, as they are known, in the hospital, they are the ones that do most of the work. For instance, if you come to the hospital at 7pm, you will not meet any consultant, they would have gone.\n\n\u201cThe resident doctors take instructions from the consultants and they stay to do the job but in the process they are also learning and specialising for them to write exams. They write three sets of exams before becoming specialists and can be appointed as consultants.\u201d\n\nHe said the consultant cannot do much without the resident doctors, a reason why during the resident doctors\u2019 strike, a lot of people took their patients out of government hospitals.\n\nEven with the help of house officers, the hospital cannot function fully without the resident doctors, nor can there be a teaching hospital without the patients, said Otabor.\n\nThe impact from the strike was however felt across the states from, one teaching hospital to another. And although the strike by the resident doctors in Enugu has been called off, our investigations revealed that people are still afraid to take their sick ones to government-owned hospitals..\n\nIt was also gathered that patients who were relocated to private hospitals during the strike refused to go back to the government hospitals afterwards.\n\n\u201cI was brought to UNTH from Parklane Hospital, Enugu, but they refused to attend to me because of the strike. Even some people who paid their bills were denied treatment. So people now have confidence in private hospitals,\u201d a patient formerly at Parklane hospital said.\n\nA member of the management at Parklane teaching hospital, who did not want his name mentioned, said their revenue base depleted seriously due to the strike.\n\nHe told our correspondent that there are about 1000 resident doctors operating in Enugu but said migration of doctors from the state to other states might have reduced the number.\n\nIn Rivers State, resident doctors at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH) and Rivers State University Teaching Hospital (RSUTH) joined the national strike, but those of RSUTH later withdrew from the action.\n\nAccording to the chairman, Medical Advisory Committee of UPTH, Princewill Stanley, during the strike, the management of the hospital activated its strike intervention protocols.\n\nStanley said: \u201cI must admit, it was not easy to run a hospital without resident doctors. The activities will slow down but the fact remains that this gridlock will now make patients stay longer than expected.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, there were delays because resident doctors actually do the bulk of the work; because of their weight and number, they give maximum support.\u201d\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend observed that resident doctors make up 60 percent of medical staff of the UPTH and RSUTH.\n\nTo Mr. Austin Job, who was on admission at UPTH, it was a very painful experience as he was attended to by skeletal staff during the resident doctors\u2019 strike.\n\nJob stated that his family had to move him out of the facility to RSUTH when they heard that the resident doctors at the latter were no longer part of the strike.\n\nA nurse, who pleaded for anonymity, told LEADERSHIP Weekend that nurses at UPTH stopped doing shifts during the strike as a result of the workload.\n\nIn Benue State, many citizens who had patients in the hospital during the two-month strike by NARD have lamented that they went through hell during the strike period, some that are buoyant said they transferred the patients to private hospitals where they had to pay triple what they would have paid in public hospitals.\n\nMama Nguveren, whose husband was admitted in one of the public hospitals in M\u00e0kurdi, the state capital, said she had to take her husband back home to engage the services of a herbal doctor, hence no doctor was coming to check them again.\n\nA nurse at Federal Medical Centre, Makurdi, who does not want her name in print said the bulk of the work was too much for them as she was working beyond the stipulated time frame.\n\nAccording to her, all the extra time they put in was just a sacrifice because nobody is paying for it.\n\nThe state chairman, NARD, Dr. Ushakuma concurred that the resident doctors constituted the majority of the workforce with a rough estimate of 60 percent.\n\nIn separate telephone conversations with the chief medical director of the Benue State University Teaching Hospital (BSUTH), Prof Terrumun Swende, and Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Dr. Peteru Inunduh, all expressed joy that the strike had been called off. They agreed that the strike was not easy for them and the patients.\n\nIn Osun State, the protracted resident doctors\u2019 strike had adverse effects on not only patients, other workforce but on the economic fortunes of the affected hospitals.\n\nWhile the economic loss to the strike at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Ile-Ife, OAUTH, Osun State cannot be ascertained now, according to the chairman, Medical Advisory Committee (CMAC), Dr Afolabi Owojuyigbe, management appreciated the resolution of the conflict.\n\nDr Owojuyigbe noted that though the experience of the strike was not palatable, consultants and other health workers did their best to deliver healthcare to patients during the duration of the strike.\n\nA nurse in the physiotherapy ward who spoke on condition of anonymity described the strike period as terrible because of the task of combining the nursing job with counseling as the case arose.\n\nShe appealed to the government to have high commitment to the health sector by at least honouring and implementing Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) reached with health workers to avoid paralysis in hospitals.\n\nA patient at the Endoscopy Suite of the hospital simply identified as Kusamotu expressed delight at the resumption of the doctors.\n\nHe said he had been an outpatient of the hospital for a considerable period of time, adding that his case wouldn\u2019t have deteriorated to admission level if the doctors had been at their duty posts.\n\nAccording to the chief medical director, Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Umuahia, the Abia State capital, Prof Azubuike Onyebuchi, it was one of the toughest periods in recent time for the centre.\n\nHe said the centre was able to cope with the situation through effective use of the house officers and consultants who are less than 30 percent of the medical doctors and the other staff who were equally overstretched.\n\nOnyebuchi, who said the centre suffered over 70 per cent drop in Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), added that the management was forced to be as prudent as possible in the use of the scarce resources to stay afloat.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend, president of the centre\u2019s branch of the association, Dr. Kelechi Chikezie, said the members constitute over 70 per cent of the medical doctors.\n\nSome of the patients and their relatives, narrating their experiences during the period, said, it is better heard than felt, adding that they are happy that it is now over.\n\n\u201cMy hope hung in the balance then,\u201d said a patient.\n\nHowever, the nurses were divided in their experiences during the period. While some, especially the senior ones, said they were encumbered with much work, the junior ones said they had less to do.\n\nIn Niger State there are no resident doctors in the general hospitals, except at the Federal Medical Centre, Bida.\n\nAttempts to get reaction from Dr Usman Abubakar, the new medical director of the medical centre on the impact of the strike, proved abortive as he had not taken over fully.\n\nIt was however gathered that about 30 percent of medical personnel are resident doctors and the strike reduced the capacity of the hospital to admit all the patients that required it during the strike\n\nInstead, patients who were supposed to be on admission were made to come based on appointments to be attended to by the few doctors available.\n\nSome of the nurses interviewed, preferring anonymity, said the strike put more pressure on them especially during emergency, while referral cases were not attended to expeditiously.\n\nIn Cross River, effort in Calabar, the state capital of Cross River, to get the input of chief medical director, CMD, of University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, UCTH, Prof. Ikpeme Ikpeme, failed woefully as the UCTH CMD declined to pick his calls or reply to text messages sent to him by our correspondent on the issues.\n\nOn difficulties faced by patients on admission as a result of the strike, one of the patients, Mrs. Sandra Ebong, who claimed to have gone through excruciating pain during the strike, said, \u201cIt was such a terrible experience for some of us who had issues to be sorted out by the hospital\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEbong lamented how treatment in the hospital was haphazard and shoddy due to the strike.\n\nShe stated that she was left with no other option than to seek help elsewhere at the private hospital in the city of Calabar, stressing that it\u2019s the reason she asked UCTH authorities to discharge her to enable her to seek help at a private hospital instead of leaving her in the hands of the nurses on special duty alone.\n\n\u201cThe consultants would visit the hospital to meet with patients whenever they felt like it. The normal routine check-up of patients wasn\u2019t there. I had no option than to ask to be discharged and seek help elsewhere in a private health facility.\u201d\n\nEbong stated that no patient would be satisfied if he goes to hospital and be left in the hands of nurses alone without having access to doctors.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like what I experienced during the strike,\u201d the patient maintained.\n\nAccording to one of the nurses, Ekanem Bernard, who refused to give details about the unit that she works at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital UCTH, \u201cThere was nothing like work overload because we had only few patients to be taken care of.\n\n\u201cBefore the resident doctors\u2019 strike began, I think management of the hospital got patients with critical cases discharged. Of course patients that were allowed to stay at the hospital with us were the ones with manageable cases. Besides, the hospital was no longer admitting people with critical cases. So nothing like work overload,\u201d Bernard stated.\n\nThe NARD strike crippled activities in Delta State University Teaching Hospital, DELSUTH, Oghara and Federal Medical Centre, FMC, Asaba.\n\nAt the FMC, Asaba, and DELSUTH, Oghara, the resident doctors abandoned the hospitals while in- and out-patients left the hospitals frustrated.\n\nSome patients, who spoke to newsmen at the FMC, Asaba, pleaded with the doctors not to embark on strike again, while calling on government to meet the demands of the doctors.\n\nBoth nurses and patients at the two hospitals, while expressing happiness over the resumption of the doctors, said they actually missed some of the patients, the striking doctors and other activities in the hospital during the strike.\n\nAccording to one of the nurses at FMC who spoke under anonymity, he said they were underutilized likewise most of their equipments which must have deprived the hospital of income and need to spend money to service the unused hospital tools.\n\nThe doctors at DELSUTH, according to the the President Dr. Odukuye Rukevwe and the General Secretary Dr. Adja Harrison called for immediate payment of the 2021 Medical Residency Training Fund to them to continue the training of specialist doctors in Delta State, payment of a reasonable percentage of the backlog of bench fees and to maintain same with a monthly payment of one million naira for the purpose.\n\nParticularly, Dr Osifo Nwabunor, State Chairman, Resident Doctors pressed for facilities to be adequately equipped in preparation for training,\n\nDr Victor Osiatuma, Chief Medical Director, Federal Medical Center, (FMC), Asaba agreed that there were shorfalls in what the hospital was expected to realise, stating that management is collating its records now that the doctors are back to work.\n\nHe regretted that activities at the hospital during the strike was low, which he agreed resulted to low patronage because there was the impression that nobody would attend to them if patients had come to the hospital for treatment or any other medical advise.\n\nOsiatuma, though said cost on services reduced, he however disclosed that what the hospital realised during the strike was a far cry compared to when there was no strike and the hospital fully functional.\n\nDelta State Commissioner for Health, Dr Mordi Ononye, when asked about the effect of the strike on DELSUTH, said the state government has recently released N68 million to the Teaching Hospital to address some of the issues demanding urgent attention.\n\nPatients, however called on the government to reconcile with the striking doctors to find a permanent solution to the incessant strikes by medical doctors..\n\nThe public relations officer of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) ,Owerri , Dr. Mrs Jacy Achonu revealed that the calling off of the strike by resident doctors portends great relief to the FMC, Owerri, as the strike impacted negatively on the hospital.\n\nAccording to her ,the hospital personnel, consultants and nurses had to work extra hours so as to meet up with the demands of the patients.\n\nDr. Achonu said some relatives of patients, who decided to evacuate their wards, however reduced the expected income of the hospital as they witnessed a slight drop in revenue\n\nThe PRO stressed that the ratio of resident doctors in FMC could be put to about 20 percent as the consultants account for 80 percent of doctors at the facility.\n\nIn her contribution, one of the nurses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was not easy operating during the strike and expressed optimism that with the calling off of the strike, the workload on each staff will be reduced significantly.\n\nIn Kwara State, the strike led to the restriction on admission of new patients at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH).\n\nMost patients on admission prior to the commencement of the doctors\u2019 strike also relocated to private hospitals for adequate medical attention.\n\nA senior management staff of UITH who pleaded anonymity told LEADERSHIP Weekend that \u201cthe doctors strike resulted in admissions of only critical cases and more volume of work for consultants.\n\n\u201cBasically, the internally generated revenue of the hospital dropped but there are other sources of revenue through laboratories, mortuary and consultancy firms,\u201d he added.\n\nThe husband of a patient on admission at the hospital, Alhaji AbdulWahab Olajide lamented that he had to take his wife to a private hospital in Ogbomosho, Oyo State for medical attention.\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend also gathered that the resident doctors account for about 25 percent of the UITH workforce .\n\n\u201cBut they (resident doctors) are the most active in that sector. They work at night and on shifts,\u201d a source disclosed.",

They agreed that the strike was not easy for them and the patients.\n\nIn Osun State, the protracted resident doctors\u2019 strike had adverse effects on not only patients, other workforce but on the economic fortunes of the affected hospitals.\n\nWhile the economic loss to the strike at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Ile-Ife, OAUTH, Osun State cannot be ascertained now, according to the chairman, Medical Advisory Committee (CMAC), Dr Afolabi Owojuyigbe, management appreciated the resolution of the conflict.\n\nDr Owojuyigbe noted that though the experience of the strike was not palatable, consultants and other health workers did their best to deliver healthcare to patients during the duration of the strike.\n\nA nurse in the physiotherapy ward who spoke on condition of anonymity described the strike period as terrible because of the task of combining the nursing job with counseling as the case arose.\n\nShe appealed to the government to have high commitment to the health sector by at least honouring and implementing Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) reached with health workers to avoid paralysis in hospitals.\n\nA patient at the Endoscopy Suite of the hospital simply identified as Kusamotu expressed delight at the resumption of the doctors.\n\nHe said he had been an outpatient of the hospital for a considerable period of time, adding that his case wouldn\u2019t have deteriorated to admission level if the doctors had been at their duty posts.\n\nAccording to the chief medical director, Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Umuahia, the Abia State capital, Prof Azubuike Onyebuchi, it was one of the toughest periods in recent time for the centre.\n\nHe said the centre was able to cope with the situation through effective use of the house officers and consultants who are less than 30 percent of the medical doctors and the other staff who were equally overstretched.\n\nOnyebuchi, who said the centre suffered over 70 per cent drop in Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), added that the management was forced to be as prudent as possible in the use of the scarce resources to stay afloat.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP Weekend, president of the centre\u2019s branch of the association, Dr. Kelechi Chikezie, said the members constitute over 70 per cent of the medical doctors.\n\nSome of the patients and their relatives, narrating their experiences during the period, said, it is better heard than felt, adding that they are happy that it is now over.\n\n\u201cMy hope hung in the balance then,\u201d said a patient.\n\nHowever, the nurses were divided in their experiences during the period. While some, especially the senior ones, said they were encumbered with much work, the junior ones said they had less to do.\n\nIn Niger State there are no resident doctors in the general hospitals, except at the Federal Medical Centre, Bida.\n\nAttempts to get reaction from Dr Usman Abubakar, the new medical director of the medical centre on the impact of the strike, proved abortive as he had not taken over fully.\n\nIt was however gathered that about 30 percent of medical personnel are resident doctors and the strike reduced the capacity of the hospital to admit all the patients that required it during the strike\n\nInstead, patients who were supposed to be on admission were made to come based on appointments to be attended to by the few doctors available.\n\nSome of the nurses interviewed, preferring anonymity, said the strike put more pressure on them especially during emergency, while referral cases were not attended to expeditiously.\n\nIn Cross River, effort in Calabar, the state capital of Cross River, to get the input of chief medical director, CMD, of University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, UCTH, Prof. Ikpeme Ikpeme, failed woefully as the UCTH CMD declined to pick his calls or reply to text messages sent to him by our correspondent on the issues.\n\nOn difficulties faced by patients on admission as a result of the strike, one of the patients, Mrs. Sandra Ebong, who claimed to have gone through excruciating pain during the strike, said, \u201cIt was such a terrible experience for some of us who had issues to be sorted out by the hospital\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEbong lamented how treatment in the hospital was haphazard and shoddy due to the strike.\n\nShe stated that she was left with no other option than to seek help elsewhere at the private hospital in the city of Calabar, stressing that it\u2019s the reason she asked UCTH authorities to discharge her to enable her to seek help at a private hospital instead of leaving her in the hands of the nurses on special duty alone.\n\n\u201cThe consultants would visit the hospital to meet with patients whenever they felt like it. The normal routine check-up of patients wasn\u2019t there. I had no option than to ask to be discharged and seek help elsewhere in a private health facility.\u201d\n\nEbong stated that no patient would be satisfied if he goes to hospital and be left in the hands of nurses alone without having access to doctors.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like what I experienced during the strike,\u201d the patient maintained.\n\nAccording to one of the nurses, Ekanem Bernard, who refused to give details about the unit that she works at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital UCTH, \u201cThere was nothing like work overload because we had only few patients to be taken care of.\n\n\u201cBefore the resident doctors\u2019 strike began, I think management of the hospital got patients with critical cases discharged. Of course patients that were allowed to stay at the hospital with us were the ones with manageable cases. Besides, the hospital was no longer admitting people with critical cases. So nothing like work overload,\u201d Bernard stated.\n\nThe NARD strike crippled activities in Delta State University Teaching Hospital, DELSUTH, Oghara and Federal Medical Centre, FMC, Asaba.\n\nAt the FMC, Asaba, and DELSUTH, Oghara, the resident doctors abandoned the hospitals while in- and out-patients left the hospitals frustrated.\n\nSome patients, who spoke to newsmen at the FMC, Asaba, pleaded with the doctors not to embark on strike again, while calling on government to meet the demands of the doctors.\n\nBoth nurses and patients at the two hospitals, while expressing happiness over the resumption of the doctors, said they actually missed some of the patients, the striking doctors and other activities in the hospital during the strike.\n\nAccording to one of the nurses at FMC who spoke under anonymity, he said they were underutilized likewise most of their equipments which must have deprived the hospital of income and need to spend money to service the unused hospital tools.\n\nThe doctors at DELSUTH, according to the the President Dr. Odukuye Rukevwe and the General Secretary Dr. Adja Harrison called for immediate payment of the 2021 Medical Residency Training Fund to them to continue the training of specialist doctors in Delta State, payment of a reasonable percentage of the backlog of bench fees and to maintain same with a monthly payment of one million naira for the purpose.\n\nParticularly, Dr Osifo Nwabunor, State Chairman, Resident Doctors pressed for facilities to be adequately equipped in preparation for training,\n\nDr Victor Osiatuma, Chief Medical Director, Federal Medical Center, (FMC), Asaba agreed that there were shorfalls in what the hospital was expected to realise, stating that management is collating its records now that the doctors are back to work.\n\nHe regretted that activities at the hospital during the strike was low, which he agreed resulted to low patronage because there was the impression that nobody would attend to them if patients had come to the hospital for treatment or any other medical advise.\n\nOsiatuma, though said cost on services reduced, he however disclosed that what the hospital realised during the strike was a far cry compared to when there was no strike and the hospital fully functional.\n\nDelta State Commissioner for Health, Dr Mordi Ononye, when asked about the effect of the strike on DELSUTH, said the state government has recently released N68 million to the Teaching Hospital to address some of the issues demanding urgent attention.\n\nPatients, however called on the government to reconcile with the striking doctors to find a permanent solution to the incessant strikes by medical doctors..\n\nThe public relations officer of the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) ,Owerri , Dr. Mrs Jacy Achonu revealed that the calling off of the strike by resident doctors portends great relief to the FMC, Owerri, as the strike impacted negatively on the hospital.\n\nAccording to her ,the hospital personnel, consultants and nurses had to work extra hours so as to meet up with the demands of the patients.\n\nDr. Achonu said some relatives of patients, who decided to evacuate their wards, however reduced the expected income of the hospital as they witnessed a slight drop in revenue\n\nThe PRO stressed that the ratio of resident doctors in FMC could be put to about 20 percent as the consultants account for 80 percent of doctors at the facility.\n\nIn her contribution, one of the nurses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was not easy operating during the strike and expressed optimism that with the calling off of the strike, the workload on each staff will be reduced significantly.\n\nIn Kwara State, the strike led to the restriction on admission of new patients at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH).\n\nMost patients on admission prior to the commencement of the doctors\u2019 strike also relocated to private hospitals for adequate medical attention.\n\nA senior management staff of UITH who pleaded anonymity told LEADERSHIP Weekend that \u201cthe doctors strike resulted in admissions of only critical cases and more volume of work for consultants.\n\n\u201cBasically, the internally generated revenue of the hospital dropped but there are other sources of revenue through laboratories, mortuary and consultancy firms,\u201d he added.\n\nThe husband of a patient on admission at the hospital, Alhaji AbdulWahab Olajide lamented that he had to take his wife to a private hospital in Ogbomosho, Oyo State for medical attention.\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend also gathered that the resident doctors account for about 25 percent of the UITH workforce .\n\n\u201cBut they (resident doctors) are the most active in that sector. They work at night and on shifts,\u201d a source disclosed.",
          "summary": "The impact from the strike was however felt across the states from, one teaching hospital to another.\nIn Rivers State, resident doctors at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH) and Rivers State University Teaching Hospital (RSUTH) joined the national strike, but those of RSUTH later withdrew from the action.\nThe NARD strike crippled activities in Delta State University Teaching Hospital, DELSUTH, Oghara and Federal Medical Centre, FMC, Asaba.\nAt the FMC, Asaba, and DELSUTH, Oghara, the resident doctors abandoned the hospitals while in- and out-patients left the hospitals frustrated.\nMost patients on admission prior to the commencement of the doctors\u2019 strike also relocated to private hospitals for adequate medical attention.",

          "text": "A breakdown of the 2022 budget estimates has shown that the federal government earmarked the sum of N2.41trillion for the Defence sector, including the military, police, intelligence and para-military.\n\nThis is the highest among other critical sectors in the 2022 budget, even as N1.45 trillion and N921billion has been set aside for infrastructure as well as youth, women and social development respectively.\n\nThis is followed by education with the sum of N875.93 billion for federal ministry of education and its agencies, N108.10 billion for universal basic education commission and N318 billion for Tertiary Education Trust fund (TETFUND).\n\nSimilarly, the health sector got N711.28 billion for the ministry of Health and its agencies, while N54. 87billion will be spent on gavi, immunisation and a transfer of N54.05 billion for the basic healthcare provision.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Hajiya Zainab Ahmed, disclosed this during the public presentation of the 2022 proposed budget in Abuja yesterday.\n\nIn the new draft budget, the executive is proposing aggregate revenue available to fund the 2022 budget of N10.13 trillion (inclusive of GOEs), 24.8 per cent higher than the 2021 projection of N8.12 trillion.\n\nWithout the government-owned enterprises (GEOs), retained revenue, the government revenue is projected at N8.40 trillion.\n\nIn aggregate, 34.9 per cent of projected revenues is to come from oil-related sources while 65.1 per cent is to be earned from non-oil sources.\n\nThe 2022 aggregate federal government expenditure, inclusive of government owned enterprises and project-tied Loans, is projected to be N16.39 trillion, which is 12.5 per cent higher than the 2021 budget.\n\nRecurrent (non-debt) spending, estimated to amount to N6.83 trillion, is 41.7 per cent of total expenditure, and 18.5 per cent higher than the 2021 budget.\n\nThe budget has aggregate capital expenditure of N5.35 trillion or 32.7 per cent of total expenditure.\n\nThis provision is inclusive of the capital component of statutory transfers, GOEs capital & project-tied loans expenditures.\n\nAt N3.61tn, debt service for 2022 is 22 per cent of total expenditure, and 35.6 per cent of total revenues.\n\n\u201cAchieving government\u2019s budget objectives requires bold, decisive and urgent actions. Government is determined to act as may be required,\u201d the Finance minister said.\n\nOn the 2021 budget expenditure side, she said N8.14 trillion (or 84 per cent) has been spent out of the N9.71 trillion prorata budget.\n\nThis performance, she added, is inclusive of expenditure estimates of the government owned enterprises but exclusive of project-tied loans.\n\nOut of that, N2.87 trillion was for debt service, and N2.57 trillion for personnel costs, including pensions.\n\nThe minister disclosed that as of August 2021, N1.759 trillion was expended on capital, and of this, N1.723 trillion represents 81 per cent of the provision for MDAs\u2019 capital, and N36.01billion as government-owned enterprises capital expenditure.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has announced key changes in the 2022-2024 medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF).\n\nAccording to the minister of Finance, the revision was necessitated by the need to reflect the new fiscal terms in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, as well as other critical expenditures in the 2022 budget.\n\nFactors that forced the government to make the changes in the fiscal framework include the fact that gross federation revenue projection decreased by N341.57 billion, from N8.870 trillion to N8.528 trillion.\n\nDeductions for federally-funded upstream project costs and 13 per cent derivation decreased by N335.3 billion and N810.25 million respectively.\n\nAhmed said net federation oil and gas revenue projection declined by N5.42 billion from N6.540 trillion to N6.535 trillion.\n\nTo further enhance independent revenue collection, she said the federal government aims to optimize the operational efficiencies and revenue generation focus of GOEs.\n\n\u201cThere would also be an introduction of new and further increases in existing pro heath taxes for example, excise on carbonated drinks,\u201d she said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe minister also reaffirmed that GOEs\u2019 revenue performance/remittance will be enhanced through effective implementation of the enhanced performance management framework, including possible sanctions for defaulters\n\nShe added that there would be tighter expenditure control, including enforcement of Finance Act 2020 provision which would limit GOEs cost-to-revenue ratio to maximum of 50 per cent and regular independent monitoring and reporting of revenue and expenditure performance of GOEs by both the budget office of the federation and the office of the accountant general of the federation.\n\nAhmed said the government is keen on improving revenue for implementation of the budget.\n\n\u201cAt that level of revenues, the debt-service-to-revenue ratio will cease to be worrying. Overall, we do not have a debt sustainability problem, but a revenue challenge which we will tackle to ensure our debts remain sustainable,\u201d she added.\n\nOn strategies to improve the revenue generation for the country, the minister explained that the federal government remains committed to using innovative ways to raise the revenues required to finance its expenditure and diversifying its revenue sources.\n\n\u201cSeveral measures are being instituted under the administration\u2019s Strategic Revenue Growth Initiatives to improve government revenue and entrench fiscal prudence with emphasis on achieving value for money,\u201d she said.\n\nCurrent Challenges Call For Vigilance, COAS Tells Troops\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, has charged troops to be alert and vigilant while discharging their duties, saying the current security challenges call for vigilance by the troops in the discharge of constitutional responsibilities.\n\nGeneral Yahaya gave the charge while addressing instructors at Depot Nigerian Army, Nigerian Military School (NMS), Directorate of Army Physical Training (DAPT), and Army School of Physical Training (ASPT).\n\nA statement by the director army public relations, Brig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, quoted the COAS as urging the troops to always conduct themselves professionally, while adhering to the rules of engagement and standard operating procedures.\n\nHe said since assumption of command, he has placed high premium on the welfare of officers, soldiers and their families, adding that deliberate steps are being taken to address the challenges associated with accommodation in Chindit Cantonment.\n\nHe added that in demonstration of his resolve, he has embarked on the assessment visit to obtain firsthand information on the level of renovation work going on in the cantonment.\n\nHe restated that welfare will continue to be given the desired attention under his watch.\n\nHe commended troops for their selfless service and urged them to keep the flag flying in defence of fatherland and service to humanity.\n\nThis, he said, is necessary to justify the confidence President Muhammadu Buhari reposes on the Armed Forces of Nigeria.\n\nOn arrival at the Cantonment, the COAS was received by the commandant, Depot Nigerian Army, Brigadier General Aminu Chinade, at the Buffalo Haven.\n\nThe commandant briefed him on the security situation as well as the state of development in the cantonment and its environs.",

These three values stand him out among his contemporaries in national politics today. It is no wonder the man stretches his arm of fellowship beyond Lagos, the State he led for eight years as a Governor and in which he bequeathed the legacy we are building on. He is nationalist in thinking and progressive in action.\n\n\u201cThe SWAGA we are launching in Lagos today is a demonstration of Tinubu\u2019s enduring political principles and strong vision. Those behind the movement took the three values and push them with passion. What we are witnessing today is the action from the vision and passion; this is what SWAGA represents. By the grace of God, we will drive this agenda to logical end and we will all witness the inauguration of our political icon come 2023.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu assured the proponents of the movement of his continued support, promising to mobilise more political support for the group. He said he would join hands with SWAGA coordinators to take the agenda beyond the Southwest region and make it a national movement.\n\nDeputy Governor, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, said Tinubu personified the progress the Nigerians had been yearning for, drumming support for the APC National Leader.\n\n\u201cIf we want true progress, employment, security and development, we all know who is capable of creating these opportunities for us. He is Asiwaju,\u201d Dr. Hamzat said.\n\nSenator Adeyeye said Lagos was the last State to be visited since the movement started last December, noting that all political and traditional rulers across the Southwest were in tune with the agenda being pushed by the group.\n\nBefore the formal launch in Lagos, the Ekiti-born ex-lawmaker said the group met over 80 traditional rulers in the State to establish SWAGA as a grassroots movement.\n\nLagos SWAGA official, Mrs. Kafilat Ogbara, said it was time Tinubu let the cat out of the bag, urging Southwest Governors to unanimously join hands with teams of supporters to make a clarion call on the APC National Leader to declare his interest in the presidency.\n\nShe said: \u201cToday we are launching a national machinery for the advancement of our nation and rescue it from the challenges of insecurity, banditry, unemployment.

          "text": "Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information and Culture, has named three key events that occurred in Nigeria since President Muhammadu Buhari took office in 2015.\n\nAccording to the minister, a huge part of the North East was under the effective occupation of Boko Haram, the economy had virtually collapsed and production went from about 2.1 million barrels per day to about half a million barrels a day.\n\nMohammed also hailed Buhari for steering the country in the right direction and returning its economy to the path of sustainable growth in spite of the huge challenges inherited by his government.\n\nThe Minister made the remarks in Abuja on Friday when he received a delegation from the African Union Development Agency-New Partnership for Africa\u2019s Development (AUDA-NEPAD), which is in the country for the second peer review.\n\n\u201cWe came into government in 2015 and by the time we came to government, three things happened, the impact of which we did not know. The first is that by the time we assumed office in 2015, a huge part of the North East was under the effective occupation of Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cWhen we came in in 2015, the economy had virtually collapsed. Oil prices crashed from a high of about $120 per barrel to about $28 a barrel. Production went from about 2.1 million barrels per day to about half a million barrels a day. These were the challenges we faced on day one when we came in,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed, therefore, urged the AUDA-NEPAD to always consider the particular challenges of a country while making conclusions on the governance structure for the peer review.\n\n\u201cWhile we can have some basic tenets of governance, governance is a bit peculiar to the locality, and the kind of challenges we face will determine to a large extent the mechanism we are going to use to resolve them.\n\n\u201cI look at Nigeria as an extremely interesting project, especially in the last six years. I think the kind of challenges we faced as a government coming in in 2015 till today will challenge the most resourceful persons,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister hailed the governance style of President Buhari which, he said, is driven by experience, wisdom, tolerance, patience and listening to all shades of opinion in his effort to chart a new course for the country that has been plagued by numerous challenges.\n\nWhile speaking on the economy, he said the President has diversified the economy as oil is no longer the driving force behind economic growth.\n\n\u201cIn the area of economy, I am proud to say that we are not just in the process of diversifying the economy, we have diversified our economy because the last report (of the National Bureau of Statistics) showed that while the non-oil economy did very well, the oil-related economy did poorly.\n\n\u201cThat after two quarters of recession, we were able to record 5.01% growth in GDP was not at all based on the oil economy but on the non-oil economy,\u201d Alhaji Mohammed said.",

These three values stand him out among his contemporaries in national politics. He is a nationalist in thinking and a progressive in action.\n\n\u201cThat SWAGA was launched today is a clear demonstration of Tinubu\u2019s enduring political principles and strong vision. Those behind the movement are the people who believe in the three values that Asiwaju personifies and are ready to push them with passion for other Nigerians to see.\u201d\n\nRecently, Sanwo-Olu travelled to London to visit Tinubu, who was Lagos governor from 1999 to 2007.\n\nAlso, members of the House of Representatives from the north led by Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Wase, visited the APC chieftain last week and endorsed his candidacy for the 2023 presidency.\n\nThough Tinubu has yet to declare his intention to contest any office in 2023, there have been reports and veiled indications that he might be interested in the exalted seat.\n\nAs the 2023 general elections draw nearer, there have been intense political posturing, permutations and fireworks, especially as the eight-year regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), who is from Katsina State, winds down.\n\nThe 17 Southern Governors had also met twice in the year and demanded power shift to their region while the 19 Northern Governors also met last week, opposing such move and noting that the candidate with the highest votes will emerge as President in the next general elections.\n\nSalihu Tanko Yakasai, a former Special Adviser on Media to Ganduje had listed Tinubu; Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; as well as Fayemi as APC chieftains who have the ability to win the 2023 presidential election.\n\nHowever, Tinubu\u2019s health has been a subject of controversy of late.\n\nAt least over 30 politicians had visited Tinubu, in London, in the last three months. Notably amongst the politicians include Buhari; Kano State Governor, Umar Ganduje; Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun; Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi; and his Ondo State counterpart, Rotimi Akeredolu.\n\nOthers who had also visited Tinubu in London include House of Representatives Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila; ex-Governor of Ogun State and current Senator representing Ogun Central, Ibikunle Amosun; former Governor of Borno State and current Senator representing Borno Central, Kashim Shettima.",

          "text": "In Anambra State, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) claimed that it has uncovered 62,698 incidents of double voter registration.\n\nThe INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, stated this in Abuja on Friday at an emergency meeting with political parties.\n\nYakubu said the meeting was necessary in order to brief the parties on the commission\u2019s preparations for the coming governorship election as well as some other recent developments in the state.\n\nHe said it was discovered during the clean-up of registration data in Anambra that 62,698 people who are already registered voters, registered again.\n\n\u201cIn Anambra State, a total of 138,802 citizens completed the registration, including applications for transfer and requests for replacement of lost, damaged or defaced PVCs as required by law. However, in the process of cleaning up the registration data, we discovered that many previously registered persons re-registered afresh,\u201d he said.\n\nHe continued that \u201cAs a testimony to the effectiveness of our new system for checking double and multiple registrations, the commission found out that some 62,698 persons who are already registered voters in Anambra State went ahead to register again. These double or multiple registrations are invalid by law. We have archived these registrations and will not print new PVCs for them.\n\n\u201cTheir old PVCs remain valid and they can use them to vote at the Polling Units where they registered and probably voted in previously elections. The same cleaning up exercise is going on nationwide. As soon as it is over, the commission will provide further details to Nigerians on the situation in other States of the Federation and action to be taken on the matter. Let me remind all Nigerians that the law prohibits double registration.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the number of valid registrants in Anambra State at the end of the first quarter of the CVR exercise on 5th September 2021 is 77,475. This figure has been added to the existing register of 2,447,996 eligible voters used for the 2019 General Election. Accordingly, the number of registered voters in Anambra State now stands at 2,525,471.\u201d\n\nYakubu added that the security around INEC facilities in the state has been ramped up in preparation for the upcoming election and appealed to the political parties not to worsen insecurity with their utterances and actions.\n\n\u201cThis could compound the security situation and make the work of the Commission, political parties and security agencies even more difficult.

          "text": "\u2026South blackmailing North for power shift \u2013 APC chieftain \u2026PDP\u2019ll re-visit Bala-led c\u2019ttee on zoning \u2013 Spokesman \u2026Every country has its own peculiarities \u2013 Olujimi \u2018\u2026Anti-open grazing law\u2019ll protect citizens\u2019 \u2018\u2026VAT being used for North to cede presidency\u2019\n\nAhead 2023 general elections, the battle of wits has started between the North and the South political elite with governors and ethnic champions fanning the embers of dispute. In this report, BODE OLAGOKE, TAIYE ODEWALE, TOPE SUNDAY, SAMSON BENJAMIN and ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU, dug deep into the agitations and the implications.\n\nBackground\n\nThe 17 Southern governors had demanded at a meeting in Lagos that the South should be allowed to take a shot at the presidency in 2023.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cThe Forum reiterates its commitment to the politics of equity, fairness and unanimously agrees that the presidency of Nigeria be rotated between Southern and Northern Nigeria and resolved that the next president of Nigeria should emerge from the Southern Region.\u201d\n\nReacting to their position, their counterparts in the North at a meeting in Kaduna, rejected rotational presidency, saying it was against the constitution of the country.\n\nThe chairman of the Forum, the Plateau state governor, Simon Lalong, said, \u201cSome Northern states governors had earlier expressed views for a power-shift to the three geo-political zones in the South with a view to promoting unity and peace in the nation.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding their comments, the Forum unanimously condemns the statement by the Southern Governors Forum that the Presidency must go to the South. The statement is quite contradictory with the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended that the elected President shall:- score the majority votes; score at least 25% of the votes cast in 2/3 States of the Federation.\u201d\n\nGloom\n\nSpeaking on the likely danger of jettisoning zoning or otherwise, a political analyst, Towoju Mercy, said ever since Nigeria gained Independence in 1960, there have been issues of tribalism in the Nigerian presidency.\n\nShe said, \u201cPresidency ought to be based on merit and people\u2019s mandate but it\u2019s had turned to a post which a particular tribe is ready to dominate. The presidential seat is not exclusively reserved for a particular group but for those who merit it and those that can hold the mantle of leadership.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of dangers that are about to set in, one of which is inter-regional or inter-tribal clash. I think it\u2019s high time the Northerners should take a shift from the presidential seat and allow the southern region to enjoy the benefit of being a part of Nigeria. The fact is that it should be accepted that we are divided so let each tribe showcase what they are up to and the package they have for the country.\u201d\n\nAnother political commentator, Success Ohia, said any attempt to jettison the zoning\u2019s unwritten agreement will only further fuel secession agitations and which will endanger the already fragile unity of the country.\n\n\u201cI foresee a great danger in the country, because, it will not be in the interest of the country for the north to hold on to power in 2023, because doing so would be to the detriment of the fragile unity of the country, which is against the constitution in section 15(1) which states that \u2018the motto of the federal republic of Nigeria shall be unity and faith, peace, and progress.\u2019\n\nIn his view, a political scientist and lecturer in the department of political science, Federal University Oye Ekiti, Femi Fayomi, noted that the development might lead to a complicated outcome in the ongoing tussles between the regional governors.\n\n\u201cInfact, it\u2019s looking increasingly like this would be a major test and hiccup to our federalism because some certain parts of the geo-political zones are yet to serve in the highest seat of the nation. Consequently, by zoning to other regions other than such regions will ignite and fuel the marginalisation outcry which will be another cog in the wheel of progress of the nation\u2019s development and unity.\n\n\u201cAlso, if we are to look beyond primordialism, I think if any region can present aspirants with proven integrity, records and antecedents good enough to paddle the ship of the nation without any form of fear or bias toward any region. Going by our history, one can easily deduce that ethnicity has done more harm than good to our development taking into consideration failure to adhere to federal character principle in the various political appointments made by the government which has limited the input of other regions hence fuelling the ideology of Right to Rule by a certain region.\n\n\u201cI think the major political parties can make a decisive action towards presenting the best candidate from the geo-political zone that has yet to serve in such capacity to also contest since it\u2019s not that those regions are short of human resources and intellectual capacity to improve the country\u2019s various spheres.\u201d\n\nVAT, open-grazing, restructuring\n\nAside from the agitations for power rotation, the controversial issues of Value Added Tax (VAT) and the open-grazing law have also become tools for negotiation in the hands of politicians, which analysts have said pose danger for the continued peaceful existence of the country.\n\nAs agreed by the Southern governors at their Lagos meeting, most Southern states have enacted laws against open-grazing in the region. This action is also considered a move against the Northern Fulani who are culturally cattle rearers and in the business of moving their cattle about.\n\nSome commentators, however, believe that the growing move against open- grazing of cattle and that of allowing states to collect VAT have been spurred by the body language of the government at the centre which appears to favour the Northern Protectorate.\n\nAgitations for the restructuring of the country in a way that powers are devolved to the regions and states have been on the table for years now with those championing the cause predominantly from the South which makes it look suspicious to the North. Restructuring, as a Southern agenda, is seen by Northern stakeholders as an agenda against their region with the highest voting population.\n\nA security expert\u2019s view\n\nA security expert, Chinedu Okafor, in his reaction, told this reporter that if not politicised, the governors\u2019 decision to ban open-grazing has the potential of curbing farmers\u2019, herders\u2019 violence in across the country. According to him, the ban may have both positive and negative effects.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn one hand, it will definitely reduce the issue of criminal herdsmen kidnapping because the alibi of staying in the forest in the guise of rearing cattle will no longer be there as a cover. More so, it will also put a stop to the herders, farmers\u2019 crises in the South, North and the Middle Belt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that if no compromise is reached between the northern governors and their southern colleagues on this issue, it could lead to another bigger crisis altogether. This is besides the Fulani\u2019s expected revolt should the plan come into action. Every side needs to tread softly.\n\n\u201cAside from deaths of different individuals, it has also led to loss of property worth millions of Naira and food shortages due to the neglect of farm lands and destruction of crops.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the executive director of Global Rights Network, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Hafeez Babatunde, said such a legal instrument is needed to stop the menace of herders, farmers\u2019 clashes in the southern part of the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cGovernors of the states where the law is yet to take off must be reminded that the anti-open grazing law is undoubtedly the only legal route to protect their people from insidious attacks by criminal herders. It is a timely warning that mere rhetoric and grandstanding cannot curb the killer herders\u2019 wanton campaign of destruction of farms and kidnappings across the southern states.\u201d\n\nFor a former House of Representatives member, Aminu Sani Jaji, the controversy surrounding the collection of VAT is being used to compel the North to cede the presidency to the South in 2023.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen in Abuja, the Zamfara state-born chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC) said the North stands to gain bountifully in the long run if states are allowed to reap from the VAT generated in their respective domain.\n\nJaji, who expressed reservations over zoning, however, admitted that rotational presidency would enhance national unity and cohesion in the country.\n\n\u201cEven the issue of VAT or fiscal federalism that people are talking about, all these are because of 2023. They feel the only way they can get the presidency or mandate is through intimidation. It will not work. You can only win somebody\u2019s heart by being polite and friendly. But so long as you continue to pursue somebody with a sort of intimidation with what you have, trying to use your own force, nobody will take it.\n\n\u201cMy take is that whosoever wants to be the president, let the person come and showcase to all Nigerians where he is from the North or South how he wants to be a president. Politics is a game of numbers. There is no way you can take away that word from politics. It must be the number.\n\n\u201cWhen a group of people sit down and talk about zoning, it is about sentiment. In politics, you don\u2019t zone everything. But it\u2019s because we are not yet mature and advanced that the issue of zoning is coming up.\n\n\u201cI think the issue of zoning always comes up because we want to remain as one. Because the political diversity we have today was because of the regional politics we have been playing all the time since 1999 till date.\u201d\n\nAs far as a former governor of Nasarawa state and the lawmaker representing Nasarawa West in the Senate, Abdullahi Adamu, is concerned, the right to field a presidential candidate solely rests with political parties.\n\n\u201cThose nursing the idea of zoning or rotational presidency should jettison it since it is not provided for by the 1999 Constitution. No part of the Nigerian constitution provides for zoning or rotation of political offices, meaning that for anybody to become president must be ready to go through the ballot box.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just whisk away a position that is fundamental to the life of a country. You can\u2019t talk of merit and talk of zoning. The issue of rotation, let\u2019s just go by merit. Let every party find a way of selling itself in a manner as to garner the kind of votes to deliver the presidential result. It is as simple as that,\u201d he said.\n\nConvention\n\nIn her reaction, a PDP senator representing Ekiti South, Biodun Olujimi, said people tend to mix up the issue of zoning and rotational presidency.\n\nShe said zoning in political parlance may not be written or recommended anywhere in the constitution but the principles of Federal Character are enshrined in the constitution.\n\n\u201cAs provided for by the principle of federal character, public offices cannot be occupied or dominated by one section of the country at the exclusion of others, which made political parties in Nigeria right from the first republic to reflect federal character in their compositions as far as membership and executives are concerned and even as far as public offices are concerned for anyone of them in power.\n\n\u201cRotational presidency on the other hand is more of convention anchored on gentlemanly agreement written or unwritten between the North and the South in addressing the peculiarities of the country called Nigeria. This debate as regards where power should shift to in 2023 between political actors from the South and the North is unnecessary going by the already analysed trend from 1999 till date.\n\n\u201cEvery country has its own peculiarities, rotational presidency between the North and the South is one of the ways of addressing the peculiarities of a highly diversified entity called Nigeria, and there should be no heated debate or argument across the divides on it.\u201d\n\nPGF boss\u2019 warning\n\nIn his reaction, the director-general of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, has warned that moves by some leaders in the APC to push negotiation for the emergence of the party\u2019s presidential candidate for 2023 elections outside the structures of the party is a threat to internal unity among APC members and leaders.\n\nHe also canvassed for a strong and functional internal consultative mechanism to address differences and disputes between APC-controlled governments in the interest of the party.\n\nBlaming the development on what he called \u201cexcessive politicisation\u201d in a statement titled: \u201cAPC and struggle for New Nigeria\u201d in Abuja, the APC chieftain said campaign and negotiation for power shift should be carried out within the party structures.\n\nHe said, \u201cPart of the challenge of excessive politicisation is that it also threatens the internal unity of APC members and leaders. For instance, excessive politicisation in the country is influencing the decision of some APC leaders to push negotiation for the emergence of the party\u2019s Presidential Candidate for 2023 elections outside the structures of the APC.\n\n\u201cThis is now threatening the unity of leaders of APC. Around the whole question of power shift, some leaders of the APC have gone outside the structures of the party to mobilise support for the party to zone its presidential candidate for 2023 to the Southern part of the country.\u201d\n\nPDP spokesman\u2019s view\n\nWhile the APC is yet to decide on zoning, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has disclosed that its national executive committee (NEC) \u201cshall at a later date revisit Governor Bala Mohammed committee\u2019s recommendation on zoning.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of PDP Zoning Committee, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu state last week recommended that \u201cconsequently, the current offices being held by officers in the Southern zones of the country, namely; South-west, South-east and South-south zones, should swap places with the offices currently in the northern zones of Nigeria, namely, North-west, North-east and North-central zones.\u201d\n\nBefore the Ugwuanyi\u2019s committee, the Governor of Bauchi state, Senator Bala Mohammed-led committee to review party\u2019s performance in 2019 had earlier recommended that the 2023 presidential ticket be thrown open.\n\nBut briefing the newsmen after Wednesday\u2019s meeting, the party\u2019s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the NEC has unanimously adopted the Ugwuanyi committee report on zoning of the party\u2019s national offices.\n\nOn the 2023 presidency, Ologbondiyan said NEC \u201cshall at a later date revisit Governor Bala Mohammed committee\u2019s recommendation on zoning.\u201d\n\nCalculations\n\nDespite the regional and ethnic political calculations, event watchers believe that when the chips are down some of the governors in the forefront of the regional interest will be forced to dance to the tunes of their political parties, bearing in mind that only political parties have the constitutional powers to present presidential candidates.",

          "text": "The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) , on Thursday, denied the trending report that the air bombardment of the air component of Operations Hadin Kai on terrorist location killed 20 fishermen in Borno State.\n\nIt noted that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed.\n\nActing Director Defence Media Operations, Brigadier General Benard Onyeuko who made this denial in a statement also explained that the military bombed the location after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe attention of the Defence Headquarters has been drawn to media reports making rounds in social media alleging that; the \u201cAir Component of Operation HADIN KAI on Sunday 26 September 2021, killed 20 Fishermen in air strikes at Kwatan Daban Masara general area in the fringes of the Lake Tchad. It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "text": "The U.S. Senate approved legislation on Thursday to temporarily raise the federal government\u2019s $28.4 trillion debt limit and avoid the risk of a historic default this month, but put off until early December a decision on a longer-lasting remedy.\n\nThe Senate voted 50-48 to pass the bill following weeks of partisan fighting. Earlier, 11 Republicans voted in favor of a procedural vote allowing the bill to proceed.\n\nThe Senate-passed bill now goes to the House of Representatives, which needs to approve it before President Joe Biden can sign it into law. The House will hold a vote on the bill on Tuesday, according to the office of the No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden looks forward to signing this bill as soon as it passes the House and reaches his desk,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in statement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the coming months, we hope that even more Republicans will join Democrats in responsibly addressing the debt limit instead of choosing default or obstruction.\u201d\n\nThe $480 billion increase, which would lift the debt limit to $28.9 trillion, is expected to be exhausted by Dec. 3, the same day that funding for most federal programs expires under a stop-gap measure passed earlier this month following another partisan standoff.\n\nThat means that over the next eight weeks, the bitterly divided Congress will have the twin challenges of finding a middle ground on agency spending through September 2022 \u2014 ranging from education and foreign aid programs to immigration enforcement and airport security \u2014 and avoiding yet another debt limit meltdown.\n\nThe vote followed a months-long standoff that brought the nation close to the Oct. 18 date that the Treasury Department forecast as when it would no longer be able to meet its obligations.\n\n\u201cRepublicans played a dangerous and risky partisan game and I am glad that their brinksmanship did not work,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said after the vote.\n\nThe plan emerged on Wednesday after top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said Republicans were open to a temporary hike after twice blocking Democrats\u2019 attempts to raise the cap. That offer came after Biden raised the possibility of bypassing the Senate\u2019s filibuster rule requiring 60 of the 100 members to agree on most legislation.\n\nNot all Republicans were happy with McConnell\u2019s move, and it took long negotiations behind closed doors to secure enough Republican votes to advance the measure.\n\n\u201cThis is a complete capitulation,\u201d said Republican Lindsey Graham.\n\nEarlier in the day, news of the negotiations drove Wall Street\u2019s main stock indexes to end sharply higher in a broad-based rally. In a sign of bond market relief, the yield on one-month Treasury bills fell to the lowest point since Sept. 8 as investors deemed that the risk of default had eased. read more\n\nRECONCILIATION\n\nWashington\u2019s debt limit troubles are unlikely to be resolved with passage of the short-term increase.\n\nMcConnell is still expected to insist that the next increase in December be achieved through the time-consuming \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d process, which would allow for passage without any votes from his party.\n\nDoing so could bolster Republican candidates in the 2022 congressional elections as they try to burnish their credentials as fiscal conservatives \u2013 even though most of them previously supported an array of measures passed during Republican Donald Trump\u2019s administration that jacked up U.S. budget deficits.\n\nDemocrats have adamantly rejected using the reconciliation process, although they have used it to pass some of Biden\u2019s other priorities, saying that in this case it is too unwieldy and would establish a bad precedent.\n\nReferring to the deal providing a debt limit reprieve until December, McConnell said in a Senate speech: \u201cNow there will be no question. They\u2019ll (Democrats) have plenty of time\u201d to pass the next increase using reconciliation.\n\nDemocrats had been trying to pass legislation that would have raised the debt limit through the end of 2022, which Republicans blocked.\n\nWhile the deal relieves debt ceiling pressures for now, it adds to the high-stakes, partisan battles Congress will wage through the end of the year.\n\nDemocrats want to pass two massive spending bills that make up much of Biden\u2019s domestic agenda in the coming weeks, including a multi-trillion-dollar social policy package to be passed by reconciliation and a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill.\n\nBut by late November, their attention will have to return to funding the government and again avoiding the debt ceiling.",

It is the highest quarterly profit since the third quarter of 2018.\n\n\u201cThe mobile business\u2019 operating margin might have been lower than the market expected,\u201d said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. \u201cWe will have to see marketing costs and what the mix of products Samsung sold was like.\u201d\n\nRising memory chip prices and shipments, plus a jump in profitability at Samsung\u2019s chip contract manufacturing business, likely raised the chip division\u2019s operating profit by about 79% from a year earlier, analysts said.\n\nSemiconductors accounted for about half of Samsung\u2019s operating profit in the first half of the year.\n\nSamsung shares pared early gains to be up 0.4% in afternoon trade. It is due to announce detailed earnings later this month.\n\nThe stock has fallen about 12% so far this year versus a 3% rise in the wider market (.KS11), hurt by losses in September when U.S. peer Micron Technology Inc (MU.O)said its memory chip shipments would slip in the near term.\n\nAnalysts said prices for memory chips are expected to tumble this quarter as demand for personal computers drops amid an expected easing in global lockdowns that have helped power sales, while smartphone shipments may also decline.\n\nA bright spot next year is expected to be Samsung\u2019s chip contract manufacturing business, which on Thursday announced plans to start producing cutting-edge, 3-nanometre chip designs in the first half of 2022, as it races against industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd to preempt advanced technology and win clients.\n\nFor Samsung\u2019s mobile business, estimated sales of 2 million new foldable smartphones within a month showed demand for its foldable handsets captured more of the mass market than last year, analysts said.\n\nHowever, this was likely offset by marketing costs and higher component costs due to the global chip shortage.\n\nSamsung\u2019s display unit likely saw solid results as key customer Apple Inc ramped up orders before its late-September launch of the iPhone 13 series, analysts said.\n\nOverall revenue likely rose about 9% from the same period a year earlier to a record 73 trillion won, Samsung said in a filing.",
