          "title": "A\u2019Ibom 2023: The search for the people\u2019s Governor",
          "text": "By Daniel Okwara\n\nBeing energetic, visionary, well educated, experienced, possessing leadership skills, and a genuine love for community service should ordinarily form some of the basic qualifications for leadership even in the political space.\n\nHowever, as Akwa Ibomites prepares for the 2023 governorship elections, the criteria for the search and selection of the next state chief executive and a good leader is not just about these qualities. Other criteria such as the nature, quality, and background of aspirants that have so far indicated interest has divided the aspirants and direction of the contest to be between what could be called \u2018just arrived\u2019 (in politics) International business moguls, against \u2018homegrown grassroots politicians\u2019. Names like Mr. Udom Inoyo who just retired from ExxonMobil where he worked for over three decades rising to become Vice Chairman in Nigeria; Mr. Akan Udofia, MD/CEO of Decision Engineering Limited and a Forbes recognized billionaire business mogul in the oil and gas sector and, Pastor Umo Enoh, multi-billionaire businessman in the hospitality and oil and gas sector represent those who have just arrived the political scene with a desire to become the next Governor of Akwa Ibom state. These men are struggling for space against the likes of Obong Bassey Albert, serving two-term Senator, who has been in the Akwa Ibom political scene for nearly 20years, the same as Barr. Onofiok Akpan Luke (G.O.A.O.L.) currently a House of Representatives member who is one of the youngest in the race but has one of the highest followership in the state due to his deep grassroots activities and the natural admiration by people of the state for him over time. He\u2019s the immediate past Speaker of the state House of Assembly who has also held many other political positions. Then Rt. Hon. Michael Eyong another House of Reps member, amongst others.\n\nThe state Governor himself, Mr. Udom Emmanuel sparked the \u201cInternational Email versus Grassroots Politician\u201d controversy when in one of his speeches he openly said that \u201c\u2026we need a governor with an internationally recognized email\u201d and not a mere crowd puller who shares money on the street or go on long convoys.\n\nHowever, the people are not interested in the controversies, they are only interested in good leadership and this time it seems a man of the people is needed because Gov. Udom Emmanuel is a man with the internationally recognized email and having led the state for 6year now, the people want something different, after all, variety is the spice of life.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe question is, between a person who is just arriving after spending three decades working from the 27th floor of an international firm somewhere in Lekki/Victoria Island in Lagos or New York in America, far away from penury, poverty, and other challenges of the people he seeks to govern, and a person who has spent decades trekking, toiling in the political scene, participating in community development and cutting his or her teeth in political leadership and its peculiarities in Nigeria, who is likely to make a good political leader?\n\nThe argument cannot be limited to Nigeria, it must be taken international; we could begin with the 44th President of America, Mr. Barrack Obama.\n\nObama\u2019s performance during his stay in office has remained yet unrivaled as he has been adjudged one of the best Presidents America ever had because according to celebrity TV host, Christine Amanpour \u2018President Barrack Obama has been involved in American politics long enough to know exactly what Americans want and this has made it easy for his administration to be very direct in their approach to solving America\u2019s problems\u201d.\n\nAs preparations for 2023 governorship elections gather steam in Akwa Ibom State, the appealing story of Barrack Obama\u2019s gradual rise from obscurity to leadership through the road of community service, grassroots engagements, and superlative legislative activities in America\u2019s senate has found expression in some political leaders in Akwa Ibom whose sojourn both in life and public service shows striking a resemblance of Obama\u2019s odysseys.\n\nFor example, at the height of the Covid-19 lockdown across the world, and its attendant economic and social challenges, Rt. Hon. Barr. Onofiok Akpan Luke (G.O.A.L.) was the first public servant in Akwa Ibom state to dole out palliatives in cash and in materials to the people. On the fateful day, he gave out 15million naira in cash to his constituents in addition to truck loads of food items. He did this even before the Government conceived the idea of giving out subsidies to citizens. Such a demonstration speaks volumes of a leader who understands the challenges of his people and is passionate enough to proactively move to action. Such are pointers that a Governor of such disposition might not be comfortable to owe government workers backlog of entitlements whether salaries, pension or gratuity.\n\nAlso, ahead of his contributions to the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB) in the National Assembly, G.O.A.L, as he\u2019s fondly referred to, held a town hall meeting where hundreds of copies of the bill was circulated to his constituents to make their contributions, before he eventually collated same to enrich his presentation on the floor of the House. Such legislative engagement is hardly heard of in this clime. This is a clear demonstration of respect for the people\u2019s opinion and a listening mindset.\n\nAhead of the 2019 polls, an election where the ruling PDP faced a stiff political onslaught, Onofiok Luke, as the Speaker of the House of Assembly then, he was at the forefront, confronting the opposition and standing by the state Governor to ensure victory for \u201cTHE PEOPLE\u201d. At all times, he has proven that he understands the yearnings the PEOPLE and that to act in the interest of the people is paramount to him. At the National Assembly, he has accurately separated politics from governance, a development that has seen him always networking with the who-is-who in the country, irrespective of political leanings, working for the benefit of the PEOPLE.\n\nIf it is true as said by many that Akwa Ibom now needs a Governor of the people, a man who truly knows what the people need, a person whose love for the people has been tested and tried and has been found to genuinely make himself available to many Akwa Ibomites both in times of joy and in times of sadness, even in times of \u2018political wars\u2019 then Barr. Onofiok Luke has everything it takes to be the next Governor of Akwa Abasi Ibom state.\n\nAs against the new narrative making the rounds that Akwa Ibom State needs a Governor with an \u2018internationally recognized email\u2019, there is absolutely no good records that people who have been very far from their people in search of greener pastures (which by the way is a noble venture) make better leaders to their people than those who had been with the people, shared the little they had with the people, had firsthand experience of the situation on the ground and advocated at various times for them, as well as share in their challenges.\n\nPresident Emanuel Macron of France had no companies and no internationally recognized emails, same as Joe Biden of America. In fact, it is easier to link experience in public service to good political leadership than it is to link experience in the very conservative and rigid private business world to good political leadership.\n\nDown here in Nigeria, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State is currently one of the most celebrated Governors in Nigeria. He seems to have mounted the saddle fully prepared to tackle the problems of Rivers people which was poor road network and endless traffic in the capital city. Today Wike is celebrated for solving the problems of his people. He is not an internationally recognized businessman; he only practiced law very briefly and later joined public service at a very young age. He was an elected Local Government Chairman of Obio/Akpor LGA between 1999 and 2007, from there he became Chief of Staff to Governor Rotimi Amaechi, in 2011 he was appointed Minister of State for Education, a position he held until he resigned to contest and win the Governorship seat in Rivers State. Wike is on his way to becoming the most celebrated Governor in Rivers State history because he has taken infrastructural development to the deepest parts of the creeks in Rivers State and built over seven flyovers to solve traffic congestion in the capital city. Unlike many Governors, he agrees to autonomy for the Judiciary and Local Government Councils.\n\nGovernor Wike\u2019s toughness and outspokenness in defense of his people cannot also be in isolation of the fact that the Nigerian and Rivers state political terrain is very familiar to him unlike some of his colleagues.\n\nLagos state is sort of the cradle of political and economic development in Nigeria currently, a deeper look at Lagos state politics will easily reveal that they have never had a Governor since 1999 who has not grown organically on the political turf, from Alhaji Bola Ahmed Tinubu to Mr. Sanwolu. Such development has witnessed the recurring election of former politically experienced individuals as Governors. The result is glaring, Lagos people enjoy a progression of political and economic development.\n\nNotably, the American people refused to allow former President Donald Trump, a man with \u2018internationally recognised email\u2019 and business mogul to win a second term in office. That should be a pointer to the fact that the majority of the American people were not satisfied with his performance. Political leadership at the level of Governor or President requires some experience in public service, as against total inexperience. Donald Trump was clearly a visitor to political leadership and public service and it was evident in his actions, he made more enemies for America than friends.\n\nThe likes of current American President, Joe Biden, the Canadian Prime Minister, and former President Bill Clinton are people that had no other economic addresses away from politics. They are respected world leaders because they gave their people quality services.\n\nBack to Akwa Ibom, the people need a man who understands the necessity of funding the grassroots systems in order to spread the wealth and economic development, and ameliorate the current groaning in the state. Not a man who will look down on the majority of the people because of a feeling of superiority to or thinking \u2018I\u2019m better than them\u2019.\n\nThe people must not be made to feel privileged to be led by a particular governor; rather public service is always a privilege to the public servant.\n\nOnofiok Luke, like Barrack Obama, is without international business concerns but rich with the currency of relationship and proven passion for service with sterling results to show. He is highly experienced and has the largest following amongst politicians in the state due to his empathetic spirit, interactions and connections with the people over time.\n\nFrom being a Student Union leader to Personal Assistant to the Governor, House of Assembly member, Speaker, House of Assembly, and now one of the most outspoken members in the National Assembly. He is a fellow of Harvard school of leadership. A school attended by most men of global relevance. Due to his diligence he was spotted, selected and fully sponsored by the American government to be a part of the International Visitors Leadership Program in the USA.\n\nThere is no way such curriculum vitae in public service can be put away because if we substitute government to International oil firm, for example, there is no way a job seeker rich in experience of serving in different cadre in the same industry would be denied a top management job in favour of another with zero experience in the sector.\n\nCome 2023, Akwa Ibom people know what they want, and from the mood in the state, it is crystal clear that the people will be firm on their demand to be governed by a man with a deep passion for the welfare of the people as against any aspirant who wants to take the governorship seat as his retirement benefit from the private sector, and would need up to 3years to learn the modus operandi of this particular terrain or to understand the real need of the people.\n\nOkwara, a political communications strategist, writes from Uyo.",

          "title": "Prophet TB Joshua\u2019s successor yet unknown \u2013 SCOAN",
          "text": "By Job Osazuwa and Vera Bassey\n\nThe Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) has said successor of its late founder, Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua, popularly known as TB Joshua has not been determined.\n\nThe cleric died on June 5 after he had preached in one of the church\u2019s programmes.\n\nAt a briefing, yesterday, at the church\u2019s headquarters in Lagos, the church announced that activities lined up for the burial ceremony would last for one week, beginning from July 5 to July 11, even as it stressed that the COVID-19 safety protocols, as laid down by government, would be strictly adhered to.\n\nReacting to questions from journalists, Gary Tonge, who spoke on behalf of the church, said an announcement would be made on who steps into the shoes of TB Joshua in due course. He said finding his successor was not an administrative issue, but a decision that would be taken through the leading of the Holy Spirit. He also assured that the founder\u2019s philanthropic gesture for the less-privilege would be sustained by the church.\n\nSaid Tonge: \u201cHis supernatural call home was met with an outpouring of millions of testimonies and tributes from 195 countries \u2013 representing every tribe, every tongue and every nation on the face of the earth. In Prophet TB Joshua\u2019s own words, \u2018The beauty of our achievement is when we longer live and our achievement is still there, continuing to linger on in the eyes and ears of children yet unborn.\n\n\u201cWe wish to inform you that July 5 to July 11 is dedicated to a series of laying-to-rest activities tagged \u2018Celebrating the life and legacy of Prophet TB Joshua (1963-2021) \u2013 not mine but God\u2019s own.

          "title": "How Interpol nabbed IPOB leader in Europe",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Godwin Tsa, Abuja, Okey Sampson, Umuahia, Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri, Mokwugwo Solomon, Nnewi, Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nA few hours after leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu reappeared before a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, presided over by Justice Binta Nyako, yesterday, the Federal Government has disclosed that he was intercepted and arrested through collaborative efforts of Nigerian intelligence and security services.\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice (AGF), Abubakar Malami, who briefed the media in company of the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba Ahmed, however, declined to disclose where he was nabbed.\n\nBut contrary to wild speculation that the IPOB leader was arrested in the United Kingdom, Daily Sun gathered that his interception took place in Czech Republic.\n\nA privileged source disclosed that the IPOB leader had travelled from England to Singapore for undisclosed reasons before heading to Czech Republic last Friday. The unconfirmed source said with the tip off from the Czech Republic officials to Nigerian government, Kanu was arrested in Prague.\n\nAccording to Malami: \u201cSelf-acclaimed leader of the proscribed secessionist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Kanu, has been intercepted through the collaborative efforts of Nigerian intelligence and Security Services.\n\n\u201cHe has been brought back to Nigeria, in order to continue facing trial after disappearing, while on bail regarding 12 count charge against him.\n\n\u201cRecent steps taken by the Federal Government saw to the interception of the fugitive Kanu on Sunday the 27th day of June 2021.\n\n\u201cNwannekaenyi Nnamdi Ngozichukwu Okwu-Kanu, born 25th September, 1967 at Afaraukwu, Abia state Nigeria, is a holder of Nigerian Passport No A05136827, first issued 17th October, 2013, at FESTAC, Lagos,\n\n\u201cIt is recalled that Kanu was arrested on 14th October 2015 on 11 count charge bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms, improper importation of goods, among others.\n\n\u201cA judge at the Federal Hgh Court, Abuja on 28th March, 2019, revoked Kanu\u2019s bail that was granted him on health ground and issued a bench warrant for his arrest on the same date, over his failure to appear in court for hearing.\n\n\u201cHe has, upon jumping bail, been accused of engaging in subversive activities that include inciting violence through television, radio and online broadcasts against the Nigerian state and institutions,\n\n\u201cKanu was also accused of instigating violence especially in south-eastern Nigeria that resulted in the loss of lives and property of civilians, military, paramilitary, police forces and destruction of civil institutions and symbols of authorities.\u201d\n\nKanu was hitherto facing five-count treasonable felony charge alongside the four other defendants \u2013 Bright Chimezie, Chidiebere Onwudiwe, Benjamin Madubugwu and David Nwawuisi.\n\nThe court had since separated Kanu\u2019s trial from that of his co-defendants.\n\n\u2022I jumped bail to save my life\n\nKanu was admitted to bail in April 2017 for health reasons but skipped his bail after reportedly flouting all the conditions given to him by the court.\n\nSpeaking from the dock, yesterday, he said he decided to go underground to preserve his life which he said, was in danger, following the invasion of his residence in Abia State by soldiers.\n\nHe told the court that his house was unlawfully invaded by security men. The self-acclaimed Biafran leader alleged that he would have been killed along with others on the day of the invasion if not for the wisdom he applied to jump out of the country.\n\nHis reaction was provoked by the Federal Government\u2019s information through its counsel, Shuaib Labaran that Kanu jumped the bail granted by the court to escape trial by running out of the country.\n\nLabaran had applied to the court for an order to remand Kanu in the custody of the DSS.\n\nThe counsel said the request became imperative because lawyers to Kanu were yet to be abreast of his re-arrest.\n\nJustice Nyako granted the request and ordered that Kanu be remanded in the custody of DSS till July 26 for the continuation of his trial.\n\nAlthough the continuation of trial was originally slated for October 20, it was brought downward to July 26 for his lawyers to appear for his defence.\n\n\u2022Family, lawyer react\n\nHis family has warned the Federal Government to be careful what they do with him\n\nSpeaking with Daily Sun at their home in Afara Ukwu, Umuahia, Abia State, his younger brother, Prince Emmanuel, who said he heard about the arrest yesterday, said the world was watching.\n\nEmmanuel said he had no doubt his brother\u2019s arrest would be for the good of IPOB and the agitation for Biafra.\n\n\u201cHis arrest will not in anyway jeopardise the agitation because when Jesus Christ came to the world and finished his work and left, the gospel of God which he brought, continued to spread to all parts of the world.\u201d\n\nHe urged IPOB members to remain calm as things continue to unfold gradually.\n\nIn his reaction to his arrest and subsequent re-arraignment, IPOB counsel, Aloy Ejimakor said Kanu is innocent until proven otherwise in court.\n\nEjimakor declared that it was one thing to make arrest and another thing to secure conviction.\n\n\u201cHe possess a political opinion which is protected by law and that political opinion is self-determination. It\u2019s protected under Cap A9, Article 20 1&19 of laws of federation of Nigeria. It\u2019s one thing to make an arrest, it\u2019s another thing to succeed in getting a conviction but I have to tell you that since 2015 when this saga of arresting IPOB members and 2017 when they were declared terrorist, there is no court of law in Nigeria that has made a conviction on any IPOB member based on terrorism or secession or whatever. Our contention is that secession is not a criminal offence mentioned anywhere in Nigeria law.\u201d\n\n\u2022Arrest won\u2019t stop Igbo agitation \u2013ADF\n\nThe Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), in a statement wondered why self-determination agitators were being clamped down on while vicious Boko Haram insurgents were pampered by the government.\n\nADF called on Igbo lawyers of whatever persuasions to rise and defend Kanu and uncountable number of Igbo youths being unjustly held in various detention centres in the country.\n\n\u201cThe arrest or elimination of Nnamdi Kanu from the scene of the struggle is most unlikely to result in the smashing of the spirit of the longing for freedom of the Igbo nation or that of other nationalities that are equally struggling to free themselves from the chaotic Nigerian federation. The Igbo nation is meanwhile groaning under the agony of the massive arrests, torture and killing of many Igbo youths by security agents of the Federal Government. One thing is very clear. The Federal Republic of Nigeria is breathing its last. It may well go the way of other federations which were created artificially and held together by the force of arms. We call on the international community not to turn its back on the horrors taking place in Nigeria, especially in Igboland.\u201d\n\n\u2022ACF: Handle him with care\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), in statement by the national publicity secretary, Emmanuel Yawe, called on the Federal Government to handle the case with care because of his international connection.\n\n\u201cGiven the complex international and national issues involved in this case, we call on government to handle the matter with care. The best way out is to keep strictly to the rule of law. Kanu and his collaborators must be made to understand that Nigeria is not a failed state and the rule of law still exists here.\n\n\u201cWe, however, know that the man has no respect for the country called Nigeria and has vowed to destroy the country. Sadly, he enjoys collaboration of some Nigerians who for some reasons want the country destroyed. He also enjoys the support of international arms dealers who know that he has the capacity to cause a war to break out in Africa\u2019s most populous country and biggest economy.\u201d\n\n\u2022Afenifere, MBF, Yakassai speak\n\nPan-Yoruba group, Afenifere, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) and elder statesman, Tanko Yakassai expressed conflicting opinions on the rearrest of Kanu.\n\nWhile Afenifere leader, Pa Ayo Adebanjo and MBF national president, Dr. Bitrus Pogu, described it as a fate awaiting every freedom fighter, Yakassai said government has an obligation to defend the constitution and anybody taking up arms to cause disunity should be dealt with according to the law.\n\nAdebanjo said: \u201cAnybody leading an agitation like Nnamdi Kanu is doing should expect similar treatment. I recall that Chief Obafemi Awolowo and myself were arrested during our days of agitation. Anybody who wants to agitate has the right to do so, but such agitation must be done peacefully without violence. However, the Federal Government must toe the line of the rule of law.\u201d\n\nDr. Pogu agreed that arrest is common with freedom fighters.\n\n\u201cNelson Mandela and many others were once arrested but later released. Kanu can be a hero tomorrow, you never can tell. But I don\u2019t know why he fell for that trap. I feel that he should have been smarter than that. However, I just wish that he should be tried according to the law and constitution of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBut for Yakasai: \u201cThis government swore to defend the constitution and territorial integrity of the country and anybody who carries arms to cause disunity in Nigeria should be dealt with according to the law.\u201d\n\n\u2022Arrest may spark protests \u2013INC, COSEYL\n\nThe Igbo National Council (INC) has warned that the arrest and detention are capable of heightening tension in view of the fragile state of the Nigeria State.\n\nAccording to its National President, Chilos Godsent, the arrest may trigger heavy protest in many parts of Nigeria if care is not taken in handling the case.\n\nIn its submission, the Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL) urged the Federal Government to arrest leaders of the Miyetti Allah for their unbridled utterances and encouragement of its members to \u201ckill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough we do not speak for IPOB, it is the right of anyone or group of persons to demand for freedom or to go his or her separate way if he feels that his well-being is not guaranteed. Nnamdi Kanu and his group have the right to demand for whatever thing they deserve because it is their fundamental human right,\u201d the group said.\n\nIt claimed that the arrest of Kanu is to prepare grounds for the massacre of Igbo.\n\n\u2022Arrest\u2019ll not affect Biafra agitation\n\n\u2013Northern group\n\nThe Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) cautioned that nobody should make the mistake of assuming that the arrest would end the Biafra agitation as a referendum was pertinent.\n\n\u201cWe stand our ground that a referendum must be held to determine this and all other agitations for self-determination from any part of the country,\u201d CNG spokesman, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said in a statement.\n\n\u2022FG should be cautious \u2013Mbazulike Amechi\n\nElder statesman and second republic minister, Mbazulike Amechi, said government must accord Kanu fair hearing.\n\nIn a telephone chat with Daily Sun, he said the separatist campaigner should be assumed innocent until he is found guilty by court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cMy advice is that the Federal authorities should be cautious the way they handle Nnamdi Kanu and the way they handle his case. First, they should not detain him unnecessarily. They should take him to court, present his case, and if found guilty, the law will spell out what to do with him.\n\n\u201cBut the authorities must not harm him or detain him perpetually in their cell because, he is a human being. He must be allowed to get a lawyer to defend himself,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Thousands of Lagosians who would have lost their sight as a result of inadequate awareness and lack of financial means benefitted from this very laudable programme.\u201d\n\nHe said the re-launch of the initiative was in celebration of one of the many legacy grassroots outreach programmes of Tinubu\u2019s administration, and also a clear testament of the determination of the present administration to prioritise all aspects of healthcare delivery.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to announce that our administration has taken a step further with the Jigi-Bola initiative by broadening its scope to include a hearing aid programme, which will cater to the needs of Lagosians with hearing difficulty through the provision of hearing aids and other medical support,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the governor, a huge number of residents were already benefitting from the initiative, adding that 250,000 Lagosians have been listed to benefit at the end of the programme across the 57 councils in the state.\n\n\u201cWe understand that vision and hearing impairments can make life difficult but could be prevented with early care and intervention.

He said those defecting from PDP after riding on the back of the party to power, have proven that they are treacherous.\n\n\u201cPeople who could not win ordinary election, the party used technicality, went to court and got victory for them. Now, they say they are leaving the party; hopeless, shameless human beings, people who have no conscience.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike accused the APC-led government of blackmailing and coercing some PDP governors and members to join the ruling party.\n\nHe reiterated that no amount of blackmailing or intimidation will make him leave the PDP.\n\n\u201cBring everything you have against me, I will not join you. Rivers State will not join you. Even if it is only Rivers State in this country, we will continue to be Peoples Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nThe governor took a swipe at former Director General of Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Dakuku Peterside, for saying the Federal Government paid Rivers State government N78 billion in cash as refund for federal projects done by the state.\n\nHe said the Federal Government merely issued a promissory note, but failed to back it up with cash.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know, Peterside does not understand what they call promissory note. N78 billion was not backed up by cash by the Federal Government. N78 billion was approved by Federal Government, but not in cash. And so, the bank has to come in to take it and discount it, because the Federal Government is going to pay them back in the next four years. What Rivers State government got was N52 billion out of N78 billion. But, in principle, N78 billion was approved, but was there any cash? No cash to back it up\u201d.\n\nGovernor Wike said it was disingenuous for Peterside, whom he convincingly defeated in 2015 governorship election, to deny his administration\u2019s glaring infrastructural achievements, such as construction of nine flyovers, schools, hospitals, roads, cassava processing factory, among others.\n\nHe disclosed that under the previous administration in which Peterside served as Commissioner for Works, contractors were compelled to pay bribe and ironically starved of funds.\n\nAccording to him, this was why projects like the Rebesi-Trans-Amadi-Elelenwo road awarded to RCC was abandoned by the previous government and he had to complete it. Governor Wike said it was on record that Peterside, who hails from Opobo and was a former Commissioner of Works, failed to complete the Ogoni-Andoni-Opobo Unity road due to his abysmal performance.\n\nHe further challenged Peterside, who was DG of NIMASA, to explain why the cabotage office was relocated from Port Harcourt to Lagos, and to declare what the state benefitted during his reign in NIMASA.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Tells court why he fled\n\nBy Alex Enumah\n\n\n\nAbout three years after jumping bail, the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, was yesterday re-arraigned before Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja, for the continuation of his trial for treasonable felony.\n\nReliable security sources told THISDAY yesterday that Kanu was rearrested in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia by Interpol following an intensive search for him by the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) in collaboration with its foreign counterparts.\n\nAccording to the sources, when, following the storming of his parent\u2019s compound in Afaraukwu, Abia State, by a detachment of soldiers on 14th September 2017, Kanu \u2018disappeared\u2019 virtually into thin air, the federal government felt concerned. Since both, his Nigerian and British passports were still in the custody of the Federal High Court in Abuja, there were strong suspicions that Kanu got the support of the United Kingdom High Commission in Nigeria for his escape. That was later proved to be the case.\n\nA security source, who spoke to THISDAY last night, said the federal government was further incensed when a global human rights agency sent a letter to the Permanent Mission in New York, asking Nigeria to either produce Kanu or explain his whereabouts.\n\n\u201cOnly a few days later, Kanu surfaced in Jerusalem, Israel, with a photograph taken at the \u2018Wailing Wall\u2019 where he granted one of those his stupid interviews,\u201d said the source.\n\nThe security source explained that whereas Kanu breached all the conditions for which he was granted bail by the Federal High Court in Abuja on 29th April 2017, he orchestrated a campaign of calumny against the country.\n\n\u201cFirst, he went into hiding, creating the impression that he was killed by soldiers and when he eventually appeared, he became more emboldened in his criminal activities,\u201d she said.\n\nKanu, according to the security source, was able to travel to many countries around the world because he holds a British passport.\n\n\u201cWith that, he thought he was invincible. From wherever location, he was operating from (and I can tell you that he has not been to the UK in the past two years), he used the power of social media to cause havoc by making incendiary broadcasts,\u201d she said.\n\nWith the money Kanu reportedly garnered through fundraising to \u201cestablish his phantom Biafran Republic\u201d, according to the source, Kanu lived large, and that eventually proved to be his undoing.\n\n\u201cWhat he did not know was that the security agencies were on his trail. His lifestyles consisted mostly of going out with different women, buying expensive pieces of jewelry, chartering aircraft, and drinks. And because he got many gullible people who were donating to his so-called IPOB, he had so much money to play with such that he even hired lobby groups for his propaganda activities,\u201d the security source told THISDAY.\n\nShe explained that the security agencies have intercepts of how Kanu formed the Eastern Security Networks (ESN) and how the members became a terror group as well as his directives to IPOB operatives that bordered on incitement to violence. \u201cWe know those he collaborated with to instigate the killings against the police in the South-east,\u201d said the source who added that it was on Kanu\u2019s instruction that certain prominent politicians from the Southeast should be visited with violence whenever they are sighted abroad.\n\nThe source cited the specific example of former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu.\n\nAfter trailing Kanu for several months and infiltrating his ranks, the security agencies finally pinned him into Addis Ababa where he was arrested by Interpol and then extradited to Abuja last Sunday.\n\nKanu returned yesterday to the court of Justice Nyako that had in late 2017 granted him bail.\n\nThe self-acclaimed leader of IPOB and four others were arraigned before the Federal High Court on a six-count criminal charge bordering on a treasonable felony in June 2016.\n\nThough they pleaded not guilty to the charge, different judges, including Justice Nyako, who heard the case denied their bail.\n\nHowever, Justice Nyako soft-pedaled following Kanu\u2019s deteriorating health and admitted him to bail to enable him to access quality medical care.\n\nThe court, on April 25, 2017, had admitted him to bail in the sum of N100 million and three sureties in like sum, one of whom must be a serving senator. This made Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe stand in for him.\n\nHowever, Kanu\u2019s bail was revoked in March 2019 and a bench warrant for his arrest issued in November 2019, following his long absence in court for his trial.\n\nThe court also separated the trial of Kanu from five others earlier arraigned with him to pave the way for the continuation of their trial.\n\nBut with his arrest and extradition, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, earlier announced yesterday, Kanu was brought before Justice Nyako by personnel of the Department of State Services (DSS), to continue his trial.\n\nThe Federal High Court complex in Abuja was completely taken over by a contingent of policemen to prevent a possible security breach by Kanu\u2019s supporters.\n\nFew minutes to his entering the dock, Malami, at an emergency press briefing, told judicial correspondents that Kanu was intercepted by security agents and was being taken to court for continuation of his trial.\n\nMalami, who was flanked by the Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Alkali Usman; police spokesman, Mr. Frank Mba, and his DSS counterpart, Dr. Peter Afunanya, was silent on where Kanu was arrested.\n\nHe said: \u201cSelf-acclaimed leader of the proscribed secessionist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has been arrested through the collaborative efforts of Nigerian intelligence and security services.\n\n\u201cHe has been brought back to Nigeria in order to continue facing trial after disappearing while on bail regarding 11- count charge against him.\n\n\u201cRecent steps taken by the federal government saw to the interception of the fugitive Kanu on Sunday, the 27th day of June 2021.\n\n\u201cNwannekaenyi Nnamdi Ngozichukwu Okwu-Kanu, born 25th day of September 1967 at Afaraukwu, Abia State, is a holder of Nigerian Passport No. A05136827 first issued on 17th October 2013 at FESTAC, Lagos.\u201d\n\nMalami added that Kanu was arrested on October 14, 2015, on an 11-count charge bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms and improper importation of goods, among others.\n\nMalami added that Kanu, upon jumping bail, engaged in subversive activities that include inciting violence through television, radio, and online broadcasts against Nigeria and its institutions.\n\n\u201cKanu was also accused of instigating violence, especially in the South-eastern Nigeria that resulted in the loss of lives and property of civilians, military, paramilitary, police forces and destruction of civil institutions and symbols of authorities.\u201d\n\nHowever, following his appearance in court, Justice Nyako ordered Kanu to be remanded in the custody of the DSS.\n\nThe remand order was sequel to an application by the federal government\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Shuaibu Labaran.\n\nRuling on the remand application, Justice Nyako held that the prosecution should inform Kanu\u2019s lawyer of his re-arrest and remand in the custody of the DSS, as well as the next, adjourned date.\n\nThe judge subsequently adjourned till July 26 for the continuation of the trial.\n\nTells Court Why He Fled\n\nMeanwhile, Kanu has rationalised his jumping bail, saying he abandoned his trial and escaped out of the country in 2017 following a threat to his life.\n\nHe sought the permission of the court to speak, shortly after he re-arraigned.\n\nThough he did not have any legal representation, Kanu, who was dressed in a black tracksuit, looked healthy and unruffled.\n\nHe explained that he did not deliberately abscond from the court to avoid trial.\n\nHe said his disappearance was due to the unlawful invasion of his house by security agents, in an operation, he said resulted in the death of many innocent people.\n\nHe added that he went underground to avoid being killed.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy lord, my house was invaded and people were killed. I would have been killed too if I had not hidden myself. That was why I have been unable to attend court.\n\n\u201cI would have been killed the way others were killed when my house was invaded.\u201d\n\nJustice Nyako asked him to get in touch with his lawyer to brief him about all that had transpired in the case in his absence.\n\nKanu\u2019s Family Speaks on Arrest, Warns FG\n\nThe family of Kanu yesterday told the federal government not to maltreat their son.\n\nHis younger brother, Emmanuel, told journalists in Umuahia that Kanu is on the path of truth and has not committed any crime to deserve persecution.\n\nHe said the IPOB leader was only demanding freedom for Biafrans, which is their fundamental human right.\n\nHe warned the federal government to handle their son with caution, adding that the whole world is watching.\n\n\u201cMy brother (Kanu) has awoken the consciousness of Nigerians about the goings-on in the country.\n\n\u201cHe stood for the truth, and heaven is on the part of anyone standing for the truth.

          "text": "Deputy gov: PDP can still retrieve our mandate\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has explained that the impressive performance of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) at all levels of government was responsible for the defection of Zamfara State Governor, Hon. Bello Matawalle from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling APC.\n\nMatawalle yesterday formally announced his defection to the APC.\n\nHowever, the deputy governor of the state, Mr. Mahdi Gusau, who refused to defect with Matawalle, has said the PDP could retrieve its mandate from the governor.\n\nThe National Chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, has, however, said that the party is confident of winning the 2023 general election, despite the defection of some of its governors to the APC.\n\nSpeaking at a rally yesterday in Gusau, Matawalle said that he had been nursing the ambition of leaving his party, PDP, for several reasons.\n\n\u201cI am now the leader of APC in Zamfara State and I am ready to work with each and everyone wishing to contribute to the rapid development of the state,\u201d he said.\n\nThe APC National Caretaker Committee Chairman and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, congratulated Matawalle for defecting to the party.\n\nBuni said Matawalle is now the leader of APC in Zamfara State.\n\nHe also announced that the state APC caretaker committee has been dissolved.\n\n\u201cI also want to bring to your notice that as from today, the APC Caretaker Committees of Zamfara State from the ward to the state level have been dissolved,\u201d Buni said.\n\nAlso speaking at the occasion, former governor of the state, Mr. AbdulAziz Yari welcomed Matawalle to APC, adding that, he was ready to give all necessary support and cooperation for him to succeed.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to bring to the notice of each and every one in Zamfara State that I am not in any way against the defection of Governor Matawalle to our great party.\n\n\u201cI was a governor for two terms; as such, I thank the Almighty Allah for giving me the chance to lead my people for eight years.\u201d\n\nMatawalle joined the APC with all members of the state House of Assembly and National Assembly members except a representative from Anka/Talata-Mafara Federal Constituency and the deputy governor, who remains in the PDP.\n\nThe rally was attended by governors of Kogi, Niger, Katsina, Kaduna, Kano, Borno, Ogun, Jigawa, Plateau, and Kebbi State; Secretary to the Government of Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha; and Minister of Humanitarian Affairs among others.\n\nThe event scheduled for 2 pm, did not start until after 6.30 pm.\n\nIn his swift reaction to the defection, the deputy governor told journalists in Abuja that the PDP should retrieve its mandate from the Zamfara State governor.\n\nHe argued that the Supreme Court judgment was clear, stressing that the mandate belongs to the opposition party.\n\n\u201cJudgment was divine. The Supreme Court said that the APC has no votes because of the quarrel and crisis in the party and said that the party that came second should assume office as the governor. So, this is divine; if the PDP desires to reclaim its stolen mandate, the party is free. For me, I will not defect and will continue as the deputy governor and do the job for which I am elected\u201d\n\nThe deputy governor also stated that nobody will sack him from office as the deputy governor as he has not committed any offence that could warrant his removal.\n\n\u201cI am not involved in contracts and any financial dealings as a deputy governor. I am free and I have not committed any impeachable offence.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis is not the first time that a governor will defect without his deputy. It happened when Wamakko defected to the APC and his deputy, Muktar Shagari, remained a member of the PDP.\u201d\n\nAlso, reacting to the defection, the president, in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, congratulated Matawalle on his defection from the PDP to the APC, saying the ruling party \u201cis becoming more popular because of its impressive performance record and commitment to good governance.\u201d\n\nIn a message delivered on his behalf at the defection ceremony by the SGF, Mustapha, President Buhari said: \u201cI\u2019m proud of your timely and wise decision to join the governing party and our doors are wide open to other politicians who believe in our vision to rebuild Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYour voluntary decision to join our party confirms the fact that our agenda for good governance is the only reason why Nigerians are getting attracted to the APC because the other alternative didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThe President used the forum to urge APC Governors and elected lawmakers across the country to continue to work harder to ensure the party maintains its popularity and retains power beyond 2023.\n\nHe reminded all elected party officials of the fact that \u201cyour performance at all levels will impact significantly on the fortunes of the party\u201d, adding that \u201cparty leaders should avoid complacency at all times in order to build the APC from strength to strength.\u201d\n\nSecondus: PDP will Still Win Presidential Election, Despite Defections.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Chairman of the PDP, Secondus yesterday said that the party is confident of winning 2023 general election, despite the defection of some of its governors to the APC.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja, Secondus also accused the APC governors who gathered in Gusau, Zamfara State to celebrate the defection of Matawalle, of celebrating bloodshed of innocent Nigerians that died in the insurgency in the state.\n\n\u201cThey are going after our governors but we are going after the masses of this country. The governors have one vote but we have the people, the masses, the people who are suffering under this government.\n\n\u201cWe feel the pains of Nigerians who are suffering, those slaughtered like chicken and killed. We have the majority support of the people and will form the next government at the centre,\u201d he reiterated.\n\n\u201cThe masses are solidly behind us, the masses are for the PDP and we stand here to state clearly that we shall form this new government coming in 2023 because of the masses and not because of the governors.\u201d, the national chairman of PDP said.\n\nSecondus acknowledged that the deputy governor, Gusau and eight members of the Zamfara State House of Assembly did not defect with the governor.\n\nSecondus said clearly that the party will challenge the defection of Matawalle in court as there is no provision of independent candidate in the electoral laws.\n\n\u201cI have never seen where you have economic crises, insecurity crises, then the ruling party goes, poaching governors and 18 governors as published on Social Media will be moving, leaving their states to Zamfara, to celebrate the killings of innocent citizens in Zamfara State, the hunger in Zamfara State. This is a shame and it is laughable,\u201d Secondus said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

This report, a copy each, must be made available to each and every senator this Tuesday afternoon. I don\u2019t know how the committee would arrange it, but every senator must have a copy today.\n\n\u201c[And] we would be considering the report on Thursday. So, we have today, tomorrow until the beginning of Thursday to look at the report, so that when we consider it, we will be doing so on the basis of what we have been able to read from this very important report.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, the upper legislative chamber\n\napproved N329,963,491,523 billion as budget for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThis was a sequel to the consideration of the report of the Committee on Federal Capital Territory on the FCT Appropriation Bill, 2021.\n\nPresenting the report, Chairman of the Committee, Senator Abubakar Kyari, said from the projected revenue of N329,963,491,523, N74,323,382,813 is for personnel costs; N58,728,614,466 for overheads and N196,911,494,243 for capital projects.\n\nAccording to him, the overall performance of the FCT 2020 Statutory Budget Allocation was 88 percent as of 31st December 2020.\n\nKyari added that most of the projects executed by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) and the Federal Capital Development Administration (FCDA) were still ongoing \u201cdue to overbearing ineptitude of getting the due process certificates on time.\u201d\n\nHe said new and ongoing projects were not sufficiently funded due to delay in the release of funds, occasioned by bureaucratic bottlenecks.\n\nAccording to him, projected revenue accrued to FCT Administration was N30 billion naira, due to additional revenue derived from Additional Statutory Allocation received from the differential distributed from the Excess Crude Account for receipts from January to May 2021, and expected receipts for the remaining seven months of the year and stamp duty refunds.\n\nAccording to him, the Committee on FCT consequently increased the fiscal framework to accommodate revenue receipts from additional statutory allocation and stamp duty fees to bring the total expenditure to N329,963,491,523 billion\n\nKyari to Meet House Today over Reform Bill\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Malam Mele Kyari, will today meet with members of the House of Representatives as part of efforts aimed at ensuring the smooth passage of the PIB 2021.\n\nThe Speaker of the House, Hon.

          "text": "Only 1.3m out of 95.6m numbers authenticated\n\nEmma Okonji\n\nFollowing the slow verification of the National Identification Number (NIN) by the Identity Management Commission (NIMC) the federal government yesterday extended the deadline for NIN-SIM data verification from June 30 to July 26.\n\nYesterday\u2019s extension of the deadline made it the seventh time the federal government would be postponing the deadline, since the beginning of the exercise.\n\nThe federal government has equally increased facilities for the registration of NIN to 5,410 nationwide.\n\nIn a joint statement yesterday by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), and signed by the Director of Public Affairs at NCC, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, and the Head, Corporate Communications at NIMC, Mr. Kayode Adegoke, stated that the decision to extend the deadline was made after a request by stakeholders on the need to consolidate the enrolment and NIN-SIM verification process following the rapid increase in the number of enrolment systems nationwide.\n\nThe federal government, in December 2020, had directed telecoms subscribers to register their NIN and submit same to network operators for verification and linkage with their SIM cards.\n\nHowever, the Joint Implementation Committee (JIC) on harmonisation of National Identification Number (NIN) with Subscriber Identification Module (SIM), otherwise known as NIN-SIM Harmonisation Committee, has rated NIN-SIM verification and integration exercise very low for May .\n\nThe committee\u2019s latest report on NIN submission and verification, covering March to May, which was obtained by THISDY, showed that subscribers have continued to submit their NINs to mobile network operators (MNOs) for verification and linkage to their telephone lines, as directed by the federal government.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that the verification and linkage have been abysmally slow, due to the alleged poor funding of NIMC, the government agency, responsible for NIN enrolment and verification.\n\nAccording to the committee\u2019s report, active telephone lines as of May were 192 million, and a cumulative 95.6 million NIN owners submitted their NIN in the same month. But only 1.3 million NINs were verified and linked during the review period.\n\nA breakdown of the statistics showed that in March, active telephone lines were 196 million, but the number dropped to 192.4 million in April and further dropped to 192.1 million in May 2021. The number of subscribers that submitted their NINs through the networks of MNOs was 90.35 million in March, representing 46 per cent of the total number of subscribers.\n\nThe figure increased to 90.38 million in April, representing 47 per cent and further increased to 95.6 million in May, representing 49.7 per cent.\n\nFrom the total number of NIN submitted, only 588,010, were verified and linked in March 2021, representing 0.6 per cent, only 929,846 were verified and linked in April, representing one per cent, while only 1.3 million NINs were verified and linked in May, representing 1.4 per cent of the total number of submitted NINs.\n\nTotal NIN enrolment by MNOs in March was 210,487 with 123,379 generated NINs.\n\nIn April, it rose to 413,272 NIN enrolments with 234,499 generated NINs. In May, the figure rose again to 530,893 NIN enrolments with 335,193 generated NINs.\n\nBut from March to May, the total NIN enrolments by all NIMC partners, were two million in March, three million in April, and two million in May.\n\nThe total NIN penetration, which is the number of NINs successfully linked, was put at 51 million in March, representing 24.1 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s population of 211.4 million, 54 million in April, representing 25.5 per cent of the population, and 56 million in May, representing 27 per cent of the population.\n\nWhen asked to comment on the low verification figure, both NIMC and NCC declined to comment, but a source close to NIMC said: \u201cThe figures are correct but NIMC cannot comment because NIMC is not involved in NIN-SIM linkage, even though NIMC verifies all registered NINs from its back end server.\u201d\n\nNIMC is of the view that the issue of incomplete and inappropriate SIM registration on the network of MNOs, could be responsible for slow NIN-SIM integration, but the Joint Implementation Committee thinks otherwise, blaming the situation of slow verification on poor funding of NIMC, resulting in the inability of NIMC to implement the recommended Bulk NIN Verification process that would speed up NIN verification and integration.\n\nThe committee said NIN verification and linkage by MNOs remained meagre at 0.6-1.4 per cent from March through May 2021, in comparison to 46-49.7 per cent of the national telecommunications base that submitted NINs over the period.\n\nIt stated that the trend will continue as long as bulk NIN Verification by NIMC is not in place.\n\nThe committee\u2019s report said: \u201cIt is pertinent to mention that Bulk NIN Verification is still at the Proof-of-Concept (POC) stage since January 2021. NIMC needs to confirm a timeline when Bulk NIN Verification will commence. Without this, MNOs will continue to collect submitted NINs from customers but will not be able to verify and link them to customer\u2019s telephone lines, as required, to achieve the stated objectives of the government. Without Bulk NIN Verification, MNOs would have to resort to overnight Batch NIN Verification processing using the Single NIN Verification API or otherwise invite their customers to visit MNO outlets for Individual NIN verification using the same API. NIMC\u2019s systems would become overwhelmed by the millions of requests for overnight Batch NIN Verification processing from all MNOs leading to poor performance outright failure of the processing systems.\u201d\n\nThe committee called on NIMC to take urgent action to rollout Bulk NIN Verification, without which verification of the 95.6m submitted telephone lines, which would continue to grow monthly, cannot happen and government\u2019s directive to verify and link NINs to customer SIMs will not be achieved.\n\nThe Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, had in December 2020, issued a directive through NCC, for all telecoms subscribers to register their NIN and submit same for to their network operators for verification and linkage.\n\nThe initial directive had two weeks window to complete the NIN registration and verification, with a threat to deactivate the SIM of any subscriber who failed to comply within the stipulated period.\n\nThe deadline was later extended and since then, government has continued to extend it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "NNPC to Borrow $3.8bn to Acquire Dangote Refinery Shares",
          "text": "\u00b7 Says no petrol price increase in next two months\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is planning to borrow $3.8 billion to actualise its agenda of acquiring a 20 per cent stake in Dangote Refinery.\n\nNNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, said yesterday that the money would be borrowed from financial institutions.\n\nHe said some financial institutions had already agreed to fund the acquisition, while the debts would be paid back from the NNPC\u2019s earnings from dividends and profits accruing from its investment in the fuel plant.\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day refinery, located in Lagos State, which Kyari said had been tentatively valued at about $19 billion, is expected to come on stream in 2022 and will produce 50 million litres of petrol per day.\n\nKyari spoke just as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Secretary-General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, expressed optimism over the overall conditions of the oil market as the cartel and its allies yesterday began a meeting to herald a resolution on whether to further ease crude oil production curbs.\n\nAccording to Kyari, there is no underhand dealings concerning the extant transaction, as the federal government\u2019s presence on the board of the Dangote Refinery will not only secure its energy needs, but give it a strong voice in the running of the asset to guarantee the country\u2019s security.\n\nKyari, in two separate interviews with two television stations, which THISDAY monitored in Abuja, stated that all the borrowing institutions, including Afrexim Bank, are comfortable with the deal, adding that the federal government will not invest a dime in the deal.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not sure Mr (Aliko) Dangote wants to sell his equity in the refinery. I can confirm that it was at our instance that we started this engagement and he did not want to sell these shares.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no resource-dependent country in the world that will watch a business of this scale, bordering on energy security which also has implications for even physical security of our country, and you watch it and you don\u2019t have a say.\n\n\u201cWe started this process long before Dangote started his refinery project. We are going to take equities in very significant businesses anchored on the oil and gas operations, for example, fertiliser plants, methanol plants, small condensate refineries and so many other businesses that we are dealing with, so that we can expand our portfolio.\u201d\n\nKyari added that the NNPC has a responsibility to ensure a constant flow of fuel, and as a policy, it will continue to acquire stakes in any refinery in excess of 50,000 barrels per day.\n\n\u201cEven for this Dangote Refinery, we are not going to take government money to buy it. That is the mistake that people are making because they think that we are going to take federation money to pay for these refineries.\n\n\u201cWe are going to borrow on the back of the cash flow from this business because we know that it is viable and it will work and return dividends and it has a cash flow that is sustainable,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari also reiterated that work had begun on the Port Harcourt refinery rehabilitation, while the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts for Warri and Kaduna will be awarded in July.\n\nAccording to him, the net effect is to have an environment where Nigeria becomes the hub for petroleum products supply to change the current dynamics of petrol supply even globally, where the inflow of products from Europe will be reversed.\n\n\u201cWe will award the EPC contract for the Warri and Kaduna refineries within the next two to three weeks, maximum by the end of July, so that these two processes will run concurrently, so that at the end of the day we will have all the refineries working,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari stated that with the current arrangement, petrol will be delivered commercially, adding that part of the requirements of the lenders is that NNPC must not operate the refineries.\n\n\u201cWe must have an operation and maintenance contractor. That means that practically, these refineries will be run by the lenders and the cash flow will be able to support the payments because the bankers have seen that the cash flow will support it,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that five similar initiatives were currently in the offing, of which decisions will be taken within three months, with about 200,000 barrels per day combined capacity of condensates.\n\nKyari said: \u201cWe have signed term sheets with the owners of the refineries. I am not sure Dangote will be very happy with this. We are taking 20 per cent equity of the Dangote Refinery. There\u2019s a valuation process because this business is very regulated and very international. No bank will lend money to you to buy equity in any business of this scale if you have not followed the best valuation process.\n\n\u201cThe reality today is that we have a valuation of this refinery. I am not sure, but it\u2019s about ($)19 billion. I do not have an exact figure. We haven\u2019t closed on this, there\u2019s an ongoing engagement. There\u2019s governance around this that we need to conclude and that includes seeking the authority of the Federal Executive Council.\u201d\n\nHe said discussions on acquiring a stake in the refinery started as far back as December 2020, adding that no bank with have anything to do with an asset that is over-valued, because they know that costs won\u2019t be recovered.\n\nKyari assured the public of openness on NNPC\u2019s relationship with the Dangote Refinery, adding that while crude oil will be sold to the company in naira, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will sort out at what value it will come.\n\nHe said the Dangote Refinery would take off spending of freight of about N21, ensure proximity to supply where it can reach anywhere within the country in one day, while dividends will be shared to Nigerians, who are the owners of the corporation.\n\nOn the landing price of petrol, he stated that as of two days ago, it was N256 per litre but added that pump price of fuel will not be increased in the next two months as engagement with the organised labour has not been concluded.\n\nHe said while the subsidy regime wasn\u2019t sustainable, President Muhammadu Buhari was not also keen on taking the product out of the reach of Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the president had directed that current volumes which are unaccounted for must be contained to bring down spending on subsidy.\n\nKyari explained that while there\u2019s an expectation in the Appropriation Act that NNPC will make a monthly remittance of at least N120 billion, only one leg of the NNPC\u2019s funding of the Federation Account has been affected by its non-remittance of funds, like royalties and taxes are still being generated.\n\nHe stated that discussions were being rounded off on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), to see that the passage of the legislation is done within the next two weeks.\n\nBarkindo Optimistic as OPEC+ Decides on Production Easing\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Secretary-General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, expressed optimism over the overall conditions of the oil market as the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) of the cartel and OPEC allies yesterday began a meeting to herald a resolution on whether to further ease crude oil production curbs.\n\nOPEC stated that the fundamentals have significantly improved in recent months, a hint that a resolution to allow member countries pump more oil may be in the offing tomorrow during the OPEC+ ministerial meeting.\n\n\u201cThe overall brighter picture in relation to the pandemic recovery efforts has led to the significantly improved oil market conditions and prospects for future growth,\u201d Barkindo said at the JTC conference.\n\nThe 53rd meeting of the body, which held via videoconference to review the latest oil market developments and discuss future prospects, was convened in preparation for the 31st meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) and the 18th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting planned for between today and tomorrow.\n\nBarkindo underscored the vital role carried out by the JTC in providing high-quality technical analyses of the latest oil market developments, adding that the research and assessments conducted by the committee will serve as a crucial input to the decision-making process of the cartel.\n\nHe stated that the discussions will build on the successful deliberations of the last meeting and lauded the unwavering commitment and tireless efforts demonstrated by the participating countries.\n\n\u201cThe Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) participants clearly continue to play an important and valuable role in accelerating the oil market rebalancing process,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn the last edition of the OPEC\u2019s Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), OPEC projected global oil demand to rise by six million barrels per day in 2021, while world economic growth was forecast at a rate of 5.5 per cent in the same period.\n\nUsually, the DoC ministerial meetings are supported by the JMMC, which is tasked to analyse oil market developments, monitor the conformity of the DoC voluntary production adjustments and recommend further actions.\n\n\u201cA combination of improving market indicators and the ongoing commitment of DoC countries to restore stability to the global oil market suggests that we are on the right path to recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, despite lingering uncertainties,\u201d Barkindo added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "At least 30 students have been suspended by the management of the Borno State College of Nursing and Midwifery for refusing to welcome President Muhammadu Buhari when he visited the state on June 17.\n\nA letter of suspension from the college to one of the students obtained by SaharaReporters showed that they were suspended for one week from June 21 to June 28 over the action.\n\nThe letter reads, \u201cYou are hereby suspended from the college for one week with effect from today 21st June 2021 for disobedience of executive order to welcome the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, GCON (on the 17th of June 2021).\n\n\u201cYou are expected to report back to college on the 28th of June 2021 along with your parent or guardian.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters, a staff member of the school said about 30 students were affected.\n\n\u201cThirty of the students were suspended, not one. I don\u2019t know when it now became compulsory to go and greet the President in the sun. Even we staff members were forced to go and welcome him,\u201d he said.\n\nSaharaReporters had on June 17 reported that the state governor, Babagana Zulum, paid N350 million to mobilise the crowd for the visit of Buhari to the state.\n\nIt had been exposed that the governor considered the spending necessary to ensure that the Nigerian leader was not booed during his official visit to the state on Thursday.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that there were fears ahead of the President's visit that he would be greeted by protesters or booed because of the insecurity in the state.\n\n\"It cost Zulum N350 million to mobilise the crowd they touted as Buhari's supporters,\" a source in Borno State government had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\"When President Buhari visited Lagos last week, they had to fly him over the city in a chopper because of a hostile crowd,\" another source had added.\n\nGovernor Zulum had earlier urged residents to show appreciation to President Buhari during his visit.\n\nThe governor in a statewide broadcast on Tuesday gave reasons the people of the state should honour the President when he arrived in Maiduguri.\n\nBorno is the epicentre of insurgency war in Nigeria.\n\nThe state has been at the end of incessant deadly attacks by terrorist groups\u2013Boko Haram and the Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP), and many residents have grown frustrated with the Buhari government.\n\nAhead of his election in 2015, Buhari promised to defeat Boko Haram but six years into his government, that promise has not been fulfilled.\n\nIn February 2020, residents of the state booed the President as his convoy drove in and when it was leaving Maiduguri, Borno State, during a condolence visit.\n\nThe residents were heard shouting in Hausa \u201cBama so, ka samu a kunya.\u201d Meaning \u201cWe don\u2019t want you, because you have disappointed us.\u201d\n\nBuhari, during his recent visit to Borno, however, said he was committed to serving Nigerians as a result of the love shown to him.",

          "text": "At least 30 students have been suspended by the management of the Borno State College of Nursing and Midwifery for refusing to welcome President Muhammadu Buhari when he visited the state on June 17.\n\nA letter of suspension from the college to one of the students obtained by SaharaReporters showed that they were suspended for one week from June 21 to June 28 over the action.\n\nThe letter reads, \u201cYou are hereby suspended from the college for one week with effect from today 21st June 2021 for disobedience of executive order to welcome the President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, GCON (on the 17th of June 2021).\n\n\u201cYou are expected to report back to college on the 28th of June 2021 along with your parent or guardian.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters, a staff member of the school said about 30 students were affected.\n\n\u201cThirty of the students were suspended, not one. I don\u2019t know when it now became compulsory to go and greet the President in the sun. Even we staff members were forced to go and welcome him,\u201d he said.\n\nSaharaReporters had on June 17 reported that the state governor, Babagana Zulum, paid N350 million to mobilise the crowd for the visit of Buhari to the state.\n\nIt had been exposed that the governor considered the spending necessary to ensure that the Nigerian leader was not booed during his official visit to the state on Thursday.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that there were fears ahead of the President's visit that he would be greeted by protesters or booed because of the insecurity in the state.\n\n\"It cost Zulum N350 million to mobilise the crowd they touted as Buhari's supporters,\" a source in Borno State government had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\"When President Buhari visited Lagos last week, they had to fly him over the city in a chopper because of a hostile crowd,\" another source had added.\n\nGovernor Zulum had earlier urged residents to show appreciation to President Buhari during his visit.\n\nThe governor in a statewide broadcast on Tuesday gave reasons the people of the state should honour the President when he arrived in Maiduguri.\n\nBorno is the epicentre of insurgency war in Nigeria.\n\nThe state has been at the end of incessant deadly attacks by terrorist groups\u2013Boko Haram and the Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP), and many residents have grown frustrated with the Buhari government.\n\nAhead of his election in 2015, Buhari promised to defeat Boko Haram but six years into his government, that promise has not been fulfilled.\n\nIn February 2020, residents of the state booed the President as his convoy drove in and when it was leaving Maiduguri, Borno State, during a condolence visit.\n\nThe residents were heard shouting in Hausa \u201cBama so, ka samu a kunya.\u201d Meaning \u201cWe don\u2019t want you, because you have disappointed us.\u201d\n\nBuhari, during his recent visit to Borno, however, said he was committed to serving Nigerians as a result of the love shown to him.",

          "title": "From Supa Strikas to Startups, Tomi Davies\u2019 approach to Angel Investing",
          "text": "In 2001, Tomi Davies backed his first company \u2014 Strika Entertainment. At the time, he didn\u2019t have a name for what he was doing; he was just helping friends.\n\nHe\u2019d later learn that what he was doing was called angel investing \u2014 an individual providing financial backing for small startups or entrepreneurs, typically in exchange for equity in the company.\n\nWith this knowledge, he co-founded the Lagos Angel Network in 2012, and a few years after, the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nTwenty years after his first investment, TD, as he is fondly called, has gone on to make many more investments and build the angel investment space in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe problem I\u2019m still trying to solve is that of funding for every African entrepreneur\u2019s great idea.\u201d\n\nWe start out our conversation talking about his first investment in Supa Strikas, a popular comic I grew up reading.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did the investment in Supa Strikas happen?\n\nTD: It started with meeting a South African named Oliver Power, I was head of IT research at Marks and Spencer in the UK then. A few years later when we returned back to our countries, he and a few others approached me to tell me that they had come up with an idea to do a comic.\n\nIt was a superhero comic book that featured the likes of Shaka the Zulu, Mansa Musa and Alaafin of Oyo.\n\nIt sounded like a good idea but I had to ask them, \u2018How are we going to make money?\u2019 because we needed to raise some investment. They said we\u2019re going to use a different model, we\u2019re going to get sponsorship from brands. We\u2019ll be like Marvel comics.\n\nSo I went to Cape Town, we had lengthy conversations and concluded this idea won\u2019t sell. We pivoted to a soccer storyline. Africans love football. We created an all African football team called Supa Strikas. It turned out to be successful.\n\nI ended up with the Nigerian rights for Supa Strikas for my contribution. So I am Supa Strikas Nigeria. There\u2019s Supa Strika Nigeria and Supa Strika South Africa. I no longer have shares in Supa Strikas South Africa. We sold our shares to Moonbug and Moonbug sold it to Disney. That\u2019s the story of Supa Strikas.\n\nDA: Why Angel and not Venture Capital?\n\nTD: I live through my portfolio. That\u2019s what keeps me alive, that\u2019s what keeps me fresh. I like the flexibility of choosing what to invest in and following up with the founders.\n\nDA: How do you operate?\n\nTD: My primary organisation is Technovision Communications. It operates as TVC Labs, which is funded by the 22 partners of the Technovision syndicate. These partners include people like Iyin Aboyeji, Kola Aina and Olumide Soyombo.\n\nTVC Labs runs accelerator programs that identify different startups that we work with. Now my portfolio consists of about 18 active startups like Trove, BigCabal Media*, Flexiserve, Trueflutter, Kishi, doci healthcare and others.\n\nDA: What was the reason for founding the Lagos Angel network?\n\nTD: The Lagos Angel Network was a happenstance. In 2012, I was already involved in angel investing. I had recognised that this was what I was going to do for the rest of my life.\n\nI ran into Dotun Sulieman; Funke Opeke of MainOne, Fatunmata Coker, Demola Aladekomo of Chams, Gbenga Sesan of Paradigm initiative, Gbolahan Elias, Folabi Esan and a host of others. We decided to put some structure to this and we started the Lagos Angel Network. We began structured investing\n\nDA: What about African Business Angel Network (ABAN)?\n\n\n\nTD: After a while, there were about 5 angel networks on the African continent.\n\nWe started partnering with my friend Ben White who runs VC for Africa and we ran the African Early Stage Investment Summit. Eric Osiakwan ran Angel Fair Africa. Through these events, the Europeans heard about us and they invited us to Slush.\n\nSo we all went to Helsinki in 2015 for Slush. At Slush, they said we needed an African Angel network to create networks and to educate people on what angel investing is all about.\n\nMy big sister Candace Johnson just turned around and said to me \u2018you\u2019re going to be the President.\u2019 I looked around, I didn\u2019t know they had all agreed to this. I looked at Dotun Suleiman, he was my senior at King\u2019s college and we formed the Lagos Angel Network together. He was the person I was expecting to be president but he said this is all yours.\n\nSo as president of ABAN, I spent the next 5 years crossing Africa and building networks. We now have 50 angel networks around 33 African countries.\n\nI am personally responsible for initiating the angel networks in the Gambia, Namibia, Tanzania, Kenya, South Africa and the list goes on. In Nigeria, I\u2019ve been responsible for the South-South Angel Network, Abuja Angel Network and also in Lagos, the women\u2019s only angel network called Rising Tide Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s important at this stage to point out that at ABAN I have co-founders. They are Ben White, Rebecca Enonchong, David van Dijk, Alexandra Fraser and Christopher Campbell.\n\nI\u2019d like to give a special shout out to David van Dijk. He is the backbone of ABAN. He runs the foundation, ensuring everything is running smoothly.\n\nDA: What does it mean to be a part of ABAN and what has been the network\u2019s impact?\n\nTD: The future of Africa is being built by a generation of entrepreneurs that are using technology to provide innovative solutions to the people of this continent.\n\nAnd those who support that cause will have a return not just in social impact but also in financial returns. That\u2019s the fundamental belief of ABAN.\n\nAs a member of the network, what you\u2019re signing up for is that we\u2019ll provide human and financial support to those working on these solutions.\n\nAs for Impact, Let me just paint a picture. In 2015 there were 5 angel networks on the African continent. Let\u2019s assume that they had 10-20 members each, so that\u2019s 50 \u2013 100 members in total. In 2021, there are now 49 angel networks in 33 African countries and Even if they have an average of 10 members each, that\u2019s 490 members. That\u2019s more human and financial support.\n\nWe created the Diaspora Angel Network, to co-invest in the local angel networks. So if you\u2019re sitting in London and you want to invest, you can invest through these networks.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the adoption rate like in Africa?\n\nTD: That\u2019s a tough one. Adoption rates are low because it\u2019s not for the faint-hearted and requires patience. Most importantly, it requires a passion and dedication to the entrepreneurs themselves. If you do not have that love of seeing others succeed, then there are different ways to spend your time or money.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when investing in startups?\n\nTD: The way I pick startups is called the POEM Framework. It goes way back to when I left Marks & Spencer. I joined Ernst & Young, where I was the chief operating officer for its incubator program. The way we worked was by doing a lot of research, then experimenting and using the results to improve on the experiment. In today\u2019s thinking, that\u2019s best captured by Eric Reis in what he calls the lean startup product development methodology.\n\nOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\nThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\nFinally, you ask, is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also is the business model sustainable. Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\n\nDA: How do you invest, alone or along with others? Also, how do you find these startups?\n\nTD: I only co-invest post-revenue, seed stage. As for the startups, I find them, they find me.\n\nI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, I sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum.\n\nThis means I tend to have a lot of people looking for deals that I can participate in but more importantly, I now do what\u2019s called program orchestration. I try to stimulate thinking, through programs that develop entrepreneurs with organisation partners like Google and Microsoft. In these programs I find entrepreneurs. That\u2019s me finding them. Every other day, from different channels there are founders reaching out.\n\nDA: It seems like an endless stream, how does due diligence happen?\n\nTD: Due diligence depends on the stage. At ideation, we say no. We either provide mentorship or advisory. There are three types of due diligence we do.\n\nFinancial: Here we\u2019re asking how much are you making, is this sustainable, what\u2019s it costing you to acquire customers? Do the numbers make sense?\n\nLegal: Are you legally incorporated, are there agreements between the founders and employees.\n\nCommercial: What\u2019s the size of your market? Is there a market? What kind of competition do you have out there? Is your market growth rate positive? We look at IP ownership \u2013 how you develop your products.\n\nBefore that we\u2019re going to issue a term sheet. Typically if it\u2019s a slam dunk, meaning someone has invested in you before, we can get it done within 30 days. If it\u2019s a first time investment, then it can take up to 90 days.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your relationship with other types of investors like Private Equity and Venture Capital?\n\nTD: I\u2019m the only person that I know that\u2019s crazy enough to say what I\u2019m about to say. I\u2019m an angel investor, I\u2019m also the chief investment officer for a Venture Capital, I sit on the board of a Private Equity company (MBO Capital). So we get along pretty well.\n\nDA: Hmm, all in one. So what have your exits been like?\n\nTD: There are different types of exits but in our continent, the only exit that\u2019s a real one is the acquisition exit. Just like Stripe acquired Paystack. Those are the typical exits you\u2019ll see.\n\nFor an early angel investment, you can expect anything from 20 to 50x return on investment. I\u2019d like to point out that for every good exit, there\u2019re at least ten bad ones. There are some deals I\u2019ve lost money on that I\u2019ve retained relationships with the founders.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s more than just about the money. The challenge is to build a better future, so as long as people are heading in that direction then it\u2019s your responsibility [as an angel investor] to support them. That\u2019s how I see it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have relationships to support you, you won\u2019t build good things. Exits are a good measure, but how I measure success is by those 15-18 founders that I\u2019m constantly helping to be better.\n\n\n\nTD: Are you focused on any particular sectors?\n\nDA: Yes. First tech-enabled businesses. My background is in tech, so that\u2019s the underlying thesis.\n\nThen there\u2019s the concept of essentials. We must all eat, so I invest in food and agriculture. Health, education and power are also part of essentials.\n\nThe next is primary things like transportation, logistics.\n\nThen we have the future of work. Anything that facilitates enterprise from a technology standpoint like the rise of Zoom in the past year.\n\nThose are the areas I focus on rather than sectors because I start from a tech enabled stand point.\n\nDA: What trends do you see?\n\nTD: In my space, the use of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are underrated. When you consider that the average home now has a 30 inch screen somewhere in it, the potential for that is limitless. We talk about the reason fintech exists is because people have smartphones. Well, they\u2019ll keep on making the screens better and more affordable. Currently because we\u2019re used to the broadcast model, we\u2019re not thinking about the interactivity that\u2019s possible. That\u2019s an opportunity I\u2019m seeing that I expect someone to take advantage of.\n\nImagine a solar based screen that you don\u2019t need to worry about charging. You can attach a router to it, so it\u2019s interactive. This means I can teach a school remotely \u2013 one to many not one to one like on mobile. It means I can also remotely manage staff.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about exotic technology but simple technology that exists today. The price points to knock them together today are high but if you look at the opportunity cost, there\u2019s alot to play for.\n\nThat\u2019s just one opportunity, I won\u2019t be surprised that a startup takes advantage of this as long as COVID keeps us out of each other\u2019s way.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve written a number of books, are you working on a new one?\n\nTD: Yes, I\u2019m working on one now, which should be done sometime in 2021.\n\nDA: Any hints on the name?\n\nTD: The working title is \u2019Conversations with an African Angel.\u2019\n\n*Tomi Davies is an investor in Big Cabal Media, TechCabal\u2019s parent organization.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Cowrywise, a Nigeria-based wealth management startup, has received a licence to operate as a Fund/Portfolio Manager from the country\u2019s capital markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe license means Cowrywise\u2019s operations now fall directly under the regulatory scope of the SEC and should help improve trust with potential users. Before now, the startup used a trustee structure to offer investment opportunities, in partnership with regulated investment management companies like Meristem.\n\nCowrywise was founded by Edward Popoola and CEO Razaq Ahmed to democratise access to savings and investment products to the growing demography of underserved Nigerian millennials and the middle class.\n\nCurrently, the company boasts a wide range of investment products. These include savings-related products backed by fixed income instruments like treasury bills, which Ahmed has often claimed at 10-15% yield better interests- than what banks offer.\n\nCowrywise also has about 21 different mutual funds and at least 20% of the total mutual funds in the country are listed on its platform, making it the largest aggregator in the country. These assets cut across five investment company partners \u2013 including United Capital Asset Management, Meristem Wealth Management, Afrinvest Wealth Management, ARM Investment Managers and Lotus Capital.\n\nFor Cowrywise\u2019s clients, a license from the SEC means greater protection of their assets. \u201cWith our own license, the SEC now becomes your \u201cguardian\u201d. They\u2019ll double down on our existing security structure to keep you even safer,\u201d Cowrywise said in a mail to clients announcing its new license on Tuesday.\n\nThe Cowrywise team.\n\nImproving relationship with the regulator\n\nWith the latest development, Cowrywise becomes the second fintech startup in Nigeria to secure a license from the SEC after the regulator granted the inaugural one to Chaka a few days ago.\n\nHowever, Cowrywise is the first fintech to get a licence in the fund/portfolio management category. Chaka, on the other hand, got a Digital Sub-Broker licence.\n\nThese developments point to an improving relationship between the Nigerian capital markets regulator and the several fintech players that provide investment services in the country.\n\nOver the past few years, DIY-stock buying platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, Chaka, and Rise have emerged while startups like Piggyvest and Cowrywise, initially focused on providing digital banking services, have dabbled into investment management.\n\nThese startups offer Nigerians access to stocks, bonds, and other securities in both local and foreign markets. While they have gained popularity among the young middle class, as they provide a means to protect naira earnings from devaluations, the companies have been subject to a series of regulatory attacks. Regulation of the space has been mooted for some time now.\n\nEfforts have been made to engage each other and, with the awarding of two licences within a week, those attempts are apparently yielding desirable results beneficial to not only both parties, but also the investing public.\n\nWhat comes next for Cowrywise?\n\nWith the new license, the startup plans to offer more for its partners (fund managers) and investors on its platform.\n\nCowrywise also said it will be making its APIs public to help fund managers across the world access its services and open up more investment options to serve customers in Nigeria better.\n\n\u201cDigitizing the investment management infrastructure is an important next step in our vision to democratize access to investment products,\u201d the startup said. \u201cThese APIs do not just apply to fintechs; any company can embed investment features in their products as our investment API simplifies regulatory, compliance, and technical hurdles.\u201d\n\nCowrrywise commenced operations in 2017 and has since grown to have over 300,000 users on its platforms. It recently raised $3 million in a funding round led by Quona Capital.\n\nBy 2025, the company aims to introduce 10 million first-time investors to regulated investments, according to Ahmed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ghana kicks off first fully digital census in West Africa",
          "text": "Ghana has started its long-awaited fully-digital national census; the first-ever in West Africa. This comes after a trial was conducted in select districts nationwide back in 2019.\n\nThe country\u2019s last census was in 2010 and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNow the government has gone digital, using tablets and satellite images to improve the reach of field agents and ensuring the whole population in Ghana is counted on census night.\n\nThe digital census will be done with the use of Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) devices which are tablets for electronic data capture and Geographic Positioning Systems (GPS) for recording coordinates of structures.\n\nMore than 67,000 field enumerators have been deployed to collect data nationwide using electronic questionnaires on digital tablets, according to the Ghana Statistics Service (GSS), the institution responsible for collecting and collating national data.\n\nThe field agents will target persons travelling, persons in short-stay institutions such as health facilities, hotels, and prisons, and those considered homeless at their locations, Ghana\u2019s Chief Government Statistician, Samuel Kobina Annim, was quoted as saying.\n\nAn \u201call-inclusive\u201d exercise\n\nThe historic digital census in Ghana fits right in with the government\u2019s bid to capture the exact number of Ghanaians in the country, especially the vulnerable population, for better national development.\n\n\u201cThe 2021 census is unique with the use of electronic tablets and the Internet to capture and transfer data to guarantee the delivery of high-quality and faster results to support the decision-making process,\u201d President Nana Akufo-Addo said back in May when he announced a countdown to the digital census. Ultimately, this would help in socio-economic planning in the country and potentially aid the fight against inequality while transforming the informal sector.\n\n\u201cThe digitisation will help us deliver results more promptly and accurately than we used to have with the paper and pen data collection in the past,\u201d said Peter Takyi Peprah, the Field Operations Manager at the GSS.\n\nGhana has millions of street vendors and waste pickers that make up most of its informal economy. The majority of these people moved from poorer rural areas in search of work and represent a \u201cfloating population\u201d that the government wants to capture better in its database.\n\nThe census will also play a major role in the nationwide rollout of biometric identity cards launched by President Nana Akufo-Addo in 2017. The new ID card requires a digital address code, many of which will be generated by enumerators during the census.\n\n\u201cThe counting that we do at GSS during a PHC is the snapshot of the population and it is an all-inclusive exercise,\u201d Annim added.\n\nThe fully digital PHC is said to have cost the government $84 million, around 50% more than the last census. It sees the West African nation join the list of African countries to collect national data electronically, an exclusive club that includes only Swaziland, Malawi, and Kenya. Meanwhile, South Africa is in line for its first-ever digital census.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nGhana\u2019s digital census\n\nSabee by Facebook\n\nJetstream\u2019s $3 million seed round\n\nGhana\u2019s digital census\n\nGhanaian Flag\n\nAfter postponing its census last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, Ghana has commenced a digital census \u2014 the first of its kind in West Africa. This is coming after a trial conducted in selected districts in 2019.\n\nHow would this be done? The government plans to deploy 67,419 field agents nationwide to assist with data collation on digital tablets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Samuel Kobina Annim, Chief Government Statistician, these field agents would look out for persons travelling, persons in short-stay institutions \u2014 hotels, prisons, and health facilities \u2014 and those considered homeless.\n\nThe digital census would accelerate plans for the rollout of identity cards proposed by President Nana Akufo-Addo in 2017. Consequently, Ghana joins the likes of Swaziland, Malawi, and Kenya as countries that have conducted a digital census.\n\nWelcome development? On the surface, a digital census is a no-brainer in an increasingly digitised world, but it is not so straightforward. While it provides governments with needed data for faster decision making, compared to manual methods used in the past, there are data privacy concerns to be addressed.\n\nWith low public trust in governments and organisations, citizens can\u2019t be blamed if they fear their data is being used to monitor them.\n\nBut are Africans really concerned about their privacy? See for yourself: Africa\u2019s dependence on Facebook companies and the WhatsApp conundrum\n\nA new direction? With countries like Kenya among those to have conducted digital censuses, could it be that we see increased adoption by African governments?\n\nWhat do you think of this development? Would you embrace it if your country adopted it? Let us know in the comment section.\n\nSabee by Facebook\n\nFacebook\u2019s Nigerian team has revealed plans to launch Sabee, an educational app targeted at learners in the West African country. The app aims to connect learners and educators in online communities to make learning more accessible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer TechCrunch, Emeka Okafor, Facebook\u2019s Product Lead, revealed that it is still a small test designed to help them understand how to build communities that can make education accessible.\n\nTechCrunch reports that the product is still being tested in a small group of 100 users who are all signed up to non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Facebook\u2019s team is also working to ensure the product supports 2G offerings, serving groups that have a harder time connecting to the Internet.\n\nLast year, Facebook announced plans to open an office in Lagos, Nigeria, as part of its investments on the continent. Since then, the team has been involved in creating a few products, including the online zine creator, E.gg; video app, Hobbi; and calling app, CatchUp. Sadly, none of these apps survived long enough to become mainstream products.\n\nUnlike these other products, which were largely social, the Sabee app is tied to Facebook\u2019s strategic goal of empowering communities across Africa in the hope that they will form part of their user base. That has seen them invest in a subsea cable project to connect over one billion people in Africa and the Middle East to the Internet.\n\nThe bigger picture: According to Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, Nigeria has 6.95 million out-of-school children. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, edtech startups worldwide received a huge boost of $16.1 billion in funding. More than double the numbers from 2019, proving that there were alternative ways to deliver knowledge to students. Consequently, products like Sabee would only gain more importance in the coming years.\n\nJetstream\u2019s $3m funding round\n\nL-R Miishe Addy (CEO and co-founder), and Solomon Torgbo (COO and co-founder)\n\nGhanaian logistics startup, Jetstream, has closed a $3 million seed round with participation from Alitheia IDF, Golden Palm Investments, 4DX Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Asia Pacific Labs, Breyer Labs, and MSA Capital.\n\nFounded in 2018 by Miishe Addy and Solomon Torgbo, the company uses technology to make the movement of cargo across borders clear and simple.\n\nOne would think proximity would translate to a high volume of trade between African countries, but that is not the case. For example, in 2020, India was Nigeria\u2019s biggest trading partner despite Ghana being only a few hundred kilometres away, while Senegal\u2019s biggest trading partner was France.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), intra-African exports accounted for 16.6% of total exports in 2017. In comparison, that number was 68.1% in Europe, 59.4% in Asia, 55.0% in America, and 7.0% in Oceania.\n\nThrough its Jetstream Freight Forwarding offering, businesses can move their goods from Ghana to Nigeria easily. This is a welcome development that would surely boost Africa\u2019s trade volumes. In addition, by digitising payments, contracts, and communication, Jetstream would be providing the essential infrastructure for trade on the continent.\n\nRead more: Ghana-based Jetstream raises $3m to build tech solutions for Africa\u2019s trade solutions.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nNigerian fintech, Cowrywise, secures SEC\u2019s fund management licence.

          "text": "Ghana\u2019s Jetstream has closed a $3 million seed round as it aims to build digital infrastructure for Africa\u2019s trade corridors. Local and international investors that participated include Alitheia IDF, Golden Palm Investments, 4DX Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Asia Pacific Land, Breyer Labs, and MSA Capital.\n\nPreviously, the company received pre-seed funding from Hustle Fund in San Francisco and C5 Capital in London through the PeaceTech accelerator. It also participated in this year\u2019s Catalyst Fund Inclusive Fintech Program cohort, where it was the only Ghanian startup. Ingressive Capital also lists the company in its portfolio.\n\nFounded in 2018 by CEO Miishe Addy and COO Solomon Torgbo, the company wants to enable African businesses to see and control their cross-border supply chains. It uses technology to make the movement of cargo across borders clear and simple.\n\nAs Addy told attendees at AB2020\u2019s 2019 Tech in Ghana Accra event, Jetstream was initially started as a logistics company for cosmetics manufacturers in South Africa. They consolidated airfreight shipments of finished shea and other products and sent them to the United States for distribution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the founders quickly realised that the biggest problems in distribution were occurring further up in the supply chain, in places like Northern and Eastern Ghana. From these locations, millions of smallholder farmers and SME processors produce ingredients that make their way through long and complex supply chains to markets like the US, South Africa, and Europe.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the CEO said, \u201cWe discussed and tried lots of different solutions for about a year and discovered that cargo aggregation generated strong traction almost immediately.\u201d\n\nEventually, Jetstream began operations in Ghana in March 2019, when it launched a Less Than Container Load (LCL) \u2014 a shipment in small quantities that cannot occupy the whole of a container \u2014 aggregation service. It allowed agricultural exporters to group their shipments into shared sea freight containers.\n\nIn November 2020, Jetstream added trade finance for customers who found it difficult to fill large purchase orders.\n\nThe company is currently white-labelling \u2014 providing services or products which other companies rebrand as theirs \u2014 its internally built systems to manage shipments and financing for customers.\n\nPreviously, Addy \u2014 a Stanford law graduate \u2014 taught business at Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST), while Torgbo had worked at Maersk\u2019s freight forwarding subsidiary Damco for eight years; their experiences have aided them in the running of the company.\n\nAfrica\u2019s share of exports to the rest of the world ranged from 80% to 90% between 2000 and 2017. And this is a major catalyst for the continent\u2019s newly created African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which aims to boost regional commerce.\n\nThe company is well-positioned to facilitate this move, especially as it is located in Ghana. The West African country is a major proponent of the AfCFTA initiative and is home to Port Tema, the largest container terminal in West and Central Africa, with plans to handle one million containers a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Port Tema, Jetstream counts an unnamed Asia-based global shipping line as a major customer and early adopter of its technology. This has seen the business generate seven-figure revenue, and Addy claims the startup grows more than 100% year on year.\n\nJetstream also has operations in Nigeria with agents in South Africa, China, the US, UK, and Europe \u2014 a move strategic to the company\u2019s ten-year plan to move whichever agricultural product to whichever enterprise that needs it, especially within Africa.",

          "text": "Nigerian Wealth management startup, Cowrywise Financial Technology Limited \u201cCowrywise\u201d, has secured an asset management licence from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe licence, dubbed the \u201cFund/Portfolio Management Licence\u201d, gives companies the right to manage funds and investment portfolios on behalf of retail investors. Per the SEC, only companies with such licence can develop and operate any product that pools investor funds.\n\nCo-founded by Razaq Ahmed and Edward Popoola in 2017, Cowrywise entered the digital wealth management space with the aim of giving more Nigerians access to a range of investment and savings products.\n\nHowever, SEC had not yet defined regulations for fintech companies playing in the investment space. Startups were left to take up the mantle of protecting investor funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot being a fund manager itself, Cowrywise struck a partnership with a SEC regulated entity, Meristem Trustees Limited.\n\nThe company\u2019s plan to protect investors was to introduce a trustee who will act as a guardian to investor funds. According to the startup, this SEC-regulated trustee ensured that Cowrywise properly invested customer savings on its platform\n\nIn 2018, the company launched various retail investment schemes, and it says it now has up to 21 mutual funds with various risk categories, and up to three hundred thousand people now use Cowrywise in 2021.\n\nAccording to Ahmed, CEO of Cowrywise, the SEC licence not only validates the company\u2019s work, but it will help to improve investor confidence, and help it deepen its partnerships with other fund managers.\n\n\u201cWe can now decide to even build our own mutual funds, partner with other fund and portfolio managers to digitise their operations and expand their reach to first-time investors,\u201d Ahmed says.\n\nA public API\n\nThe Cowrywise app. Source: Supplied.\n\nAhmed says the company\u2019s plan is to capture 10 million first time investors by 2025 into regulated investments., and an important step going forward is to digitise the country\u2019s investment infrastructure.\n\nPer Ahmed, the company will be launching its public Application Programming Interface which other fintech companies and traditional fund managers can access to either launch their own wealth management products, or digitise their operations.\n\n\u201cWe want to help fund managers across the world access our services and open up more investment options to serve our customers in Nigeria better,\u201d Ahmed reveals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur investment API simplifies regulatory, compliance and technical hurdles. We\u2019ve been developing this for some time and the SEC licence eliminates the regulatory obstacles to launching such a product,\u201d he says.\n\nRecall that in January 2021, Y Combinator-backed Cowrywise raised $3m pre-Series A, led by Quona Capital which brought its total funding to $3.5 million since its 2017 launch.\n\nA closer look at SEC\u2019s licence\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from Pixabay\n\nIn Ahmed\u2019s opinion, this latest move signifies the SEC\u2019s interest in embracing the rise of fintech companies and giving their services the much needed regulatory backing.\n\nCowrywise\u2019s Fund/Portfolio Manager licence comes barely a week after SEC issued a sub-broker licence to Chaka, a startup that helped people trade stocks from companies like Amazon, MTN, and Airtel.\n\nHowever, the requirements for SEC\u2019s fund manager licence are more capital intensive.\n\nThe registration process involves four fees that cost a combined \u20a6800k ($2000). These include a filing/application fee, processing fee, registration fee, and sponsored individual fee.\n\nAccording to SEC\u2019s website, every fund manager must have, at least, three sponsored individuals with one serving as a regulatory compliance officer.\n\nThe commission requires a minimum paid-up capital of \u20a6150 million ($365k) This capital could either be in bank balances, fixed assets or Investment in quoted Securities.\n\nThe company would also be required to secure a current Fidelity Insurance Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum paid-up capital \u2014 \u20a630 million ($73k).\n\nInterestingly, SEC\u2019s January 2021 rule amendment states that fund managers must pay annual regulatory fees that amount to 0.25% of their total funds targeted at retail investors. They will also pay a 0.01% fee on their funds which are targeted at High Networth Individuals (HNIs).\n\nAnother section of this rule also states that fund managers can only develop or operate any product when the commission grants it prior approval or has no objection on that product.\n\nFlouting this rule could attract a \u20a6500k ($1200) fine and an additional \u20a610k ($24) for every day the violation continues.\n\nConsidering Cowrywise\u2019s position as a constantly innovative fintech company, it is not clear if this rule would be adjusted specifically for fintech companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission has already given fintech startups without defined regulations until Q3 2021 to joins its incubation program, a very similar initiative to the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN\u2019s) regulatory sandbox.",

Do they have the qualifications? You have to interact with them and advise us. Tell us whether these people can help us deliver on our mandates.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cWhen you make your recommendations, we then look at those your recommendations and select those that we need to select; we are running a very transparent selection process. I don\u2019t have one name; the people have gone through the process.\n\n\u201cYou all have very high credibility; we have engaged you in various assignments in the past, so we are very deliberate in choosing you. We trust and believe that whatever you give to us would be as you see it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we have a lot of trust and confidence that you will do a great job for us.

Through the Energy Cabin projects, Awoye and Odofado are having access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for the first time thus fulfilling Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).\n\nOndo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, who was represented at the commissioning by Mrs Abike Ilawolle, the Secretary, Ondo State Public Utility, said that the rural electrification project is in line with his administration\u2019s agenda.\n\nWhile promising to ensure that all rural areas benefited from social amenities in order to improve their welfare, the governor COMMENDED CNL, the sponsors of the laudable project which he said was first of its kind.\n\n\u201cRural electrification is part of our administration\u2019s agenda and we will ensure that rural dwellers, especially residents in the riverine areas have access to social amenities for life to be enjoyable to them unlike their land counterparts.\n\n\u201cThe communities should prioritise these projects and guarantee its security in order to charge the government to do more and extend such to other riverine communities to bring succour to them.\n\nMr Goke Ojatuwase, the Chairman, Ilaje LGA who also commended the IRDC and sponsors of the laudable project, said it would relieve the two communities of total darkness. He said the project which was one of its kind had set the pace for other states to emulate, assuring the riverine communities of more dividends of democracy from the present administration in the state.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of the IRDC, Mr Roland Akintoye, expressed gladness for the completion of the project which he said had set the group to the highest pedestal in the community drive for improved standard of living. He thanked the state government, the LGA and NNPC/Chevron for the synergy which had blossomed into cordial relationship and attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) beneficial to residents of the riverine communities.\n\nEngr. Ayodeji Olumilua, Managing Director, A4 and T Power Solutions, contractor of the projects said that residents of the riverine communities would enjoy uninterrupted power supply with 40 percent discount on tariffs compared to normal electricity. \u201cWe have metered all the 200 houses and shops for them to enjoy the uninterrupted power supply.\n\n\u201cThe token amount of money that was paid on their prepaid meters would generate funds that would be used to maintain and sustain the solar cabin grid.\u2019\u2019\n\nMr Aribo Adegoke, a resident of Awoye community said that the solar electricity was a welcome development for them as they now have access to noiseless electricity at cheaper rate compared to generating set and its expenses.\n\nAlso speaking, another beneficiary from Odofado community, Mrs Folashade Ojagun said she had totally lost hope in electricity as no government had been able to erect poles on the river to provide electricity until the advent of the solar power.\n\nNigerian Observer gathered that IRDC was a community-based organisation solely funded by NNPC/Chevron Nigeria Ltd. It was founded under a Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) between Ondo State government, Some communities neighboring CNL\u2019s Operations in Ondo State and NNPC/Chevron Nigeria Limited to manage community development in constituent areas.\n\nTo execute the Energy Cabin project, Ilaje RDC partnered with the Foundation for Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta (PIND), a Chevron-sponsored Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) which was incorporated in Nigeria, in 2010, to complement Chevron\u2019s existing social investment efforts to help promote equitable economic development and peace in the Niger Delta through partnerships. At the moment, PIND is also working with other private sector investors interested in providing solar energy in the riverine communities (as a for-profit business) using this model for scale up.\n\n...",

          "text": "Chairman of Emohua local government area of Rivers State, Dr. Chidi Julius Lloyd, on Wednesday, locked out hundreds of civil servants from the council secretariat for reporting to work late.\n\nThe development came exactly one week after the chairman had set up his office under a mango tree in the council secretariat to monitor the ingress and degress of civil servants in the local government council.\n\nLEADERSHIP observed that civil servants who reported to work some minutes after 8:00am were not allowed access into the council secretariat by security personnel.\n\nIn a short message service (SMS) sent to our correspondent, Lloyd said he has already directed the Head of Local Government Administration (HLGA) and the Head of Personnel Management (HPM) to issue query to the affected workers for late coming.\n\nHe said: \u201cI got to work at exactly 7:30 and noticed that staff were not at their duty posts, I had to ask the security to lock out late comers and the HLGA/ HPM to issue queries to all those involved. We must be responsible citizens of Emohua local government area.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the chairman has said huge wage bills of the local government councils should not deter chairmen from embarking on meaningful projects.\n\nLloyd, who disclosed this while speaking with LEADERSHIP at Emohua, headquarters of Emohua local government area, said the plan of his administration was to rebrand the council secretariat within his first 100 days in office.\n\nHe stated that the task before his administration was like that of a newly created local government area, considering the fact that most of the structures in the council secretariat are dilapidated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLloyd said: \u201cFor us, it is going to be a very challenging period because it is as if we are starting fresh; it is as if the local government area has just being created.\n\n\u201cIf you were here on the first day we assumed office, you will understand what the issues are. We have a staff strength of nearly 1,500 persons who work in the local government.\n\n\u201cObviously, the wage bill will be high and with the dwindling revenue that comes from the federation account, it is not even enough to pay salaries, let alone embark on any meaningful project.\n\n\u201cBut, we don\u2019t have any excuse; we are not here to merely pay only salaries, no, that is not why we are here. So, we need to change the narrative of the local government area.\n\n\u201cWe shall rebrand the local government area to make it possible for people to have enough space to attend events. All the structures here are almost getting dilapidated, which for us, in the next 100 days will be a done deal.\n\n\u201cI have been having a lot of nostalgia trying to think where to start because every sector is yearning for attention.

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",

          "text": "About four years after jumping the bail granted him by Justice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja; leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu was extradited to Nigeria Sunday to face trial.\n\nKanu was accused by the federal government of instigating violence, especially in the South-east Nigeria, resulting in the loss of lives and property of civilians, military, paramilitary, police personnel and destruction of civil institutions and symbols of authorities.\n\nHe was arrested in 2015 and charged to court on an 11-count charge bordering on treasonable felony, but subsequently granted bail.\n\nBut in March 2019, the court revoked his bail after sneaking out of the country.\n\nBefore he was reported missing in 2017, Kanu, Blueprint recalls, spent about 18 months in prison and was granted bail by the trial judge who then slated October 2017 for his trial.\n\nAlthough the Army had publicly stated the IPOB leader was not in their custody, a relation of his alleged Kanu was held in secret custody by the military after the attack on his family house in Umuahia September 14.\n\nSimilarly, his lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, stated that it was only the army that could tell the whereabouts of his \u2018missing\u2019 client.\n\nThe government thereafter made a move and obtained a court order declaring IPOB a terrorist organisation and also cut sources of funding of the group, a position his lawyer has since challenged.\n\nHis re-arrest\n\nAnd following his re-arrest and consequent re-arraignment Tuesday before Justice Nyako, the court ordered that he be detained at the Department of State Services (DSS)\u2019 facility preparatory to the resumption of his trial.\n\nEarlier at a press briefing in his office in Abuja, Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami (SAN) told journalists that the IPOB leader was rearrested through joint efforts between the Nigerian and UK authorities.\n\nThe AGF revealed that Kanu was arrested and brought back to Nigeria Sunday with an International passport number A05136827 issued on the 17th October, 2013 at FESTAC in Lagos.\n\nThe AGF was quoted as saying\n\n\u201cFugitive Nnamdi Kanu\u201d is back to Nigeria to face his trial.\n\nAt the ten-minute briefing were the Inspector General of Police Usman Baba Alkali, Force Public Relations Officer (FPPRO) Frank Mba and DSS spokesperson Peter Afunaya.\n\nThe AGF said: \u201cThe self-acclaimed leader of the proscribed secessionist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has been arrested through the collaborative efforts of Nigerian intelligence and security services.\n\n\u201cHe has been brought back to Nigeria in order to continue facing trial after disappearing while on bail regarding eleven (11) count charges against him. Recent steps taken by the Federal Government led to the interception of the fugitive Kanu on Sunday the 27th day of June, 2021.\n\n\u201cNwannekaenyi Nnamdi\n\nNgozichukwu Okwu-Kanu, born 25th day of September, 1967 at Afaraukwu, Abia State is a holder of Nigerian Passport No. A05136827 first issued 17th October 2013 at FESTAC, Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt is recalled that Kanu was arrested on 14th October, 2015 on 11-count charge bordering on terrorism, treasonable felony, managing an unlawful society, publication of defamatory matter, illegal possession of firearms and improper importation of goods, among others.\u201d\n\nThe drama that follows\n\nMeanwhile, as the briefing was still ongoing, Kanu had already been sneaked into the court premises by the DSS operatives the same day to continue his trial.\n\nDecked in brown and black tinted wear, the IPOB leader who was brought to the court at about 1:40 pm amidst tight security was shielded from the prying eyes of journalists and cameramen.\n\nApart from positioning policemen and DSS operatives within and at all the entrances to the court, the door to Justice Nyako\u2019s court was also under lock as the hearing in the matter was ongoing.\n\nThere were fully armed DSS operatives and police within and outside the premises while the trial was going on.\n\nAlso, at the adjoining roads that led to the court premises, there were four (4) police patrol vehicles strategically positioned to forestall any security breaches.\n\nAt the court session Tuesday, prosecuting counsel, Magaji Labaran moved an ex parte application urging the court to remand Kanu in the DSS\n\ncustody in Abuja pending the hearing and determination of the matter.\n\nHe premised his position on the grounds that the IPOB leader violated the conditions of the earlier bail granted him by the court.\n\nKanu explains escape\n\nHowever, immediately after the ruling by the judge, Kanu, who expressed his desire to talk, told the court that \u201cI did not jump bail, my lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cI only went underground when the Nigerian Armed Forces raided my residence in Abia State, which led to the death of some people. So, I had to run for my safety.\n\n\u201cThat was why I have been unable to attend court. I would have been killed the way others were killed when my house was invaded,\u201d Kanu said, stressing that his absence was not deliberate.\n\nAfter listening to the accused, Justice Nyako ordered his detention at the DSS facility, and asked him to get across to his lawyer for the trial.\n\nAfter the court session, it became herculean for journalists and their cameramen to have a shot at Kanu as every attempt was thwarted by the security operatives who cordoned off some parts of the court premises.\n\nAfterward, our correspondent sighted Kanu covered with a black hood and was then whisked away by the security operatives through a small gate by the side of the court linking the Justice Ministry.\n\nAs that was playing out, journalists and cameramen were spotted running around, and some towards the court fence to capture what was playing out to no avail.\n\nIn the meantime, Justice Nyako has adjourned the matter till the 26th of July for continuation of Kanu\u2019s trial.\n\nACF urges fair trial\n\nMeanwhile, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has hailed the Nigerian government for re-arresting the IPOB leader even as it called for fair trial for the accused.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday by its Public Relations Officer (PRO) Emmanuel Yawe, the ACF said though Kanu lacked respect for Nigeria and vowed to destroy the country, he should be tried with full recourse to the rule of law.\n\nYawe said: \u201cThe Arewa Consultative Forum has been informed that Mr. Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) which was declared illegal by the Federal Government has been arrested.\n\n\u201cWe know that the man has no respect for the country called Nigeria\n\nand has vowed to destroy the country. Sadly, he enjoys collaboration of some Nigerians who for some reasons want the country destroyed.\n\n\u201cHe also enjoys the support of international arms dealers who know that he has the capacity to cause a war to break out in Africa\u2019s most populous country and biggest economy.\n\n\u201cGiven the complex international and national issues involved in this case, we call on the government to handle the matter with care. The best way out is to keep strictly to the rule of law. Kanu and his collaborators must be made to understand that Nigeria is not a failed state and the rule oflaw still exists here.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze reacts\n\nSimilarly, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide \u2013 the apex-Igbo socio\u00adcultural organisation-commended the federal government for arresting Kanu, adding that it his arrest has brought an \u201cend to violent agitations in the country.\n\nIn a reaction by its secretary-general, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, the group however called for calm and cautioned Igbos to desist from any form ofprotests and processions that would bring more catastrophes for Southeastern Nigeria\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo calls for calm and cautioned Igbos to desist from any form of protests and processions that will bring more catastrophes for south eastern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu the leader of IPOB is the beginning of the end of violent agitations in south eastern Nigeria and a lesson to others that deviation from the nonviolent agitations and wasting of the innocent blood of the Igbo youths contradicted what Igbos are known for, and self\u00addetermination should not be used for purposes of fortune and fame-seeking.\n\n\u2018Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s refusal to adhere to the advice of Igbo leaders, Elders, and Political leaders is the outcome of what had befallen him, he made a lot of enemies, especially those that would have saved him and Federal Government will never lose grip on him again.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think that any Igbo leader will stick out his/her neck for him, his re-arrest will eventually bring peace and stability to the region and averted another civil war that was raging on.\n\n\u201cFederal Government should handle the situation carefully because his large followers of IPOB wouldn\u2019t resort to violent revolts, his trial should be strictly based on the laws of the land, they shouldn\u2019t kill him because it will destabilize the entire country,\u201d Isiguzoro said.\n\nShehu Sani\n\nAlso, a former Kaduna lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani called on the Nigerian government to ensure Kanu\u2019s rights\u2019 as a human being were respected while the trial goes on.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental rights of Nnamdi Kanu should be respected in compliance with the relevant articles of the constitution of the FRN. His trial should be guided by justice, fairness and the rule of law and not sentiments, prejudice, hate, ill feelings, vengeance or bigotry,\u201d he said.\n\nKanu\u2019s family speaks\n\nAlso, Kanu\u2019s family has cried out to the federal government to ensure the safety of their son.\n\nHis younger brother, Emmanuel Kanu, who spoke to journalists in Umuahia, said Kanu is on the part of truth and has no way committed any crime to deserve any persecution.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy brother (Kanu) has awoken the consciousness of Nigerians about the goings-on in the country.\n\n\u201cHe stood for the truth, and Heaven is on the part of anyone standing for the truth. My brother committed no crime, and the whole world is watching.\u201d\n\nIPOB threatens\n\nAmidst all this, the Lagos state chapter of IPOB,has warned\u201d\u201d nothing should happen to its leader.\n\nThe state coordinator of the group, Sam Igwe said this in a phone chat with Ripples Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe want to sound this as a warning that nothing should happen to our Supreme leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu or else there will be war. The South-East, South-South and indeed every part of Nigeria will be too hot.\n\n\u201cMazi Nnamdi Kanu is not a criminal. His only crime is fighting for the liberation of Ndigbos. Is that a crime? Does that make him a criminal?\n\n\u201cWe are giving the Nigerian government 24 hours to release Kanu or there will be serious repercussions. We are warning them,\u201d Igwe threatened.\n\nNorthern groups laud FG\n\nAnd from the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) came an advice that the federal government should tackle the Biafra issue once and for all.\n\nThe CNG spokesperson, Abdul- Azeez Suleiman, in a press statement issued Tuesday in Abuja, said nobody should make the mistake of assuming that the arrest is anywhere near the end of the Biafra affair.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe stand our ground that a referendum must be held to determine this and all other agitations for self-determination from any part of the country.\n\n\u201cThe Coalition of Northern Groups received the news of the arrest and repatriation of the fugitive rebel, Nnamdi with mixed feelings of apprehension and appreciation.\n\n\u201cOn hand, we commend the effort of the federal government and the agencies that made this possible, particularly the International Police and authorities of the United Kingdom for honouring their obligations with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOn another hand, we remain apprehensive until the full course of justice takes effect. Kanu as we all know has a pending trial for treasonable felony and jumping bail.\n\n\u201cIn addition, he must now face additional charges of incitement to violence and killing of people of other ethnicities, particularly northerners, security personnel as a result of his open incitement.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, we don\u2019t see Kanu\u2019s arrest affecting the issue of Biafra.\u201d",
          "summary": "The AGF was quoted as saying\u201cFugitive Nnamdi Kanu\u201d is back to Nigeria to face his trial.\nHe premised his position on the grounds that the IPOB leader violated the conditions of the earlier bail granted him by the court.\nACF urges fair trialMeanwhile, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has hailed the Nigerian government for re-arresting the IPOB leader even as it called for fair trial for the accused.\n\u201cThe fundamental rights of Nnamdi Kanu should be respected in compliance with the relevant articles of the constitution of the FRN.\n\u201cWe want to sound this as a warning that nothing should happen to our Supreme leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu or else there will be war.",

He is facing treason charges and was remanded in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) following an order by a Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nBut the World Igbo Congress in a statement signed and issued by its chairman Anthony Ejiofor and spokesperson Basil Onwukwe, urged the federal government to treat the IPOB leader according to universally accepted laws.\n\nThe group on Wednesday called on the \u201cNigerian Government to ensure that Nnamdi Kanu is treated in accordance with the rules and international conventions that guarantee that his rights and personal safety are protected.\u201d\n\nKanu, a UK citizen, had been in the country after jumping bail. The government did not, however, say where he was rearrested, triggering speculations about how he was recaptured.\n\nThe WIC, however, claims that the Biafran agitator was not captured in the UK and called on the British Government and the international community to investigate the circumstances surrounding Kanu\u2019s rearrest.\n\n\u201cThe UK government needs to investigate the collusion of any other country or party in this saga,\u201d the Igbo group further stated.\n\n\u201cThe government of the US, the UN and the international community to take note of the ongoing abuse of human rights in Nigeria including this matter of abduction of Nnamdi Kanu.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the Nigerian government proscribed IPOB and designated it as a terrorist organization but the World Igbo Congress has faulted the move, accusing the government of double standards and targeting the Igbo.\n\n\u201cThe world has taken notice of the disparity in the treatment of Boko Haram insurgents and Fulani herdsmen who have been designated as terrorists by known international agencies,\u201d it added in the statement where it called for the protection of the rights of Ndigbo.\n\n\u201cThese killers are routinely arrested, compensated, released, and oftentimes absorbed into the Nigerian security services. On the other hand, the Igbo has been subjected to massive shoot-at-sight order, arrests and abduction.

          "text": "The National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (Rtd), has stated that in order to deal decisively with the complex nature of terrorism and other transnational organized crimes, the international community must see the threat of terrorism to a particular country as a threat to global peace and security.\n\nThe NSA made this statement on Monday 28 June 2021, at the ongoing Second United Nations High-Level Conference of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies of members states, convened by the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. Antonio Guterres, at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.\n\nGeneral Monguno said terrorism has continued to manifest itself as a vicious and relentless global threat, recognizing no border, nationality, and all religions. He noted that terrorism has become a contemporary weapon of violence for non-state actors in this era of globalization.\n\n\u201cI can say with total conviction that apart from pandemics, natural disasters and the climate itself, today the greatest threat to the existence of human race is the global scourge of terrorism\u201d the NSA stated.\n\nREAD ALSO: Court Gives DSS Permission To Remand Nnamdi Kanu\n\nThe NSA stated that preventing terrorist attacks, safe guiding borders, empowering national police, improving the criminal justice system, curbing illicit financial flows as well as hurting the abuse of drugs and hard substances remain extremely daunting challenges for most nations, including Nigeria in addressing the scourge of terrorism.\n\n\u201cThe fallout of activities associated with jihadist and other forms of terror have collectively heightened insecurity in the greater part of the African continent with serious economic, social, and political implications for its people. In the North-Eastern part of Nigeria, the activities of Boko Haram terrorists and the so-called Islamic State West Africa Province with known affiliation to other international terror networks such as Daesh and Al-Qaeda have continued to undermine the security and livelihoods of the whole of the people, while at the same time overlapping into neighboring countries of the Lake Chad Basin\u201d\n\nIt was disclosed that over a million persons have been internally displaced in the communities in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe states, while over seven million remain in need of humanitarians assistance in North-Eastern Nigeria.\n\nThe NSA noted that social media platforms have become instruments often leverage by terror groups to propagate their ideologies, recruit vulnerable youths, radicalize them and instill fear in the target community, as well as deflate the morale of defense and security forces. He noted that the terrorist groups\u2019 approach is to portray the government as incapable of guaranteeing the protection and well-being of the population.\n\nThe NSA noted that the Nigerian Government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari has continued to confront these challenges by setting up new structures and national institutions as well as empowering them. It states that the Federal Government has improved the coordination of humanitarian supports for Non-Government Organizations by creating the Ministry of Humanitarians Affairs, Disaster Management, and Social Development.\n\nIt stated that in the recent past the President has approved the establishment of the National Commission of the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons as well as the National Commission for the Coordination of Cyber Security. It was equally pointed out that the Government was empowering the National Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) to trace the sources of funding of terrorist organizations.\n\nGeneral Monguno noted that the President\u2019s funding commitment to the first regional organization for countering insecurity- the Multinational Joint Task Force (MJTF), has continued to yield results, diffusing tensions and curbing the activities of Boko Haram and ISWAP within the fridges of the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nThe NSA expressed President Buhari\u2019s commitment to working with all nations, not just those in the sub-region and the African continent but the entire international community. He stated that Nigeria committed to working within the confine of legitimacy and legality in dealing with the multiple problems of security in the country without hurting the sensibility of innocent people, as well as abiding by the international standards of human rights of the people.",

          "text": "President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said he was opposed to mandatory coronavirus vaccinations for Russians but urged the jab-sceptic population to get inoculated, as his country battles a deadly third wave.\n\nHis comments came as Russia earlier Wednesday reported 669 coronavirus deaths over the past 24 hours, a pandemic high of fatalities for the second day in a row, according to a government tally.\n\nRussia in mid-June saw infections spike in a third wave driven by the highly transmissible Delta variant first identified in India, authorities have said, and worsened by a sluggish inoculation drive.\n\nAlthough free jabs have been available since early December, only around 15 percent of Russia\u2019s population had received at least one dose as of Wednesday according to the Gogov website, which tallies Covid figures from the regions.\n\nThe slow uptake prompted Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin earlier this month to order mandatory jabs for service sector employees, with more than a dozen regions in Russia since following suit.\n\nThe widening policy has prompted concerns that all Russians eventually would be required to be vaccinated, which Putin shot down Wednesday while fielding questions in his annual phone-in session.\n\n\u201cI do not support mandatory vaccinations,\u201d the Russian president said.\n\nStill, Putin \u2014 as he has done repeatedly in recent months \u2014 called on Russians to get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to listen, not to people who understand little about this and spread rumours, but to specialists,\u201d he told Russians, the majority of whom polls show oppose receiving coronavirus jabs.\n\n\u201cIf a person is sick without a vaccine, then the long-term consequences can be very serious,\u201d the 68-year-old Russian leader said.\n\nNo lockdown\n\nSurveys show that Russians are particularly sceptical of the country\u2019s homegrown jabs \u2014 Sputnik V, EpiVacCorona, CoviVac and the one-dose Sputnik Light.\n\nPutin said Wednesday that the four homegrown vaccines were better than foreign alternatives, naming AstraZeneca and Pfizer. He added that he himself had been vaccinated with Sputnik V.\n\nThe president\u2019s plea for Russians to get inoculated came after the Kremlin Tuesday conceded that its target of vaccinating 60 percent of the population by autumn will not be possible.\n\nCritics say the third wave has been spurred by the failure to lock down, a measure taken during the first wave last spring but avoided this time by Russian authorities to support a struggling economy.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he supported a new lockdown, Putin said regional authorities were instead promoting localised mandatory vaccinations and other measures to avoid introducing new quarantines.\n\nIn Moscow, the epicentre of Russia\u2019s outbreak, Mayor Sobyanin has ordered businesses to send home at least 30 percent of unvaccinated employees and restaurants to only allow inside patrons who have been inoculated or were infected in the past six months.\n\nThe country\u2019s second-worst hotspot Saint Petersburg has avoided imposing strict restrictions, however, and on Friday it is due to host a Euro 2020 quarter-final drawing hundreds of supporters from abroad.\n\nDozens of Finland supporters were infected in the city after they travelled there earlier this month for their team\u2019s loss to Belgium in the group stage.\n\nNationwide, infections grew on Wednesday by 21,042, bringing Russia\u2019s caseload to more than 5.5 million \u2014 the fifth-highest worldwide, according to an AFP tally.\n\nWith 135,214 deaths from the virus, Russia has the highest official toll from Covid-19 in Europe \u2014 even as authorities have been accused of downplaying the severity of the country\u2019s outbreak.\n\nUnder a broader definition for deaths linked to coronavirus, statistics agency Rosstat at the end of April said that Russia has seen at least 270,000 fatalities.\n\nAPC",

In November, four pro-democracy members of the territory\u2019s legislature were disqualified from their seats in the chamber \u2013 accused of \u2018endangering national security\u2018.\n\n\u201cIn one year, the National Security Law has put Hong Kong on a rapid path to becoming a police state and created a human rights emergency for the people living there,\u201d Yamini Mishra, Amnesty International\u2019s Asia-Pacific regional director, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cFrom politics to culture, education to media, the law has infected every part of Hong Kong society and fomented a climate of fear that forces residents to think twice about what they say, what they tweet and how they live their lives.\n\n\u201cUltimately, this sweeping and repressive legislation threatens to make the city a human rights wasteland increasingly resembling mainland China.\u201d\n\nMedia mogul Jimmy Lai was initially allowed out on bail pending trial, but a court reversed that decision in December sending him back to jail [File: Tyrone Siu/Reuters]\n\nAmnesty based its report on analysis of court judgments, court hearing notes and interviews with activists targeted under the security law during the past 12 months.\n\nIt found that the government had \u201crepeatedly used \u2018national security\u2019 as a pretext to justify censorship, harassment, arrests and prosecutions\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is clear evidence indicating that the so-called human rights safeguards set out in the NSL are effectively useless, while the protections existing in regular Hong Kong law are also trumped by it,\u201d the report said.\n\nPeople charged under the law are denied bail unless they can prove they will not \u201ccontinue to commit acts endangering national security\u201d and Amnesty said that 70 percent of those officially prosecuted under the security legislation are being held on remand. It noted that the presumption of innocence is an \u201cessential part of the right to fair trial\u201d.\n\nAmong those held under the NSL are Jimmy Lai, the retail tycoon turned media mogul who founded the pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily. After being briefly allowed bail under strict conditions that amounted to house arrest, 73-year-old Lai was returned to jail in December. The Apple Daily itself shut down last week after its editor and top executives were also arrested under the NSL and the company\u2019s assets frozen \u2013 also under the law \u2013 which meant it was unable to pay staff and vendors despite having the money to do so.\n\nAmnesty said that as of 23 June 2021, 64 people had been formally charged under the law with 47 in pre-trial detention.",

          "text": "Dozens of people have died in Canada amid an unprecedented heatwave that has smashed temperature records.\n\nPolice in the Vancouver area have responded to more than 130 sudden deaths since Friday. Most were elderly or had underlying health conditions.\n\nThey said the heat was a contributing factor in many cases.\n\nOn Tuesday, Canada recorded its highest ever temperature for a third straight day \u2013 49.5C (121F) in Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nBefore this week, temperatures in the country had never passed 45C. The heatwave is due to a dome of high pressure hovering over the north-western US and Canada.\n\nExperts say climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. However, linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\n\nThe heat is believed to have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 65 people in the city of Vancouver, police say.\n\nThe suburb of Burnaby, meanwhile, reported at least 34 sudden deaths and the Surrey area recorded 38.\n\n\u201cVancouver has never experienced heat like this, and sadly dozens of people are dying because of it,\u201d police sergeant Steve Addison said.\n\n\u201cOur officers are stretched thin, but we\u2019re still doing everything we can to keep people safe,\u201d he said, before adding that daily sudden death calls in the city had more than trebled.\n\nIn the tiny village of Lytton, about 155 miles (250 km) east of Vancouver, resident Meghan Fandrich said it had been \u201calmost impossible\u201d to go outside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been intolerable,\u201d she told the Globe & Mail newspaper. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to stay indoors as much as possible. We\u2019re used to the heat, and it\u2019s a dry heat, but 30 [degrees] is a lot different from 47.\u201d\n\nMany homes in British Columbia do not have air conditioning as temperatures are usually far milder during the summer months. Temporary water fountains and cooling centres have been set up in the Vancouver area.\n\nDozens of officers have been redeployed in the city, while the increased volume of 911 calls has created a backlog and depleted police resources.\n\nThe country\u2019s weather service, Environment Canada, has issued heat warnings for the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, along with areas of Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the second coldest country in the world and the snowiest,\u201d said David Phillips, a senior climatologist for Environment Canada.\n\n\u201cWe often see cold snaps and blizzards but not often do we talk about hot weather like this\u2026 Dubai would be cooler than what we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d\n\nIn the US Pacific Northwest on Monday, temperatures hit 46.1C in Portland, Oregon, and 42.2C in Seattle, Washington, the highest levels since record-keeping began in the 1940s, the National Weather Service said.\n\nA dozen deaths in Washington and Oregon may be linked to the heatwave.\n\nThe heat is intense enough to melt cables, shutting down the Portland Streetcar Service on Sunday.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering why we\u2019re canceling service for the day, here\u2019s what the heat is doing to our power cables. pic.twitter.com/EqbKUgCJ3K\n\nAn electrical utility in Spokane, Washington, has also introduced rolling blackouts to cope with huge power demand as residents run air conditioners.\n\nOne Seattle resident told the AFP news agency that the city felt like a desert: \u201cNormally\u2026 60, 70 degrees is a great day \u2013 everybody is outside in shorts and T-shirts \u2013 but this is\u2026 ridiculous\u201d\n\nAmazon allowed members of the public into areas of its Seattle headquarters as a cooling-off location on Monday, while people in Portland also flocked to cooling centres.",

          "title": "At 100, China\u2019s Communist Party Looks to Cement Its Future",
          "text": "For China\u2019s Communist Party, celebrating its 100th birthday on Thursday is not just about glorifying its past. It\u2019s also about cementing its future and that of its leader, Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nIn the build-up to the July 1 anniversary, Xi and the party have exhorted its members and the nation to remember the early days of struggle in the hills of the inland city of Yan\u2019an, where Mao Zedong established himself as party leader in the 1930s.\n\nDug into earthen cliffs, the primitive homes where Mao and his followers lived are now tourist sites for the party faithful and schoolteachers encouraged to spread the word. The cave-like rooms feel far removed from Beijing, the modern capital where national festivities are being held, and the skyscrapers of Shenzhen and other high-tech centers on the coast that are more readily associated with today\u2019s China.\n\nYet in marking its centenary, the Communist Party is using this past \u2014 selectively \u2014 to try to ensure its future and that of Xi, who may be eyeing, as Mao did, ruling for life.\n\n\u201cBy linking the party to all of China\u2019s accomplishments of the past century, and none of its failures, Xi is trying to bolster support for his vision, his right to lead the party and the party\u2019s right to govern the country,\u201d said Elizabeth Economy, a senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution.\n\nThis week\u2019s celebrations focus on two distinct eras \u2014 the early struggles and recent achievements \u2014 glossing over the nearly three decades under Mao from the 1950s to 1970s, when mostly disastrous social and economic policies left millions dead and the country impoverished.\n\nTo that end, a spectacular outdoor gala attended by Xi in Beijing on Monday night relived the Long March of the 1930s \u2014 a retreat to Yan\u2019an that has become of party lore \u2014 before moving on to singing men holding giant wrenches and women with bushels of wheat. But it also focused on the present, with representations of special forces climbing a mountain and medical workers battling COVID-19 in protective gear.\n\nThe party has long invoked its history to justify its right to rule, said Joseph Fewsmith, a professor of Chinese politics at Boston University.\n\nShoring up its legitimacy is critical since the party has run China single-handedly for more than 70 years \u2014 through the chaotic years under Mao, through the collapse of the Soviet Union and through the unexpected adoption of market-style reforms that over time have built an economic powerhouse, though millions remain in poverty.\n\nMany Western policymakers and analysts believed that capitalism would transform China into a democracy as its people prospered, following the pattern of former dictatorships such as South Korea and Taiwan.\n\nThe Communist Party has confounded that thinking, taking a decisive turn against democracy when it cracked down on large-scale protests in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square in 1989 and quashing any challenges to single-party rule in the ensuing decades \u2014 most recently all but extinguishing dissent in Hong Kong after anti-government protests shook the city in 2019.\n\nIts leaders have learned the lesson of the Soviet Union, where the communists lost power after opening the door to pluralism, said Zhang Shiyi of the Institute of Party History and Literature.\n\nInstead, China\u2019s newfound wealth gave the party the means to build a high-speed rail network and other infrastructure to modernize at home and project power abroad with a strong military and a space program that has landed on the moon and Mars. China is still a middle-income country, but its very size makes it the world\u2019s second-largest economy and puts it on a trajectory to rival the U.S. as a superpower.\n\nIn the meantime, it has doubled down on its repressive tactics, stamping out dissent from critics of its policies and pushing the assimilation of ethnic minorities seeking to preserve their customs and language in areas such as Tibet and the heavily Muslim Xinjiang region. While it is difficult to gauge public support for the party, it has likely been boosted at least in some quarters by China\u2019s relative success at controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and its standing up to criticism from the United States and others.\n\n\u201cWe have never been so confident about our future,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told journalists on a recent trip to the party\u2019s historic sites in Yan\u2019an.\n\nTiananmen Square, where Mao proclaimed the founding of communist China in 1949, is no longer a home for student protesters with democratic dreams. On Thursday, the plaza in the center of Beijing will host the nation\u2019s major celebration of party rule. While most details remain under wraps, authorities have said that Xi will give an important speech.\n\nThe anniversary marks a meeting of about a dozen people in Shanghai in 1921 that is considered the first congress of the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 though it actually started in late July. The festivities will likely convey the message that the party has brought China this far, and that it alone can lift the nation to greatness \u2014 arguing in essence that it must remain in power.\n\nXi also appears to be considering a third five-year term that would start in 2022, after the party scrapped term limits.\n\nThe centennial is at once a benchmark to measure how far the country has come and a moment for Xi and the party to move toward their goals for 2049, which would mark the 100th year of communist rule, said Alexander Huang, a professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan. By then, Xi has said, the aim is basic prosperity for the entire population and for China to be a global leader with national strength and international influence.\n\n\u201cWhether they can achieve that goal is the biggest challenge for the Chinese leadership today,\u201d he said, noting growing tensions with other countries, an aging population and a young generation that, as elsewhere, is rejecting the grueling rat race for the traditional markers of success.\n\nStill, the party\u2019s ability to evolve and rule for so long, albeit in part by suppressing dissent, suggests it may remain in control well into its second century. The party insists it has no intention of exporting its model to other countries, but if China continues to rise, it could well challenge the western democratic model that won the Cold War and has dominated the post-World War II era.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, you only talk, talk, talk,\u201d said Hua of the Foreign Ministry. \u201cYou try to win votes. But after four years, the other people can overthrow your policies. How can you ensure the people\u2019s living standards, that their demands can be satisfied?\u201d",
          "summary": "For China\u2019s Communist Party, celebrating its 100th birthday on Thursday is not just about glorifying its past.\nYet in marking its centenary, the Communist Party is using this past \u2014 selectively \u2014 to try to ensure its future and that of Xi, who may be eyeing, as Mao did, ruling for life.\nTiananmen Square, where Mao proclaimed the founding of communist China in 1949, is no longer a home for student protesters with democratic dreams.\nOn Thursday, the plaza in the center of Beijing will host the nation\u2019s major celebration of party rule.\nThe anniversary marks a meeting of about a dozen people in Shanghai in 1921 that is considered the first congress of the Chinese Communist Party \u2014 though it actually started in late July.",

          "text": "The fighters now retaking parts of Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region will pursue soldiers from neighboring Eritrea back into their country and chase Ethiopian forces to Addis Ababa \u201dif that\u2019s what it takes\u201d to weaken their military powers, their spokesman said Tuesday, as a conflict that has killed thousands of civilians looked certain to continue.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Getachew Reda said that \u201cwe\u2019ll stop at nothing to liberate every square inch\u201d of the Tigray region of 6 million people, nearly eight months after fighting erupted between the Tigray forces and Ethiopian soldiers backed by Eritrea.\n\nHe rejected the unilateral cease-fire Ethiopia\u2019s government declared Monday as a \u201csick joke\u201d and accused Ethiopia of long denying humanitarian aid to the Tigrayans it now \u201cpretends to care about.\u201d Ethiopia declared the unilateral cease-fire as its soldiers and hand-picked regional interim administration fled the Tigray regional capital following some of the fiercest fighting of the war.\n\n\u201cWe want to stop the war as quickly as we can,\u201d the Tigray spokesman said.\n\nBut he said liberating the region is not just about territory. \u201cIf there is still a menace next door,\u201d whether it be in Eritrea, \u201cextremists\u201d from the neighboring Amhara region who have occupied western Tigray or Ethiopian forces, it\u2019s about assuring Tigrayans\u2019 security, he said.\n\nThe comments were sure to bring new alarm from the United States, United Nations and others who have pressed for an end to the fighting in Africa\u2019s second most populous country that has sent hundreds of thousands of Tigrayans into the world\u2019s worst famine crisis in a decade.\n\nThis week\u2019s swift turn in the war has left people scrambling to understand the implications for Tigray, as communications links remained largely cut.\n\nEritrean soldiers, accused by witnesses of some of the war\u2019s worst atrocities against Tigrayans, left the towns of Shire, Axum and Adwa, witnesses said, but it was not clear whether the retreat was temporary. The information ministry of Eritrea, a longtime enemy of Tigray\u2019s former leaders and described by human rights groups as one of the world\u2019s most repressive countries, did not immediately respond to questions.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet know if they are withdrawing\u201d from Tigray altogether, acting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Godec told the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. He said the U.S. had seen no statement from Eritrea saying it was committed to the cease-fire after \u201cwhat appears to be a significant withdrawal of Ethiopian national defense forces from Tigray.\u201d\n\nThe Tigray leaders have waged a guerrilla war since November after a political falling out with the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who had sidelined them from influential roles in Ethiopia\u2019s government and military. An Ethiopian military spokesman did not answer the phone Tuesday.\n\nThe arrival of Tigray forces in the regional capital, Mekele, on Monday was met with cheers. The fighters on Tuesday moved into Axum and Shire, a town that in recent months saw the arrival of hundreds of thousands of people fleeing intimidation in western Tigray and is a key staging area for humanitarian aid.\n\nTigray forces are now in control of much of the region after a major counteroffensive with mass popular support, International Crisis Group analyst William Davison said in a statement. They are \u201cnow in a position to facilitate access to many previously hard to reach areas,\u201d he said, urging Ethiopia\u2019s government not to sabotage the urgent humanitarian efforts.\n\nBut the Tigray forces\u2019 talk \u201cindicates how distrustful they are of the cease-fire,\u201d Aly Verjee, a senior adviser at the United States Institute of Peace, told AP. \u201cOf course, I think it\u2019s highly irresponsible for them to say such things. It doesn\u2019t do anything for people on the brink of famine. At the same time, I understand they\u2019re motivated by deep suspicion of Eritrean forces in particular.\u201d\n\nMajor questions remained about the fate of the more than 1 million civilians that the United Nations has said remain in parts of Tigray that have been hard, if not impossible, to reach with aid. The United States has said up to 900,000 people now face famine conditions, in the world\u2019s worst hunger crisis in a decade.\n\nThat famine \u201cis entirely man-made,\u201d the acting U.S. assistant secretary of state said.\n\nSarah Charles, assistant to the administrator for the United States Agency for International Development, told the Washington hearing that the next week or two will be consequential. She urged Ethiopia to lift a \u201ccommunications blackout\u201d on Tigray and said forces from the Amhara region must lift checkpoints on key roads for aid delivery.\n\nUN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters that \u201cthe impact of the current situation on the humanitarian operations in the region remains unknown right now.\u201d Operations have been \u201cconstrained for the past few days due to the ongoing fighting.\u201d The airport in Mekele was closed, and routes to deliver aid were not open, he said.\n\nEthiopia has said the cease-fire is in part for the delivery of aid but will last only until the end of the crucial planting season in Tigray \u2014 which is in September.\n\nIn Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, people said they weren\u2019t sure who to believe amid the battlefield claims, and hoped for peace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the innocent children, farmers and the poor people that are at the front of the war and are suffering,\u201d resident Biruk Dessalegn said.",

          "title": "NNPC to Borrow $3.8bn to Acquire Dangote Refinery Shares",
          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is planning to borrow $3.8 billion to actualise its agenda of acquiring a 20 per cent stake in Dangote Refinery.\n\nNNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, said Tuesday that the money would be borrowed from financial institutions.\n\nHe said some financial institutions had already agreed to fund the acquisition, while the debts would be paid back from the NNPC\u2019s earnings from dividends and profits accruing from its investment in the fuel plant.\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day refinery, located in Lagos State, which Kyari said had been tentatively valued at about $19 billion, is expected to come on stream in 2022 and will produce 50 million litres of petrol per day.\n\nKyari spoke just as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Secretary-General, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, expressed optimism over the overall conditions of the oil market as the cartel and its allies yesterday began a meeting to herald a resolution on whether to further ease crude oil production curbs.\n\nAccording to Kyari, there is no underhand dealings concerning the extant transaction, as the federal government\u2019s presence on the board of the Dangote Refinery will not only secure its energy needs, but give it a strong voice in the running of the asset to guarantee the country\u2019s security.\n\nKyari, in two separate interviews with two television stations, which THISDAY monitored in Abuja, stated that all the borrowing institutions, including Afrexim Bank, are comfortable with the deal, adding that the federal government will not invest a dime in the deal.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am not sure Mr (Aliko) Dangote wants to sell his equity in the refinery. I can confirm that it was at our instance that we started this engagement and he did not want to sell these shares.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no resource-dependent country in the world that will watch a business of this scale, bordering on energy security which also has implications for even physical security of our country, and you watch it and you don\u2019t have a say.\n\n\u201cWe started this process long before Dangote started his refinery project. We are going to take equities in very significant businesses anchored on the oil and gas operations, for example, fertiliser plants, methanol plants, small condensate refineries and so many other businesses that we are dealing with, so that we can expand our portfolio.\u201d\n\nKyari added that the NNPC has a responsibility to ensure a constant flow of fuel, and as a policy, it will continue to acquire stakes in any refinery in excess of 50,000 barrels per day.\n\n\u201cEven for this Dangote Refinery, we are not going to take government money to buy it. That is the mistake that people are making because they think that we are going to take federation money to pay for these refineries.\n\n\u201cWe are going to borrow on the back of the cash flow from this business because we know that it is viable and it will work and return dividends and it has a cash flow that is sustainable,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari also reiterated that work had begun on the Port Harcourt refinery rehabilitation, while the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts for Warri and Kaduna will be awarded in July.\n\nAccording to him, the net effect is to have an environment where Nigeria becomes the hub for petroleum products supply to change the current dynamics of petrol supply even globally, where the inflow of products from Europe will be reversed.\n\n\u201cWe will award the EPC contract for the Warri and Kaduna refineries within the next two to three weeks, maximum by the end of July, so that these two processes will run concurrently, so that at the end of the day we will have all the refineries working,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari stated that with the current arrangement, petrol will be delivered commercially, adding that part of the requirements of the lenders is that NNPC must not operate the refineries.\n\n\u201cWe must have an operation and maintenance contractor. That means that practically, these refineries will be run by the lenders and the cash flow will be able to support the payments because the bankers have seen that the cash flow will support it,\u201d he added.\n\nHe stated that five similar initiatives were currently in the offing, of which decisions will be taken within three months, with about 200,000 barrels per day combined capacity of condensates.\n\nKyari said: \u201cWe have signed term sheets with the owners of the refineries. I am not sure Dangote will be very happy with this. We are taking 20 per cent equity of the Dangote Refinery. There\u2019s a valuation process because this business is very regulated and very international. No bank will lend money to you to buy equity in any business of this scale if you have not followed the best valuation process.\n\n\u201cThe reality today is that we have a valuation of this refinery. I am not sure, but it\u2019s about ($)19 billion. I do not have an exact figure. We haven\u2019t closed on this, there\u2019s an ongoing engagement. There\u2019s governance around this that we need to conclude and that includes seeking the authority of the Federal Executive Council.\u201d\n\nHe said discussions on acquiring a stake in the refinery started as far back as December 2020, adding that no bank with have anything to do with an asset that is over-valued, because they know that costs won\u2019t be recovered.\n\nKyari assured the public of openness on NNPC\u2019s relationship with the Dangote Refinery, adding that while crude oil will be sold to the company in naira, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will sort out at what value it will come.\n\nHe said the Dangote Refinery would take off spending of freight of about N21, ensure proximity to supply where it can reach anywhere within the country in one day, while dividends will be shared to Nigerians, who are the owners of the corporation.\n\nOn the landing price of petrol, he stated that as of two days ago, it was N256 per litre but added that pump price of fuel will not be increased in the next two months as engagement with the organised labour has not been concluded.\n\nHe said while the subsidy regime wasn\u2019t sustainable, President Muhammadu Buhari was not also keen on taking the product out of the reach of Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the president had directed that current volumes which are unaccounted for must be contained to bring down spending on subsidy.\n\nKyari explained that while there\u2019s an expectation in the Appropriation Act that NNPC will make a monthly remittance of at least N120 billion, only one leg of the NNPC\u2019s funding of the Federation Account has been affected by its non-remittance of funds, like royalties and taxes are still being generated.\n\nHe stated that discussions were being rounded off on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), to see that the passage of the legislation is done within the next two weeks.\n\nBarkindo Optimistic as OPEC+ Decides on Production Easing\n\nEmmanuel Addeh",
