          "text": "\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2Robert Okubo\n\n\u2022No militancy, it\u2019s all lies against Okubo \u2014Andrew Igiri, community leader\n\nBy Emma Amaize\n\nEX-MILITANT leader and former Senior Special Assistant, SSA, to Edo State Government on Surveillance/Waterways Security, Robert Okubo, accused of terrorising villagers and setting up a parallel government at Inikorogha Community in Ovia South-West Local Government area of the state, has rebutted the accusations.\n\n\n\nA community leader, Andrew Igiri, who corroborated his claim, said some people who want to take over Inikorogha by hook or crook were the ones causing trouble in an otherwise peaceful settlement.\n\nI didn\u2019t recruit ex-militants against my people\n\nDismissing the charge that he commandeered the community with ex-militants from neighboring states, Okubo said: \u201cIt is not correct, Inikorogha Community people are living in peace, and they can come for a visit.\u201d\n\n\n\nIs he saying that the Amaokosuwei (eldest man and head) of Inikorogha Community, Joseph Megbuwei, who cried out, recently, that he (Robert) was intimidating the people with ex-militants lied, the ex-militant leader responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think this is coming from the Amaokosuwei to be, because the entire Inikorogha Community is very peaceful and, if this is truly coming from the Amaokosuwei, it means he is doing so under some influence.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe denied constituting a parallel government, saying: \u201cThere is nothing like installation of new executive because the current executive tenure has not ended.\n\nSecondly, nobody was beaten; they came to Inikorogha Community with 15 armed mobile policemen and 35 vigilante members for the installation of the Amaokosuwei, but the Amaokosuwei to be disappointed them by travelling out of the community without letting those that came with him from Benin to know. Nobody was beaten.\u201d\n\nPDP leaders want to take control\n\nHis words: \u201cThe only problem we have in Inikorogha is that some Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, group, under the leadership of Godstime Ogidigba, Atiga Magbuwei, Sunday Kiriya and one Daniel Pere, who is not from this community, are trying to force new executive on Inikorogha people, when we have an execo that their tenure has not expired.\n\n\u201cWe have police post in the community. They can confirm to the world that Inikorogha is peaceful. The PDP guys in government gathered some community elders that stays in Warri, Benin, Lagos etc., and came to try to change the executive when their tenure has not expired.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are just trying to give a dog a bad name to hang it, because I refused to join the PDP. I decided to stay back at All Progressives Congress, APC, because APC is the party that I belong to. They are doing all these things just to bring me down politically, but God Almighty has failed them, because I have done a lot for my people. Ninety-nine per cent of the entire community is with me.\n\n\n\n\u201cInikorogha is a community that I provided with seven boreholes, built a primary school, market, hospital, solar lights; we brought MTN masts and, during former governor Adams Oshiomhole\u2019s era, we gave jobs to 418 persons, including Godstime Ogidigba, Sunday Kiriya etc. Daniel Pere is not from Olodiama Clan and he is just deceiving them,\u201d he added.\n\nI\u2019ve not committed any crime\n\nAsked if he was aware that security agents were on manhunt for him, the ex-militant leader said: \u201cI am not aware that security agents are looking for me. I have not committed any crime that will make security agents come for me. I have worked with them for 12 years now and I don\u2019t have any criminal records.\n\n\u201cThe likes of Daniel Pere, Godstime Ogidigba, Atiga Magbuwei, Sunday Kiriya etc. are trying to use Edo State government against me. What they claimed is happening at Inikorogha Community is just politics. They have lied to the security agents that there are arms and ammunition at Inikorogha and the security agents have visited the community four times with gunboats and drones, without finding anything incriminating.\n\n\u201cThey are just making the government waste money with their lies, just to get appointments and to be relevant in Edo State politics. My question is this, \u2018must you destroy your leaders to become a leader?\u2019\n\n\u201cIn addition to what I said, the Amaokosuwei does not have the right to install anyone of his choice as a community chairman. It must be a collective decision. The Amaokosuwei to be has not even been installed as the community leader,\u201d he stated.\n\nNothing like militancy \u2014Igiri\n\nAndrew Igiri, speaking to Niger Delta Voice, NDV, said: \u201cThere is nothing like militancy, nor any harassment going on in Inikorogha Community. The accusers are only lying and trying to instigating the government against the community, just to give a dog a bad name. Also they have been boasting that it is their government (PDP) that is in power, and that they will be coming to take over the community.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey further lied that Okubo Robert is grooming militants from Ondo, Delta and other states, in the community. They are all lies just to give a dog a bad name.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut there is point of correction, Ijaw communities are governed by Ijaw traditions and not political parties. They also brought in parallel executives, when there is an existing exco in the community working for the overall interest of all. The community executive is headed by Timi Edu, while the youth body is headed by Pereke Ukulor. So, they cannot come from anywhere and put up a parallel executive, when the present executive tenure has not expired.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd again, the community has a working document that is guiding it, which says, and I quote: \u2018Except an executive member is been found wanting in embezzlement, or involved in criminal activities, that is when he or she can be removed from office\u2019; otherwise, they should remain silent.\n\nMore lies against Okubo\n\n\u201cThey also lied to the military and the military came to Inikorogha with gunboats and drones and found out that it was all lies, and they left. Now, the only option they have is to instigate the Edo State government against the community.\n\n\u201cThey also mentioned that the Udo-Inikorogha\u2013Ofunama road contract was awarded to Okubo Robert and that he (Okubo) ate the money. These are all lies, because the above-mentioned road construction was approved during ex-President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration through the Niger Delta Development Company, NDDC, to a construction company called Japaul, and not Okubo, and the road is still left undone by the company,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nIgiri urged Edo State government to disregard those bent on fomenting non-existent crisis in Inikorogha, for selfish reasons.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) has vowed to replace the properties destroyed at Comprehensive Secondary School, Nkume in Njaba council area of Imo State on Monday by gunmen. This is even as the group has disowned the \u201cIPOB Volunteers\u201d alleged to have perpetrated the act.\n\nA statement by the media and publicity secretary of the group said \u201cIPOB leadership is hereby promising to replace those motorbikes burnt in the school to their owners and rebuild school blocks burnt by hoodlums in the name of ESN and IPOB volunteers.\n\n\u201cThis is not to portray or indicate that IPOB committed the heinous crimes against our people and promise to set up tax force to checkmate those parading themselves as IPOB volunteers and those committing this crime against humanity and our people.\n\nWhile promising to set up task force to checkmate future occur nice, Powerful said \u201cIPOB strongly condemn the barbaric act by hoodlums and mentally deranged fellows who disrupted a WAEC exam in a school in Imo State on Monday. What a stupid madness. Whoever was behind such barbarity must be made to pay for their actions.\n\n\u201cWe plead to Biafrans to bear with us for this dastardly act against humanity they are using to disrepute and demomize IPOB in the world. We are calling on the school management and those their properties were destroyed to contact any IPOB office near to them for possible payments of their properties.\n\nEmma Powerful while exonerating its members from the incident at Nkume and Atta has also warned anybody or group who tries to commit crime using its name.\n\nSame vain, Powerful has emphasised that there is no more sit-at-home after Tuesday\u2019s declaration. He also seized the opportunity to reiterate the relax of the order on Mondays till when Nnamdi Kanu would be appearing in court .\n\nHe said \u201cWe the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, wish to reiterate once again, that we have no other sit-at-home order after 14th September.\n\n\u201cAny other purported sit-at-home including the suspended weekly sit-at-home on Mondays does not exist in the dairy of IPOB. In fact, after September 14, there is no other sit-at-home this week. Any contrary news or speculations to this effect should be ignored.\n\n\u201cAnybody trying to enforce any sit-at-home order using the name of IPOB is a saboteur, and does so at his peril. If we catch anybody disturbing the peace of Biafrans or residents in Biafra land under the guise of enforcing non-existent sit-at-home order, such a person regret his actions because he will receive the reward of traitors.\n\nExplaining why the order was relaxed on Mondays ,Powerful said \u201cIPOB is a responsible organisation with reasoning and empathy. We cannot be part of the problem we are trying to solve. We cannot join the enemies to compound the woes of our people we are fighting to liberate.\n\n\u201cThat was why we suspended the ghost Mondays that we earlier declared because of the economic implications to our people. We listened to appeals by the people and reviewed our stance on the matter then. That was why we reduced the sit-at-home protests to the days our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will be making appearances in court.\n\n\u201cThat is enough for now and we stand by it. Anybody trying to impose another sit-at-home order on our people or enforce illegal or imaginary sit-at-home is not IPOB, and must be dealt with. Such a person(s) are working with the enemies to disrepute IPOB, and we won\u2019t tolerate such stupidity.\u201d Powerful stated.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

The public is advised to stay calm as the situation is under control. We shall leave no stone unturned to bring the inmates who escaped back to the custody.\u201d\n\nThe minister said government had also put INTERPOL on notice with details of inmates that escaped, in case any of them attempts fleeing the country.\n\nHe urged fleeing inmates to voluntarily return as they will be eligible for mitigation if they willfully surrender at the nearest law enforcement office.\n\nDaily Sun learnt that the gunmen attacked a military checkpoint located a few metres away from the correctional centre with heavy gunfire before attacking the prison. Two soldiers were confirmed killed while another was injured.\n\nAnother eye witness account, however, said the gunmen attacked an uncompleted building where the soldiers normally hibernate and after that broke into the correctional centre releasing over 100 inmates.\n\nThe account said some officers on guard at the correctional facility were injured, while one of the soldiers who made attempt to flee was shot on the leg.\n\nAssistant Inspector General of Police Zone 8, Ayuba Edeh, said the Commissioner of Police and other heads of security agencies in the state have swung into action to ascertain the cause of the attack.\n\nAregbesola cnfirmed that one soldier and a policeman lost their lives during the attack, while two officers of the custodial service were yet to be accounted for.\n\nHe said during the attack, security officers on duty, comprising 15 soldiers, 10 police officers and 10 armed guards of the service fought gallantly to repel the attack.\n\n\u201cThe facility had 294 inmates as at the time of the attack, many of whom escaped after the gunmen used explosives to destroy three sides of the perimeter fence.\n\n\u201cThe remaining 28 inmates didn\u2019t escape. Meanwhile, some of the inmates who escaped have also voluntarily returned to the facility this morning,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kogi Government has given assurance that security agencies were synergising with relevant stakeholders to unmask and arrest the mastermindof the attack.\n\nCommissioner for Information and Communications, Mr Kingsley Fanwo, in a statement in Lokoja said security agencies had intensified efforts to ensure that those who escaped were re-arrested.\n\nSome of the inmates who escaped during the attack have, however, been rearrested.\n\nHowever, palpable tension has gripped residents of the Confluence state and those in contiguous states as unconfirmed security report had warned of the possibility of coordinated attacks in Kogi state.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "A member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Setonji David, has said the state would proceed with implementation of its recently assented Value Added Tax (VAT) Law nothwithstanding a stay of execution by the Appeal Court in Abuja last Friday.\n\nThe lawmaker, who represents Badagry II Constituency in the House, spoke on a television programme monitored in Lagos, yesterday.\n\nFollowing Rivers State which signed its VAT bill into law last month, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, last Friday, signed the state VAT Bill into law a day after it was passed by the House of Assembly.\n\nOn the same day, Lagos asked to be joined as a respondent alongside Rivers State in the appeal filed by the Federal Inland Revenue Service challenging the judgment of the Federal High Court, Port Harcourt which ruled that Rivers should commence VAT collection.\n\nJustice Haruna Tsammani of the Appeal Court had adjourned to September 16 to hear the application by Lagos and asked all parties to \u201cmaintain status quo.\u201d\n\nBut David said Lagos would continue the implementation of the VAT law pending any order by the Appeal Court ruling otherwise.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos State, we have always clamoured for true federalism. This is consumption tax from the people of Lagos and it should be domiciled in Lagos and used for the people of Lagos. There are so many hassles that have to do with federalism that we are practising.\n\n\u201cWe generate over 55% of the VAT in Nigeria and we get a paltry sum of 10%. Is that fair for a population of over 24 million. We are happy that the Rivers State Government went to court and the court was very clear that VAT was supposed to be a state affair. We have no choice but to follow suit.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Lagos State would go ahead with the implementation of the law despite the Court of Appeal\u2019s \u2018maintain status quo\u2019 ruling, the lawmaker said, \u201cThe status quo is that we have enacted the law in Lagos and the law is in existent and I believe strongly that until another judgment is passed by the Court of Appeal to the extent that what we have done is wrong, the law subsists.\n\n\u201cBy our own understanding, what subsists in Lagos is our own law, until that law is set aside by the Court of Appeal. So, as far as Lagos is concerned, VAT in Lagos will be collected by the Lagos State Government.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that the state does not enjoy special status despite generating over half of the country\u2019s VAT. \u201cAnywhere we can get money to fund the infrastructural development of the state, we won\u2019t hesitate to do it.\u201d\n\nHe said that with the implementation of the VAT law in Lagos, the interest of small businesses has been taken care of by the law.\n\n\u201cThe Lagos Internal Revenue Service is well-placed, doing excellently well and is well-equipped to collect VAT,\u201d David noted, adding that Lagos assisted FIRS to develop its VAT collection through the deployment of the state personnel to Abuja.\n\nOn the prompt passage and enactment of the VAT law in Lagos, David said the bill passed through the normal process though it was passed and signed into the law in less than a week.\n\n\u201cIt depends on the exigency of the situation, we have passed bills like that, there is nothing abnormal about it,\u201d he said on the prompt passage of the bill.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

But with this approval, Nigerian ground handling companies can now charge the same handling rates as their counterparts in the sub-African countries.\n\nA circular signed by Director General of the NCAA, Captain Musa Nuhu, dated September 6, 2021 with the reference number: NCAA/DG/AIR/11/16/315, addressed to \u201cAll Airlines and Ground Handling Companies\u201d (foreign and local) with the subject: \u201cSafety Threshold Ground Handling Charges,\u201d reads in part: \u201cAll stakeholders are invited to note that the new ground handling rates for international and domestic operations will become effective on 1st October, 2021 and 1st January, 2022, respectively.\n\nAll stakeholders are directed to ensure full compliance with the safety threshold ground handling charges. Any change to these charges must be done in formal consultation with and approval of NCAA. Please be guided accordingly.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, Chairman, Association of Ground Handlers (AGHAN), Mr. Olaniyi Adigun, praised the Minister of Aviation Hadi Sirika, for approving the amendment. Also speaking on the impact the previous charges and the current charges would have on the economy, he explained that other African countries charging at $4,000, remit 5 per cent of about $200 to their governments while the Nigerian Government is getting just $20 stressing that the disparity was miles apart and is a lot of capital flight out of the country.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "\u2022Says officers must take initiative, decisive action to defeat threats\n\n\u2022Maintains failure is failure irrespective of the circumstance\n\nKingsley Nwezeh\n\n\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Faruk Yahaya, yesterday, read the riot act to war commanders in terrorism-ravaged parts of the country, saying he would no longer accept excuses for non-performance in the prosecution of the war against insurgency and armed banditry. Yahaya asked commanders in the various theatres of operation to seize initiative and take decisive actions to defeat threats in their respective areas of responsibility.\n\nThe army chief emphasised, \u201cFailure is failure, irrespective of the circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn his address at the opening ceremony of the Chief of Army Staff Combined Second and Third Quarter Conference 2021, held in Abuja, Yahaya stated that the Nigerian Army on his watch would remain resolute and continue to chart the progressive path towards tackling the security challenges confronting the country.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI have directed that serious attention be given to sustaining and improving the tempo in all on-going Nigerian Army operations across the country. I have also directed the conduct of special operations, especially, in the North-central and North-west regions.\n\n\u201cCommanders must, therefore, glean from my command philosophy to ensure that operational and administrative proficiencies of the Nigerian army units and formations are sustained and improved upon.\n\n\u201cCommanders must seize initiatives and commanders must take initiatives, they must take decisive actions to defeat the threats in their respective Areas of Responsibility (AOR).\n\n\u201cI will not again take or accept no excuses. Gentlemen, failure is failure, irrespective of the circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe army chief acknowledged that there were logistic constraints affecting operations across the country and disclosed that efforts were in progress to provide combat enablers that would enhance and boost military operations. He also said concerted efforts were being made to eliminate the threat of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), which had been a major impediment to troops and Operation Hadin Kai.\n\nYahaya acknowledged the imperative of training and retraining of troops for operational efficiency, and reiterated his determination to rebuild fighting skills, capacity, confidence and morale of troops across the theatres of operations through \u201ctraining and more training\u201d.\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff Combined Second and Third Quarter Conference 2021 was the first edition of the conference under Yahaya as army staff.\n\nThe quarterly programme of the Nigerian Army brought together Principal Staff Officers, General Officers Commanding, Commandants of Strategic Army formations, and operational commanders to brainstorm and interact with the Chief of Army Staff on the state of affairs of the Nigerian Army and review its plans for the next quarter.\n\nA major highlight of the opening ceremony of the three-day conference themed, \u201cDeveloping Enduring Strategy to Accomplish Assigned Mission in a Joint Environment,\u201d was the commissioning of seven satellite communication vehicles and conferment of special awards to some distinguished officers.\n\nAmong those given awards was the guest lecturer at the event, Maj Gen Lawrence Ngubane (rtd), who delivered a lecture, titled, \u201cLeadership Development as a Panacea for Accomplishing Mission in a Joint Environment.\u201d\n\nLt Gen Lamidi Adeosun (rtd) and the current Commandant of Nigerian Defence Academy, Maj Gen Ibrahim Manu, were also honoured. Yusuf received the award of Knight of the National Order of Chad conferred on him by the Government of the Republic of Chad for his outstanding performance during his time as Commander of the Multi-national Joint Task Force (MNJTF) headquartered in Ndjamena, Chad Republic.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State government has confirmed a attack on Peigyim village, near Kibori, Atyap Chiefdom of Zangon Kataf Local Government Area, and said 12 people were killed by gunmen.\n\nA statement on Monday by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said the gunmen stormed the village late on Sunday evening.

          "text": "By Chinedu Eze\n\nAviation experts have expressed fear over the federal government designation of two Sudanese airlines to operate to the Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano, just as the world commemorates 20 years anniversary of September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States by al-Qaeda.\n\nInformed source from the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) confirmed to THISDAY yesterday that the federal government designated Sudan Airways and Sun Air Aviation and two Nigerian carriers, Kabo Air and Skypower Express, to operate between the Sudanese city of Umm Badr and Kano in Nigeria, as the two countries have long-term Bilateral Air Service Agreement (BASA).\n\nReacting to the decision of the federal government, former Chief Security Officer of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Festus Adeboye, told THISDAY that the regulatory authority, NCAA, should have considered the security implication of designating two Sudanese airlines to operate to Nigeria.\n\nHe said the threat might not be directly on aviation but on the country because currently, Nigeria is going through security crises that could be exacerbated by further influx of arms from Sudan.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOur regulatory body ought to have considered the security implication of that decision. They should know the security undertone of designating two Sudanese airlines to Nigeria, but maybe NCAA may have made recommendations against it, but the federal government decided to suppress it.\n\n\u201cThey can bring arms to the country through porous security system. Why are the airlines not coming to Lagos, which has all the security apparatus? United Nations airport security personnel and the US Transport Security Administration (TSA) visit and inspect Lagos airport regularly. But a lot of things can be hidden at the Kano airport.\n\n\u201cMaybe this is to help those from Northern Nigeria who sneak out of the country for medical services through Arab countries to Germany to avoid publicity. They don\u2019t want the people to know their health status. With Sudanese airlines, it will be very easy to do that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive Officer of Centurion Securities Limited and the Secretary-General of Aviation Round Table (ART), Group Captain John Ojikutu (rtd), also told THISDAY that Sudan and Nigeria have had a long BASA relationship that resuming air link between the two African states should be nothing to worry about.\n\nHe said: \u201cSudan has been one of the countries we have in our BASAs, and like the Saudi Air, they have been flying to Kano in the days of Nigeria Airways. They went underground like the Nigeria Airways did; if they have decided to begin operations as we are planning too, it will be wrong for us to stop them if there is no strain in our diplomatic relationship.\u201d\n\nBut in his article on 9/11 attacks, Ojikutu pointed out that the possibility of similar attacks in Nigeria is real because there is lack of coordination among security operatives at the airports.\n\n\u201cAlthough there had been no direct reported attacks of bombing on Nigerian airports, the possibility of such attacks is real if one considers the multilateral layers of security agencies at our airports working independently of one another without coordinated effective authority. The setup of the security system at the Nigerian airports today is a challenge to the national security and are still not different from the set up at the US airports before the 9/11 attack,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Ugo Aliogo and Oluchi Chibuzor\n\nA group of social enterprises yesterday announced that the continued suspension of the micro blogging site, Twitter, in Nigeria has cost the country about $360 million in economic revenue in 100 days of its suspension.\n\nThe coalition, which made the announcement, includes groups like Enough is Enough Nigeria (EiE), Paradigm Initiative (PIN), Media Rights Agenda (MRA), Socio-Economic Rights And Accountability Project (SERAP) among others.\n\nIt also claimed that the government, while claiming to promote innovation and at the same time clamping down on tech companies was contradictory to its economic drive promoting national development.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Lagos to mark the 100 days since the government announced the suspension of Twitter, the Executive Director of Paradigm Initiative, Gbenga Sesan, noted that as far as they are concerned, the ban remains illegal as rule of law must prevail in a democratic dispensation.\n\nCiting NetBlocks cost of shutdown tool, Sesan said the blockade costs Nigeria\u2019s economy $250,600 every hour in the last 2,400 hours the federal government banned the platform in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cSuspending twitter in Nigeria is illegal, and we are saying it categorically, as we expect the court to support what we have said because the order to suspend the telecommunications companies was not done with a court warrant.\n\n\u201cMaybe they can now come up with a backdated court warrant, well at that time, the court was on strike, so there was no way they would have obtained it.\u201d\n\nThe group, which is advocating for digital rights and freedom of speech, however, alleged that the government has been making up reasons for the continued suspension.\n\nSesan added: \u201cPlease do not forget that at the beginning they said the reason for the ban was to free the space from the activities of terrorists, and then they claimed it is now safe. My question is if it is now safe why is the suspension still on?\u201d\n\nThe coalition, having also alleged that the measure taken by the federal government in declaring the platform suspended undermines Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence, disclosed that it has taken some measures to call on the government to rescind the suspension of Twitter.\n\nOn his part, the Programme Director, Media Right Agenda (MDA), Ayode Longe, said Enough is Enough(EIE) Nigeria has filed a N5 billion claim at the federal High court in Lagos against four mobile telecommunications operators in Nigeria over the blocking of access to twitter, in a class action on behalf of the companies\u2019 subscribers, including PIN and MRA.\n\n\u201cThis action is founded on the belief that the telecommunications operators have no legal authority to block our access to Twitter. MRA filed a separate suit against the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) challenging its powers to licence social media platforms, following its announcement calling on all social media platforms operating or seeking to operate in Nigeria to register with the commission and obtain a licence,\u201d Longe said.\n\nThey also maintained that since June 4, 2021, Nigeria has not been the same as the effect of the Twitter ban touches all aspects of social and economic growth.\n\n\u201cNigeria has lost at least $360 million in the past 100 days since the twitter ban,\u201d they revealed.\n\nSimilarly, the Executive Director, Enough is Enough (EIE), Yemi Adamolekun, said NCDC was one of the government agencies that made excellent use of the platform to disseminate information during the COVID-19 lockdown for quick updates to the public.\n\n\u201cIn shutting down twitter, you have shut down that effective channel of communication, and we can see the difference because post-Delta variant, as Nigerians have not been engaged as they were at the peak of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis is also not about the platform itself, but about some fundamental structure of governance in Nigeria. The government is afraid of the platform because it is found to supporting young people to give their voice and advocating additional channels to raise money,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Victor Ogunje\n\nA United Kingdom based Nigerian Artiste, Busayo Osakuade , has appealed to the Federal Government to invest hugely in entertainment industry to wean Nigerians from criminal engagements in internet fraud.\n\nThe Ekiti born Nigerian afrobeat star said many of the youth engaging in internet fraud and other criminal activities could have been gainfully engaged in entertainment, if government had made the sector attractive .\n\nApart from checkmating ICT fraud, Osakuade added that entertainment industry had the proclivity to propel the country\u2019s foreign earnings that can help in turning around the nosediving fortunes of the country\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Artiste said this in Ado Ekiti on Monday while interacting with the newsmen on how best to develop Nigeria\u2019s entertainment industry to develop talents.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigerian government should find a platform to bring out more artists especially upcoming artists. Music is fast becoming one of our best exports and with the online streaming avenue, Nigerians can actually earn money in dollars and export their music.\n\n\u201cInternet fraud shouldn\u2019t be an alternative to our youth. We should create enabling environment for them in music, because many of our youth are greatly gifted and government should encourage them through sponsorship and tackling of piracy to boost the industry\u201d, he said.\n\nSpeaking about the decadence in the sector, Osakuade expressed displeasure about how some artistes were not honouring their contracts with record labels.\n\nHe stated that the judicial system is also causing indulgence in breach of contracts, as it takes an awful long time to entertain cases emanating from such criminal act.\n\nThe Artiste said he was making good exploits in music in UK despite his degree in Mechanical Engineering from Ekiti State University and Post Graduate degree in Renewable Energy from the University of Reading, United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cI have been singing all my life, but I took it up as a career about four years ago . Financial incapability and inability to secure a record deal caused the delay in going into full time Music career.\n\n\u201cI listened to dancehall as a kid Shakademus and Pliers, Shaba Ranks, Buju Banton among others was inspiring to me.Then in Nigeria, the likes of 2face & Remedies hit the stage, hence, the Nigerian version of dancehall gave birth to the current afrobeats. So basically afrobeats became my favourite type of music.\n\n\u201cMusic-wise, Michael Jackson, The Lighthouse Family, Seal and a few others are my role models\u201d .\n\nOsakuade, who revealed that he had released seven singles musical albums, said he made a breakthrough in November 2018 with his first album titled \u201cBecause I can\u201d , which he said contained 12 tracks.\n\nHe said afrobeat was taking over the world at the moment and it\u2019s here to stay, saying \u201cHowever, I\u2019m not happy with the attitude of most upcoming artistes I have met. They refuse to see the benefit of working together. They will rather do it all alone because of pride and ego and they end up losing out\u201d.\n\nOsakuade said he was presently making big collaborations with some entertainment promoters on how best to develop local talents wasting away in the country, saying he conceptualised this to rescue some youth and the entire industry from collapse.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Anthony Stimler, a former employee of Glencore Plc West Africa desk, has exposed Diezani Alison-Madueke, ex-petroleum minister in Nigeria, in a bribery scheme in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Stimler confessed in a cooperation deal at the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan.\n\nBloomberg said since Stimler resigned in August 2019, he has been helping a US justice department investigate Glencore and \u201cnumerous\u201d former colleagues as well as confessed to paying millions in bribes to African officials and intermediaries (middlemen).\n\nAccording to the report, Stimler had spent years involved in this illicit activity as far back as 2007 until he pleaded guilty to foreign bribery and money laundering charges in July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I made requests for payments to intermediaries, I was aware that other Glencore traders who worked with me were doing the same thing by directing our intermediaries to make bribe payments to government officials,\u201d the report quoted Stimler as saying in a transcript of his guilty plea.\n\n\u201cI intended that a proportion of the payment to intermediaries operating in Nigeria were to be passed on to Nigerian state-owned oil company officials.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the payment was to influence those officials\u2019 decisions regarding the Nigerian government\u2019s allocations of crude oil cargo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBloomberg reports that in 2017, \u201cprosecutors from the Justice Department\u2019s kleptocracy team filed a case in Houston to seize nearly $145 million worth of assets \u2014 including an $80 million, a 215-foot yacht called the Galactica Star, a $50 million Billionaire\u2019s Row apartment in New York and homes in California \u2014 that it said were purchased for the benefit of Nigeria\u2019s oil minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke, with embezzled funds.\n\nProsecutors said two associates of the minister set up companies shortly after she took office and were awarded contracts to sell large allotments of oil on global markets.\n\n\u201cThe pair were awarded dozens of crude cargoes worth about $1.5 billion,\u201d according to the prosecutors.\n\n\u201cNigeria received little of the proceeds of those sales, which prosecutors say were diverted for Madueke and her associates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne of the primary trading houses that stepped up to buy those cargoes, according to prosecutors: Glencore.\n\n\u201cThey say that over the course of 2013 and 2014, Glencore bought 15 cargoes totalling 7 million barrels from the men, paying more than $800 million. Of that, they contend, roughly a third \u2014 $272 million \u2014 was diverted into an account at a Nigerian bank used for the purchases for Madueke.\u201d\n\nThe report also showed that \u201ca court filing in Stimler\u2019s case makes reference to a \u2018Foreign Official 1\u2019 (Diezani), a high-ranking Nigerian from 2010 to 2015, who had demanded and received bribery payments.\n\n\u201cWhile Stimler began bribing in 2007, often using coded language in emails, the payments appear to have accelerated during Madueke\u2019s time in office,\u201d according to the court documents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cStimler agreed in late 2013 to pay more than triple the usual fees to an intermediary company that would be passed on as bribes for favourable grades and loading dates of Nigerian oil, his guilty plea says.\n\n\u201cThree months later, he and a colleague made another $500,000 payment to be eligible for additional Nigerian cargoes.\n\n\u201cStimler \u2018requested and received approval\u2019 for a Glencore subsidiary to make the payment, prosecutors said, without specifying who granted it.\n\n\u201cLater that fall, he received another request, saying Foreign Official 1 was seeking $300,000 per month from customers of Nigeria\u2019s national oil company, in connection with an upcoming election. Stimler authorized the payment, according to prosecutors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMadueke left office in 2015 and has been living in London. She has been charged with corruption by Nigerian authorities but has so far successfully evaded extradition, and she is under investigation by U.K. authorities as well.\n\n\u201cNow Glencore and some of its executives face the prospect of steep fines and prison in a far-reaching investigation of tactics in numerous countries and commodity markets.\n\n\u201cU.S. authorities pursue such cases because, though they involve events in other countries, the payoffs were made in dollars that pass through the banking system in New York.\u201d\n\nGlencore Plc, an Anglo-Swiss mining company, had described Stimler\u2019s plea as unacceptable, adding that \u201cthe conduct has no place in Glencore.\u201d\n\nIn August, Gary Nagle, Glencore\u2019s new chief executive, said the company has adopted new compliance rules intended to eliminate illicit conduct, and that every person mentioned in Stimler\u2019s case has been disciplined or left the firm.\n\nNagle also mentioned that Glencore no longer works with intermediaries in a move to reduce the company\u2019s business in high-risk jurisdictions.\n\nMeanwhile, Stimler is out on bail in the U.K. and awaits sentencing at a later date.",

          "title": "Meet the startup transforming informal recycling in Nigeria",
          "text": "Being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria faces a number of urban challenges and uncollected trash is high on the list. Waste collection methods driven by local authorities remain inadequate, particularly in rural areas. Furthermore, most Nigerians are not inclined to collect and dispose of their waste properly.\n\nIn Lagos, for instance, where trash volume grows by 15,000 tons daily, only 40% of waste generated is collected and just 13% is recycled each year. The rest \u2013 including materials that could feed the local recycling industry \u2013 litters the streets and clogs open drains.\n\nOver the past few years, trash-for-cash initiatives have emerged in Nigeria, looking to tackle the widespread waste problems by incentivising Nigerians while supplying recycling plants with much-needed materials for processing. One such is Scrapays, founded by Boluwatife Arewa, Tope Sulaimon, and Olumide Ogunleye, all graduates of the Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA).\n\n\u201cIt all started as a project when Tope, Olumide, and I were still undergraduates at FUTA,\u201d Arewa told TechCabal. \u201cAs geoscience students, we understood the environmental impact of waste and thought up a solution. It was called Panti (Yoruba term for waste) initially and during our final year in school, we got into a national program.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe undergraduate project evolved and became Scrapays, a startup using technology to facilitate a decentralised ecosystem for recovering recyclable waste in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe company has changed but the ideology remains the same; we see waste as a commodity or even better, currency,\u201d Arewa said.\n\nHow does Scrapays work?\n\nScrapays\u2019 decentralised model fuses technology, finance, and recycling. It serves two broad sets of users \u2013 waste producers and recycling businesses.\n\nWaste producers are categorized as individuals, SMEs, and enterprises that churn out recyclable waste daily and accumulate them for lengthy periods before requesting for pickup through Scrapays\u2019 online or offline channels; including the USSD shortcode (*347*477#), mobile app, and website.\n\nOn the business side are mobile collectors \u2013 typically young, low-income Nigerians \u2013 that fulfill on-demand recovery requests from waste producers within an area. The group, mostly composed of existing informal waste pickers but open to interested individuals, are equipped with portable IoT-enabled scales, customised carts (which they get upon registration and pay for over a nine-month period), and a designated app.\n\nAfter a waste producer requests a pick-up, the nearest Scrapays collector receives and accepts the request via the app. At the point of collection, sorted waste items are weighed using the digital scales, which communicate the weight (in kilogram) and monetary value on the mobile app.\n\nThe Scrapays workflow. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\nThen there are agents who provide temporary storage facilities for recyclable materials retrieved by collectors. Scrapays allows existing or new businesses and individuals to sign up as agents and make money off their empty spaces for every kilogram of material stored on it. Arewa refers to this model as \u201cAirBnB for recyclables.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like Uber made driving a profession or side hustle for some, even though you weren\u2019t a driver before, Scrapays provides a platform for people currently in recycling businesses or want to go into the business,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth collectors and agents manage their operations through our designated apps, with features like Wallet transfer, collector and agent mapping, account funding, and more.\u201d\n\nFrom the agents\u2019 facilities, logistics partners transport the recyclable waste categories collected to a centralised processing space and sell them off to several local companies that convert the material into finished products. Some manufacturers make tissue paper from waste paper; others use plastics to make fiber for the clothing and textile market; and a few companies recycle glass, metal, copper, and aluminum.\n\nThe financial reward of recycling waste\n\nUsing a wallet-based system, Scrapays operates a revenue-sharing model that allows all stakeholders in the value chain \u2013 from producers to all its partners \u2013 to earn commission per kilogram recovered.\n\nWaste producers get paid directly in mobile wallets and funds can be redeemed in cash or directly transferred to the individual\u2019s account. They can also be used to buy airtime or make purchases on Scrapays\u2019 partner marts.\n\nFor every kilogram of recovered recyclables, collectors get paid a 19% commission. The commission rate for agents is set at 11% for every kg of waste received and verified.\n\nThe newly launched Scrapays USSD version 2.0. Image Credit: Supplied\n\nFormalising recycling in Nigeria\n\nIn Nigeria, the bulk of recyclable waste collection and processing is carried out by informal waste pickers and processors, with unregistered SMEs dominating the billion-dollar recycling sector.\n\nScrapays\u2019 platform helps these informal players manage their funds and operations; improve the waste material collection process by minimising human interference; and mitigate typical losses involved in the supply chain.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos alone, over two million of these businesses exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we do is provide them with the infrastructure and tools to help them control recyclable material recovery while creating sustainable self-managed businesses from it.\u201d\n\nThe web platform also has a list feature, which serves as an online marketplace for industrial listing and trade of recyclables (plastic, metal, lead, copper, aluminum, paper) and \u201cout of use\u201d machinery, cars, trucks, and equipment.\n\nA collector with the customised Scrapays cart. Image Credit: Supplied.\n\n\u201cThe informal guys account for 99% of whatever is recovered and recycled. Their model is what works, they reach the nook and cranny of the country and do recycling effectively. Why not create a system around that and make it scalable?\u201d Arewa said. \u201cOur platform has simply formalised and created a structure around informal recycling.\u201d\n\nScaling the solution\n\nScrapays has been in operation for about ten months, after an initial test period of six months. It currently has 3,000 registered waste producers (households and enterprises) across Lagos and Ogun State, and has recovered about 270,000 kilograms of recyclable materials.\n\nThe startup\u2019s operations have been financed through an internal convertible fund from an angel investor, loans, and founders\u2019 capital. But Arewa has grander plans for the startup, which will require raising significant capital over the next couple of years.\n\nScrapays aims to be in not less than 22 cities in Nigeria over the next 18 months; 10 countries in Africa in 24 months; and five countries in Southeast Asia in 36 months.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re solving isn\u2019t just a Nigerian or African challenge. The same problem is faced in Southeast Asia and Latin America. The per capita municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the ASEAN region is one of the highest in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAt scale, our solution cuts across every developing nation and we\u2019re building in a way that it can be implemented everywhere.\u201d\n\nArewa is also looking to promote a recycling culture among Nigerians, which would significantly increase the amount of waste collected, as the current volume recovered falls short of the demand for recyclables. \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re not able to meet the demand for recyclables, which is why expanding the collection network and producer sensitisation are extremely important over the next few months.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s population is estimated to double by 2050; that\u2019s most likely to result in more solid waste hanging around and more items for recycling.

          "title": "Why Nigeria\u2019s vehicle financing culture is struggling to take flight",
          "text": "Owning a personal vehicle is of economic importance. Next to housing, transportation is often the second largest expenditure for the majority of urban households anywhere in the world. But insufficient purchasing power among middle-class Nigerians coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing puts cars out of reach for over 90% of the population.\n\nIn developed economies, car loans and vehicle financing schemes help people spread out vehicle payments over several months or even years. However, the auto financing space is still very nascent in Nigeria, with available car loans significantly costly and inaccessible.\n\nTwo major factors that influence the access and affordability of vehicle financing in Nigeria are interest rates and the value of the vehicle being financed, according to Gbenro Dara.\n\nOver the past decade, Dara has led four online marketplaces with significant interests in the automotive sector and also pioneered an automated process for used car loans as CEO of Cheki (which was recently acquired by Autochek).\n\nExpensive interest rates\n\nA number of banks and startups currently provide car loans but they aren\u2019t exactly cheap, and accessing them can be difficult due to prohibitive credit criteria and high-interest rates. According to Dara, the latter factor is the biggest drawback when it comes to vehicle financing in Nigeria. \u201cThe interest rates available in the auto financing market is the main challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nFor car loans, banks in Nigeria lend at rates between 18% to 30% per annum compared to an average interest rate of less than 5% available for a 72-month vehicle financing scheme in the United States.\n\nGetting a loan from commercial banks in Nigeria also comes with a lot of paperwork and processes, making their approval rate very low, at about 20%.\n\nMicrofinance banks, on the other hand, are less strict with requirements, as opposed to larger banks which are more focused on mid-to-large corporate clients. Several microlenders have developed vehicle financing programs, which take the asset as collateral. However, they are still not able to offer car loans at significantly lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken out a vehicle loan for 4% per month for a 2-year tenor, and ended up paying almost two times the amount of the invoice value of the vehicle,\u201d Dara said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not entirely the fault of the banks as they derive their interest rates from the prime lending rate of the Central bank of Nigeria.\u201d He however called on banks to do better by innovating more for the growth of the automotive sector in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe tokunbo problem\n\nThe vehicle market in Nigeria remains heavily dominated by imported second-hand cars (popularly referred to as tokunbo), primarily due to the inability of most Nigerians to afford brand new cars, including those assembled locally. According to Dara, the predominance of used vehicles discourages banks from providing car loans.\n\nThere are approximately 15 million vehicles on Nigerian roads with most of them older than 20 years. The average age of private cars in major cities in the country is 14 years, most of which are likely to have been resold to more than five owners. For light commercial vehicles such as danfos and molues, the average age is estimated at 24 years.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, total new vehicle registrations annually in Nigeria are estimated at 400,000 (excluding motorcycles), but only 5% of which are brand new vehicles. The rest are mostly shipped in from North America, Europe, and Dubai.\n\nThese vehicles, which have often suffered accidents, been repossessed, are out of warranty, and with little or no history about prior usage and service, are referred to as \u201cgrey imports\u201d. That is, they are traded outside authorised channels and since they\u2019re not purchased from official manufacturers or accredited dealers, do not come with the service support of the producer.\n\nTo minimise the risks associated with providing credit for imported second-hand vehicles, most banks that finance used cars do so through partnerships with car dealers, and not directly. For example, Tokunbocars.ng is backed by Guaranty Trust Bank, UBA, Zenith, and Sterling Bank.\n\nA drag on the local auto industry\n\nThe lack of proper vehicle financing schemes in the country not only deprives the average Nigerian of a chance of getting a personal vehicle but also has implications on the local automotive industry.\n\nDespite being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria\u2019s new passenger vehicle sales are far behind sales in countries such as South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco.\n\nGlobally, about 80 to 95% of purchases of cars are done through loans and leasing by government or private entities. In the United States, it is estimated that 85% of all new car purchases are financed.\n\nWithout such financing mechanisms available to buy cars in Nigeria, locally-made brand new vehicles are out of the financial reach of most Nigerians, the majority of whom have seen their purchasing power dwindle over the years.\n\nIn 2020, less than 10,000 brand new cars were sold in Nigeria, compared to over 247,000 in South Africa. According to unofficial figures from auto dealers cited by Dara, up to 80% of the purchases in Nigeria were made by the government and large corporations, mostly with bank credit and at non-retail rates.\n\nBeyond the direct impact on how Nigerians commute, the current state of vehicle financing in Nigeria leaves the country\u2019s auto industry facing challenges that stall its growth potential.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

A writedown of MTN\u2019s Afghanistan business without any proceeds from disposal is estimated to cost about R700 million ($49 million) according to undisclosed sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThis move is in line with MTN\u2019s announcement just over a year ago to exit countries in the Middle East over the next three to five years, in order to focus on African markets.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

The pandemic remains a real threat as it continues to spread. Per The Vanguard, Nigeria recorded 790 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, August 11, 2021, the highest in six months.\n\nActive cases in the country now stand at 11,500.\n\nIn case you missed it on Techpoint Africa\n\nIt\u2019s 9 days to SME Clinic 2021.

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

Anybody who wants to waste money should give money to incumbent governors, but when those governors go, nobody will follow the agreement reached. Therefore, our governors are warned. Reluctance or even arrogant refusal to comply with that decision is considered as a coup against the masses of Southern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhile we commend Enugu and Abia States for their efforts to empanel legislation on anti-open grazing, we urge the other states in the South, especially the South East and other lgbo-speaking states of the South South to put in place, necessary machinery to comply with the southern governors\u2019 resolution or be liable for aborting the popular will and desire of our people.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government spent N11.679 trillion on debt servicing while N8.31trillion was expended on capital/development expenditure between 2015 and 2020, according a report titled \u201cAnalysis of the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper,\u201d presented in Abuja yesterday by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ).\n\nA breakdown of the amount showed that in 2015 and 2016, N953.620 billion and N1.475 trillion, respectively, were spent on debt service, while N1.841 trillion and N2.203 trillion went into same line item in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\nThe sums of N2.254 trillion and N2.951 trillion went into debt service in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe N11.679,845,205, 997 five-year debt service profile (2015-2020) also translated to a yearly average of N1.386 trillion.\n\nAt the presentation, the Lead Director of CSJ, Eze Onyekpere, whose organisation has been in the forefront of the campaign for fiscal discipline and transparency in public affairs, stated that Nigeria\u2019s debt had also been increasing in double digits year-after-year since 2015, with the highest increase recorded between 2015 and 2016.\n\nOnyekpere, citing the Debt Management Office (DMO) statistics, noted that public debt stock stood at N12,603 trillion in 2015, N17.360 trllion in 2016, and N21.725 trillion in 2017.\n\nIn 2018, 2019 and 2020, public debt stood at N24.387 trillion, N27.401 trillion, and N32.915 trillion, respectively.\n\nThe highest increase was occurred between 2015 and 2016.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, Nigeria\u2019s public debt increased by 161 per cent, indicating a yearly average increase of 37.74 per cent.\n\nThe CSJ chief executive stated that the debt service figures provided the factual background to the presentation of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF\u2019s) position on consolidated debt.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Consolidated Debt Statement affirms the Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) 2020-2023 as the governing policy strategy. The MTEF states that the MTDS focuses on the development of an optimal borrowing structure to fund the government\u2019s financial gap and needs, taking into consideration borrowing options, cost of borrowing and the associated risks with borrowing.\n\n\u201cUnder the MTDS, the proposed portfolio composition is 70 per cent for domestic debt and 30 per cent for external debt while total debt as a ratio of the GDP has been increased from 25 per cent to 40 per cent; average tenure of debt portfolio is a minimum of ten years.\n\n\u201cIt proposed up to five per cent of the GDP in sovereign guarantees for private companies executing public projects and Promissory Notes is to be issued to settle government arrears, Ways and Means Advance at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and the debt stock of 5 state owned enterprises (SOEs.\u201d\n\nOnyekpere recalled that the Consolidated Debt Statement setting out and describing the fiscal significance of the debt liability of the federal government was expected to process measures to reduce any such liability.\n\nHowever, he regretted that the MTEF\u2019s proposals were about measures to increase the liability, noting that debt as ratio of GDP increased from 25 per cent to 40 per cent and up to five per cent of GDP in sovereign guarantees for private companies executing projects, among others.\n\nHe said Nigeria would continue borrowing in the medium term to finance expenditure, adding that the borrowing projections in the 2022-2024 MTEF contradicts the provisions of the Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS), which sets a portfolio composition of 70 per cent for domestic debt and 30 per cent external debt.\n\nThe trajectory, he noted, was leading to a 50:50 ratio, adding that debt service to revenue would be increasing in the medium term while capital expenditure as a percentage of total federal government spending would be decreasing in the medium term.\n\nSimilarly, he pointed out that from available facts, recurrent expenditure as a percentage of total FGN spending, would be increasing in the medium term.\n\nOnyekpere pointed out that in the FGN Revenue Framework, the share of oil revenue to FGN overall revenue was projected at 43 per cent in 2022, 51 per cent in 2023 and 46 per cent in 2024 while the share of non-oil taxes (VAT, CIT and Customs collection) to FGN overall revenue is projected at 29 per cent in 2022, 28 per cent for 2023 and 34 per cent for 2024.\n\nHe stated that the FGN Expenditure Framework showed that statutory transfers as a percentage of total FGN budget amounted to 4.31 per cent, 5.15 per cent, 5.23 per cent and 4.96 per cent for the years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n\nOnyekpere stated, \u201cDebt service, including Sinking Funds to total FGN budget is 29 per cent, 33 per cent, 39 per cent and 44 per cent respectively for the years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\n\u201cRecurrent non-debt expenditure amounts to 48.94 per cent, 52.11 per cent, 47.81 per cent and 44.29 per cent respectively for the years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\n\u201cThe high level personnel costs as a component of recurrent non debt expenditure (66.4% in 2021; 68% in 2022; 67.9% in 2023 and 67.9 per cent in 2024) is further evidence of the imperative for reducing the cost of governance.\n\n\u201cSpecial interventions funds amounts to 3.04 per cent, 2.94 per cent, 2.61 per cent and 2.39 per cent respectively for the years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\n\u201cCapital expenditure (excluding Government owned Enterprises and statutory transfers) amounts to 32.87 per cent, 23.82 per cent, 20.22 per cent and 18.50 per cent for the years 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively.\u201d\n\nCSJ recommended that MTEFs should be prepared on the strength of high-level overarching national policy instruments, pointing out that a clear successor to the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERHP) should be articulated and made available to Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the organisation, there are references in the MTEF to a Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP), which is neither in the public domain nor a product of the popular participation by Nigerians.",

This is a fantastic achievement and an endorsement of all the good work going on in your department.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the current rating underpins the State\u2019s capacity to service its financial obligations owing to its stronger operating performance driven by IGR, which makes Lagos an outliner in the national context.\n\n\u201cThe assessment reflects Fitch\u2019s view of risk relative to international peers with the ability to recover debt service with the operating balance,\u201d he said.",

The son of Cho Doo-chun and Kim Bok-sun, Cho was the eldest of five brothers and four sisters. He graduated from middle school with honours.\n\nBecause his father\u2019s sock and glove business went bankrupt, he could not afford high school or university tuition. Subsequently, he enrolled in an inexpensive technical high school to learn a trade. At the same time, he began frequenting an American army base near his school, and learned English from soldiers whom he befriended.\n\nHe mastered English quickly, and became an interpreter for the commander of the army base, and also for the principal of his school.\n\nRaised initially as a Buddhist, Cho converted to Christianity at the age of 17, after a beautiful girl visited him telling him about Jesus Christ, before he was diagnosed with tuberculosis.\n\nSensing God calling him to the ministry, Cho began working as an interpreter for the American evangelist Ken Tize. In 1956, he received a scholarship to study theology at Full Gospel Bible College in Seoul. While there, he met Choi Ja-shil, who became his mother-in-law and a close ministerial associate. He graduated in March 1958.\n\nCho had spent more than 44 years emphasizing the importance of cell group ministry, which he believed was the key to church growth, as well as team ministry.\n\nIn November 1976, Cho founded Church Growth International, an organization dedicated to teaching the principles of evangelism and church growth to pastors all over the world. In January 1986, he led the way in establishing the Elim Welfare Town, a facility for the elderly, the young, the homeless, and the unemployed. The latter would be given training and a choice of four occupations.\n\nIn 1988, he founded newspaper company, Kukmin Ilbo. He was Chairman of the World Assemblies of God Fellowship from 1992 to 2000 and did not pursue another term, and has served as Chairman of the Korean Christian Leaders Association since November 1998. He had also served as Chairman of the Good People charity organization since February 1999.\n\nIn 2008, Cho retired, with Young Hoon Lee succeeding him as senior pastor.",

          "text": "A former governor of Nasarawa state and serving federal lawmaker, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, has faulted northern governors planning to ban open grazing in their states.\n\nSenator Adamu who kicked against the move in its entirety, also said movement of herders with their cattle is constitutional while describing anti-open grazing law as unconstitutional.\n\nHe also declared that contrary to yearnings in some parts of the country for a possible southern presidency in 2023, the 1999 Constitution does not make provision for rotational presidency.\n\nThe lawmaker made the positions known while fielding questions from the Senate Press Corps Monday in Abuja.\n\nThe southern governors, had, at the end of their meeting in Asaba, agreed to enact anti-open grazing laws in the region to curb incessant clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nAs at the time of this report, Ondo state Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and his Enugu counterpart, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi had signed the anti-open grazing law, making open grazing an offence in their states.\n\nEl-Rufai, Masari, Ortom on open grazing\n\nAlthough the former governor was not specific on any northern governor, but Kaduna state Governor Nasir El-Rufai and his Katsina counterpart, had at different times faulted the open grazing by cattle herders.\n\nAlso, Benue state Governor David Ortom has signed into law the ban on open grazing amidst criticisms from certain quarters.\n\nSpeaking earlier in the year during a visit to Yola, Adamawa state, Governor El-Rufai had said:\u201cI am a Fulani man. Today, I\u2019m the governor of Kaduna State because I went to school. My parents were settled in one place breeding their livestock.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ranching system has so many advantages. For one, it enables children of herders to go to school and have access to quality education like any other Nigerian,\u201d El-Rufai added, even as he said the northern states would need the federal government\u2019s support to get ranching in place.\n\nSimilarly, while featuring on Channels Television last week, Governor Masari had hinted on the state government\u2019s tacit support for non-open grazing method.\n\n\u201cWe intend to have a law banning (cattle) roaming but before we do that, we would make provisions for where the animals would stay,\u201d the governor said during the programme.\n\n\u201cHerdsmen should stay in one place. Roaming about should not be encouraged. In fact, for us, it is un-Islamic. Why do you have animals that you cannot feed and you have to go to other people\u2019s land and farm and you say that is right? I don\u2019t think it is right,\u201d the governor had said.\n\nMasari added: \u201cWe already have started. The federal government has given us N6.2 billion and as a state government, we are also investing N6.2 billion. The objective is to have Fulanis stay in one place.\u201d\n\nAdamu kicks\n\nBut fielding questions from journalists Monday in Abuja, Adamu said in as much as it\u2019s wrong for any herder to use his cattle to destroy the farms, it is unconstitutionally for anybody to restrict his movement or criminalise cattle rearing business going by provisions of free movement and legitimate business in the 1999 Constitution.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe fact that a governor or two is doing that doesn\u2019t take away the right of herders. Nature abhors vacuum. The duty to protect the right of farmers rests squarely with the governors.\n\n\u201cThe question to ask is that have the governors done the right thing. The answer is no. The stance of some Northern Governors doesn\u2019t change my position against the law which, as far as the provisions of the 1999 Constitution are concerned, is nullity.\n\n\u201cIf you can protect a spare parts dealer, why can\u2019t you protect a herder? If government can save private banks with public money, why can\u2019t we do that with herders? I am for modernisation but the government must address the problem genuinely.\u201d\n\nOn 2023 election\n\nSpeaking on the 2023 presidential election, the former governor said those nursing the idea of zoning or rotational presidency should jettison it since it is not provided for by the 1999 Constitution.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo part of Nigerian constitution provides for zoning or rotation of political offices , meaning that for anybody to become President , he or she must be ready to go through the ballot box .\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just wish away a position that is fundamental to the life of a country. You can\u2019t talk of merit and talk of zoning. The issue of rotation, let\u2019s just go by merit. Let every party find a way of selling itself in a manner as to garner the kind of votes to deliver the presidential result. It is as simple as that.\n\n\u201cWhat we are practicing is democracy which is government of the people, by the people and for the people. It therefore amounts to wishful thinking for anybody to be thinking of zoning to get to office.\u201d",

Regrettably, two officers of the Correctional Service are yet to be accounted for while one soldier and a policeman lost their lives during the attack.\n\n\u201cThe Kabba Custodial facility had 294 inmates as at the time of the attack, many of whom escaped after the gunmen used explosives to destroy three sides of the perimeter fence. However, there remains 28 inmates who didn\u2019t escape. Some have also voluntarily returned to the facility as at this morning.\n\n\u201cThe Controller General of the Nigeria Correctional Service, Haliru Nababa, is currently monitoring the situation. A tour of the facility is also ongoing.\n\n\u201cA Crisis Response Centre has been activated and a Special Taskforce mobilized to recapture escaped inmates whilst an Inter-Agency Security Task Force is already on the trail of the gunmen who attacked the facility. The public is advised to stay calm as the situation is under control.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, assures the citizenry that Nigeria\u2019s security forces will find the attackers and bring them to justice. We shall leave no stone unturned to bring them back to custody. We are also putting INTERPOL on notice with their details, in case any of them attempts fleeing outside our shores.\n\n\u201cWe urge the people, especially the communities around the custodial facility, to be vigilant and report any strange and suspicious persons or activities to the nearest law enforcement agency.\n\n\u201cTo the fleeing inmates, escaping from lawful custody is a serious criminal offence. Law enforcement agencies and citizens are lawfully empowered to use all necessary means to arrest and bring you to justice. You should therefore know what you are up against. You will however be eligible for mitigation if you willfully surrender yourselves at the nearest law enforcement office.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Correctional Service shall not be cowed by elements seeking to compromise the security of our nation; we shall deal with this situation with absolute resolve.\n\n\u201cFurther updates will be provided after the end of the preliminary assessment.\u201d",

          "text": "THE President of the Professional Insurance Ladies Association (PILA), Joyce Ojemudia, has called on African women to come together in order to actualize their God\u2019s given potentials and contribute to Africa\u2019s economic recovery.\n\nShe also advocated that women should be given strategic positions in governance, noting that the hope of the continent would only be brighter if the female gender is a factor in consideration of for strategic positions in governance and policy making across the continent.\n\nOjemudia who is also the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of African Alliance Insurance was speaking at the 2021 Women\u2019s Forum of the African Insurance Organization (AIO) Conference held in Lagos on September 7, 2021, harped on the idea behind PILA Africa Initiative and the need for women to come together.\n\nAccording the idea is to have an umbrella body of female insurance professionals and practitioners in Africa under which members will glean together to harness the rich potentials God endowed us with to ensure women take their rightful place in our various countries and Africa at large.\n\n\u201cPart of that gleaning comes in the form of professional networking, knowledge sharing and mentorship which is why the Theme for this Workshop; an offshoot of the 47th AIO Conference; \u201cWomen Collaborating For Africa\u2019s Economic Recovery\u201d is very apt. Statistics show that women constitute a significant chunk of the demography of African continent with population of approximately 691m. Out of this population, a critical chunk are professionals, including those operating in the Insurance Industry. From these records, coupled with the renewed acceleration of the number of women taking up careers in the professions, the hope of the continent would only be brighter if the female gender is factor into consideration of for strategic positions in governance and policy making across the continent.\n\n\u201cPILA Africa is an initiative of PILA Nigeria, which has snowballed into many other African countries establishing similar associations and a lot more at the verge of concluding their modalities. It is expected that many other African countries here represented, will be encouraged to establish their local associations. PILA Nigeria is ever ready to partner with you in this regard,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile appreciating the past Chairperson of the PILA Africa Organising Committee Dr Mrs Tonia Smart for her great achievements in this regard, she commended the immediate past Secretary General of the AIO, Ms Prisca Soares, whom she said performed her duties meritoriously over the years.\n\nSoares who was described by PILA President as Pillar of the insurance industry not just in Nigeria but also in Africa for her strides was officially honoured.at this event.\n\nSpeaking on the theme \u201cWomen Collaborating For Africa\u2019s Economic Recovery,\u201d Dr. Abiba Zakariah, listed how women can collaborate to contribute to Africa economy to include the unification of the individual country associations; uniting with others female bodies in various countries; Collaborating with global female associations and focusing on strategic directions of meeting agendas.\n\nOn how women can take control of their narrative, she emphasized the need for women to strategize, ensure female child education as well as women participation in politics and policy formulation.\n\nShe also listed the benefits of women Collaboration to include economic growth; achieving the 2030 agenda for sustainable development; achieving the gender parity realization of women rights and gender equality amongst others.",

          "text": "South Korea\u2019s competition regulator has vowed to fine Google the U.S. tech giant, $176.9 million (207.4b Korean won) for allegedly using its dominant market position in the mobile operating system space to stifle competition.\n\nThe announcement which was made on Tuesday by the antitrust regulator or Korea Fair Trade Commission, allegedly stated that Google used its market position to block smartphone makers like Samsung from using operating systems developed by rivals.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Android operating system which currently holds the lion\u2019s share of the smartphone market, ahead of Apple\u2019s iOS platform, was also allegedly practice stifled innovation in the development of new operating systems for smartphones, according to Yonhap News.\n\nYonhap News added that the regulator, which published its decision in Korean, said the tech giant required smartphone makers to agree to an \u201canti-fragmentation agreement (AFA)\u201d when signing key contracts with Google over app store licenses and early access to the operating system.\n\nThat agreement prevented device makers from installing modified versions of the Android operating system, known as \u201cAndroid forks,\u201d on their handsets, Yonhap reported.\n\nThe news site added, The KFTC has asked the tech giant to stop forcing companies to sign AFAs and ordered it to take corrective steps, according to Yonhap.\n\nA Google spokesperson argued that Android\u2019s compatibility program has spurred hardware and software innovation, and brought success to Korean phone makers and developers.\n\n\u201cThe KFTC\u2019s decision released today ignores these benefits, and will undermine the advantages enjoyed by consumers. Google intends to appeal the KFTC\u2019s decision,\u201d the spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.\n\nTuesday\u2019s fine is small compared with the tech giant\u2019s quarterly figures. Last quarter, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet reported $61.88 billion in revenue.\n\nStill, Tuesday\u2019s decision is the latest setback for the tech company in South Korea.\n\nIn late August, the country\u2019s parliament approved a bill that will allow app developers to avoid paying hefty commissions to major app store operators, including Google, by directing users to pay via alternate platforms.",

          "text": "The federal government has projected that it will receive about 55 million doses of vaccines by April 2022 to ensure that more Nigerians are vaccinated against the dreaded COVID-19.\n\nThe Chairman Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on Covid-19, Boss Mustapha made the disclosure on Monday when the PSC briefed reporters in Abuja.\n\nHe assured that with the delivery of doses of AstraZeneca, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson vaccines, in addition to the expected delivery of Pfizer vaccines, there would be enough vaccines to go across the country.\n\nMustapha, who is also the Secretary to the Government of the Federation reiterated that the only way to survive the scourge was to be vaccinated, a fact he said had been reinforced by science and research.\n\nHe noted that although the global cases recorded have continued to decline to about four million cases weekly, the situation still calls for caution because the country and the world are not out of the woods yet.\n\n\u201cTo ease travels for fully vaccinated Nigerians, we are exploring the principles of reciprocity between Nigeria and other nations. For the time being, Nigerians are advised to always carry their vaccination card details or barcode on their electronic devices for easy access especially for those travelling outside the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also disclosed that the federal government has removed India from the list of countries affected by the travel restriction that was introduced on May 4 to mitigate the spread of Covid-19.\n\nHe said India was removed from the list in view of the improved situation in that country.\n\nIn the light of the exemption of India, all non-Nigerian passport holders and non-residents who had travelled to the other countries on the restricted list \u2013 Brazil, Turkey and South Africa-in the last 14 days would be denied entry into Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, the Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) Dr Faisal Shuaib has said there are efforts to implement the policy of vaccine mandate for all federal public workers in order to ensure workplace safety.\n\nShuaib who spoke on Monday at the PSC briefing said with the increasing number of cases of COVID-19 globally, some countries have been instituting vaccine mandates by asking workers to either present proof of vaccination or provide weekly COVID-19 PCR negative results in order to be allowed into public offices.\n\nHe stressed that it was only when eligible persons come out for vaccination and observe the non-pharmaceutical interventions that the country can achieve population immunity and prevent the vaccine from becoming a nuisance and threat.\n\nHe also disclosed that as of Monday, September 12, 2021, the country had attained a national average of 70.4 per cent utilisation of the 2,000,040 doses of Moderna vaccines it received.\n\nAccording to him a total of 4,052,756 eligible persons had received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, comprising of 2,645,020 persons with the first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine and 1,407,736 eligible persons with the first dose of Moderna vaccine.\n\n\u201cConsidering the rapid progress seen in the utilisation of Moderna vaccines, states have been guided not to exceed their 50 per cent utilisation rates for Moderna in order to reserve the second doses for all those already vaccinated.\n\n\u201cMost states have reached this percentage and priority is now focused on administering AstraZeneca vaccine as first dose vaccine in all states,\u201d Shuaib said.\n\nHe warned against an attempt by anyone to produce, procure and sell fake Covid-19 vaccination cards, saying anyone caught illegally transacting would be apprehended and made to face the law.\n\nHe similarly warned that any state found to be condoning acts of corruption in relation to the distribution of vaccines and handling of vaccination cards sent to them will no longer be allocated vaccines.\n\nShuaib said it was the duty of the states to protect the vaccines and vaccination cards sent to them as well as ensure that the vaccines are administered in a safe and effective manner and are made free for all.\n\nShuaib further said: \u201cA recent study by the United States Centre for Disease Control (USCDC) which examined 600,000 COVID-19 cases, revealed that people who were unvaccinated were about four and a half times more likely to contract COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt further showed that those who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 were eleven times more likely to die of the disease and ten times more likely to be hospitalised with the disease\u201d\n\nShuaib also said that the agency has taken steps to ensure that the vaccines are administered in a safe and effective manner and are made free for all.\n\nHe said there is the need for the states to hold their health workers accountable and sanction any health official found carrying out activities contrary to the mandates set by the federal government.\n\nAccording to him, any state found to be condoning these acts of corruption would no longer be allocated vaccines.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo and Olawale Ajimotokan",

We are also putting INTERPOL on notice with their details, in case any of them attempts fleeing outside our shores.\n\n\u201cWe urge the people, especially, the communities around the custodial facility, to be vigilant and report any strange and suspicious persons or activities to the nearest law enforcement agency.\u201d\n\nHe further warned the fleeing inmates, that escaping from lawful custody was a serious criminal offence.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies and citizens are lawfully empowered to use all necessary means to arrest and bring you to justice. You should therefore know what you are up against. You will however be eligible for mitigation if you willfully surrender yourselves at the nearest law enforcement office.

          "title": "OPEC Increases 2022 Global Oil Demand Forecast By 1mbpd",
          "text": "The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Monday expanded its global oil demand forecast for 2022 by almost one million barrels per day (bpd), to 100.83 million bpd. This was a 4.15 million bpd increase from the 2021 figure and a steep hike from the 3.28 million bpd growth projection it made last month.\n\nPegging its optimism of stronger pace of demand recovery on a steady economic outlook in all regions, OPEC stated that vaccination rates had continued to rise, while the COVID-19 pandemic was expected to be better managed, with economic activities and mobility expected to return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nDisclosing this in its September Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), the cartel further confirmed a THISDAY report earlier in the month that though paltry compared to its pre-COVID production figure of nearly two million bpd, Nigeria was unable to meet its oil production quota for the month of August.\n\nBased on secondary sources, the OPEC document revealed that the country was unable to take full advantage of the latest adjustments by the oil producers\u2019 group, and it lost a whopping 114,000 barrels per day in the month under review.\n\nWhile crude oil output increased in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Angola, Nigeria was one of the three member countries, which were unable to fully pump their quotas, the rest being Congo with a deficit of 14,000bpd and Iran with 8,000 bpd.\n\nThe THISDAY report had revealed that despite asking for a higher baseline in August, Nigeria failed to meet the existing quota assigned by OPEC, with the new figures now showing that the country may have lost over 3.5 million barrels of crude oil during the month alone.\n\nMany of the shut-ins, it was gathered, were attributable to assets\u2019 breakdowns, unresolved community issues, as well as shutdowns to carry out routine maintenance, although the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had recently said it was difficult to get its facilities back to production after they were closed down due to OPEC cuts imposed last year because of the pandemic.\n\nBut on its latest demand forecast, OPEC projected that the pandemic would affect demand in the near term and revised down its fourth-quarter demand forecast by 110,000 b/d, to 99.70mn bpd, as well as this year\u2019s non-OPEC liquids supply growth to 170,000 bpd, lower than the forecast in last month\u2019s report.\n\nIt trimmed its world oil demand forecast for the last quarter of 2021 due to the Delta coronavirus variant, saying a further recovery would be delayed until next year when consumption would exceed pre-pandemic rates.\n\nOPEC said in the report, \u201cThe increased risk of COVID-19 cases primarily fuelled by the Delta variant is clouding oil demand prospects going into the final quarter of the year. As a result, second-half 2021 oil demand has been adjusted slightly lower, partially delaying the oil demand recovery into first-half 2022.\u201d\n\nOn the back of the new report, oil prices rose for a second session on Monday, fuelled by concerns over shut output in the United States, following damage from Hurricane Ida.\n\nPrices have risen over 40 per cent this year, boosted by economic recovery hopes and OPEC+ supply cuts, although concern about the Delta variant has weighed heavily on the optimism.\n\nBrent crude rose 67 cents, or 0.9 per cent to $73.59 a barrel, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude also added 66 cents, or 1 per cent, to $70.38, their highest since around September 3.\n\nAbout three-quarters of the offshore oil production in the US Gulf of Mexico, or about 1.4 million barrels per day, have remained halted since late August, roughly equal to what OPEC member, Nigeria, produces.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell Plc, the largest oil producer in the U.S. Gulf, on Thursday cancelled some export cargoes because of damage to offshore facilities from Hurricane Ida, signalling energy losses would continue for weeks.\n\nIn July, OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, agreed to gradually unwind record oil output cuts put in place last year due to the pandemic, by 400,000 bpd a month from August and confirmed the plan at their last meeting on September 1\n\nOn the overall Nigerian economy outlook, OPEC recalled that it grew by five per cent year-on-year in 2Q21, following expansion of 0.5 per cent y-o-y in 1Q21, describing the growth as the strongest since 4Q14.\n\nOPEC said regarding the growth rate, \u201cMore importantly, it mirrors a stable economic recovery, as it marked a third quarter of expansion following a recession in 3Q20. Growth was driven by the non-oil sector, which expanded to 6.7 per cent from 0.8 per cent y-o-y in 1Q21.\n\n\u201cRemarkably, the trade, information and communication, transportation, electricity, agriculture and manufacturing sectors contributed the most to GDP growth. On a quarterly basis, the GDP decreased by 0.8 per cent.\n\n\u201cFor the time being, the re-imposition of lockdown measures to cope with a new wave of COVID-19 has become a more pressing risk.\n\n\u201cIn the short term, the economy is anticipated to pursue its recovery, though high inflationary pressures, liquidity constraints and the impact of and uncertainties related to COVID-19 will provide challenges.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos",
