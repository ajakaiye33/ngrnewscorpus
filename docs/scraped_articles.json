          "title": "Tinubu: Don\u2019t opt for Muslim-Muslim ticket, Babachir warns APC",
          "text": "A former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, has warned the All Progressives Congress against picking a Muslim as running mate to its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who is also a Muslim.\n\nLawal pointed out that Nigerians are still conscious of ethnoreligious factors in politics. According to him, Tinubu would have been running mate to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), when the latter became the candidate of the APC in 2014 but for the discouragement of a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nHe issued the warning while speaking on a programme on Channels Television on Thursday.\n\nTinubu, a former governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the APC, had emerged as the flagbearer of the ruling party on Wednesday.\n\nThere are concerns that Tinubu, a Muslim, might be forced to pick a Muslim running mate from the North where Christians are the minority.\n\nWhen asked if it was time for northern Christians allegedly marginalised to be placated with the nomination of one of them as Tinubu\u2019s running mate, Lawal said, \u201cI will answer this question in a roundabout way. A political party is in the business of winning elections and to win elections you need to get the votes to beat your opponents. The way I see it is that in choosing your vice-president, that must be paramount in your mind. You can have the best ticket but if you don\u2019t win elections, it is a waste of time.\n\n\u201cSo, whatever candidate we are going to choose, we will bear in mind that that vice-president will contribute to winning that election. How does he (or she) continue? It is either he (or she) is popular and can bring in the votes or he (or she) can bring the money that will help our logistics in getting out the votes, so we can win the elections.\n\n\u201cBut then, there is also the requirement that you want to run a united country; you want to run a country where you don\u2019t he friction in the society \u2013 peaceful, settled and everybody goes about their business.\n\n\u201cTo that extent, you must factor in Nigeria\u2019s peculiarities in politics. That is why, for example, in recognition of these peculiarities, the northern governors and the majority of us in the North felt that the presidency ought to shift to the South.\n\n\u201cIt is not a requirement in the Constitution that it has to shift. There is no zoning. But it is so we can have a country that is united; that everybody can go about their business in a peaceful environment.\n\n\u201cIt could have been possible for a northern (presidential) candidate to emerge. But then, you would know that running the country in that manner would have the southern part of Nigeria (to be) hostile to that government. So, we allowed it to shift.\n\n\u201cNow, extending that consideration to the Muslim-Muslim ticket, I have lived among the Christians and I know that among the Christians, the question of a Muslim-Muslim ticket is a no-go area. It is dead on arrival. Buhari himself, even at that time, had to drop this present presidential candidate (Tinubu) because of the tension of a Muslim-Muslim ticket. And we have not seen anything in the country that has changed significantly to allow that to happen.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, it has worsened. The religious divide has increased. Tribal divisions have increased. Regional divisions have increased. So, it would be a good thing if APC would settle for a Muslim-Christian ticket because we know (that the) PDP, that is what they would do.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The just concluded special convention of the All Progressives Party (APC) to pick its presidential candidate was like no other in the ruling party\u2019s seven-year-old history. It was characterised by drama, twists, turns and even myths.\n\nIn the first place, the primary was postponed a record six times. And just when Nigerians had readied themselves to the seemingly last date tweaking of Monday June 6, eagerly awaiting the official unveiling of its presidential flagbearer, the date was pushed forward, yet, again to Tuesday, June 7. Tellingly, APC officially declared its presidential candidate just a few hours to the June 9, deadline for parties to hold their primaries. Its Presidential Primary election did not end until well after 2 p.m. on June 8.\n\nWe all expected to see a consensus candidate which, the nation was told, was what President Muhammadu Buhari and the party\u2019s leadership were pushing for, hence the postponement upon postponement of the D-day. At a time, we were told that the governors had asked northern aspirants to step down for a southern candidate to emerge; that, they had pruned the number of aspirants to just five, from which a consensus candidate could be picked by Mr. President. Apparently, not everybody agreed. One aspirant, out of youthful exuberance declared that there would be \u2018crisis\u2019 if his name was not on the ballot.\n\nThen, the chairman of the party, Abdullahi Adamu at a meeting with the National Working Committee members told them that Senate President, Ahmed Lawan was the consensus candidate. He said that this decision followed consultation with President Buhari.\n\nExpectedly, this drew the ire of many party faithful who for one reason or other did not consider Lawan a popular choice. The outrage apparently forced Mr. President (who had earlier enjoined the governors to allow him choose his successor) to make an about-turn and declare in a press statement that he has \u201cno anointed candidate\u201d. That was how the consensus option failed and election became a fait accompli.\n\nIn a way, it can be argued that eventual winner of APC\u2019s presidential primary election, Bola Tinubu, has Abdullahi Adamu to thank in a way, for letting out Lawan\u2019s name at the time he did. Supposing the so-called consensus candidate\u2019s name was made known at the convention ground, after the preliminary welcome speeches by the president?\n\nRemember that Lawan joined the race late, just as Abdullahi Adamu came in at the 11th hour to become the consensus candidate for the post of national chairman.\n\nEven with the party forced to go into election, observers expected only the five aspirants pencilled down by the 11 northern APC governors (a powerful group) to slug it out at the ballot box. These are Messrs. Bola Tinubu, Yemi Osibanjo, Rotimi Amaechi, Kayode Fayemi and Dave Umahi. Surprisingly, all the 23 persons who bought presidential nomination forms, including the 10 whom the screening committee had separated as not having much political weight to stand as the party\u2019s presidential candidate, were all allowed into the fray.\n\nSome of the aspirants were little known; many people were not even aware that some were APC members. It turned out to be the largest number of presidential aspirants contesting for a party\u2019s ticket. The huge nomination fee of N100 million rather than deter, seemed to have attracted more aspirants. Looking deeper, I see that many joined the race because they believed somehow, that they would be anointed by President Buhari because of their closeness to him.\n\nFor particularly aspirants from the southeast, the impression they gave was that there was some kind of agreement that the presidency would be ceded to that part of our country and each believed he is close enough to Mr. President to be picked by him as his favoured candidate. Ikeobasi Mokelu talked about his relationship with Buhari dating way back before 2015 when he assumed office as president. Ogbonnaya Onu immediate past Minister of Science and Technology let it be known that he it was who paid for APC\u2019s registration fee from his personal pocket. He had been with the ANPP, Buhari\u2019s earlier party and one of those that merged to become, APC. Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi state had been acquainted with Buhari from the days when they were both in ANPP and he has sustained that friendship to-date. It was most probably the reason he decamped from PDP to APC months ago, believing that he would be favoured by Buhari to be his successor. Chibuike Amaechi, most probably considered himself the most likely favoured because he is the \u2018poster boy\u2019 of this administration, given his achievements as transportation minister especially in the rail transport sector; he had served Buhari twice as director-general of his campaign (2015, 2019) and delivered on both occasions as Buhari won the elections. He sited the Transport University in Buhari\u2019s home town of Daura and was conferred with a chieftaincy title (Dan Amana) by Buhari\u2019s Emir.\n\nVice President Osibanjo, considered to be Mr. President\u2019s right-hand man as a loyal deputy, did not clinch the ticket. Alas, all the long-standing personal friendships, political friendships, working relationships, over the years with Buhari came to naught as the president did not give them a nod. The friendships cum relationships turned out to be a myth somehow.\n\nYet another twist at this APC primary was stepping down of no less than five aspirants (including the only female one) for Asiwaju Tinubu. One had thought that the egos of especially, Akpabio, Amosun and Fayemi would not allow them to forgo their ambitions for Tinubu.\n\nWhat about the high dramas in the run up to this primary? Take the case of the Central Bank of Nigeria boss, Godwin Emefiele reportedly purchasing the nomination form, challenging in court the provision that he should resign before contesting as an APC presidential aspirant? And the intrigues under which former President Goodluck Jonathan was going to be drafted in as the ultimate consensus candidate? Up until the last minute, so to speak, some still believed Jonathan would make it. Some people continued to protest with placards, demanding that he be given the ticket as consensus candidate.\n\nDrama, twists, turns, myths; Nigerians saw them all, demystified.",

          "text": "From Fred Itua and Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nAs the Friday, June 17 deadline issued by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to political parties to submit names of their presidential standard bearers draws closer, tension has enveloped the camps of the two major political parties as they struggle to pick running mates.\n\nWhile the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Atiku Abubakar, is expected to pick from the Southern part, the All Progressives Congress (APC) is required to balance its ticket by going to the northern axis.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nBeyond ethnic balance, the parties are also expected to reflect religious equilibrium.\n\nFor the PDP, names that have been bandied as possible running mates for Atiku, a Muslim from North East, include Governors Nyesom Wike, Udom Emmanuel and Ifeanyi Okowa all from the South South as well as former deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, Emeka Ihedioha and deputy senate president, Ike Ekweremaduboth from the South East. A common denomination among them is that they are all Christians. In the last one week, Atiku has held series of consultations with PDP governors and other stakeholders on the choice of running mate.\n\nHowever, the ruling party may be thrown into fresh crisis over the choice of running mate for its candidate.\n\nPrior to his victory, political pundits, religious leaders and party faithful, had pondered on who Tinubu, a southern Muslim, would pick as deputy from the North.\n\nAPC and Tinubu are in dilemma because picking a Christian from the north would be a hard sell to the predominantly Muslim populated region while running on a Muslim-Muslim card would be a political setback nationwide of monumental proportion.\n\nIndeed, since the return to democratic rule in 1999, major political parties have avoided fielding either Christian-Christian or Muslim-Muslim tickets in a bid to balance the religious sentiments in the country.\n\nAn attempt in 2015 by the APC to have Tinubu as running mate to Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, a northern Muslim, was stoutly resisted by party faithful led by former Senate president, Bukola Saraki, which paved the way for the emergence of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, a southern Christian.\n\nMultiple sources told Daily Sun that the APC was in a fix on who to pick as Tinubu\u2019s running mate.\n\nIt was, however, learnt that with the conclusion of the APC primary, negotiations and lobbying for Tinubu\u2019s running mate kicked off with northern Christians like Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State; Secretary to the Federal Government, Boss Mustapha and former Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakbubu Dogara, being considered, among others.\n\nLeader of the House of Representatives, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa said Tinubu\u2019s running mate may come from the North-East.\n\nOne of the sources said Tinubu\u2019s Islamic background was one of the reasons many party leaders did not support his candidacy. He said picking a Christian minority from the North could be counter-productive, especially in the North West, where they are largely Muslims.\n\nHe said if APC picked a Muslim running mate, it would amount to handing over victory to the PDP on a platter, explaining that the Christian community in Nigeria would mobilise its members against the party at all levels.\n\nHe said options may have been narrowed down to North East and North Central. He also listed some possible names that are being considered by the party, to present as Tinubu\u2019s running mate.\n\n\u201cAs it stands today, the party won\u2019t take that risk. APC is not as popular as it was in 2015. Nigerians don\u2019t support APC like they did in 2015. So, the party knows that if it fields a Muslim running mate from the North, Atiku Abubakar will win even without campaigning.\n\n\u201cSo, options have been narrowed down to North Central and North East. The party is seriously considering Simon Lalong, governor of Plateau State and chairman of Northern Governors\u2019 Forum. He\u2019s formidable and can get the support of Northern Christians.\n\n\u201cIf Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State were to be a Christian, he would have been the best bet. Unfortunately, he has been ruled out. For now, Lalong appears to he the only option from the North Central.\n\n\u201cNorth East has more options. The current Secretary to Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, is the leading possible running mate from the North East being considered. He is from Adamawa State. At least, he has that national appeal.\n\n\u201cAnother option is Yakubu Dogara from Bauchi State. He is not very popular and the Tinubu camp don\u2019t trust him because of what he did in 2015. Remember he worked with some elements and denied the South West, especially Tinubu\u2019s man, Femi Gbajabiamila.\n\n\u201cGbajabiamilawas supposed to be the Speaker, but Dogara violated that pact and worked with the PDP to achieve that. Tinubu may not accept him as a running mate. Beside, he\u2019s not popular in the North.\n\n\u201cIn the coming days, the picture will become clearer. There are also moves to allow President Buhari to pick Tinubu\u2019s running mate since his endorsed candidate didn\u2019t win the primaries. If that\u2019s the case, Lalong or Mustapha are possible candidates.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has warned the APC against presenting candidates of same religion for the 2023 poll threatening legal action.\n\nPastor Bayo Oladeji, media aide to CAN President told Daily Sun that the Christian body stood by its previous statement opposing political parties fielding Muslim/Muslim or Christian/Christian candidates as presidential and vice presidential candidates.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet\u2019s state it clearly again that Muslim/Muslim or Christian/Christian ticket for the 2023 general election particularly the presidential election is not acceptable to us. APC tried it in 2015 and they failed. God frustrated them. They will fail again this time if they try it.\n\n\u201cMuslim President (Buhari) and Christian Vice (Osinbajo) have been in power in the past seven years and we know the level of verbal and physical persecution and attacks Christians have faced in Nigeria, not to talk of Muslim/Muslim ticket as being rumoured.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no religion that doesn\u2019t have people that would man critical positions in Nigeria. Why then choose from same religion when there are different religions in Nigeria? That won\u2019t be acceptable to CAN and we will work, legally and otherwise to frustrate the plans.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

We have been able to locate the imprints of the perpetrators of that attack, and from all indications, we are zeroing in on the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP).\n\nIt is not an ethno-religious thing. The ISWAP members, wanting attention and recognition, are suspected to have carried out that attack and we have directed all the agencies concerned to go after them and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\nThe IGP said that 10,000 additional police officers will be graduating next month, and would be added to the security architecture to enhance efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, Baba said the police will be leading other security agencies to monitor the June 18, 2022 elections in Ekiti State and over 17, 000 police officers and men have been mobilised to maintain law and order during the election.\n\nMeanwhile, President of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Pogu Bitrus, has insisted that the government knows where the terrorist are but has refused to do anything about their activities.\n\nDr. Bitrus noted that Nigerians were no longer interested in which group, between ISWAP or Boko Haram, carried out the attack, but wanted the government to do something about arresting the ugly trend of bloodshed in the country.\n\n\u201cIf Sheikh Ahmad Abubakar Gumi could visit their location, then, the government knows where they are.

The fact that the government has not destroyed them means that the government is complicit in all of these,\u201d he insisted.\n\nFor pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, the attack was an act of terrorism as well as a declaration of war against the Southwestern part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith what happened in Owo, the Yoruba are being provoked into war because they know that the land has been infiltrated and surrounded by armed militias,\u201d it said.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the group, Jare Ajayi, said killings have continued across the country because the Federal Government has been treating acts of terrorism by suspected Fulani with kid glove, which runs contrary to the way and manner it had handled similar occurrences in other parts of the country in the recent past.\n\nThe organisation lamented that Nigeria is now ranked alongside countries like Ukraine and Venezuela where human lives are at a very high risk.\n\nAlso, the Yoruba self determination group, Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide said the attack has vindicated its earlier position that Fulani terrorists were behind the dastardly act.\n\nLeader of the group, Prof Banji Akintoye, in a statement issued by his Communication Secretary, Maxwell Adeleye, in Ibadan, Oyo State, yesterday, said \u201cThe declaration of the Nigerian Government that ISWAP was responsible for the Owo Massacre is a vindication of our earlier position that Yoruba Land has been encircled by Fulani foreign terrorists disguising as herdsmen.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, reinstate our earlier position that the government of Ondo state should declare an emergency on the activities of Fulani herdsmen in Ondo state. All Fulani herdsmen operating in Ondo should be profiled. Those in the bush must be flushed out.\u201d\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "By Gabriel Dike\n\nA day after securing the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has released his manifesto.\n\nThe former Lagos State governor promised to lead the country to a new era of economic prosperity with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 12 per cent annually, decentralise the police, create jobs, increase the education budget to 25 per cent and health to 10 per cent, put an end to incessant strikes by workers in tertiary institutions, secure and stabilise the country, increase electricity generation to 15,000 megawatts and ensure 24 hour power supply while also halting fuel subsidy.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThis was contained in a document titled \u2018My Vision for Nigeria\u2019, signed by his Director of Media and Communication, Mr. Bayo Onanuga.\n\nTinubu said as president he would launch a new National Industrial Policy focused on special intervention to reinvigorate specific strategic industries.\n\nHe also said he would create six new Regional Economic Development Agencies, which would establish sub-regional industrial hubs to exploit each zone\u2019s competitive advantage and optimise their potential for industrial growth.\n\nThe presidential aspirant also promised to formulate a new national policy on agriculture to boost food production.\n\nHe promised new commodity exchange boards, while also strengthening the one in Lagos to guarantee minimum pricing for agricultural products such as cotton, cocoa, rice, soya beans, corn, palm kernel, and groundnuts.\n\nTinubu also promised to \u201cBuild A New Nigeria (BANN)\u201d by developing a National Infrastructure Plan, which would cover strategic roads, bridges, rail, water, power, seaports, and airports spanning the length and breadth of the country.\n\nHe said his administration would combine government funding, borrowing, public private partnership, private sector financing and concession to initiate a medium and long-term financial model for the BANN initiative.\n\n\u201cI will focus on stimulating jobs, which will be my top priority as President. I will get Nigeria to work by launching a major public works program, a significant and heavy investment in infrastructure, and value-adding manufacturing and agriculture.\n\n\u201cMy administration will build an efficient, fast-growing, and well-diversified emerging economy with a real GDP growth averaging 12 per cent annually for the next four years, translating into millions of new jobs during this period\u2026\n\n\u201cA vibrant and thriving democracy and a prosperous nation with a fast-growing industrial base, capable of producing the most basic needs of the people and exporting to other countries of the world. A country with a robust economy, where prosperity is broadly shared by all irrespective of class, region, and religion. A nation where its people enjoy all the basic needs, including a safe and secure environment, abundant food, affordable shelter, health care, and quality primary education for all. A nation founded on justice, peace, and prosperity for all.\u201d\n\nTinubu said there would be no need for fuel subsidy because \u201csupply will come from local refineries, and the forces of demand and supply will determine the price of petroleum products. My administration will establish a National Strategic Reserve for Petroleum Products to stabilise supply during unexpected shortages or surplus periods. This will eliminate any form of product shortages and prevent wild swings in prices.\u201d\n\nHis administration, he said, would eradicate strikes by tertiary institution workers by encouraging the institutions to source for funds through grants and corporate sponsorships, with all the institutions granted financial autonomy.\n\nThe APC presidential candidate promised to increase the funding for health care in the annual budget to 10 per cent. According to him, the National Health Insurance Scheme would be relaunched to grant health insurance cover to most Nigerians.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "Despite court cases of alleged massive frauds hanging on his neck, former Governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu was on Wednesday officially declared the presidential candidate of the party.\n\nTinubu polled 1,271 votes at the election which was held at Eagle Square, Abuja.\n\nFormer Rivers State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi trailed with 316 votes, while Vice President Yemi Osinbajo garnered 235 votes.\n\nSenate President Ahmed Lawan and Governor Yahaya Bello polled 152 and 47 votes respectively.\n\nChecks by SaharaReporters revealed that the fraud cases against Tinubu dated as far back as 1998, raising questions about how the former governor struggled to delay the axe of the law.\n\nOn February 18, 2009, SaharaReporters obtained original copies of a judgment in the case of United States versus Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in which Tinubu was charged (along with other defendants) in a case of massive drug trafficking and money laundering.\n\nThis judgment directly relates to (and further documents) the SaharaReporters report of September 16, 2008 \u2013 How US Federal Agents successfully Linked Tinubu to Drug Trafficking Ring in Chicago.\n\nThe United States of America, by its attorney, Michael J.

The speculation, which has yet to dissipate since then, is that Tinubu completely owns or is a major shareholder in the company.\n\nIn the same vein, the state has also never denied claims that the company takes about 10 percent of the internally generated revenue of Lagos, estimated in 2016 to be about N40 billion every month.\n\nThe court process was still ongoing when on October 27, 2020, hoodlums burnt the documents during the riotous #EndSARS violence in the state.\n\nThe court papers stating charges brought against Tinubu, his tax consultancy firm, Alpha Beta Consulting, by Apara were burnt, according to claims by Tade Ipadeola, Apara\u2019s lawyer.\n\n\u201cEverything in Igbosere High Court got burnt including the registrar\u2019s copy of our application.

          "title": "INSIDE STORY: Nigerian women battling to keep traditional cloth weaving from extinction",
          "text": "This report was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.\n\nHis striking, vulnerable eyes pounced on every object in the large earthen compound where he gathered his toys. Mojeed flocked around his 25-year-old mother, Taiwo Abduljelil, while she got busy with cloth weaving. His father was also seated at the entrance of the compound where he was weaving a bundle of polychrome threads. Mojeed was born a few months after Nigeria announced its first total lockdown in March 2020 as part of measures to check the spread of the COVID-19 in the country. So, they call him \u201cCorobaby\u201d. A happy child, Mojeed, teetered from one end of the compound to the other as though on an undercover mission \u2013 from his mother to the father and paternal grandmother who weaned him.\n\nAlthough the lockdown was not observed in Iseyin, a rustic Yoruba community in Oyo state, south-west Nigeria, where Mojeed and his parents live, the effect of the economic shutdown in Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital, and the nation\u2019s capital city was felt everywhere. States locked their borders to curb the spread of the virus; there were travel restrictions and businesses began to nosedive.\n\nFor most households in Iseyin where traditional cloth weaving is the major source of livelihood, they all disembarked from the wooden loom. They had woven enough clothing materials at home, but there was no one to buy them. Hunger and frustration dealt a massive blow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaiwo and her husband, Jelil, had nowhere to go. They had no other business or means of survival and life became unbearable. Yet, they welcomed Mojeed into the world with open hands.\n\n\u201cIt was a tough time for us. The pandemic and the restrictions came to us unexpectedly. We had to stop working and we were sleeping all day. That was when we had our third child, Mojeed. I do not pray to witness such a pandemic in my lifetime again,\u201d Taiwo said.\n\n\u201cWe suffered. We sold out the materials we had at home for peanuts just to feed. I took my children to my mother-in-law to take care of them. Businesses have started picking up again, but so many of us have not recovered from the shock of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore COVID-19 disrupted the traditional cloth weaving business in the community, Taiwo, who only attended a basic primary school, would wake up at 6 am, cook for the family, feed the children and step out into the compound to begin the business of the day. She used to weave two packs of materials daily. A pack, which consists of eight pieces of woven materials, is sold for N800. In other words, she used to make N1,200 daily. But the pandemic altered everything.\n\n\u2018WE SURVIVED COVID BY LUCK\u2019\n\nIt was 4 pm and the blazing sun was already lowering its gaze. Under a huge mango tree, 40-year-old Oluwayemisi Kehinde was at her best as she shuttled a small wooding boat across threads and locks them with the reed. Her feet were swift on the pedals of the ofi, which is the local name for a loom. The warp was long, about ten meters away from the ofi where she sat to knot it with the weft to form a beautiful pattern.\n\nIn Yoruba language, aso means cloth; so, aso-ofi loosely translates as the hand-woven textile from the loom. The process is hectic and takes days, from sorting the raw cotton or synthetic fibres to combing, spinning and warping \u2014 all done manually.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOluwayemisi has been making aso-ofi for over 20 years \u2013 from 7 am to 6 pm. She only rests on Sundays. Her dexterity and energy were contagious as she answered questions smoothly without a break from weaving. She learnt the job when she dropped out of school after her primary education.\n\nAccording to her, the height of the COVID-19 pandemic was the toughest period she has ever experienced over two decades of making aso-ofi. She sold out all the materials she had in store for lesser amounts. At some point, Oluwayemisi fed her six children with mangoes. Schools were shut, so they all woke every morning thinking about where the next meal would come from.\n\n\u201cWe feed our family and also pay children\u2019s school fees with proceeds from this business. Customers used to come to Iseyin from different parts of the country to order various designs, quality and brands of our material. Suddenly, they disappeared, and we starved,\u201d Oluwayemisi said.\n\n\u201cI used to sell a pack of aso-ofi for N5,000 or 6,000 depending on the quality because I use 100 per cent cotton. I can make ten packs in three days. So, things were good for us and we were able to meet our needs. Now, the profit has thinned owing to the recent increase in the materials we use, but the demand is increasing because we make quality aso-ofi here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeaving is the primary employment of many women in Iseyin. As business starts picking up again, Kehinde works twice as she used to just to make life better again. But Rebeccah Ayodele says with the absence of capital, they are still finding it hard to heal.\n\nRebeccah, a 43-year-old mother of two, practically eats and relaxes on the loom just to make up for the time lost to the pandemic. As soon as she places her feet on the pedal at 8 am, she works till 9 pm under the cover of darkness. Sometimes, her husband puts on an electricity-generating set for illumination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn a pack of material, I make a profit of N500 to N1,000, although I used to make more before COVID happened. Things were so bad that feeding became a huge problem. We prayed fervently and waited endlessly for the pandemic to end,\u201d Ayodele said.\n\nKudirat Azeez, a 26-year-old expectant mother, survives on a paltry N500 she makes from producing a component part of the reed. She retreated to her bedroom when the pandemic knocked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nResuming back to work after the COVID-19 restrictions were relaxed, the women found out the cost of materials had tripled. They had no choice, So, they diversified. Instead of waiting for ceremonial seasons when the material is in high demand, they now use the fabric for bags, shoes, belts, pillows, suits, upholstery and interior decorations. The supply to Ibadan, Abeokuta, Lagos and other urban cities across the country has begun to improve.\n\nASO-OFI: A COMMUNITY\u2019S LIFELINE\n\nIn Iseyin, the making of traditional fabrics is not just an art or trade, it is a religion. The ancient community is reputed as the home of aso-ofi also known as aso-oke as it reportedly began there some centuries ago. In fact, the art of traditional cloth weaving reflects in their ancestral praise.\n\nYears back, in a typical Nigerian ceremony beaming with colours and glam, aso-ofi used to be the centre of attraction. It is the staple of special occasions like a coronation, wedding, chieftaincy, festival, naming ceremonies, burials and other important ceremonies. Some are sewn into agbada, trousers, cap; and for the women, iro and buba with a shawl. How thick and colourful the signature design of the material shows the social and economic status of the wearer.\n\nCall it a relic of the past, it has struggled over the years to keep itself relevant in the contemporary fashion industry. While it may no longer enjoy the popularity and huge patronage of the past owing to the prevalence of imported textile materials in the market, aso-ofi has maintained its class among the royals and the rich. Most of the textiles imported into the country include brocade, ankara, damask or lace materials from China, Japan, the United States, Malaysia and India, according to the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS).\n\nNigeria has a huge appetite for importation. In 2019, the Nigerian Textile Manufacturers Association (NTMA) says the country spends $4 billion importing textiles annually. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) trade report shows that the importation of textile and textile articles rose year-on-year by 258% in the first three months of 2021 to N171.8 billion from N48 billion in the same period of 2020.\n\nAccording to Chimera Iheonu, a research analyst at Kwakol, a finance and technology firm, textile importation undermines the domestic industry and leads to job losses. Despite the ban on forex for imported finished textiles in Nigeria to protect local producers, foreign products are still making their way into the country.\n\nWHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR ASO-OFI?\n\nEven at that, the women artisans, mostly uneducated, are doubling their efforts to ensure aso-ofi gains wide acceptance again. Despite the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on small-scale businesses, they have decided to keep the craft alive and boost their family income. For them, it is beyond a livelihood. It is a communal activity that was passed from one generation to the other and must not go into extinction.\n\nSuch is the case of Raimot Lateef, an 18-year-old senior secondary school student at Islamic Girls High School, Iseyin, whose father taught weaving at a very young age. Rukayat, Ramot\u2019s 22-year-old elder sister, is also a prodigy at the job.\n\nAccording to Moshood, their father, teaching her daughters how to weave fabrics is to ensure they have the skills that can fetch them money in the future and not go hungry or stranded. He said he believes female children should be empowered to fend for themselves and also contribute significantly to their families when they eventually get married.\n\nSo, as soon as Raimot comes back from school in the afternoon, she eats, freshens up and mounts the loom to weave some fabrics till late in the evening. Yet, she believes the time she spends weaving cannot stop her future ambition of becoming a doctor.\n\n\u201cWhen I am not weaving, I create time to do my assignments and read my books. I was born into traditional weaving and I have been doing it since I was six years old. I really enjoy weaving these fibres into fabrics,\u201d Raimot told this reporter, while she was busy weaving.\n\n\u201cI use part of the money I make from the job to buy the things that I need. I also use it to pay my school fees and that is what I will use to purchase forms for the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) examinations next year. I hope to continue with the craft after secondary school and when I become a doctor.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is still anxiety among weavers in the community about how technology may disrupt the indigenous industry. In 2012, some weavers organised a rally in Lagos to protest the influx of China-made aso-ofi in the market. They said the machine-woven fabric with oriental blend was counterfeit.\n\nOn September 27, 2016, during World Tourism Day, the Oyo state government launched the aso-ofi festival in the community with the aim of preserving the rich cultural values of the craft and also giving the fabric a global appeal. The aso-ofi international market and museum were also inaugurated.\n\nAccording to Wasiu Olatunbosun, commissioner for culture and tourism, the exportation of aso-ofi textile products to various countries across the world has been in existence from time immemorial before COVID-19 disrupted the supply. He added that the export has improved the state\u2019s internally generated revenue.\n\n\u201cAso-ofi textile products are being exported to United States, United Kingdom, Brazil, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, among others. Recently, the state facilitated a N5 million loan from the Bank of Industry (BOI) at a very low-interest rate to the weavers and also influenced the direct supply of cotton to them. This is really important as the state is currently focused on boosting its revenue base through tourism and other non-oil sectors,\u201d the commissioner told TheCable on phone.\n\nThe government\u2019s commitment to the development of aso-ofi means a lot to the women weavers in Iseyin. The resumption of export of the textile translates to more money to feed the family, take care of themselves and pay for children\u2019s education.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

Today it makes its first major foray and vouches to \u201ccontinue to surround ourselves with young and ambitious entrepreneurs from francophone Africa to build together a pan-African giant of FMCG and financial services distribution.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2021 by Ali Ouattara and Amidou Diarra, two former managers at Glovo and PepsiCo, Diago operates exclusively in Abidjan, the capital city of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and one of the biggest French-speaking cities in Africa.\n\nChari said in a statement that Ouattara and Diarra, who had initially sought funding and market and tech advisory before choosing to exit to the Moroccan, will remain CEO and COO, respectively.

Just last month, a Nigerian autotech startup Autochek travelled up north to acquire Moroccan KIFAL Auto. Now, Chari is acquiring a West African startup.\n\nBelkhayat said the company is currently raising a big series A. If Belkhayat\u2019s 2-year-old startup, with just about $7 million funding, has already made 3 acquisitions and is operational in 3 countries\u2014Morocco, Tunisia, and now Cote d\u2019Ivoire\u2014who knows what he\u2019d do with the \u201cbig series A\u201d when it finally closes?\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Boomplay, a Chinese-owned music streaming platform for African artists and songs, has launched in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nToday, the platform opened the doors of its Ivorian offices in Abidjan to enhance music streaming, and help Ivorian artists reach a broader audience within and outside the continent.\n\nCote D\u2019Ivoire marks the 6th African country with Boomplay\u2019s presence after Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana and Cameroon.\n\nSpeaking about the launch, Boomplay C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire General Manager, Paola Audrey Ndengue, said, \u201cWe\u2019re particularly proud to establish a presence in Abidjan, a creative and cultural hub in the region. The warm welcome our team has received from artists, local partners and stakeholders is a strong indicator for us moving forward. Boomplay is committed to contributing to the dynamism of the Ivorian music industry\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no available data on the growth of the Ivory Coast\u2019s music streaming industry, several of its artists have risen to prominence in the past few years due to an increase in streaming services. For example, French singer-songwriter Kikimoteleba rose in Spotify\u2019s ranks when his hit single Tigini exceeded 15 million streams. Others have also been thrust into the spotlight on social media; the Nigerian remix of Aboutou Roots La Blessure, for instance, have been used in thousands of videos across the internet.\n\nThe role these streaming services play in democratising income for Ivorian artists cannot be understated especially as many artists depend of live performances for their income. Guy-Constant Neza, an Ivorian label manager at Believe Digital told Lemonde that 80% of Ivorian artists\u2019 income comes from live performances. Streaming platforms, according to Neza, provide \u201ca double awareness among our artists, of both the limits of the existing model and the opportunities that streaming offers.\u201d\n\nWith the launch of Boomplay, Ivorian artists now have access to 70 million active users on a platform where they\u2019ll be paid per stream/purchase.\n\nThe company has a freemium model similar to YouTube where users can play music for free but with ad intermissions, or pay for an ad-free version.\n\nAccording to Director of Artist and Media Relations, Tosin Sorinola, \u201cThis physical presence extends Boomplay\u2019s mission to promote local talent by providing them with a platform and resources within and outside of the service, which enables them to reach a wider audience of music lovers across the continent. We are delighted to provide a transparent service which ensures that artists get due revenue from their music streaming.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Ikpea Esq, dated May 12, 2022 and titled \u201c SUPPRESSION OF REPORTED CASE BY POLICE OF GRUESOME ATTACK, ASSAULT AND THREAT TO LIFE OF MRS QUEEN OKOJIE BY INSPR MONDAY AIDOMOH OF MOPOL 60, IYAMOH\u201d, Mrs Queen Okojie stated that Inspector Monday Aidomoh had openly boasted to eliminate her under the guise of accidental discharge and nothing will happen thereafter, due to an irreconcilable differences between her and one Netty Abu said to be a lady friend of the embattled police Inspector.\n\n\u201cWe are informed by our client that one Inspr Monday Aidomoh of Mopol 60, Iyamoh, has a lady friend by name Netty Abu who runs a store beside our client\u2019s residence.\n\n\u201cInspr Monday Aidomoh is attached to Setraco/Hartland Estate. He passes by our client\u2019s residence and store when going and coming from the Estate, situate at the far end of the road.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between Netty Abu and our client has been so strained because of constant quarrels between them always caused by Netty Abu. In short, Netty Abu has had cause to apologize to our client in a public Newspaper on one occasion and at another had rang bell around Auchi town in her bid to appease our client. Despite the above, she does not want to see our client.\n\n\u201cIn his bid to please his lover, Inspr Monday Aidomoh has taken sides with Netty Abu by trying to revenge or fight for her with our client. This has made Inspector Monday Aidomoh to openly boasted to our client that he will eliminate her under the guise of accidental discharge and nothing will happen thereafter. He has on occasions openly called our client \u201cAshawo\u201d (Harlot) to the hearing of the public\u201d. The petition stated in parts.\n\nThe petition which was submitted to the office of the Commissioner of Police in Benin City on May 16, 2022 further alleged that \u201cHe (Inspr Monday Aidomoh) subjected our client\u2019s son, Sulieman Amin, a 10 years old child, to frog jump for a distance of over 100ft under the pretence that the child poured water on him.\n\n\u201cOn 11/12/2021, Inspr Monday Aidomoh met our client in front of her house when our client was about entering her gate in company of one Florence and started reigning insults on her by abusing her with indecent words. When she returned the insult, Monday Aidomoh assaulted her by beating, tore her clothes and took her phone (Techno Canon 15) costing over N150,000. Up till now he has not returned the phone and clothes he tore\u201d.\n\nS.A. Ikpea Esq decried the lukewarm attention the police is giving to his client\u2019s case.\n\nHe expressed his disappointment when he referred the Commissioner of Police to his client\u2019s initial petition on the same case.\n\n\u201cIn order to avoid repetition, we hereto attach as Annexure \u201cA\u201d, a petition captioned \u201cPetition On A Case Of Gruesome Attack, Assault And Threat To Life Against Inspr Monday Aidomoh Of Mopol 60\u201d, dated 13/12/21, written by J.A Abolagba & Co, a firm of Legal Practitioners. The petition was received by your office on 20/12/21. It contains most of the criminal acts against our client and her child committed by Inspr Monday Aidomoh.\n\n\u201cOn receipt of the petition by your office, the matter was referred to your X-squad for investigation and one Inspr Idemudia was made the IPO. Our client was invited by your X-squad. She went there 3 times with her son. They only took her son\u2019s statement but she adopted the contents of her petition. The X-squad men came to Jattu and interviewed the DPO at Jattu who confirmed certain facts to them. One Florence made statement to your X-squad as our client\u2019s witness when they came to Auchi. Since that day, Monday Aidomoh has been threatening to deal with Florence. She works inside Hartland Estate where Inspr Monday is attached to.

I recall when you gave me the first mandate in 2015 to 2019.\n\n\u201cI recall that there is no Senator ever that did the kind of empowerment I did for you. I know a lot of projects were done across the ten local government areas, from markets to water projects, to electricification project, to building of classroom blocks,\u201d\n\nIn his remarks earlier, the State APC Chairman, Mr Stephen Ntukekpo said he was directed by the party at the national level to carry out the re-run, and cited infractions in the first primaries as the reason for the re-run.\n\n\u201cThere was some infractions in the primaries held about some weeks ago and I was directed by the National Working Committee to carry out a re-run.\n\n\u201cWe have about five aspirants in this exercise.

The aspirants are Sir Joseph Akpan, DIG Ekpo Udom, Obong Emem Ekperikpe Ekpo, and Senator Godswill Akpabio,\u201d Ntukekpo said.\n\nOne of the aspirants Obong Emem Ekperikpe Ekpo announced that he was stepping down for Akpabio.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe first primaries took place on May 28th and all of you were there. Today, our Father has joined the race. I, Obong Emem Ekperikpe Ekpo, former member of the House of Representatives, a son of this senatorial district, I plead with all my delegates to identify with our father, and I return all the delegates to vote for him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should do anything to undermine the person God has given to us as a leader. The person is Senator Godswill Obot Akpabio. I call all my delegates once again to support him. With that, I have withdrawn my aspiration to the Senatorial seat\u201d.\n\nThe five- man committee to monitor the primaries was led by the Chairman, Sir Sylvester Okonkwo, Secretary, Alhaji Salisu Isa, and Mrs Bunmi Imole, who was the returning officer, among others, as well as officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission .",

Sometimes it takes the things we see as disappointments to happen for elevation to come.\n\n\u201cIt happened many times in the bible, just like the case of Joseph. I\u2019m a man after God\u2019s heart.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like King David in the bible. I communicate with my God and He guides me every day. I wronged my wife May from the way I went about it, and I have apologized to her sincerely from the bottom of my heart, but in the eyes of God things are different.\n\n\u201cGod blesses differently. His ways are not our ways. Our destinies are different. Don\u2019t be deceived by the white man\u2019s culture.\n\n\u201cSame White people that condemn polygamy are encouraging men to marry their fellow men. In the end, judgement is for God. Even white people don\u2019t understand God fully. Nobody does, actually. That\u2019s why He remains God.\n\n\u201cMany great men in the bible had one wife, many great men in the same bible also had more than one wife.\n\n\u201cAnd if that happens to be your destiny God will elevate you and elevate all that concerns you through it.\n\n\u201cMy wife May just signed her first endorsement deal. Something that never happened all these years. And this came from what many saw as a disappointment.\n\n\u201cI have realized that God\u2019s ways are different. Many more deals will still come to her cos she\u2019s a wonderful person.\n\n\u201cSo is my wife Judy. She has also been elevated. Now widely known, her career is bigger with a whole lot going for her as well.\n\n\u201cLet me not even talk about myself. My stardom has tripled. My name is being mentioned in places it never got to before. My children are blessed.\n\n\u201cSummary: The ways of God are different. Our destinies are not the same. You may not understand another man\u2019s destiny and that\u2019s because you\u2019re not supposed to, except your own.\n\n\u201cIf God gives you more than one wife it will come with blessings and elevation.

          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) chose Bola Tinubu, a former Lagos State governor, as its presidential candidate after weeks of intrigue and uncertainty.\n\nThe 70-year-old politician was able to rally northern governors to his cause, handing crushing defeats to other younger and more nimble contenders, including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nTinubu, Osinbajo, and Rotimi Amaechi, the former Minister of Transportation, were neck and neck a few weeks before the national convention, despite the odds favoring Tinubu.\n\nGovernors Simon Lalong of Plateau State, Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna, and Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State were among those who publicly backed Amaechi.\n\nThe governors, however, had closed ranks and allied with the former Lagos State governor three days before the poll.\n\nAccording to the findings of the DAILY POST, the governors assessed Amaechi\u2019s candidacy against former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and concluded that the chances were poor.\n\nThe governor of Jigawa State, who had openly expressed support for Amaechi, subsequently resigned and called his people to rally behind Tinubu.\n\nAccording to an insider, after President Muhammadu Buhari declared that governors should support him in choosing a candidate, the governors met multiple times, but it became evident that more governors preferred Tinubu.\n\nThe insider also said Amaechi\u2019s campaign also slowed down after his resignation as Minister, therefore, creating doubt in the minds of those willing to back him.\n\n\u201cDuring those meetings, Governor Umar Ganduje, Gboyega Oyetola, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Babagana Zulum were clear on their position as far as their favourite candidate is concerned. Also, the declaration by Abdulahi Adamu on Ahmad Lawan as consensus candidate united the governors to pick the strongest of the candidates,\u201d the source said.\n\nIt would be recalled that the National Chairman had announced the Senate president as the choice of the president as the consensus candidate.\n\nThat same day, some governors, including Nasir El-Rufai, Umar Ganduje, Babajide Sanwo-Olu came to the National Secretariat and had a meeting with some members of the NWC; however, Adamu shunned the meeting.\n\nUndeterred, the governors went to Adamu\u2019s house in the Villa around 1 a.m., to make it clear they will not accept Lawan.\n\nAnother insider told DAILY POST that the governors wanted to make it clear to Adamu that they are the owners of the party.\n\n\u201cSince (Adams) Oshiomhole left, the governors have been in control of the party. They know the antecedent of Adamu. What played out at the convention was to make it clear that they are the one to pick the successor of President Buhari.\n\n\u201cOn the choice of Asiwaju, they looked at who has the capacity to go head to head with Atiku Abubakar in the general election. The governors have a huge stake in the election. If the APC should lose the presidential election, it will affect their senatorial elections as most of them want to move to the Senate and also elect a successor,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cFor the governors, it was more of a logical reasoning, nothing more, and Amaechi fell short of the expectation,\u201d the source further explained.\n\nTinubu, in his acceptance speech, also corroborated this, when he said he did not know what he told the governors, but they gave him their total support.",

          "text": "As national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Tinubu, savours his victory at the presidential primary, the party is said to be in a dilemma over who to pick as his running mate for the 2023 election.\n\nVarious caucuses in the party are reportedly behind the push for eight names as likely preferred choice as running mate.\n\nNo fewer than six camps in the APC in the North are backing separate individuals, including serving and former state governors, as well as ex-ministers who played key roles at the conventions that produced the current APC national officers and the just-concluded presidential primary in Abuja.\n\nThe eight names that have so far emerged included a leading critic of the APC federal administration.\n\nAll the names that have been thrown up are Governors Babagana Zulum (Borno), Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Abubakar Badaru (Jigawa), Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano) and Samuel Lalong (Plateau); former governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Honourable Yakubu Dogara and the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha.\n\nZulum is reportedly being considered by the Progressives Governors as their likely choice, against the deal a source said Tinubu had with Shettima, the arrowhead of his campaign organisation ahead of the recent primary.\n\n\u201cThe only drawback for Kashim Shettima is that he\u2019s not Hausa/Fulani and that it will be the first time Hausa/ Fulani will not be represented in government. The same holds for Dogara, Boss, Lalong.\n\n\u201cAnother source claimed that there is a strong push for Bishop Hassan Matthew Kukah who retires later this year to balance the ticket, in spite of his occasional acerbic views on the APC federal administration.\u201d\n\nSome said Tinubu\u2019s emergence as APC candidate has been generating ripples, particularly in parts of the North, with leaders of the northern political establishment going back to the drawing board to re-strategise on the way to ensure that the interest of the North in the power locus is defended and preserved after the next general election in the country.\n\nIt was learnt that the power brokers have not ruled out the possibility of a Muslim-Muslim ticket for APC if it hopes to win the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe Muslim-Muslim agenda is said to be the response of the Northern establishment to a raging campaign in the North that many prospective voters are threatening to vote against the APC if it fails to pick a Muslim from the North as running mate to Tinubu.\n\nAccording to them, apart from one or two persons, APC lacks a figure in the mould of Atiku that can rally Christian politicians from the North to guarantee victory for the ruling party.\n\nThe source added: The APC is likely to fly a Muslim/Muslim ticket because some influential members of the northern establishment have insisted that they do not want a Christian vice president in the North.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no Christian who can match Kashim Shettima in the entire North. Dogara can\u2019t win more than Tafawa Balewa Local Governnent Area in Bauchi State. The SGF, Mr Boss Mustapha, is neither Hausa nor Fulani and can\u2019t win in multi-ethnic Adamawa State.\n\n\u201cLalong is neither Hausa nor Fulani stock, so the majority Hausa Fulani may not accept him. Let\u2019s look at the turn of events, something tells me it will be a Muslim/ Muslim ticket.\u201d\n\nHowever, some influential members of the northern establishment are said to perceive Lalong \u201cas not being part of them.\u201d\n\nHe is seen as a member of the ethnic minorities who are spread across such states as Plateau, Benue, Kogi and Niger. Besides, Lalong, who is the current chairman of the Northern Governors\u2019 Forum, is said not to enjoy the support of some camps of other presidential aspirants apart from that of former minister of transportation, Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nHe was accused of dodging other aspirants when they visited his state to lobby delegates to the primary.\n\nThose pushing for el-Rufai to become running mate claimed that it was the key demand of delegates when Tinubu visited Kaduna to lobby them.\n\nIn their opinion, it was time for him to accede to the demand in order to keep the governor in Nigeria after his tenure ends in May next year.",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has announced June 17, 2022 deadline for the submission of list of presidential candidates and their running mates, as well as candidates for the National Assembly, by all the political parties.\n\nSpecifically, it warned that the dedicated portal for the submission of list of candidates for national elections will automatically shut down at 6.00pm (1800hrs) on Friday 17th June 2022.\n\nAnd for the governorship and House of Assembly elections, the list of candidates shall be uploaded from 1st to 15th July, 2022.\n\nINEC\u2019s deadline\n\nINEC Chairman Professor Mahmood Yakubu made the announcement at a meeting with Resident Electoral Commissioners (REC) Thursday in Abuja.\n\nHe said only the names of candidates that emerged from democratic primaries as provided by Section 84 of the Electoral Act 2022 shall be submitted.\n\nYakubu said: \u201cAll primaries end today Thursday 9th June 2022. For the next one week from tomorrow 10th June 2022, all Political Parties are required to submit their list of candidates for national elections (Presidential/Vice Presidential, Senatorial and House of Representatives) latest by Friday 17th June 2022.\n\n\u201cFor State elections (Governorship/Deputy Governorship and State Houses of Assembly), the list of candidates shall be uploaded from 1st to 15th July 2022 as already provided in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election already released by the Commission.\n\n\u201cAll political parties are required to upload the details of their candidates for each constituency to the INEC Candidate Nomination Portal (ICNP). To achieve this objective, four officials recommended by each of the 18 political parties were trained on the procedure for uploading the nomination forms to the dedicated web portal.\n\n\u201cConfidential Access Codes to the portal have already been given to each Political Party to facilitate the uploading of its nominations.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor emphasis, the Commission wishes to remind Political Parties that only the names of candidates that emerged from democratic primaries as provided by Sec. 84 of the Electoral Act 2022 shall be submitted to the Commission. Similarly, the list of all Presidential and Governorship candidates must be accompanied by the names of their running mates (i.e. Vice Presidential and Deputy Governorship candidates) without which the nomination is invalid.\n\n\u201cAll nominations must be uploaded to the portal on/or before the deadlines. The portal will automatically shut down at 6.00pm (1800hrs) on Friday 17th June 2022 for national elections and 6.00pm (1800hrs) on Friday 15th July 2022 for State elections. With this innovation, the Commission has eliminated the physical interface between party officials and INEC staff for the purpose of submitting the list of candidates for the 2023 General Election.\n\n\u201cA Nomination Centre has been set up here at the Commission\u2019s Headquarters to receive and process all nominations by political parties, including dedicated telephone lines to serve as Help Desk for any Party that may need assistance. In our avowed commitment to openness and transparency of the process, the media will be invited to the Nomination Center so that Nigerians will see our level of preparedness for the exercise,\u201d the commission further said.\n\nTinubu, Atiku\u2019s search for running mates\n\nThe announcement came on the heel of intense search for running mates by both the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nWhile former Lagos state Governor Asiwaju Bola Tinubu from the South-west emerged the APC presidential candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who hails from the North-east, was elected the PDP standard bearer.\n\nWith the two candidates being Muslims by faith, the choice of who becomes their running mates has become a dilemma to them as well as their political parties.\n\nTinubu/APC\n\nAnd in the APC camp for instance, there is seeming disquiet over the choice of running mate.\n\nBy the party\u2019s zoning arrangement, the North-east is expected to produce the running mate to the party\u2019s flag bearer.\n\nIt is not however clear whether the dynamics might change, especially against the permutation in some circles that Kano state Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje might be in top contention from the North-west, a region believed to have strong voting base.\n\nAnd to this end, the APC governors from the North met with Asiwaju Tinubu to discuss the issue, even as the APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu pledged to ensure victory for the party during the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nAdamu, alongside his colleagues in the National Working Committee (NWC), met with the party\u2019s presidential candidate Thursday behind closed doors at his (Tinubu) Abuja residence.\n\nAdamu described the task of ensuring Tinubu\u2019s victory as a task that must be accomplished by the entire party stalwarts across the country.\n\n\u201cFor us, action speaks louder than voice, we are here to join our brother, congratulate him and assure him that we are together. This is our project and by God\u2019s grace, we will succeed,\u2019\u2019 the APC national chairman said.\n\nGovs meet candidate too\n\nAlso, the APC governors from the northern part of the country also met with Tinubu behind closed doors in an apparent bid to have a say in his choice of running mate before the expiration of INEC\u2019s June 17 deadline.\n\nSome of the governors at the parley were Ahmad Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi), Simon Lalong (Plateau), Abdullahi Umar Ganduje (Kano) and Aminu Bello Masari (Katsina).\n\nA source told one of our correspondents that Tinubu might be left with no choice but to settle for a Muslim -Muslim ticket as a matter of \u201cpolitical expediency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not about sentiments; it is about winning election. Who is that Christian that Tinubu would pick that would please the overwhelming Muslim population in the far north that can swing the votes in his favour?\n\n\u201cIf Tinubu is not careful, he will give Atiku the opportunity to make political capital out of it and it would be costly to the APC,\u201d said a top party source who was privy to the parley.\n\nSimilarly, another source said \u201cwhen one looks at what happened in Kaduna where there was a Muslim-Muslim ticket of El-Rufai and his deputy, one can readily conclude that doing same under this circumstance, at least to check Atiku\u2019s candidature, won\u2019t be a bad idea.\u201d\n\nPDP probables\n\nAnd in the PDP, lined up as possible running mate to Atiku are Rivers state Governor Ezenwo Nyesom Wike, who was the runner-up to the former number two man during the party\u2019s convention, Akwa Ibom state Governor Udom Emmanuel, also a presidential aspirant and Delta state Governor Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nThe trio are all from the South-south, leaving the South-east which is embittered over alleged marginalisation, out of reckoning.\n\nWhile Wike\u2019s Rivers is believed to have some electoral value coupled with the governor\u2019s war chest to prosecute the campaign, it is feared that his choice may be opposed by major stakeholders within the party, particularly his colleague-governors who believed he is too overbearing when it comes to issues affecting the party.\n\nBesides, his accusation of colleague-governors from the South as being responsible for his loss during the presidential primaries is one other thing, as gathered by this medium, that might also work against his emergence as the running mate.\n\nAlso, sources believed his \u2018public conduct and outspokenness\u2019 could cause some damage within the presidency as the number two man, if the party eventually wins the election.\n\nFor the duo of Udom and Emmanuel, the party would be facing an arduous task in convincing Wike to back either of them, particularly against the backdrop of the Rivers governor\u2019s angst that Udom would have stepped down and backed his candidature against Atiku.\n\nWhile Wike\u2019s supporters are rooting for him as running mate, a handful of party leaders queue behind Okowa as the party\u2019s best choice for the position.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

The portal will automatically shut down at 6.00 pm (1800hrs) on Friday 17th June 2022 for national elections and 6.00 pm (1800hrs) on Friday 15th July 2022 for State elections.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: [2023 Presidency] Muslim-Muslim Ticket Is Dead On Arrival \u2013 Babachir Lawal\n\nAs of the time of publishing this report, no leading candidate for the presidential election has named their running mate.\n\nWhile the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) flag bearer Atiku Abubakar is expected to name a running mate from the southern regions of the country, his rival in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Bola Tinubu is expected to pick a northerner as his vice-presidential candidate.\n\nFor Peter Obi, the Labour Party (LP) candidate, being from the southern region of Nigeria, analysts believe his running mate will be from the northern part of the country.\n\nRabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) has also not named his running mate. The former governor of Kano State is believed to be contemplating picking the party\u2019s vice-presidential candidate from the south of Nigeria.\n\n\u2018No-Go Area\u2019\n\nAs consultations and permutations continue over who the presidential candidates, especially from the major parties, will pick as running mates, debates over whether Tinubu will choose a Muslim as the vice-presidential candidate has heightened in the wake of his triumph at the APC convention.\n\nAlthough some observers believe a Muslim-Muslim ticket for the former Lagos State governor is not an issue and argue that religion should not be a criterion for political offices, critics say the multi-religious nature of Nigeria makes such an idea dead on arrival.\n\nOne of those against a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket is Babachir Lawal.\n\nThe former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) maintains that the peculiarities of the Nigerian political environment do not favour such.\n\n\u201cYou can have the best ticket but if you don\u2019t win the election, it\u2019s a waste of time. So, we must bear in mind that the vice (presidential candidate) is going to contribute to winning that election,\u201d he said on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today on Thursday.\n\n\u201cExtending that consideration to the Muslim-Muslim ticket, I live among the Christians, and I know that among the Christians, the question of Muslim-Muslim ticket is a no-go area; it is dead on arrival.\n\n\u201cBuhari himself, even at that time, had to drop this present presidential candidate because of that tension of a Muslim-Muslim ticket, and we have not seen anything in the country that has changed significantly to allow that to happen.

If you reach the level of Christianity that I am, you should be able to seek God\u2019s opinion on everything that you do and get the indication.\n\n\u201cI will consider it. I have been in government before, and I have not seen any personal merit or advantage to me being in government.

I can tell you that we have a commitment beyond description, a commitment to deliver you as president. Our party has spoken loud and clear, and delivering the will of the people, our delegates have given you the mandate to lead.\n\n\u201cWe are all now your soldiers. We will follow you to the nooks and crannies of this country. We will not rest on your oars until we have delivered you as president.\u201d\n\nThanking the chairman and members of the NWC, Tinubu said, \u201cI am honoured by this visit. We are all members of the same party, and as such, belong to the same progressive family. I appreciate your visit, I truly feel as if I am with family members.\n\n\u201cI want to thank everyone of you individually and collectively. You have formed a very dynamic team in a short period of time. You have sent jitters to other parties that our party remains united, and you must continue to live up to expectations.\n\n\u201cToday, as I have done throughout my campaign, I assure you that I am ready to reciprocate and vindicate our efforts in making the ultimate sacrifice: relentless public service to our beloved nation.\n\n\u201cWe have begun a new story of greatness, prosperity in the history of our nation. You helped me to complete the introduction; we must now work together to etch the substance of the book itself. Our book will not be complete until you have delivered me as president.\u201d\n\nTinubu described the APC national chairman as a straightforward, focused, and courageous man, whom he had worked together with as a fellow-governor in 1999.\n\nThe former governor stated, \u201cI thank you and I reiterate my commitment to the greatness of our party. We must work together, we must not let our enemies, who want to divide us, succeed. We must not allow it. Almighty Allah will crown our work with success as we embark on the journey to a greater Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAmong the NWC members who joined the chairman on the visit were Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Abubakar Kyari; Deputy National Chairman (South), Chief Emma Eneukwu; National Secretary, Senator Iyiola Omisore; National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Felix Morka; National Organising Secretary, Alhaji Sulaimon Argungu; National Woman Leader, Dr. Betta Edu; and National Youth Leader, Mr. Dayo Abdullah Isreal.\n\nOthers were National Vice Chairman (South-west), Dr Isaac Kekemeke; National Vice Chairman (South-south), Chief Hon. Victor Giadom; and National Vice Chairman (North-east), Comrade Mustapha Salihu.\n\nNorthern APC Governors Visit Tinubu, as Search for Running Mate Begins\n\nMeanwhile, some members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Northern States Governors Forum, on Thursday, paid a visit to the presidential candidate of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu, in Asokoro, Abuja.\n\nThe northern governors, who visited Tinubu, included governor of Kebbi State and Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Abubakar Atiku Bagudu; Governor of Kastina State, Aminu Masari; Kano State Governor, Abdulahi Ganduje; Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya; Plateau State Governor, Simon Lanlong; and Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello.\n\nAlthough the purpose of the visit was not made public, sources said it might not be unconnected with the search for a running mate for Tinubu.\n\nAlready, there were speculations that the ruling party might settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nIt was gathered that the meeting, which was held behind closed-doors, was centred on a possible running mate to Tinubu in the 2023 election.\n\nAlsi, former deputy governors, who were members of APC, assured that the leadership of the ruling party, as well as the presidential candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu, would choose the vice presidential candidate that would best serve the interest of Nigeria.\n\nChairman of the Forum of former Deputy Governors of Nigeria and former Deputy Governor of Edo State, Lucky Imasuen, at a press conference yesterday in Abuja, wondered why people were already speculating whether the ruling party would settle for a Musilm-Muslim ticket.\n\nImasuen said, \u201cWhy are we crying foul, when there is no smoke? I will tell you without any hesitation that the man we have chosen is a leader. When you choose a leader, you choose him to represent the people.\n\n\u201cHimself (Tinubu) and the party leadership, you can rest assured that they will bring the best vice presidential candidate that will best serve the interest of Nigeria. So, just be patient. I can\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s going, because I\u2019m not the candidate and I\u2019m not the national chairman.\u201d\n\nThe forum stated that the emergence of Tinubu as the standard-bearer of the party had sent jitters to the camp of the opposition party, which had realised the irreversible error they committed by choosing a presidential candidate against the mood of the nation.",

He said the APC project was far from over \u201cand we need all of you to come together to ensure our progressive journey to peace and prosperity is sustained.\u201d\n\nThe letter read, \u201cI was pleased to see how you were very professional and efficient in handling the sensitive political position of Chairman Progressives Governors Forum.\n\n\u201cYour commitment in pursuit of equity and fairness speaks volumes in the cooperation displayed by APC governors. This, indeed, demonstrates the camaraderie that brought us together over eight years ago.\n\n\u201cThe party primaries were peacefully conducted and the delegates have selected the candidate to carry the APC flag in the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cToday, as a patriotic APC member and stakeholder, I trust that you will come together to work with our candidate to win the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cIn the past seven years in government, we have achieved a lot. However, we have a lot more to do. The APC project is far from over and we need all of you to come together to ensure our progressive journey to peace and prosperity is sustained.\n\n\u201cOur candidate, His Excellency, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is no stranger to you. He is our friend and brother. We know his commitment, his track record, and his capacity to lead our party to success. So, now is the time for all of us to come together and march forward, as we did in 2015, to a convincing APC victory.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working closely with APC governors to support Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu and all our APC candidates to success in 2023.\n\n\u201cWhile I wish our great party success in the 2023 elections, please, accept the assurances of my consideration and personal regards.\u201d\n\nBuhari played host to Tinubu, Thursday night, at the State House, Abuja.

Legacy of a level playing ground for all the aspirants. He will be committed to democratic principles and values. And he did so.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t endorse anybody, he didn\u2019t impose anybody, he did not, at any time, attempt to tinker with the process of this election to favour one tribe or the other. He was steadfast, he was trustworthy, he was dependable, he was a leader.\u201d\n\nOn his selling point ahead of the 2023 election, Tinubu said he was clear-minded on his mission and possessed a wealth of experience from both the private and public sectors. He said he was \u201cready to hit the ground running same day and not mess up the legacy of progress and honesty that is left behind for me and handed over to me by President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d",
