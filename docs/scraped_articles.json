          "text": "By Gabriel Olawale\n\nThe Chief Medical Director, Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Yaba, Dr Olugbenga Owoeye has admonished Nigerians most especially youths to shun drug abuse, smoking and other social vices that can ruin their future.\n\nSpeaking during the 2021/2022 Matriculation Ceremony of the Federal School of Occupational Therapy, Oshodi, Lagos, Owoeye said that a lot of people who engaged in drugs or smoking, the moment they are entangled, quitting becomes difficult.\n\nHe explained that drug addicts are not in position to quit the habit on their own except they receive help from expert and those around them.\n\n\u201cThough the choice to abuse drugs is personal, stopping is not unilateral. When people who abuse drugs tell you that they want to stop but can\u2019t help themselves from going back into it, they are saying the truth. It is their choice to start, but by the time the drug starts to use them, it is not their decision alone to stop.\n\n\u201cWhether they will stop or not is a serious battle between the impulsive part of the brain and reflective part of the brain. Irrespective of the psychoactive substance someone is taken, on the final analysis, this substance has significant and lasting changes in the brain especially in the part of the brain that as to do with thinking, feeling and judgment.\n\n\u201cBy the time drug starts to affect the brain, it empowers part of the brain called the impulsive, which dominates reflective part of the brain, such that the person is willing but cannot go by his own decision because there is part of the brain that is compelling him to work against his decision.\n\n\u201cHe or she will be the one to decide not to indulge in drug and still be the one to go back into drug. He or she will tell you, I don\u2019t want to go back to drug but I find myself going back. At that moment, impulsive part of the brain has put pressure on reflective part of the brain.\n\n\u201cTo get out of it, you need expert intervention by coming to a place like our institution, Federal Neuro Psychiatric Hospital Yaba. We have a robust program to help people quite drug abuse or smoking.\u201d\n\nHe encouraged the newly be focused, study hard and make sure they graduated with good grade.\n\nOn his part, the Acting Principal of Federal School of Occupational Therapy, Oshodi-Lagos, Mr. Adeoso Akinwole said the role occupational therapist in rehabilitating patient back to the society is unquantifiable.\n\n\u201cOccupational Therapists fill the space of rehabilitating physiatrist patient back into the community as one of the numerous function they performed. As an institution, we boost of the best result in training and practical aspect. Our students are in dire need within and outside the country.\n\nOur students can work in different places ranges from psychiatric hospital, orthopedic hospital among others.\n\n\u201cAs Occupational Therapist, we assist clients with physical and psychiatric conditions to reach their maximum level of function and independence in all aspects of their daily living.\n\n\u201cUnlike other types of therapy, Occupational Therapists takes a holistic approach and deals with the whole person. The certificate obtained from this school qualifies you as an Occupational Therapy Assistant.\n\n\u201cAt the end of your Diploma Programme, you will have to go further and obtain your degrees and qualify as full-fledged occupational therapy practitioners. Federal School of Occupational Therapy, Oshodi is first of its kind in Nigeria and the West Africa sub-region.\u201d\n\nThe school is one of the two schools operated by the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Yaba.

It is very unfortunate and unacceptable.\n\n\u201cNigerian students hereby call on the presidential aspirant, in the spirit of patriotism and in the interest of development to rally around Nigerian students.\n\n\u201cAll of these aspirants paid huge amounts of money to procure their nomination forms, so donating funds to rescue the tertiary education in Nigeria should not be too difficult for them,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cIt is only by doing this, that Nigerian students and Nigerians, in general, will respect and show support for their ambitions\u201d.",

          "text": "FACEBOOK and other social media platforms have been cautioned against yielding their platforms to the members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to incite violence and instigate ethnic hatred in Nigeria.\n\nThe Federal Government gave the instruction through Information, Culture & Tourism Minister Lai Mohammed at a meeting with a team from Facebook.\n\nIn a statement signed by his media aide, Mr. Segun Adeyemi, the minister said since IPOB had been proscribed and classified as a terrorist organisation, Facebook has no justification to continue allowing its platform to be used by the organisation to further its campaign of hate and destabilisation of the country.\n\nMohammed was quoted as saying: \u201cI have called this meeting to enable us to discuss the increasing use of Facebook by separatists and anarchists, especially those of them based outside the country, to instigate violence and ethnic hatred in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason, they seem to have now chosen Facebook as their platform of choice. And their tools include disinformation, incendiary statements and hate speech.\n\n\u201cThey use Facebook broadcasts to reach their followers, who are in thousands. They tag those opposed to their violent ways as \u2018saboteurs\u2019 who must be attacked, maimed and killed. They use both English and their local language as it suits them.\u201d\n\nHe said the actions of the outlawed group have real-life implications, adding: \u201cBy purveying hate and inciting violence, people are getting killed while private and public property are being attacked and destroyed. Security agencies and other symbols of government are their choice targets.\u201d\n\nThe minister said that despite the numerous complaints to Facebook on the activities of IPOB, nothing has been done by the company to curtail the group\u2019s excesses on the social media platform.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur social media people have been monitoring these separatists, anarchists and purveyors of hate, and have been reporting their atrocious actions to Facebook, but all they get are default responses that their complaints have been received and are being looked into.\n\n\u201cMost often than not, nothing has been done about such complaints\u2026 The truth is that whatever Facebook is doing to check these people is mere tokenism and is totally ineffective.\u201d\n\nMohammed said the government would be monitoring Facebook and other platforms closely in the days ahead to ensure compliance with the demand, as it steps up the campaign for the responsible use of social media.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have always advocated a responsible use of social media, and consistently called on all stakeholders to join us in achieving this. Some have tagged our efforts as an attempt to stifle social media.\n\n\u201cThey are wrong, because we have no intention of preventing Nigerians from using social media responsibly. All we have been advocating is a responsible use of social media,\u201d the minister said.",

I will also invest in the manufacturing and productive industries.\n\n\u201dThe problem of Nigeria is that we moved into the service industry and we have refused to pay attention to production.\n\n\u201dSo, you see somebody producing chicken, he doesn\u2019t have a processing factory, he doesn\u2019t have an abatoir that will kill the chicken, process it and sell it as a finished product.\n\n\u201cIf you have a processing factory you will employ more hands. So, we will depend on states like Nasarawa that have very high level of practice in agriculture, and that will change the face of Nasarawa State,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nAmaechi further appealed to the delegates to shun politicians with deceitful tendencies who would come to them for votes.\n\nHe appealed that they (delegates) should consider his (Amaechi\u2019s) track record of achievements over the years in public service and vote for him for a better Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have come to beg you to elect me because you are the most important politicians now in APC. Don\u2019t be deceived by politicians who would come here to speak English.\n\n\u201dI have worked with two of your governor. I have the capacity to deliver. Check my work in the ministry of transportation, I delivered Abuja-Kaduna railway.\n\n\u201dI started the Kano-Kaduna railway, I started the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri railway, I completed the Warri-Itakpe railway and completed the Lagos-Ibadan railway.\n\n\u201dI changed the face of the maritime sector, so I am tested and I am trusted. All I can say to you is to go out on that day and vote for me,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nEarlier at the Government House, Lafia, Amaechi recounted his achievements as Rivers Governor in the area of security, noting that he would replicate the feat if elected.\n\nResponding, Gov. Sule, who extolled the virtues of the former Minister, said, \u201cSir, you don\u2019t have to sell yourself to me at all. I may know you more than you think I do.\n\n\u201dOne introduction about you that was not done is the doggedness of who you are, you are a dogged fighter.\n\n\u201dYou fought to emerge as the chairman of the governor\u2019s forum, you fought to become the Rivers Governor, everything about you, you fought to get them.\n\n\u201dSo, today you are fighting to be the President of Nigeria, I wish you well. The most amazing thing is the intimidating team you have been able to put together, a lot of people in your team are well known to me.\n\n\u201dAnd one thing about our party is that we have competent aspirants and I was happy when you mentioned that even among the aspirants in the party you are the most competent,\u201d Sule said.\n\nPoliticians and associates who accompanied the former Minister included Sen. Ayogu Eze; former Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai; former DG NIMASA, Dakuku Peterside and former Acting Governor of Abia, Stanley Ohajuru.\n\n(NAN)",

He pointed to the need why the country requires a president that would be in charge of things, including issues of security and the economy.\n\nHe said it was sad that Nigerian farmers could not go to farm conveniently or go about their trading activities because of insecurity. \u201cWe need a Nigerian who believes in the unity of this country. We have never been divided the way we are divided now. If God gives us the opportunity, we\u2019ll form a government of national unity where everybody will be involved.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike told the delegates that he is the best PDP aspirant that has the capacity to secure electoral victory for the party and implement policies that would truly rescue Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, PDP and, indeed, Nigerians need somebody who could face the APC squarely in the 2023 general election and give the country a new direction in which safety of life is guaranteed.\n\nHe said people like him stayed back to build the party and make it once again formidable.\n\nI won\u2019t retire from politics until I\u2019m president \u2013 Tinubu\n\nNational Leader of the APC, Bola Tinubu, has vowed not to retire from partisan politics until he becomes president.\n\nI will bring the experience of my leadership in Lagos State as governor to bear on my leadership style in Nigeria,\u201d he said during his campaign visit to Benue State, yesterday.\n\nTinubu, who insisted he is the best man for the job said if he emerges as candidate, he would win the election no matter whoever emerges as the candidate of the PDP.

He said the country cannot afford to toy with the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe recalled that as Senate president, he had championed the move for a mayor for the FCT. He added that as president he would ensure indigenes of Abuja are adequately compensated when their lands are used for developmental purposes.\n\nHe noted that the electorate cannot vote just anybody and urged delegates to rate all aspirants by the capacity to address the myriad of challenges confronting the country.\n\nHe was also in Osun State where he boasted that his eight years in executive and eight in the legislative arm give him an edge as the most qualified among the presidential aspirants.\n\nWhen next you come to Adamawa, you\u2019ll come as president, Lamido of Adamawa tells Amaechi\n\nLamido of Adamawa, Muhammadu Barkindo Mustapha, has tipped APC aspirant, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, as the next president.\n\nHe pledged to continually pray for him to emerge victorious, stating that Nigerians need to enjoy the dividends of good governance like the people of Rivers State enjoyed during Amaechi\u2019s eight-year tenure as governor of Rivers State.\n\nHe spoke when Amaechi paid him a courtesy call on the sidelines of his consultative visit to APC delegates in Adamawa State on Monday.\n\nAt the meeting with delegates, leader of the APC in the state, immediate past governor of Adamawa, Sen. Jubrilla Bindow urged Adamawa delegates to vote for him at the party primaries for the good of the state and for Nigeria.\n\nAmaechi charged the delegates to judge him by his antecedents and performance in every position he has handled, and make the right choice by voting for him to emerge candidate of the APC for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nI\u2019ll restore nationhood, conscience to Nigeria \u2013 Anyim\n\nFormer Senate president and PDP aspirant, Anyim Pius Anyim, promised to fix the socio-economic and political challenges through restoration of nationhood and conscience to the country.\n\nHe made the promise when he visited Governor Seyi Makinde in Ibadan, Oyo State, yesterday.\n\nHe later addressed national delegates drawn from all the six states in the South West at the Presidential Lodge, Government House, Oke-Oyinbo, Agodi, Ibadan.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen we talk about Nigeria, it is a country in search of nationhood and conscience. Looking at my antecedents as a lawyer, former senate president and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, I know the problems of Nigeria and what the solutions should be. I have worked in the three arms of government. This is why I intend to lead the search for the nationhood and conscience. These are what will distinguish me from other presidential aspirants.\u201d\n\nHe recalled the time he was Senate president and how he was able to stem the tide of storm that rocked the senate before he became the number three person in the country.\n\nEducation remains key to Nigerian Problems, Obi\n\nFormer governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi, has said education remained critical to development as well as the key to the many problems facing the country.\n\nHe spoke after the breakfast meeting with the Chief Executive of Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council, Rosie Glazebrook in Lagos yesterday.\n\nObi, who recalled what education is doing in many parts of the world, said it remained the only enduring legacy by which the future generations would compete with their peers all over the world. He said if Nigeria\u2019s leaders understood as much, ASUU would not be on strike.\n\nAs the governor of Anambra State, Obi moved Anambra from 26th position in external examinations to number one among other states in Nigeria. It was after the spectacular improvement that the World Bank commissioned Prof. Paul Collier to study what Anambra State did on education, which they widely published and encouraged other countries to emulate.\n\nOver 600 women groups back Yahaya Bello\n\nThe Nigerian Women Arise For Nigeria (NIWAFON) says more than 600 women groups are backing Gov.Yahaya Bello ahead of the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the 2023 Presidential election.\n\nThe National Coordinator of NIWAFON, Dr Hanatu Adeeko, said this in a statement in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAdeeko said that the group was also carrying out aggressive delegates\u2019 mobilisation for Bello, adding that no efforts would be spared in ensuring the emergence of Governor Bello as the APC Presidential candidate.\n\nShe said this would be the first in a long while those women on their own would come together in their numbers to lead a political movement.",

It is regrettable that those who held sway in their states but pilfer and plunder local government allocation during their tenure, which is the only selfish reason they openly oppose passage of Local Government Autonomy Bill, are now jostling to become the president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAmbali said such leaders were not only unpatriotic but are anti-people, hence Nigerians must not allow them to be victorious in the poll. He said granting autonomy to local government councils was imperative if the myriads of problems confronting Nigeria like insecurity, poverty, joblessness, infrastructural decay, women and youth empowerment, agriculture and rural economy is to be addressed.\n\nMeanwhile, the Church of Christ in Nations (COCIN) has advised Christians and indeed Nigerians to vote competent, credible and God-fearing leaders.\n\nIts president, Rev. Amos Mohzo, gave the advice at the opening of the 101 General Church Council (GCC) of the Church in Jos, yesterday.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

Activities by our electoral body and political parties leading to the general elections in 2023 are proceeding with full speed. This is why I am calling on Nigerians and the Church in particular, to vote God-fearing, credible and competent leaders in the forthcoming general elections,\u201d he said.\n\nMohzo also called on Christians to get involved in politics, insisting that \u201cwhen the righteous are in power, the people rejoice.\u201d\n\nHe called on Christian religious leaders to mobilise and encourage their members to vie for political positions and get involved in the political processes.\n\n\u201cMay I reiterate that the Church is the conscience of the nation and custodian of morale of the people; we must gather our momentum and courage to come out of our hiding cliff to lead the people,\u201d he said.\n\nCOCIN president promised that the church would support any credible candidate to make the desired change that would bring about a better society.\n\nPlateau State Governor, Simon Lalong represented by his deputy, Prof. Sonni Tyoden said: \u201cWhat is happening in this country needs the intervention of men of God at all levels.

The fallout of the recent melee in Sokoto following the killing of Deborah Samuel where several Igbo traders and other Southerners were harassed as young residents demanded the release of those who perpetrated the killing of the young student is a clear instance of the delicate religious and ethnic balancing act that needs to be upheld in Nigeria. With a fractious polity where ethnic and religious strife has seen sectional violence come to the fore in the North Central, South-East, South-West, the South is eager to stake a claim to the presidency to sooth frayed nerves across the country. Nigeria\u2019s fragile unity is indeed at stake,\u201d he said.\n\nFarouk said the apparent mismanagement of the party processes due largely to the greed and megalomania of vested interest in the North who do not care about the region but their personal aggrandisement and were terrified by the prospect of life without the cover of federal power and immunity, may drive Nigeria to the brink and cause an implosion that could break the country and set on course a new scramble by the global powers of Europe, America, and China \u2013 a project some may well say is underway, especially in the case of China, with boobytrap loans and investments.\n\n\u2022244 PDP aspirants jostle for 68 elective positions in Lagos\n\nNo fewer than 244 aspirants are jostling for 68 elective positions in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State.\n\nThe 68 elective positions are governorship, one; senate, three; House of Representatives, 24 and House of Assembly, 40.\n\nGiving the breakdown, Lagos Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Hakeem Amode, said 140 aspirants were contesting for the party\u2019s tickets for the 40 seats in the state House of Assembly, 85 for the 24 House of Representatives seats, 13 aspirants for the three senatorial districts and six for governorship.\n\nDates for the House of Assembly primary is May 21 while primaries for the House of Representatives and senate are fixed for May 22 and 23 respectively. The governorship primary is slated for May 26.\n\n\u202287 APC aspirants vie for 26 Osun Assembly seats\n\nThe screening committee of APC said 87 aspirants have obtained forms to contest the 26 Osun State House of Assembly seats.\n\nAddressing the press in Osogbo, yesterday, chairman of the committee, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, said the large number of aspirants showed how popular the party is in the state.\n\nHe said the aspirants have been tutored on the requirements to present for the screening, assuring that there would be fair and equal in treating all the aspirants.\n\n\u201cThere are constitutional requirements and there are party requirements but basically, we want to be sure they are Nigerian citizens. We want to see local government certificates, they must be party members, they must be voters, and we also want to know their age, we want to see their educational qualifications, if you claim to be a doctor, you must provide a certificate to prove it.\u201d\n\n\u2022Group kicks as Imansuangbon\u2019s name varnishes from Edo delegates\u2019 list\n\nA socio-political pressure group, Esan South East for Justice, yesterday, condemned the removal of Kenneth Imansuangbon\u2019s name from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National delegates\u2019 list of Esan South East Local Government, describing the action as criminal and undemocratic.\n\nImansuangbon had last weekend at a congress conducted at Ubiaja, the administrative headquarters of Esan South- East Local Government Area and supervised by INEC officials, won with 156 votes against his opponent Giwa Agbomherere, who scored 50 votes.\n\nWhile appealing to Governor Godwin Obaseki to intervene in the matter, the group also called on INEC, police and DSS to investigate and ensure that those behind the act were exposed.\n\nIt also called on the Iyorchia Ayu-led National Working Committee to call to order the state chairman of the party. It said the present position amounted to disenfranchising the former PDP governorship aspirant.\n\nBut Edo State Chairman of the party, Tony Aziegbemi, said: all questions about the conduct of the adhoc congress should be directed to the National office of the party as the exercise was not a state affair.",

          "text": "Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nThe First Lady of Ekiti State, Erelu Bisi Fayemi, has lamented that people living with all forms of disabilities (PWDs) are being sexually abused by those he described as \u201csex predators\u201d in the state.\n\nMrs. Fayemi said the government has zealously been implementing the Gender-Based Violence Prohibition Laws (GBV) and other relevant laws in protecting the right of women, especially those living with disabilities.\n\nThe first lady stated this in Ado Ekiti yesterday at a sensitisation programme on GBV women organised for people living with disabilities in the state.\n\nGoing down memory the lane, Fayemi revealed that in 2020 nationwide lockdown caused by the breakout of COVID-19 brought an upsurge in all forms of violence against women due to closure of work spaces around the globe, assuring the public that her husband, Governor Kayode Fayemi\u2019s government won\u2019t condone any form of discrimination against the physically challenged.\n\nShe said: \u201cSex predators don\u2019t care whether one is disabled or not, or wear skimpy skirt or not. They can do it to anyone. I have seen many physically challenged being sexually abused; even an 85-year-old woman was also a victim. What could have attracted her to these perpetrators?\n\n\u201cApart from discrimination, the most urgent issues we are solving are lack of economic empowerment, education and training for the people living with disabilities. Though, while some of you are educated, you knew what you went through to acquire this. One aspect we have been able to ensure is that you have access to healthcare.\n\n\u201cTo lessen your plights, the state government has put in place Office of Disability Affairs under Ministry of Women Affairs to deal with issues of social welfare and social justice for people with disabilities.\u201d\n\nIn her presentation on \u2018Ekiti Gender Based Violence Prohibition and Support for Women with Disabilities\u2019, a lawyer and human rights advocate, Mrs. Rita Ilevbare, said no efforts should be spared in tackling the rampancy of psychological, economic, physical and sexual violence against women.\n\nIlevbare, who is the executive director, Gender Relevance Initiative Promotion (GRIP), said from reports, women are most victim of GBV and such tendencies are more convenient with people living with disabilities.\n\nReeling out what could trigger violence, Ilevbare stated that: \u201cThe culture of patriarchy, where men are favoured or perceived to be leaders, have been fueling GBV in the country.\n\n\u201cAnything that tends to put women at the mercy of men is violence, and it must be stopped. It is devastating to be a woman and carrying disabilities; it is double jeopardy. And we also have the culture of silence where people don\u2019t want to talk because of stigmatisation. Violence and discrimination are twin evils, which we must confront at all cost.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "At 26.61%, Banks Maximum Lending Rate Drops to 5-year Low",
          "text": "Kayode Tokede\n\nAmid rising inflation rate that is expected to hike operating cost and plud profitability, banks have reduced maximum lending rate to 26.61 per cent, an over five-year low, the latest data by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on banks\u2019 deposit and lending interest rates has revealed.\n\nThe CBN data revealed that In 2016, the maximum lending rate was hovering around 26 per cent and crossed the 31 per cent mark in 2017.\n\nThe drop involves a decline in lending rates to the real sector of the nation\u2019s economy and increasing deposit rates on bank customers\u2019 deposits.\n\nThe data on banks\u2019 deposit and lending interest rates showed a 1.4 percentage points drop in the average maximum lending rate from 26.61 per cent in March 2022, as against 27.65 per cent in January 2022.\n\nThe maximum lending rate was at 30.73 per cent in February 2022 and it has dropped by 2.5 per cent to 27.85 per cent in December 2021 from 28.3 per cent it was in January 2021.\n\nThe CBN data indicated that interest on savings deposits closed March 2022 at 1.28 per cent from 1.25 per cent, representing an increase of 2.4 per cent Year-till-Date (YtD) performance.\n\nExperts attribute the decline in maximum lending rate to excess liquidity in the banking sector.\n\nCommenting, the President of the Association of the Capital Market Academics in Nigeria (ACMAN), Professor Uche Uwaleke believe interventions by CBN also forced banks to cut interest rate on loans to customers.\n\nHe explained that, \u201c\u201cWhen the money supply is high, it is expected to translate into low interest rates on lending to Bank customers. The numerous interventions by CBN have forced down interest rates in the banking sector. The CBN has a lot of its intervention at single digit interest rate; moved from nine per cent to five per cent. When the CBN should have ended that regime of five per cent lending rate, it extended it further.\n\n\u201cThe CBN has been extending loan facilities to key sectors of the economy and a lot of interventions are accessing these funds at single digit interest rate. The banks were forced to reduce interest rate in order to remain relevant in their major core business of lending to the real sector.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the gap between saving and lending rates is huge, stressing that the CBN management have expressed concerns.\n\nSpeaking on increase in deposit rate, he added that the hike in deposit rate is meant to attract deposits and remain competitive.\n\n\u201cIt is the competition that is pushing up interest on deposits in the banking sector,\u201d he added.\n\nThe President, Bank Customers Association of Nigeria (BCAN), Dr. Uju Ogubunka attributed the decline in maximum lending rate to uncertainty surrounding the business environment amid political tension in the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOnce bank customers are not applying for loans as they used to, for sure the lending rate is expected to drop. When you have pressure on loan request, the rate is expected to go higher. Many people are not making moves to invest because of the insecurity, upcoming elections, among others.\u201d\n\nOgubunka, who was the former Registrar/ Chief Executive, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) expressed that Nigeria\u2019s economy in 2022 has not witnessed major improvement to warrant a hike in banking lending rate to the real sector.\n\nHe added that, \u201cIf there is no improvement in macroeconomy activities, it simply means there is no need to commit more funds into the business environment, leading to slow demand for loans.\u201d\n\nOgubunka explained further that banks opted to increase the rate on saving deposits to attract savings since the funds are not available.\n\nHe questioned, \u201cHow many bank customers are still saving money in the bank? It is a demand and supply related issue. If bank customers do not give to banks, they will not have enough to lend to the real sector.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, if there is surplus in the system, the pricing goes down but if you do not have enough and there is demand for it, you increase the rate. I think what is happening now is that so many bank customers are incapacitated that they cannot save due to inflation rate, among others.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from a different perspective, analyst at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye said the competition between the banks and Fintech companies forced down the maximum rate in the financial sector.\n\n\u201cFor the month of March 2022, as the deposit rate increases, lending rate dropped. I think it has to do with competition between banks and other lending houses. Deposit rate actually increases which is expected to encourage people to deposit more funds. Banks are facing the reality of the CBN granting licence to MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa to operate a Payment Service Provider (PSP) that is expected to commence soon.\u201d\n\nOn the flipside, the CBN\u2019s data revealed that the average prime lending rate hit a 14-month high to 11.85 per cent in March 2022.\n\nPrime lending rate in its Year-till-Date performance has gained 1.4 per cent from 11.68 per cent reported in January 2022, while in Year-on-Year gained 6.4 per cent from 11.13 per cent reported in March 2021.\n\nThe average interest rate on one-month deposits dropped to 3.33 per cent in March from 3.79 per cent in January 2022, while three-month deposits also dropped to 4.41 per cent from five per cent in January 2022.\n\nThe apex bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBN since February 2021 maintained interest rate at 11.5per cent.\n\nA member of the MPC, a Professor of Economics at the University of Benin, Mike Obadan had in his personal statement during the March 2022 meeting in Lagos said, \u201cA further tightening of monetary policy will not tame inflation. Rather, it will lead to an increase in lending rates of the commercial banks, limit access to credit, and hurt investment in the real sectors of the economy.\n\n\u201cIndeed, a further tightening policy will be antithetical to the CBN\u2019s goal of increasing access of investors to cheap credit in order to aid economic recovery, spur growth, increase employment and reduce poverty.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, easing monetary policy in the present circumstances could increase untargeted money supply growth and exacerbate inflation. The situation of low growth, high unemployment and poverty incidence and double-digit inflation, no doubt, entails difficult policy choices.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, output growth requires continuous policy support, especially monetary policy to complement fiscal policy which, for some time now, is characterised by weak fiscal space. Targeted development finance interventions of the CBN would need to be sustained to boost aggregate supply of goods and services in aid of non-monetary inflation control.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy Governor, Financial System Stability, CBN, Aisha Ahmad, also in her personal statement said the committee has a window to use the tools at its disposal to fight inflation promptly while keeping an eye on output growth, stressing that a marginal interest rate hike, thus, signals the need to curb inflation and could tangentially moderate foreign exchange pressures in the medium term by attracting foreign investors.\n\nShe added that, \u201cWhile I acknowledge that a rate hike could potentially have a negative effect on real sector lending prices, this is mitigated by the Bank\u2019s interventions which has broadened affordable access to loans.\n\n\u201cI am, therefore, convinced that sustaining these interventions, alongside a marginal increase in the monetary policy rate to combat inflation, would combine well to strengthen the recovery process.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "APC Convention: Osinbajo Fvoured to Clinch Presidential Ticket",
          "text": "\n\nYinusa Duba advances reasons for placing a bet on Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s victory at the All Progressives Congress presidential primary\n\nIt is exactly two weeks to the Special National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and there are clear indications that bookmakers may be in for a shocker as Senator Bola Tinubu is increasingly facing strong headwinds in his bid to clinch the party\u2019s presidential ticket. A zone-by-zone analysis of delegates\u2019 preferences, realignments of APC governors, President Buhari\u2019s behind-the-scene moves and emerging voting patterns indicate that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will likely emerge winner at the convention on June 1. The Vice President\u2019s intense campaigns (he visits two states in a day), his inspiring messages and the emphasis he places on his experience and readiness to lead right from the first day are increasingly resonating with party stakeholders across the country. Of the 20 aspirants or so in the field, only three \u2013 Osinbajo, Tinubu and Amaechi \u2013 are the serious contenders. The rest came into the race for many reasons, and so I won\u2019t waste time profiling their chances. In fact, I am sure that these unserious ones will step down before the Convention even begins. They were convinced to buy the N100 million forms to raise funds for the party.\n\nIn the South-west region, Tinubu will take Lagos, his home base, and take a slight lead in Osun. The VP will win Oyo, Ondo, Ekiti and Ogun. The governors of these four states are solidly with Osinbajo. But Osun is in strong contention by Tinubu and the VP, and so the votes would be almost evenly split between the two.\n\nWhile Chibuike Amaechi will take his home state of Rivers, Osinbajo will sweep Akwa Ibom, Cross River, Delta and Bayelsa. In Bayelsa, Timipre Sylva\u2019s firm grip on the delegates is the VP\u2019s advantage. Sylva will easily align with President Buhari and vote Osinbajo. In Akwa Ibom, the VP is banking on the supports of bigwigs like former Deputy Governor Nsima Ekere, Senator Udoma Udo Udoma and Senator Ita Enang, among others; while in neighbouring Cross River State, Gov. Ben Ayade is leading the battalion of supporters rooting for the VP. In Delta, Senator Omo Ovie-Agege and Minister of State for Labour, Mr. Festus Keyamo are the driving forces behind the VP. There would be serious contention for Edo State by both the VP and Tinubu. Although former APC National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole may be rooting for Tinubu in Edo, but the statutory delegates are solidly behind the VP.\n\nThe South-east delegates are going into the APC Convention with a sense of grievance. They would have loved to vote for an aspirant from their zone. But in the absence of that, the voting pattern would be disparate. Those from Imo and Ebonyi would be influenced by their governors, while the rest would mostly make their independent decisions. David Umahi and Hope Uzodinma would listen to Buhari\u2019s persuasions and support Osinbajo with their delegates. Delegates from Enugu, Abia and Anambra will support the VP overwhelmingly, but a few would however line up behind Tinubu and Amaechi.\n\nI can confirm that the delegates from the three Zones in the North (NE, NC and NW) will vote in the same pattern because most of the 19 Northern States are APC states whose governors will go along with the President; and we all know that President Buhari is not willing to support Tinubu. Buhari is bent on having his VP succeed him. This is an established fact which has rankled the Tinubu team to no end. But it is what it is. No APC governor from the North will antagonize the President. They respect, adore and revere the old man. Northern governors will support whosoever the President anoint. Although Tinubu will make some good showings in Kano, Zamfara and a few other places, his overall performance in the North will fall behind the VP\u2019s. Amaechi, on the other hand, will give a smattering performance in some places like Katsina.\n\nIn previous presidential contests, party delegates were mostly motivated by money. This year seems to be different. What are the major critical success factors in this year\u2019s race? The most important consideration among delegates this year is the character, capacity and competence of the candidates. There is a strong realization among party delegates that Nigeria could fully achieve its full potentials if the right set of leaders are elected. In the governing APC, many are convinced that money would not be the deciding factor. In this regard, Prof Osinbajo is highly regarded as the most competent, experienced and well-prepared candidate. The VP\u2019s relatively young age (he was 65 on March 8; Tinubu 70 on March 29 and Amaechi 56 on May 27) coupled with good physical and mental health is a plus for the VP. Overall, Prof. Osinbajo will score between 70% and 75% of the total delegate votes at the Convention.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Adams Oshiomhole, senatorial hopeful, and Kayode Fayemi, governor of Ekiti state, have traded words over an allegation made by the former APC national chairman.\n\nIn an interview with Channels Television, Oshiomhole said Fayemi asked him to rig the party\u2019s primary election in 2018 in favour of some unnamed people.\n\n\u201cIn one of the meetings I had with governor Fayemi \u2013 he told me bluntly to my face that \u2018chairman what we are saying is you can go and conduct election and fulfil all righteousness but if we say this the person to emerge just make sure he emerges\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI told Governor Fayemi that it would be his portion, not me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be used as an instrument of fraud to invite people to buy forms and convince them that they are going for the primary, regardless of how the people will vote and this is the man that will prevail?

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Disney+ today launched in South Africa.\n\nEarlier in January, the Walt Disney Company confirmed the expansion of its streaming service, Disney+, to 42 new countries, including 6 African countries\u2014Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and South Africa.\n\nLaunched in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands in 2019, Disney+ is currently present in 64 countries, with 137.7 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nIts entry into South Africa will mark the service\u2019s first ingress into the continent, where it joins other international streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Shomax, and Netflix.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan, at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum. The plan, similar to Disney+\u2019s $8 plan in the US, allows users to stream concurrently on 4 devices and access unlimited downloads across 10 devices.\n\nOn the service, South Africans will access original Disney content like the Star Wars series and Encanto; and features from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) like Moon Knight. South African users will also access Disney+\u2019s Star Hub where they can view features from other platforms like FX, Hulu, Freeform, and 20th Century Fox.\n\nMore competition for DStv\n\nComparatively speaking, Disney+ is the cheapest international streaming service available to South Africans, beating Amazon Prime Video at R136 ($8.55)/month and Showmax at R225($14.14)/month. While Netflix does have an affordable R49/month Mobile plan in South Africa, the plan only allows 1 user and 1 device. The only Netflix plan similar to Disney+\u2019s Standard R119 plan is Netflix\u2019s Premium plan which costs R199 plan and allows Ultra HD streaming on up to 4 devices.\n\nDisney\u2019s launch will also bring more competition for DStv which has been struggling to retain its users\u2019 on the platform. Last year, it lost over 100,000 high-value subscribers in 6 months after it cut off access to some sports channels from its packages.\n\nDStv, however, does have cheap monthly plans at R59 ($3.71) and R115 ($7.23) and is still the preferred streaming service for most South Africans with over 12 million subscribers (58% of DStv\u2019s total subscribers) glued to the platform.\n\nWhile platforms like Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video offer access to more international content, they also come with a major disadvantage, compared to DStv: users need to be connected to the internet to access their services.\n\nData is expensive in South Africa with 1GB costing an average of R78.50 ($5). An hour of streaming on Netflix consumes 1GB of data at standard definition, and 3GB at high definition. Watching just 20 hours of Netflix a month is equal to R1,560 ($98), almost twice the cost of DStv\u2019s most expensive Premium plan.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Adora Nwodo is making a name for herself in the cloud",
          "text": "Adora Nwodo is a 25-year-old software engineer based in Lagos. She currently works as a cloud engineer at Microsoft and is the author of Cloud Engineering for beginners. I\u2019m bringing Adora to Centre Stage because she has shown great commitment to strengthening developer communities across Nigeria and is an advocate for African women in technology.\n\nAdora Nwodo on cloud engineering and mixed reality\n\nKoromone Koroye: Hi Adora, thanks for agreeing to speak with me. Please, tell me a little about yourself.\n\nAdora Nwodo: I am a software engineer currently building mixed reality on the cloud at Microsoft. I am also a public speaker, published author, digital creator, and occasional DJ.\n\nKK: Are there any differences between cloud and software engineering, or are the terms interchangeable?\n\nAN: There are differences. Anyone who designs, builds, implements, and maintains software applications is a software engineer.\n\nCloud engineers are typically hired to deploy or scale up new and existing cloud resources. Cloud engineers literally do their engineering on the cloud, whether software engineering or DevOps engineering.\n\nKK: What does it mean to build mixed reality (MR) products?\n\nAN: Before I talk about mixed reality, let me briefly explain the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAR is essentially an enhanced and interactive version of our physical and real world. If you have ever used Snapchat or Instagram filters, you have interacted with AR somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, VR is a computer-generated environment that usually requires a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset to enjoy a fully-immersed digital experience.\n\nMixed reality blends both AR and VR and provides an interesting middle ground for both technologies. MR gives you the immersive VR experience and the chance to interact with multiple digital objects. Furthermore, MR gives you the illusion that these digital objects exist in your physical space. I can see holograms in my room when I wear a mixed reality headset, but I still get to experience my room as it exists in real life.\n\nKK: Fascinating! What do you enjoy about building mixed reality products in your current role?\n\nAN: I\u2019m building a platform called Mesh for Microsoft. Mesh is the engine that will power the metaverse. Building Mesh has been an exciting experience, primarily because most of the ideas we are working on are relatively new and unknown. Sometimes, building in uncharted territory without a pre-existing playbook to fall back on, can be frustrating. Still, I choose to enjoy the learning process of pioneering a new industry or sector.\n\nDigging deeper with Adora Nwodo\n\nKK: How did you get into cloud engineering? What piqued your interest?\n\nAN: Before joining Microsoft, I already had a vested interest in technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud engineering. When I found out about the Microsoft role and that it involved working with mixed reality, I was immediately interested in being a part of the team. During my early months in Microsoft, I primarily worked on the HoloLens before transitioning into cloud-related projects.\n\nKK: Is there a learning curve to accommodate cloud engineering? What are the specific courses people need to take?\n\nAN: If you\u2019re trying to come into cloud engineering, taking an introductory computer science course is essential. The cloud is basically a network of computers, so you need a foundational understanding of computers to understand what is going on. Take any fundamental course on computer science; learn about Linux, operating systems, networking, and cloud fundamentals of the computer.\n\nKK: Let\u2019s talk about your professional growth. Did your career kick off at a startup?\n\nAN: No, it didn\u2019t. I worked with an advertising agency as a software developer before moving to Microsoft.\n\nKK: What was it like transitioning from working at an agency to moving to a more structured and global company like Microsoft?\n\nAN: Joining Microsoft was a breath of fresh air for me, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily about the company as much as it was about the team. I\u2019m a big advocate for working with great teams rather than just great companies. The transition was easy for me because I was excited about the opportunity to build solutions I am passionate about and become the kind of engineer that I have always dreamed of.\n\nAdora on being an African woman in technology\n\nKK: What changes do you think need to be made for gender biases to be eradicated in our ecosystem? It\u2019s obviously going to take a while, but practically speaking, what kind of changes do you think need to be made?\n\nAN: When we talk about gender bias, some people think it\u2019s always conscious, but unconscious biases also exist. I implore African startups and businesses to hold recurring bias training sessions for their employees throughout the year. We can\u2019t start the mindset shift if we don\u2019t educate people and expose them to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nHannatu Asheolge: You are pretty influential in the Nigerian tech ecosystem. You\u2019re also a blogger, published author, and active YouTuber. How has putting yourself out there helped you grow?\n\nAdora Nwodo: Putting myself out there is one of the reasons I got into Microsoft at the time that I did. Being active in the developer community and on LinkedIn at that time put me on a recruiter\u2019s radar; it helped me acknowledge that I\u2019m a big fan of learning in public. If I didn\u2019t try to learn in public by posting tweets about things I was reading or learning, people wouldn\u2019t have reached out to me to offer help. Finally, it helped me build my network. Going to ecosystem-related events, meeting new people, and taking on collaborative projects has helped my professional growth.\n\nHA: You recently announced that you were accepted into a Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) programme. What does this acceptance mean to you as a young Nigerian woman?\n\nAN: I am excited about learning career-accelerating skills like leadership and business management, and I get to be a part of the impressive GSB network.\n\nHA: Do you have any tips you\u2019d like to share about balancing work life and school?\n\nAA: First of all, I don\u2019t know if balance is achievable. I like to think we just try our best and leave the rest to vibes, to a great extent. Delegation is a skill everyone needs to learn on the job. You don\u2019t have to do everything, primarily when you work with a team of talented people. How you prioritise your tasks and assignments matters as well. Prioritise, delegate, and ask for help.\n\nMy calendar has also made my life easier recently. I use it to schedule most of my days to avoid wasting time on unnecessary tasks.\n\nHA: You\u2019re very vocal about your non-work-related hobbies and interests. Can you share some of your favorite hobbies or after-work activities?\n\nAN: I love going around drinking wine and eating steak and mashed potatoes. I enjoy the whole restaurant-hopping thing with a bunch of my friends where we\u2019re just eating good food and drinking wine. I also DJ at lounges and curated events.\n\nHA: You\u2019re currently part of several communities. Can you share a few that have helped shape your professional and personal growth?\n\nAN: I\u2019ve been a part of several communities, but the one that really helped a lot at the start of my career was Google Developer Groups(GDG). I was a co-organiser for GDG Ajah and a member of GDG Lagos. My involvement with them helped me meet many tech people at that time. Currently, I\u2019m VP for the Nigerian chapter of the VR/AR Association. The goal is to advocate for VR and AR usage in this region and let the world see what Nigerian companies are doing with VR and AR technology.\n\nHA: You\u2019re a young woman with a thriving career. Do you see yourself sticking with cloud engineering for a long time, or is there a career pivot in your future?\n\nAN: There\u2019s a career pivot in my future. I see myself taking on more roles that allow me to make business decisions within tech organisations pretty soon. Engineering decisions are fun, but I definitely want to take on roles that will enable me to make more business and product decisions at some point in my career.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian mobility company, GIG Mobility has announced a new leadership team with Enahoro Okhae as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nJoining Okhae are Jude Odum as Chief Operating Officer, Funmi Ogunleye as Chief Process Officer, John Okafor as Chief Procurement Officer, Chukwudi Anyawuocha as Chief Enterprise Business Officer, and Kenneth Nwanganga as Chief Technology Officer.\n\nOkhae brings over a decade of experience working with various businesses in different capacities and is the president of the Life Coaches Association of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnahoro Okhae, CEO, GIG Mobility\n\nFollowing the announcement, Chidi Ajaere, CEO of Greatman Legend (formerly GIG Group), said, in a statement, \u201cI believe that GIGM is ready to move on from its founders. Engaging in actionable steps to strengthen our goal to provide innovative and disruptive products as well as build an empowered and efficient workforce is something we are committed to at GIGM.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEnahoro brings unquantifiable experience to this role and will drive value for all stakeholders through his leadership and initiatives. I am delighted that we were able to get him to embrace the long-term vision of GIGM as he takes on this new role.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Okhae hinted at GIGM embedding more customer-friendly features in its products. \u201cTechnology has been pivotal in positioning GIGM as an industry leader, and technology will be the premise on which the company will continue to lead the industry.\n\n\u201cThe digital age is primarily characterised by customer-first features with crucial attention paid to customised services. This new dispensation will focus on implementing future-proof business strategies while integrating more lifestyle features into the GIGM application enabling users to do things freely while moving freely.\u201d\n\nBuilding a sustainable business\n\nOver the past few years, GIGM has steadily incorporated technology into its operations, transitioning from a transportation company to a tech-driven mobility player. In 2019, it launched its services in Ghana as part of moves to become a pan-African player.\n\nThat was followed by the addition of payment services in 2021 as the company revealed its desire to facilitate the movement of not just humans and goods but also value.\n\nCommenting on GIGM\u2019s mobility goals, Okhae shared that the company plans to embed more lifestyle features in its products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMobility is beyond movement; it is about the ability to move easily and unhindered irrespective of the channel: land, rail, water, air, or virtual/augmented reality. While moving freely, people should also be able to move things freely. This is the new renaissance of GIGM and the bedrock upon which we will embed more lifestyle features in the existing customer app.\u201d\n\nWith the new leadership not including anyone from the company\u2019s founding team, it would be interesting to watch the business\u2019 attempts to stay relevant in the face of stiff competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

My only regret is that I did not invest more,\u201d he added.\n\nNigerian stocks have rewarded local investors with the highest return among other African stocks this year, thanks to a combination of accommodative monetary policy and low yields on fixed income instruments.\n\nWith a return of 24 percent since the beginning of the year, the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) has left other African markets in its wake.\n\nNigeria stocks shed N101bn as profit taking continue\n\nFor instance, Nigerian stocks, on average, boast double the return of the second-best performing stock market \u2013 the Lusaka Securities Exchange in Zambia, which has gained 12 percent, according to data from Financial Times.\n\nThe NGX has also outperformed peers from the Johannesburg Exchange (6.1 percent) to the Egyptian Stock Exchange (-12.45 percent) and the Nairobi Securities Exchange (-15.91 percent).\n\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there. Nigerian stocks have also outperformed emerging market peers, which are down 11 percent on average.\n\nSome of the companies spurring the stock market rally, which is the biggest return in eight years, according to Bloomberg data, include Meyer Plc, a paint maker based in Lagos, which has returned 552 percent. That implies that an investor who staked N1 million in Meyer Plc\u2019s shares at the beginning of the year would have made an extra N5.52 million as at May 16.\n\nOther companies leading the charge include beer maker, Guinness Plc; tier-two bank, Wema; and palm-oil manufacturer, Presco Plc, all of which have rewarded investors with over double their investment in five months.\n\nMTN, the country\u2019s most capitalised company, has returned over 30 percent, exciting news for particularly new investors who partook in its initial public offer last year.\n\n\u201cWe are only five months into the year and the stock market is already running ahead of our full-year estimate of a 16 percent return,\u201d said Tajudeen Ibrahim, director of research at top investment bank, Chapel Hill Denham.\n\nThere are three factors responsible for the impressive stock performance in Nigeria, according to Ibrahim.\n\n\u201cThe accommodative monetary policy by the central bank despite rising inflation is one of those factors, coupled with unattractive fixed income yields and improvement in corporate results of some Nigerian companies,\u201d he said.\n\nWhereas interest rates are rising in other markets to curtail rising inflation, rates have remained stable in Nigeria as the authorities attempt to balance rising inflation with weak economic growth and ballooning public debt service costs.\n\nNigeria\u2019s benchmark interest rate has remained at 11.5 percent for two years, even though analysts are now expecting an increase before the end of the year as inflationary pressures mount.\n\nThe country\u2019s headline inflation rate has accelerated for six straight months, hitting 16.82 percent on rising food and energy prices, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. One-year Treasury bill yields are around 4 percent, four times lower than inflation rate.\n\n\u201cIn a pre-election year, one would have expected investors to be taking cover but there seems to be appetite across the market for various reasons such as good corporate results, dividend payments, expected future earnings growth,\u201d said Idris Toriola, an equities trader at Stanbic IBTC Stockbrokers.\n\nThe bullish run by Nigerian stocks may however not be sustainable. Interest rates may soon start to rise as the Central Bank of Nigeria comes under pressure from rising global interest rates. At the last Monetary Policy Committee meeting, four out of 10 members of the committee voted for a hike in interest rate, leading analysts to expect a hike in the second half of the year.\n\nNigeria\u2019s stock investors gain N1.2trn in week ended May 13\n\nSector-specific market moving news may yet come to the rescue for some stocks like the telecommunication companies, according to Ibrahim, who said news like the approval of a payment service banking license for MTN and Airtel may well see both stocks continue to outperform through the year.\n\nFor Toriola, some undervalued stocks like banking stocks, GTCO, Access, UBA, Zenith as well as NASCON, Nestle and Lafarge still deserve investor interest.\n\nThere\u2019s a feeling among market players that Nigerian stocks could be doing better if foreign investors were active in the market.\n\nForeign investors have largely exited the market due to acute foreign exchange shortages and are yet to return due to a lack of confidence and transparency in Nigeria\u2019s FX management system.",
          "summary": "The NGX has also outperformed peers from the Johannesburg Exchange (6.1 percent) to the Egyptian Stock Exchange (-12.45 percent) and the Nairobi Securities Exchange (-15.91 percent).\nNigerian stocks have also outperformed emerging market peers, which are down 11 percent on average.\nThe bullish run by Nigerian stocks may however not be sustainable.\nFor Toriola, some undervalued stocks like banking stocks, GTCO, Access, UBA, Zenith as well as NASCON, Nestle and Lafarge still deserve investor interest.\nThere\u2019s a feeling among market players that Nigerian stocks could be doing better if foreign investors were active in the market.",

The governor must do something urgently.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the government of Edo state for a solution to plight at hand.\n\n\u201cMoreover, Edo State should be concentrating on how to move the economy of the state forward, not forgetting the potentials of making Edo state the number one tourist state in Nigeria if not in Africa especially now that our stolen \u2018Benin bronzes\u2019 have been returned\u201d, she said.\n\nOboh-Macleod said the people of Ugboha, Ubiaja and other neighbouring communities in Esan land have continued to live in perpetual fears consequent upon the activities of the killer herdsmen who have constantly rain terror on them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s being done to the people of Esanland in Edo state is inhumane. It\u2019s like genocide.\n\n\u201d Esan people are mainly farmers and the land and the forest means a lot because that\u2019s where we get our livelihood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now being occupied by barbaric hoodlums masquerading as purported Fulani herdsmen whom are alleged to be heavily armed always\u201d, she said.\n\nShe alleged that the herdsmen are raping women in front of their husbands and children in front of their parents, actively kidnapping asking for ransom but allegedly killing most and harvesting their human organs in a professional way and still collecting ransom because they know that traditionally, they believe in laying to rest their dead ones.\n\nShe said this act is becoming rampant hence this call to Save Esan Land.\n\nShe also alleged that the security force have turned a blind eye or are inadequate so they urge the governor of Edo state as their elected Chief Security Officer to save their lives and properties because they are now afraid to go out of their houses, with their farms occupied.\n\nAccording to her \u201cWe are now starving and we fear they we come and drive us out of our home soon, a close relative said to me recently.\n\n\u201cThe high level of insecurity is unacceptable. With people constantly living in fear and are unable to go about their normal lives.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to governor Godwin Obaseki to Save Esan Land, Save the people of Edo state from this hoodlums.\n\n\u201cOur sons and daughters living in other parts of Nigeria and overseas are now unable to visit their beloved ancestral homes for fear of being kidnapped, raped, violated and killed or while still alive vital organs harvested from their bodies.\n\n\u201cVery painfully, the perpetrators still ask for a ransom to release these dead bodies for burial and in most cases, they are never returned even after ransoms are paid so, urgent intervention is needed by the government of Edo state whose duty is to protect lives and properties\u201d, she said.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has bemoaned the killing of Miss Deborah Samuel Yakubu last Thursday, 12th of May, 2022 at the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, saying that it came to Council as a jolting and troubling piece of news.\n\nIPAC in a statement signed by the national chairman, Engr Yabagi Yusuf Sani, said coming at the time the nation is practically groaning under the throes of different forms of insecurity and the nation at the threshold of another round of democratic elections, it was one sad, shocking and devastating calamity too many. It added that the tragedy was avoidable as it was unnecessary.\n\nThe national leadership of IPAC sent its heartfelt condolences to the parents and other members of the family of young, Miss Deborah Samuel Yakubu.\n\n\u201cIn the same breath, we are sending our condolences to the Niger State Government, the entire people of Niger State, the people of Rijau Local Government and particularly, members of the community of Tungan Magajiya over the understandably, painful, untimely passing on of a promising daughter.\n\nWe urge them to take heart in the belief that life and death come from the Most Superior Being who is the Supreme and everlasting Creator of all that exists on earth and in the heavens,\u201d it said.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cWithout going into the details in order not to tamper with frayed nerves, or, to exacerbate the smolders triggered by the unfortunate incident, IPAC will want to appeal to all concerned to exercise utmost restraint. We must avoid stoking the embers of mayhem or anarchy which always come with the capacity of snow-balling into great infernos of unimaginable and unanticipated dimensions and consequences. We implore our political, religious and traditional leaders to eschew the tendencies of making inflammatory utterances and statements that can inflame passions. We are as well urging the society\u2019s opinion moulders not to resort to taking actions overtly or covertly or, refusing to take actions, that is, eerie silence that connotes a tacit support for violence.\n\n\u201cWe are urging our youth, as leaders of tomorrow, to seriously desist from actions that are detrimental to the peace and tranquility of the country which puts in great peril the nation\u2019s unity and progress. As the greatest and most strategic beneficiaries and stakeholders in the future prosperity of Nigeria, our youths should be wary of being used as canon-fodders by unpatriotic and misguided agents of destabilisation and disunity.\u201d\n\nIPAC commended the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III for his prompt and courageous response and stance in the wake of the unfortunate incident thus, demonstrating once again, his fatherly and stateman stature in the society.\n\nIt also commended the deft, firm and decisive security measures put in place by the Sokoto State governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal which contributed in no small measures in curbing the threatening tide of violence that was welling up in the aftermath of the gory incident.\n\n\u201cWe also wish to register our appreciation and commendation to the Governor of Kaduna State, His Excellency, Mal. Nasiru El-Rufai for the proactive steps he caused to be taken as a strategy to prevent the likely escalation of violence usually experienced in the wake of similar phenomena with origins in other states,\u201d it added.\n\nThe Council called on the authorities to ensure that all persons culpable in the gruesome, indefensible and despicable act are brought to book to serve as a deterrent.\n\n\u201cThis is especially against the backdrop of our belief that the religion of Islam neither condones arbitrary acts of taking laws into one\u2019s hands, or, the blood-chilling barbarism demonstrated by the perpetrators of the incident,\u201d it added.",

Of this number, 85% died of heart attack and stroke. Unfortunately, 75% of deaths arising from cardiovascular accidents occur in low and middle-income countries of which Nigeria is one.\n\n\u201cBringing this closer home, according to the 2021 statistics, an estimated 76.2 million Nigerians or 38 per cent of the national population were hypertensive. Meanwhile, of this number, only 23 million or 30% of this affected population are taking medications,\u201d averred Ikebudu\n\nThe PSN chair said there is widespread apathy among sufferers and potential sufferers of hypertension towards checking their blood pressures regularly and accurately and harped on the need for all adults who are at least 40 years, to take their health seriously and avoid falling victim to hypertension which he referred to as the \u201csilent killer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that there is an apathy by the vast majority of persons with elevated blood pressure in taking measures that would enable them maintain adequate control of their blood pressures, thereby preventing cardiovascular accidents and ultimately early death.\u201d\n\nAlso at the event, the Chairperson of the Abuja branch of the Association of Lady Pharmacists (ALPs), Pharm.

Though the process is ongoing, agitation and struggle over delegates among 2023 presidential aspirants are making it difficult for the party to conclude the process.\u201d\n\nThe source also disclosed that \u201cthe party is working round the clock to resolve all issues and complete the compilation of the delegates\u2019 list to meet up with the INEC deadline.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) Tuesday inaugurated 37 screening committees to screen more than 3,000 of its members jostling for House of Assembly seats nationwide.\n\nThe leadership of the party constituted each committee per state and also for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nEach committee has seven members per state, while the screening appeal committee has five members per state, including the FCT.\n\n\u2018May 30 date remains\u2019\n\nThe party has, however, denied altering the date of its presidential primary scheduled to hold between May 30 and June 1, 2022.\n\nThere were reports in some sections of the media suggesting that the ruling party had altered the date of its presidential primary from May 30 to May 28, the same day the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would hold its own version.\n\nHowever, National Publicity Secretary of the party, Felix Morka, in a statement issued Tuesday described the report as fake.\n\nThe party stated categorically that should an adjustment become necessary, such changes would be communicated via its official communication channels.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to a story of purported adjustment to the All Progressives Congress (APC) Timetable/ Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Elections which is making the rounds on social media.\n\n\u201cThe story should be disregarded as fake news.\n\n\u201cThe party\u2019s timetable/schedule of activities for the 2023 elections remain as earlier published:\n\nGovernorship-Friday, 20th of May, 2022; State House of Assembly \u2013 Sunday, 22nd of May, 2022; House of Representatives-Tuesday, 24th of May, 2022; Senate \u2013 Wednesday, 25th of May 2022; Presidential-Monday, 30th of May to June 1st, 2022.\u201d\n\nScreening\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration ceremony, Tuesday, Deputy National Chairman, North, Senator Abubakar Kyari, said the screening would be conducted simultaneously alongside the election of local government and state delegates.\n\nHe said: \u201cInitially we are supposed to have two processes, but we have decided to combine both exercises so that you all can conduct the exercises one after the other or simultaneously if the situation permits.\n\n\u201cThis is the foundation of all the primaries. We have just conducted the screening of the gubernatorial, senatorial and House of Representatives aspirants.\n\n\u201cBut the basic foundation is what you people are going to do, which is the election of local government and state delegates. APC, we are in government today simply by championing the call for economic and social change.\u201d\n\nKyari said after seven and half years, members of the party could beat their chest that the party had achieved what others were unable to do.\n\n\u201cWe are at the verge of electing new leaders for the post Buhari era and that is why you are chosen to spearhead it and I have no doubt in my mind that with the caliber of people I\u2019m seeing here, we would do just that. Politics is dynamic and ambition is dynamic. You will face challenges but that is why you are there to succumb to those challenges,\u201d Kyari added.\n\nAlso, National Organising Secretary, Suleiman Argungu, has described the assignment as one of the critical segments of the party\u2019s transition to the 2023 general election.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will provide each chairman and secretary of each committee the guidelines specifying roles of the committee which include minimum requirements; APC requirements; educational requirements; payment of form fees which qualifies each aspirant to contest; sponsors and if anybody goes against Section 84(3) of the Electoral Acts as amended stands disqualified.\u201d\n\nArgungu said each committee would be provided with an aspirant assessment verification form that the committee would follow diligently to ensure justice is done to each of the aspirant who has purchased forms and submitted.\n\nOn his part, Chairman of Kebbi state appeal screening committee and Director General Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, said the assignment was about building a foundation for the new leadership of the country that would emanate from the candidates of the various political parties.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn our own instance in the All Progressives Congress, what we are going to do in our various states is to screen those we think are qualified to run for the House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe have over 3000 aspirants contesting across the country. And for us to do a good job, we want to make it easier for the electorate by presenting those who are better, more qualified, that meet all the conditions, one of which is being a Nigerian, having gone to secondary school and being of good behavior. This is our job.\n\n\u201cWe are going to elect five (5) delegates per ward and there are 8,809 wards in the country. Those elected 5 delegates per ward will go to the state and elect the governor.\n\n\u201cWe are going to elect three (3) delegates from each of the 774 local governments who will elect the president. But the first job is the screening and the delegates would be elected and the delegates would in turn elect the guber and presidential candidates.\u201d\n\nThe implication is that a total of 2,322 elective delegates are expected at the presidential primary, while 44,045 delegates would elect the governorship candidates of the party across the states.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

ABCON under my leadership will continue to encourage our members to play the vital role of closing the exchange rate gaps in the market and reducing widening premium between the parallel market and the official window,\u201d he said.\n\nGwadabe listed several factors that continue to undermine the naira stability and the local currency\u2019s value against other currencies.\n\nThe ABCON boss called for the creation of BDCs\u2019 Autonomous Foreign Exchange Trading Window (BAFEX) with determined maximum daily limit for legible BDCs to access dollars from banks, autonomous market and diaspora forex widow at the prevailing market prices.\n\nHe requested for enhancement of existing BDCs\u2019 automation portals to file transaction returns on CBN/ABCON/NFIU/NIBSS portals for effective regulatory monitoring and supervisions.\n\nGwadabe also sought for the creation of an automation portal to encourage registration of undocumented and unlicensed operators for effective monitoring, identification and tracking of their transactions.\n\nHe said the reluctance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to open new windows through which foreign exchange can be attracted to the economy remains a key factor in the naira continued fall.\n\nHe said the non-inclusion of BDCs in the list of channels through which diaspora remittances flow to Nigeria, under the CBN\u2019s guidance and regulation, has reduced the volume of dollar inflows to the economy.\n\nAccording to him, the World Bank\u2019s latest Migration and Development Brief showed that Sub-Saharan Africa attracting $49 billion in 2021. The bank said officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to increase by 4.2 per cent this year to reach $630 billion.\n\nGwadabe said Nigeria\u2019s contribution to the remittances fund is expected to rise when BDCs are allowed to receive funds from Nigerians in Diaspora into the economy.\n\nHe said the BDCs are to perform this role through contactless and digitised channels that make collections easy and seamless.\n\nHe said there is urgent need to review the guidelines on BDC\u2019s Scope of Operations to include participation in payment space, such as agency banking, Point of Sale (PoS) services, inbound and outbound forex transfers, ATM Forex services, to reflect global business model practice.\n\nHe suggested that the BDCs should be allowed to access dollars or diaspora remittances through the autonomous forex windows that enable operators to receive IMTOs proceeds, carry out online dollar operations and Point of Sale (PoS) Agency, among others.\n\nGwadabe insisted that now is the time to break the current industry monopoly that puts the remittances market in the hands of few players depriving others from tapping into the plan.\n\nThe ABCON boss also called for the establishment of training institutes to enhance capacity and infrastructure in the industry and broaden players\u2019 business scope with cash-back incentives for those that patronize BDCs while also implementing a less cumbersome and complex documentation requirements for end users.\n\n\u201cThe BDCs should be able to operate a network of digital solutions for PTA/BTA. This would reduce overheads, and improve profitability. Some BDCs might still consider working closer with commercial banks. The ABCON can also be recognized as self-regulatory organization to enable it operate effectively and sanction erring members,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our resolve to align with the policy thrust of the apex bank and ensure that ABCON members play their roles professionally and strategically in the interest of the market and economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that de-marketing of BDCs by regulators and security agencies is not good for the stability of the market.

          "text": "Finland and Sweden formally applied to join NATO on Wednesday, prompted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and triggering one of the most significant changes in Europe\u2019s security architecture in decades.\n\nThe applications came after more than 250 Ukrainian fighters surrendered to Russian forces at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol after weeks of resistance, bringing an end to the most devastating siege of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nFinland and Sweden were both neutral throughout the Cold War and their decision to join NATO reflects the sweeping shift in public opinion in the Nordic region since Russia\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion.\n\nIt also brings about an expansion of the Western alliance that Russian President Vladimir Putin had long invoked as one of the main justifications for ordering his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine in February.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic moment, which we must seize,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at a ceremony in which the Swedish and Finnish ambassadors to the alliance handed over their application letters.\n\nRatification of all 30 allied parliaments could take up to a year, diplomats say.\n\nTurkey has surprised its allies in recent days by saying it had reservations about the new prospective members, but Stoltenberg said he thought the issues could be overcome.\n\nAnkara has said it wants the Nordic countries to halt support for Kurdish militant groups present on their territory and lift bans on some sales of arms to Turkey.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden will host the leaders of Sweden and Finland at the White House on Thursday to discuss the applications, the White House said.\n\nAfter weeks in which Russia threatened retaliation against the NATO plans, Putin appeared to abruptly climb down, saying in a speech on Monday that Russia had \u201cno problems\u201d with either Finland or Sweden, and that their NATO membership would not be an issue unless the alliance sent more troops or weapons there.\n\nThe steelworks surrender in Mariupol allowed Putin to claim a rare victory in a campaign which many military analysts say has stalled.\n\nWhile both sides spoke of a deal under which all Ukrainian troops would abandon the steelworks, many details were not yet public, including how many fighters still remained inside, and whether any form of prisoner swap had been agreed.\n\nPOSSIBLE PRISONER EXCHANGE\n\nBuses left the steelworks late on Monday in a convoy escorted by Russian armoured vehicles. Five arrived in the Russian-held town of Novoazovsk, where Moscow said wounded fighters would be treated.\n\nSeven buses carrying Ukrainian fighters from the Azovstal garrison arrived at a newly reopened prison in the Russian-controlled town of Olenivka near Donetsk, a Reuters witness said.\n\nRussia said at least 256 Ukrainian fighters had \u201claid down their arms and surrendered\u201d, including 51 severely wounded. Ukraine said 264 soldiers, including 53 wounded, had left.\n\nRussian defence ministry video showed fighters leaving the plant, some carried on stretchers, others with hands up to be searched by Russian troops.\n\nThere were some women aboard at least one of the buses in Olenivka, Reuters video showed.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin had personally guaranteed the prisoners would be treated according to international standards, and Ukrainian officials said they could be exchanged for Russian captives.\n\nUkrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said Kyiv aimed to arrange a prisoner swap for the wounded once their condition stabilised.\n\nRussian Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations Dmitry Polyansky said there had been no deal, tweeting: \u201cI didn\u2019t know English has so many ways to express a single message: the #Azovnazis have unconditionally surrendered.\u201d\n\nTASS news agency reported a Russian committee planned to question the soldiers, many of them members of the Azov Battalion, as part of an investigation into what Moscow calls \u201cUkrainian regime crimes\u201d.\n\nFighters of the Azov Regiment are lionised as heroes in Ukraine, but reviled by the Kremlin as a band of Russia-hating neo-Nazis.\n\nHigh-profile Russian lawmakers spoke out against any prisoner swap. Leonid Slutsky, one of Russia\u2019s negotiators in talks with Ukraine, called the evacuated combatants \u201canimals in human form\u201d and said they should be executed.\n\nFormed in 2014 as an extreme right-wing volunteer militia to fight Russian-backed separatists, the Azov Regiment denies being fascist or neo-Nazi. Ukraine says it has been reformed and integrated into the National Guard.\n\nBATTLE FOR DONBAS\n\nThe battle for Mariupol is Russia\u2019s biggest victory since its invasion, giving it control of the Azov Sea coast and an unbroken stretch of eastern and southern Ukraine. But the port lies in ruins, and Ukraine believes tens of thousands of people were killed under months of Russian bombardment.\n\nRussia\u2019s offensive in the east, meanwhile, appeared to be making little progress, although the Kremlin says all its objectives will be reached in its bid to \u201cdemilitarise\u201d Ukraine.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military command said Russia continued to shell Ukrainian positions along the entire frontline in the east on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIn the Kharkiv direction, the enemy focused on maintaining its positions and preventing the further advance of our troops,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s general staff said in a statement.\n\nAround a third of the Donbas was held by Russia-backed separatists before the invasion. Moscow now controls around 90% of Luhansk region, but it has failed to make major inroads towards the key cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in Donetsk in order to extend control over the entire Donbas.\n\nUkrainian forces have advanced at their fastest pace for more than a month, driving Russian forces out of the area around Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city.\n\nUkraine says its forces had reached the Russian border, 40 km (25 miles) north of Kharkiv. They have also pushed at least as far as the Siverskiy Donets river 40 km to the east, where they could threaten Russian supply lines.",

          "text": "Africa\u2019s multilateral trade finance institution, the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), has signed a deal with the African Petroleum Producers Organisation (APPO) for the creation of an energy bank.\n\nThe deal followed pressure from Nigeria and other oil-producing African countries to float a bank that will cater to the energy needs of the continent as a result of declining global investment in the oil and gas sector.\n\nRecently, the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, while marshalling reasons for the urgent need to establish the bank, stated that it will help boost business activities in the sector on the continent.\n\nThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had recently projected that the global oil industry will require about $12.6 trillion investments in the downstream, midstream as well as upstream to sustain its innovative and production efficiency in the next 25 years.\n\nIt warned that Nigeria\u2019s economy as well as those of other resource-dependent countries may be badly affected, especially if the current push against fossil fuels continues to gain ground.\n\nSylva said since western nations were scaling down funding for hydrocarbon exploration across the world and focusing on renewable energies, setting up an African energy bank remains a viable way to neutralise the threat.\n\nAccording to the minister, the call for the establishment of the bank is heightened by the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), stressing that the Act will open up the oil and gas sector for huge investments, going forward.\n\n\u201cIf we insist on the exploration of our oil and gas reserves when the world is cutting down on investments in the sector, we must set a financial institution, an African energy bank, to develop the oil and gas sector,\u201d he insisted.\n\nBut during the signing ceremony at the ongoing 8th African Petroleum Congress and Exhibition tagged \u201cCAPE VIII\u201d in Luanda, Angola, the parties explained that the deal was aimed at scaling up private sector investment in African oil and gas projects.\n\nThe bank is expected to provide critical financing for new and existing oil and gas projects as well as energy developments across the entire value chain.\n\nWhile the Director and Global Head, Client Relations, Afreximbank, Mr. Rene Awambeng signed on behalf of the bank, Nigeria\u2019s Omar Farouk, Secretary General of APPO, appended his signature on behalf of African oil producers.\n\nA communiqu\u00e9 by the parties stated that the deal was made possible having regard to the long, mutually beneficial relationship and cooperation between APPO and Afreximbank.\n\nThey noted that they were concerned about the threat posed to the African oil and gas industry and Africa\u2019s economic development by the coordinated withdrawal of international trade and project financing from Africa\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\nAccording to the signatories , having acknowledged the impact of climate change on Africa and aware that poverty fosters accelerated environmental degradation, there was the need for an orderly and just transition that protects the environment and enhances living standards.\n\n\u201cThe two African institutions have resolved to work together to find an Africa-led solution to the threat posed to the African oil and gas industry and an orderly energy transition in Africa by the withdrawal of funding by its traditional financiers.\n\n\u201cThe two institutions have committed to taking necessary actions to promote a sustainable and balanced solution to the challenge of financing the oil and gas industry in Africa during the energy transition.\n\n\u201cThis will be done through, among others, the establishment of an African energy transition bank dedicated to supporting an Africa-led energy transition strategy that is consistent with the goal of preserving the environment and livelihoods,\u201d the African institutions said.\n\nWhile the developed world calls for the end of fossil fuels due to climate change, Africa continues to face the crisis of energy poverty.\n\nAccording to available data, over 600 million lack access to electricity and 900 million lack access to clean cooking solutions, leading to stakeholders calling for the rapid expansion of the oil and gas sector.\n\nDespite these calls, global investors are shying away from hydrocarbons, leaving the continent without the investment it needs if it is to capitalise on its resources.\n\nThe African Energy Chamber, (AEC) Q1 2022 report on the state of African energy, says that from the peak in 2014 at $60 billion, capital expenditure in Africa declined to $22.5 billion in 2020.\n\nDespite projected increases to $30 billion, significant levels of investment are still required, and thus, the role of African financial institutions has been emphasised, it said.\n\nOrganisations such as the Afreximbank have already made notable progress to drive oil and gas project developments. At the end of 2020, the Afreximbank\u2019s total assets and guarantees stood at $21.5 billion, with shareholder funds amounting to $3.4 billion.\n\nThe Afreximbank-APPO MoU, the deal said, is aimed at alleviating these challenges and ensuring the provision of capital for Africa\u2019s upcoming oil and gas projects.\n\nBased in Africa, the bank will operate as an independent entity, regulated and led by experienced professionals that know and understand Africa\u2019s energy needs.\n\nThe proposed bank, it said, will not be a substitute for private investment, however, but rather, will serve as a catalyst for Africa-directed investment.\n\n\u201cThe African Energy Chamber has been pushing for the creation of an African Energy Bank, one that is African-based and Africa-focused, and I am proud to announce that the Afreximbank and APPO have taken the first steps towards its creation.\n\n\u201c The bank will be critical for Africa\u2019s energy sector, serving as a catalyst \u2013 not a substitute \u2013 for private investment in African energy.\n\n\u201cThis is a practical strategy for prosperity and a pragmatic vision that must be embraced by all who want to make energy poverty history and fight climate change,\u201d the Executive Chairman of the AEC, N.J Ayuk, said.",

          "text": "The Head of Commercial Section/Commercial Counsellor, Lagos US Consulate, David Russell, on Tuesday, stated that the current visa environment between Nigeria and the United States of America was the biggest limiting factor hindering trade between both countries.\n\nThe US envoy stated this at the Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce ((NACC) breakfast meeting in Lagos, with the theme: \u201cUS Mission\u2019s Current Commercial-focused Activities in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAccording to him, many Nigerians doing business with the United States have had difficulties traveling for training and connecting with their business partners which he said was detrimental to the overall business relationships.\n\nIn his words: \u201cWe put a lot more focus on ensuring that we work with our partners across the embassy to facilitate traveling when we are able to. We are dedicated to doing what we can to build capacities for both travels to the United States and here in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nRussell added: \u201cOne of the biggest limiting factors we have with doing business with US is the current visa environment in which people doing business with US have had difficulties travelling for trainings and connecting with their business partners which is detrimental to their overall business relationships.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that US businesses were willing to invest in Nigeria, but are however worried over trust gaps in working in unfamiliar markets like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have to get the risk profile to a level that is acceptable to US businesses.
