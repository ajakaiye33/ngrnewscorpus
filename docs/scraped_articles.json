          "text": "One Prince Reuben has been paraded by the Nigerian Police Force for raping and killing a woman who wanted to buy a plot of land from him in Rivers State.\n\nAccording to Force Publicity Relations Officer, CP Frank Mba, Reuben and three others who are at large committed the crime together.\n\nHe said, \u201cPrince Reuben who hails from Eche in Rivers State had earlier sold a plot of land to one Joy Saturday, a hardworking mother of four and a petty trader who laboured so hard to put together the first N250, 000 to buy the plot of land.\n\n\u201cThereafter, he(Reuben) lured this lady, pretending that there is another vacant land for sale.\n\n\u201cJoy Saturday accompanied Reuben to the bush side ostensibly on an inspection. Unknown to this innocent hardworking woman, Reuben had conspired with three other friends of his namely Nwaba, Promise and Chinedu.\n\n\u201cDuring the inspection tour, Joy was kidnapped by these men. They took her into the forest, gang-raped her, stole the only cash sum she had with her (N20, 000) and then shot her to death. After killing her, they poured acid on her body and then threw it into the forest.\n\n\u201cNwaba, Chinedu and Promise are currently at large.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Mba appealed to Nigerians who might have information on the whereabouts of the suspects at large to inform authorities so that they can be apprehended to face the law.\n\nThe paraded suspect, when asked to speak, confessed to having committed the crime.\n\nNarrating how it happened, he said, \u201cOn that day, I went to my place of work. She called me on phone saying she\u2019s coming to see the land. I said okay, but I\u2019m at work and will close by 4pm. She said I should call her when I close.\n\n\u201cBefore then, my friends (the other suspects) told me that they are going to kidnap her and make money from her. I said no problem.\u201d\n\nHe said when he took the woman to see the land, his friends who were hiding somewhere came out, kidnapped the woman and took her to the forest.\n\n\u201cWe raped her, killed her and poured acid on her,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Don\u2019t reassign Maina\u2019s case to another judge, EFCC urges Chief Judge",
          "text": "Maina in court\n\nThe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has urged the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court (FHC), Justice John Tsoho, not to reassign Abdulrasheed Maina\u2019s case to another judge.\n\nThe EFCC also called on Justice Tsoho not to transfer the trial of his son, Faisal, and few other cases which matters had far been heard to a new judge.\n\n\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Justice Okon Abang was the presiding judge in the trial of the Chairman, dedunct Pension Reformed Task Team (PRTT), Maina and his son, before he was transfered to Warri division of FHC.\n\n\n\nThe Chief Judge, Tsoho, had, in a March 16 circular, ordered a mass transfer of judges in the 36 divisions of the court and directed the newly posted judges to assume duty in their newly reassigned places on April 12.\n\n\n\nWhile Justice D.U. Okonkwo took over from Abang, Justice Folashade Giwa-Ogunbanjo, who was transferred to Enugu, was replaced by Justice Zainab Abubakar and Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, now in Calabar division, was replaced by Justice Bolaji Olajuwon.\n\n\n\nBut no sooner than the judges\u2019 transfer was done than the judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) went on a 64-day strike to demand financial autonomy for the judiciary.\n\n\n\nJUSUN, which began its nationwide strike on April 6, suspended it on June 9.\n\nThe development, however, hindered court proceedings in the country, forcing the EFCC to apply to Justice Tsoho for a fiat to allow Justice Abang conclude some of the cases it started, including Maina\u2019s matter.\n\n\n\nNAN reports that it is a common practice that whenever a judge is transfered before delivering judgment in a case he or she handles, the case will have to start afresh if another judge takes over.\n\n\n\nSuch case, however, can continue only where parties in the suit apply for a fiat to allow the presiding judge to conclude the matter irrespective of his or her new posting.\n\n\n\nThe judge is then bound to come from his current division to hear the case.\n\nA competent source at the EFCC\u2019s office told NAN that since Maina\u2019s trial had gone far, it would only be good, in the interest of justice, for Abang to conclude the matter.\n\n\u201cHe (Maina) has been arraigned, we have called all our witnesses and the defendant (Maina) has opened his defence.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo it will only be proper for the presiding judge to conclude the trial to guard against delay in justice,\u201d the source who did not want to be named said.\n\n\n\nNAN recalls that Maina\u2019s trial was surrounded by controversies and dramas.\n\nMaina (1st defendant), who was arraigned before Justice Abang on Oct. 25, 2019, by the EFCC alongside his firm, Common Input Property and Investment Ltd (2nd defendant), pleaded not guilty to the 12-count charge bordering on money laundering to the tune of N2 billion.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the proceedings, the judge had told Maina that he was uncomfortable with the manner the ex-pension boss stared at him.\n\n\n\nThe development generated reactions from the defence counsel as Maina, on Oct. 30, 2019, prayed the court to transfer his case to another judge on the grounds that he was not also comfortable with Abang\u2019s way of handling his matter but the request was overruled.\n\n\n\nHe had collapsed in the courtroom while the case was ongoing over ill-health.\n\nWhile Lawyer Mohammed Abubakar had consistently being appearing for the prosecution, Maina had changed counsel no few than seven times.\n\n\n\nNAN observes that Joe Gadzama, SAN; Ahmed Raji, SAN; Adeola Adedipe; Afam Osigwe, SAN; late Esther Uzoma; Sani Katu, SAN; Paul Adaji and Anayo Adibe had appeared for Maina as counsel in the course of the trial.\n\n\n\nThe court had, on June 29, 2020, varied his bail conditions eight months after his inability to meet the terms.\n\n\n\nHe jumped bail and was said to have fled to Republic of Niger around September 2020.\n\n\n\nThe court, on Nov. 18, 2020, then ordered his trial to continue in absentia.\n\nHis surety, Sen. Ali Ndume, was remanded in Kuje Prison for about five days before Maina\u2019s rearrest.\n\n\n\nMaina, who was produced in court on Dec. 4, 2020, was ordered to be remanded in prison custody pending the hearing and final determination of his matter.\n\n\n\nThe EFCC, on Dec. 9, 2020, closed its case after calling nine witnesses.\n\nAlthough Maina had applied for a no-case submission, the court, on Dec. 21, 2020, foreclosed his right to make such application on the grounds that the ex-pension boss had had adequate time and facility to make the submission but failed to do so.\n\n\n\nMaina, who had only called two witnesses in his defence, had, on March 8, applied for a subpoena compelling the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami; the Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, Godwin Emefiele; former acting Chairman of EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, among others, to appear in court and testify in the ongoing case against him.\n\n\n\nBesides, his first defence witness, Ngozika Ihuoma, while giving his evidence-in-chief, alleged that EFCC under Magu misappropriated 222 property worth N1.63 trillion recovered by the Maina-led PRTT.\n\n\n\nHe alleged that Magu had sold most of the property to his friends and associates.\n\nIhuoma had also told the court that the AGF and the National Security Adviser (NSA) met with Maina in Dubai, the United Arab Emirate, in January 2016 and that \u201cafter the meeting in Dubai, Maina gave the delegation intelligence report that led to the recovery of N1.3 trillion out of the N3 trillion promised to recover.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmidst these allegations, the judge fixed April 13 to hear subpoenaed witnesses and for trial continuation before issues of his transfer and JUSUN strike crept in.\n\n\n\nFaisal, like his father, also jumped bail. He was arraigned on Oct. 25, 2019, by the anti-graft agency on a three-count charge bordering on money laundering.\n\n\n\nAlthough he was admitted to bail, the EFCC, on Feb. 4, told the court that Maina\u2019s son had absconded to the United States of America (USA) through the Republic of Niger after jumping bail.\n\nHis surety, Rep Sani Dan-Galadima representing Kaura-Namoda Federal Constituency of Zamfara, forfeited a property used as a bail bond following his inability to produce Faisal in court to stand his trial.\n\n\n\nThe judge had also ordered his trial to continue in his absence.\n\nHowever, controversies had also surrounded Faisal\u2019s whereabouts.\n\n\n\nHis counsel, Anayo Adibe, claimed that his client had been arrested by security operatives and was in custody of the police in Sokoto contrary to the anti-graft agency\u2019s claim that he had sneaked to the USA.\n\n\n\nAdibe, who disagreed that the defendant must have fled to the U.S. when his travel documents were still in the custody of the court, urged the court to make an order of enquiry into Faisal\u2019s whereabouts.\n\n\n\nHowever, after the prosecution closed its case, the defendant (Faisal) did not call any witness.\n\n\n\nThe EFCC, which called three witnesses in Faisal\u2019s trial, was only waiting for adoption of final written address before the issues of Abang\u2019s transfer and JUSUN strike also came up.\n\n\n\nNAN also reports that Maina\u2019s family, on Nov. 24, 2019, called on Justice Tsoho to reassigned the case against Faisal to another judge.\n\n\n\nThey said that they had lost confidence that their son could get justice in Abang\u2019s court.\n\n\n\nThe source also told NAN that the anti-corruption commission had also applied for a fiat in the trial of former Governor of Adamawa, Murtala Nyako and the case involving a director in Process and Industrial Development (P&ID), James Nolan.\n\nThe two cases are also before Justice Abang.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the office, we were asked to submit list of cases that we have gone far in prosecuting so that application for fiat could be applied for due to the recent transfer of judges handling them.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo those cases were compiled and the applications forwarded to the chief judge,\u201d the source said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Media-focused civil society organization, International Press Centre, IPC, and other advocacy groups have expressed opposition to the proposed regulation of tariff of pay television operators contained in the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC, Act amendment.\n\nIPC and other advocacy groups made their views known in Abuja on Wednesday at the public hearing of a bill to amend the NBC Act organised by the House Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values.\n\nIn his presentation titled \u201cIndependence of NBC/Depoliticised process of licensing, industry-sensitive pricing system, checking arbitrariness\u201d, IPC\u2019s Executive Director, Mr. Lanre Arogundade, said fixing tariffs arbitrarily has the potential to discourage investments in the sector and bring about job losses.\n\nHe added that handing the NBC the sole right to determine pay television tariffs could be interpreted as an ouster clause that gives it arbitrary powers that are unchallengeable in the court of law.\n\nArogundade emphasised that the provisions must also not encourage the regulator to become a dictatorial entity with unrestrained powers and conduct, as doing so will negate democratic norms and values.\n\nHe also noted that unlike other regulatory bodies such as the National Communications Commission, NCC, the appointment of the Board, including the Director-General, is not subject to the confirmation of the National Assembly.\n\nArogundade pointed out that the conduct of the NBC over time marks it out as an extension of the office of the Minister of Information and Culture and rarely acts independently.\n\nHe stated that in recent times, the NBC has taken politically-motivated action against certain broadcast media platforms, adding that such actions make it imperative for reforms that will make the NBC truly independent.\n\nHe also described the process of licensing broadcast stations as politically compromised under the extant NBC Act.\n\n\u201cFixing tariffs arbitrarily could lead to excessive pricing that has the potential of discouraging investment in the sector and the attendant job losses.\n\n\u201cGiving the NBC the sole right over tariff issues which cannot be interfered with could be interpreted as an ouster clause that arrogate to its arbitrary powers that cannot be challenged even in the court of law,\u201d he stressed.\n\nArogundade noted that the proposal to regulate tariff in the NBC Act amendment bill represents a usurpation of the functions of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission Act (FCCPC Act), which has adequate provisions to deal with the often contentious issue of competition and pricing in Nigeria.\n\nHe lamented that the NBC currently operates as an institution that is a law unto itself and on the whims of its Director-General, which make it decide that an offence has been committed, decide the punishment and go apply the sanctions, including shutdowns of broadcast stations.\n\nThis situation, he said, makes the NBC the accuser, prosecutor and judge in its own case.\n\nTo end this, Arogundade said the NBC Act should provide for the right of appeal to the Board of NBC, adding that the national broadcasting code should include hefty fines, suspension or withdrawal of licence if offence is confirmed after appeal.\n\nAlso lending his voice, the Executive Director, Institute for Media and Society, Dr. Akin Akingbulu, said the most prominent gap in the NBC is its failure to provide for the independence of the regulatory body.\n\nHe said lack of independence manifests in many ways such as in skewed decision-making, inconsistencies in attention to regulatory functions, inability to protect the industry and strengthen its professionalism, inability to meet international standards and ultimately, failure to deliver on its mandate.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Director, Institute for Media and Society, Dr. Akin

skewed decision-making, inconsistencies in attention to regulatory functions, inability to protect the industry and strengthen its professionalism, inability to meet international standards and ultimately, failure to deliver on its mandate.\n\nAlso, making his presentation on behalf of Ataguba and Ataguba Solicitors, Mr. Emmanuel Ataguba said the intendment of this amendment to regulate and control prices in the interest of consumers of Digital Satellite Television Services is against the objective of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act, which is to \u201cprotect and promote the interests and welfare of consumers by providing consumers with a wider variety of quality products (and services) at competitive prices\u201d.\n\nHe pointed out that he does not consider that price regulation would bene\ufb01t consumers, stressing that in public services where government subsidies are involved, price regulation may be relevant.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We want Oodua Nation, marched down to Centry, the border point between Nigeria and the Republic of Benin and forcefully opened the gates at the international frontier.\n\n\n\nIn a 20-minute viral video, a gun was snatched from an immigration officer and a man in a yellow T-shirt was seen shooting the gun into the air to the admiration of others at the scene.\n\n\n\nDifferent voices were heard in the video calling on soldiers and other security agents to come out and shoot.\n\n\n\nThey destroyed the gates at the border, screaming: \u201cWe have opened the border at Idiroko and asked people to begin their importing business through the route.\u201d\n\n\n\nDuring the invasion, a young man, who was accused of trying to record the incident with his mobile phone, was attacked and mercilessly beaten.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with Vanguard in a telephone chat, a community leader in the town, Mr. Olanrewaju Adelaja called on the Federal Government to address the issue of agitators that are coming from different quarters, attributing the agitations to the injustice being perpetrated by a section of the country against others.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThis agitation is getting out of hand. I don\u2019t know what the Federal Government is waiting for before something is done.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe major reason for all these agitations going on in different parts of the country is injustice. Once there is justice in this country, all these issues will become things of the past.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are all Nigerians and we all should be treated equally. \u201cOnce we are not treated equally, all these problems must arise. The Federal Government must do the needful now before it becomes too late.\u201d\n\nBorder remains shut\u2014 NCS\n\nReacting to the news of the forceful reopening of the border, the spokesperson for the Igun 1 Area Command of the Nigeria Customs Service, NCS, Hammed Oloyede, said the Idiroko border remained closed as directed by the Federal Government.\n\n\n\nOloyede said: \u201cThough a group of youths, who called themselves the Yoruba Nation Agitators stormed Idiroko border on Saturday, but the situation was brought under control, while the border remained shut.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe situation is under control, there is no problem whatsoever. Everywhere is calm. Our officers are at their duty posts with other security operatives.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe border is still closed and there is no movement whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also denied attacks on any Customs officers.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere was no attack on our patrol bases or checkpoints. Those guys were just doing their own. They tried to attack one patrol point, but it was repelled. The situation is under control. There is no problem.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his part, a Public Affairs Analyst, John Adeoluwa, said what happened on Saturday at Idiroko border was a wake-up call to both the federal and state governments to rise to their responsibilities before things get out of hands.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThough, I have seen where military and paramilitary personnel patrol towns and cities in what they call \u2018show of power, but I have never seen where smugglers and hoodlums stage show of power like what happened in Idiroko on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was very unfortunate that such thing could happen where we have constituted authority.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to commend men of the Nigeria Customs Service and other security operatives on the matured way they handled the situation on Saturday, that it did not degenerate into violence and bloodshed.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

It is the basis for human development. One can grow and not develop, but one can not develop without growth. As the economy grows and human capacity develops, it develops the economy. Higher level of income reduces infant mortality.\n\n\u201cEthnic and religious sentiments should be removed through education because development cannot occur where such exists.\n\n\u201cDevelopment involves the empowerment of women, children and men. An increase in development increases life expectancy. It results in a high level of life expectancy. And Accounting plays an essential role in economic development\u201d, he added.\n\nEarlier in his opening remarks, the Vice-Chancellor, Osun State University, Professor Labode Popoola, noted that the 2020 edition of the Candido Da Rocha Annual Memorial Lecture was supposed to have been held last year but could not because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe revealed that the lecture was part of the commitment of the University management to deliberate and proffer solutions to the developmental challenges currently facing the country.\n\nHuman rights activists launch movement against insecurity, kidnapping [PHOTOS]",

We thus disapprove of extreme posturing and agitations, verging on the dismemberment of the country as being demanded by some groups.\n\n\u201cAs political scientists, we do not grudge against some Nigerians who have grievances with the current state of affairs in Nigeria and are ready to canvass their views within the confines of the law. However, we reject the option of breaking up the country for the many consequences that some countries that have passed through the route are still living with.\n\n\u201cFortunately, we are in a democracy with its avowed principles guiding its operation. Its time-tested principles such as dialogue should be embraced by all in navigating the country away from the path of the precipice and thus strengthening the bond that exists among Nigerians.

I want to seize this opportunity to put it on record that our nation will forever be indebted to you, for your patriotic commitment to the defence of our fatherland against insurgency and criminality.\n\nI therefore commend you and remember all the personnel who have paid the supreme sacrifice in ensuring that Nigeria remains an indivisible and secure entity.\n\nAs I send my heartfelt condolences to the families of our fallen heroes and pray for the souls of the departed, I want to assure you that this administration will spare no effort or resources to ensure that the widows and children of our fallen heroes who paid the supreme price in defence of our beloved country, are well cared for.\n\nFurthermore, we will continue to ensure that our wounded comrades get the best medical attention towards their full recovery.\n\nWhile acknowledging your collective efforts at decimating and degrading the terrorists and reaffirming the inviolable sovereignty of our nation, I also wish to extol your steadfastness and untiring efforts in the face of the difficulties you experience in the Theatres of Operation.\n\nYour collective efforts have resulted in the relative peace being enjoyed in the region today. Under my watch, the Armed Forces of Nigeria have been provided a firm strategy and clear sense of direction to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.\n\nWe should not allow our adversaries the opportunity or breathing space to challenge or undermine our national interests and core values. The defence and security agencies should rest assured of the Federal Government\u2019s unalloyed commitment to winning the battle against terror and criminality.\n\nI am particularly happy to note the increasing understanding and cooperation within the military, as well as the inter-agency cooperation in the fight against the terrorists and other criminal elements in the North East.\n\nThe outcome of this synergy is evidenced by the successes recorded in the ongoing Operation TURA TAKAIBANGO which has so far degraded the insurgents\u2019 capabilities in the Timbuktu Triangle, Sambisa Forest and the Lake Chad Region. I am therefore pleased to acknowledge that the military and other security agencies including civilian stakeholders are adhering to the true spirit of Operation HADIN KAI which implies \u201cjointness, synergy and cooperation.\u201d\n\nBy pooling together, the collective resources and comparative advantages of the Armed Forces and other security agencies, we hope the enemy will now feel the ferocity of our firepower and the weight of our resolve.\n\nSide by side with the efforts of the Armed Forces and security agencies, this Administration is developing a strategy for post-war reconstruction and peace-building. Concerted efforts are being made to fast-track re-construction and development programmes in the affected communities in the North East.\n\nI am hopeful that this will lead to the speedy resettlement of displaced persons, as well as the restoration of bubbling community life as the people return to their homes.\n\nAlongside investment in development and reconstruction, we will sustain our investment in the Armed Forces in a manner that balances the \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d.\n\nSeveral interventions by this government have led to the procurement and delivery of large consignments of critical combat enablers, including high calibre weapons and ammunition.\n\nMany have been injected into the Theatre and soon other equipment that have just arrived the country would also be deployed to the Theatre of operations. Much more equipment will be procured for the Armed Forces to cater for both the short and long-term requirements.\n\nI would like, at this point to also commend the hierarchy of our Armed Forces for their strategic foresight in ensuring that some of our critical military equipment are fabricated locally.\n\nThe repairs and maintenance of some of these vital weapons are now being carried out in the country thereby saving the nation a lot of foreign exchange and also creating jobs for our teeming population.\n\nAs personnel of our Armed Forces and security agencies, you must understand that these items of equipment must be put to good use against the terrorists and other criminal elements. There is no room for complacency, and no need to be less than 100 per cent alert at all times.\n\nAs your Commander-in-Chief, I want to assure you that this government will continue to work towards the provision of timely funding and procurement of equipment for the Armed Forces and other security agencies. This is intended to boost the prosecution of the ongoing war to a logical conclusion and also to serve our collective interests and well-being.\n\nIn addition, your welfare is of utmost importance and concern to this government. I am glad that the gradual rotation of the troops in the field has commenced, as I directed. I am sure that this will minimize and possibly eliminate battle fatigue, as well as enhance troops\u2019 morale.\n\nI now wish to thank you for your unalloyed loyalty and selfless sacrifices towards the defence of our country. Your courage and gallantry will continue to inspire others, as they echo into the future.\n\nWhile I commend your resilience, let me remind you that there is still a lot of work to be done, to completely restore peace to the North East, stem the activities of armed bandits in the North West and North Central, as well as deal with other security challenges across the country.\n\nYou must therefore remain steadfast and see this war to a conclusive end. In doing so, you must rely on interagency cooperation, strengthen your cohesion with the troops of neighboring Republics of Cameroon, Chad and Niger in our collective fight against the terrorists, under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force. This will consolidate our efforts and facilitate the speedy return of peace and stability to the region.\n\n24. Once again I salute your courage and wish you the best, as you continue to make Nigeria proud.\n\nGod bless you all and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Commission creates 56,872 centres\n\n\u2022Fixes dates for Ekiti, Osun governorship elections\n\nBy Chuks Okocha\n\nAfter 25 years and ahead of preparations for the 2023 general election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday announced the creation of additional 56,873 polling units, with Lagos and Kano States topping the distribution list with 4,861 and 3,148 centres respectively.\n\nWith the creation of the polling units, Nigeria now has 176,846 polling units.\n\nThe new polling units were created after over 25 years of the creation of the old polling units of 119,973.\n\nINEC also removed 749 polling units from inappropriate facilities, nine of them from shrines, while others were from religious houses and palaces.\n\nINEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who gave the figures at a meeting with Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) in Abuja, said the history of creating and expanding polling units in Nigeria had been long and complex.\n\nHe said the adequacy and accessibility in terms of number and location across the country were some of the challenges that had to be addressed in the interest of credible elections.\n\nYakubu said: \u201cBefore 2010, the commission operated on a round figure of approximately 120,000 polling units. However, a census undertaken by the commission before the 2011 general election arrived at the precise figure of 119,973 polling units. The commission also made efforts to relocate many polling units from inappropriate places such as private residences and properties, palaces of traditional rulers and places of worship to public buildings accessible to voters, polling agents, observers and the media during elections.\u201d\n\nHe stated that following unsuccessful attempts to create additional polling units despite pressure from increased number of registered voters, the commission established voting points and voting point settlements nationwide as a pragmatic response to necessity.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe voting points were tied to the existing polling units and voting point settlements. The number of registered voters in a polling unit and the voting point settlements in the FCT was used to determine their voting points, based on the upper and lower thresholds of 500 and 750 voters respectively.\n\n\u201cThese were also, the limits used for the 2019 general election. The number of new polling units in a state is the number of voting points aggregated from those polling units having voting points.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, it was discovered that one polling unit in Lagos State had been wrongly categorised as a voting point and the error was corrected. With this adjustment, the actual number of approved polling units came to 119,974.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the commission arrived at the exact figure of 56,563 voting points in addition to 309 voting point settlements in the FCT, making a total of 56,872 voting points.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, after wide-ranging consultations with stakeholders and voting point settlements by officials, the 56,872 voting points and voting point settlements were converted and added to the existing 119,974 polling units.\n\n\u201cThe commission is glad to report that 25 years since the current polling units were created in 1996, the hard nut is finally and successfully cracked after several unsuccessful attempts. Nigeria now has 176,846 full-fledged polling units,\u201d Yakubu stated.\n\nAccording to him after consultation with stakeholders, the commission has successfully removed 749 polling units from inappropriate locations to appropriate public facilities or open spaces in line with INEC policy to guarantee unencumbered access to polling units for all voters.\n\nOf this figure, 232 removed from private units were relocated for various reasons which include distance, difficult terrain, congestion, communal conflict, new settlements and general insecurity.\u201d\n\nHowever, Yakubu said that in view of the advanced preparations already made by the commission, four pending bye-elections in Kaduna, Jigawa and Plateau States would be the last to be conducted using a combination of polling units and voting points.\n\n\u201cTwo of these elections in Sabon Gari State Constituency in Kaduna State and Gwaram Federal Constituency in Jigawa State are holding this weekend while the commission awaits the formal declaration of vacancies by the Honourable Speaker of the House of Representatives in respect of Lere Federal Constituency of Kaduna State, and Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency of Plateau State.\n\n\u201cFor subsequent elections, beginning from the Anambra State governorship election holding on 6th November 2021, there will be no voting points anymore in Nigeria,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe INEC chairman said the new approved polling units for each state of the federation and FCT would be presented to the public in 37 volumes at this meeting.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn behalf of the Independent National Electoral Commission, I would like to express our profound appreciation to the leadership of political parties, civil society organisations, the media, security agencies, religious leaders, socio-cultural associations, the labour unions, professional bodies, persons with disabilities, women and youth groups, students\u2019 unions, the Federal Executive Council (FEC), the state governors under the auspices of the National Economic Council (NEC) and the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe also acknowledge the invaluable support of the development partners for facilitating some of the stakeholder engagements and the publication of advocacy documents.\u201d\n\nYakubu said that the commission was preparing to conduct the remaining off-season end of tenure elections ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nHe said activities listed in the timetable for the Anambra State governorship election were being implemented, along with the those of the FCT Area Council election holding on 12th February 2022.\n\nHe stated that the Ekiti and Osun State governorship elections would hold next year.\n\nIn keeping with its policy of announcing the dates of elections in advance to enable early and effective preparations by all concerned, Yakubu said the commission had approved that the Ekiti State governorship election would hold on Saturday, June 18, 2022, while the Osun State governorship election would hold on July 16, 2022.\n\nState by State Distribution of New Polling Units\n\nMeanwhile, Lagos State and Kano State got the highest allocation from the 56, 872 new polling units, with 4,861, and 3,148 units, respectively.\n\nAccording to the breakdown obtained by THISDAY, the 19 northern and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have a total of 31,196 polling units while the 17 Southern states have 25,676 polling units.\n\nAbia State got 1,387 polling units; Adamawa 1,495; Akwa Ibom, 1,374; Anambra 1,112; Bauchi, 1,349; Bayelsa, 440; Benue, 1,414; Borno, 1,138; Cross River, 998; Delta, 2,239; Ebonyi, 1,161; Edo, 1,892; Ekiti, 250; Enugu, 1,187; FCT 2,260; Gombe, 770; and Imo 1,235.\n\nOthers are Jigawa, 995; Kaduna, 2,910; Kano, 3,148; Katsina, 1,750; Kebbi, 1,345; Kogi, 960; Kwara, 1,015; Lagos, 4,861; Nasarawa,1,761; Niger, 1,765; Ogun, 1,832; Ondo, 924; Osun, 753; Oyo,1,607; Plateau, 2,358; Rivers, 2,424; Sokoto, 956; Taraba, 1,685; Yobe,1,109; and Zamfara,1,013 units.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I want to seize this opportunity to put it on record that our nation will forever be indebted to you, for your patriotic commitment to the defence of our fatherland against insurgency and criminality.\n\nI therefore commend you and remember all the personnel who have paid the supreme sacrifice in ensuring that Nigeria remains an indivisible and secure entity.\n\nAs I send my heartfelt condolences to the families of our fallen heroes and pray for the souls of the departed, I want to assure you that this administration will spare no effort or resources to ensure that the widows and children of our fallen heroes who paid the supreme price in defence of our beloved country, are well cared for.\n\nFurthermore, we will continue to ensure that our wounded comrades get the best medical attention towards their full recovery.\n\nWhile acknowledging your collective efforts at decimating and degrading the terrorists and reaffirming the inviolable sovereignty of our nation, I also wish to extol your steadfastness and untiring efforts in the face of the difficulties you experience in the Theatres of Operation.\n\nYour collective efforts have resulted in the relative peace being enjoyed in the region today. Under my watch, the Armed Forces of Nigeria have been provided a firm strategy and clear sense of direction to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.\n\nWe should not allow our adversaries the opportunity or breathing space to challenge or undermine our national interests and core values. The defence and security agencies should rest assured of the Federal Government\u2019s unalloyed commitment to winning the battle against terror and criminality.\n\nI am particularly happy to note the increasing understanding and cooperation within the military, as well as the inter-agency cooperation in the fight against the terrorists and other criminal elements in the North East.\n\nThe outcome of this synergy is evidenced by the successes recorded in the ongoing Operation TURA TAKAIBANGO which has so far degraded the insurgents\u2019 capabilities in the Timbuktu Triangle, Sambisa Forest and the Lake Chad Region. I am therefore pleased to acknowledge that the military and other security agencies including civilian stakeholders are adhering to the true spirit of Operation HADIN KAI which implies \u201cjointness, synergy and cooperation.\u201d\n\nBy pooling together, the collective resources and comparative advantages of the Armed Forces and other security agencies, we hope the enemy will now feel the ferocity of our firepower and the weight of our resolve.\n\nSide by side with the efforts of the Armed Forces and security agencies, this Administration is developing a strategy for post-war reconstruction and peace-building. Concerted efforts are being made to fast-track re-construction and development programmes in the affected communities in the North East.\n\nI am hopeful that this will lead to the speedy resettlement of displaced persons, as well as the restoration of bubbling community life as the people return to their homes.\n\nAlongside investment in development and reconstruction, we will sustain our investment in the Armed Forces in a manner that balances the \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d.\n\nSeveral interventions by this government have led to the procurement and delivery of large consignments of critical combat enablers, including high calibre weapons and ammunition.\n\nMany have been injected into the Theatre and soon other equipment that have just arrived the country would also be deployed to the Theatre of operations. Much more equipment will be procured for the Armed Forces to cater for both the short and long-term requirements.\n\nI would like, at this point to also commend the hierarchy of our Armed Forces for their strategic foresight in ensuring that some of our critical military equipment are fabricated locally.\n\nThe repairs and maintenance of some of these vital weapons are now being carried out in the country thereby saving the nation a lot of foreign exchange and also creating jobs for our teeming population.\n\nAs personnel of our Armed Forces and security agencies, you must understand that these items of equipment must be put to good use against the terrorists and other criminal elements. There is no room for complacency, and no need to be less than 100 per cent alert at all times.\n\nAs your Commander-in-Chief, I want to assure you that this government will continue to work towards the provision of timely funding and procurement of equipment for the Armed Forces and other security agencies. This is intended to boost the prosecution of the ongoing war to a logical conclusion and also to serve our collective interests and well-being.\n\nIn addition, your welfare is of utmost importance and concern to this government. I am glad that the gradual rotation of the troops in the field has commenced, as I directed. I am sure that this will minimize and possibly eliminate battle fatigue, as well as enhance troops\u2019 morale.\n\nI now wish to thank you for your unalloyed loyalty and selfless sacrifices towards the defence of our country. Your courage and gallantry will continue to inspire others, as they echo into the future.\n\nWhile I commend your resilience, let me remind you that there is still a lot of work to be done, to completely restore peace to the North East, stem the activities of armed bandits in the North West and North Central, as well as deal with other security challenges across the country.\n\nYou must therefore remain steadfast and see this war to a conclusive end. In doing so, you must rely on interagency cooperation, strengthen your cohesion with the troops of neighboring Republics of Cameroon, Chad and Niger in our collective fight against the terrorists, under the auspices of the Multinational Joint Task Force. This will consolidate our efforts and facilitate the speedy return of peace and stability to the region.\n\n24. Once again I salute your courage and wish you the best, as you continue to make Nigeria proud.\n\nGod bless you all and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FACT CHECK: Viral circular of US offering Nigerians work visa is fake",
          "text": "A circular, alleged to have emanated from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) claiming to offer visas to Nigerian citizens, is circulating on instant messaging platforms \u2014 particularly on WhatsApp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe circular, dated June 11, 2021, and purportedly signed by the director of USCIS with no name attached, offers \u201c20,000 eligible Nigerians between the age of 25 to 55 years\u201d a new work permit in the US.\n\nThe statement claimed that President Joe Biden signed an executive order that interested Nigerians are eligible for the \u201cAmerican work e-visa and residence permit\u201d.\n\n\u201cPresident Joe Biden, the 46th U.S. President has signed an Executive Order that interested citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria who measure in some special professions are eligible for American Work E- Visa and Residence Permit,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis was communicated to the Nigerian Mission in the United States by the U.S Department of Immigration. The Terms of the executive Order allow 20,000 citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria between the age of 25 to 55 whose expertise are among the following: Health Workers; Engineers; Marine Workers; Civil Servants; Business Administrators; Accountants; Lecturers; Special Skills Workers.\n\n\u201cSuccessful Applicants are required to make a deposit of $250 for English Proficiency Test which must be undertaken in America upon arrival before resumption of any official duty. Children of applicants below the age of 16 are not required to make this payment, however, couples are bound to make payment as principal applicants.\u201d\n\nThe statement came into circulation months after the US president lifted the immigrant visa ban imposed on migrants from certain countries, including Nigeria, by Donald Trump, his predecessor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpon assumption of office in January, Biden reversed the ban and directed the State Department, through an executive order, to restart visa processing for individuals from the affected countries.\n\nVERIFYING THE CLAIM\n\nWhen TheCable checked the website of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), it was discovered that the last news release issued by the agency was on June 9 titled: \u201cUSCIS Updates Policies to Improve Immigration Services\u201d. There was no mention of such a visa for Nigerian citizens on the website. Further checks by TheCable also showed that the circular was not posted on the official Twitter handle of the agency on the said date.\n\nAlso, TheCable found out that a similar statement, with slight changes, had been circulated earlier in March which the USCIS denied and warned Nigerians to beware of scammers. Below are the changes:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the old statement circulated in March, the age bracket for prospective applicants was 40-45 years as against the new one that stipulated 25-55 years.\n\nTheCable also found some grammatical errors in the recent statement.\n\nFor example, paragraph six of the statement reads: \u201cApplicants are advised to monitor their email always for a feedback afterwards\u201d. Feedback is an uncountable noun and does not need the indefinite article \u2018a\u2019 before it.\n\nIn the last paragraph \u2014 \u201cOffer Lasts until 20,000 Applications are Approved, Based on First Come First Serve. Please note that any fake documents or false representation shall apply the U. S. automatic sanctions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe correct form is \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d since it is in the past tense.\n\nIn addition, the US Department of State does not require immigrants to pay for an English proficiency test before travelling. As part of the requirement for some visa classes, you are required to write an English proficiency test (IELTS or TOEFL) before you leave your home country. The result will then be uploaded to the visa application portal or shown at the embassy during the visa interview.\n\nReacting to the circular, a US State Department official described it as fake news.\n\n\u201cThe circulating image is fake. We advise your readers to be wary of online scams. Our websites \u2013\u2013ng.usembassy.gov, travel.state.gov \u2013\u2013 and other US government sites are reliable sources of information for our programs and announcements,\u201d the official told TheCable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVERDICT: The US Citizenship and Immigration Services did not release any statement claiming to offer a new work visa to Nigerian citizens. All evidence points to the fact that the statement was fabricated.",

          "title": "Banks and startups need to partner for growth but who can solve the risks involved?",
          "text": "Five Nigerian banks have signed up as pioneer members of a new initiative that aims to increase partnerships between corporations and startups in emerging markets.\n\nThe initiative is called the Circle of Corporate Investors and is organised by Catalyst Fund, an accelerator operating in Africa, Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe aim is to help startups and corporates \u201cbetter discover technical and commercial synergies while sharing learnings and insights with the wider industry,\u201d says Maelis Carraro, Catalyst Fund\u2019s managing director.\n\nThe banks joining the partnership are Access, Sterling, Ecobank, and Fidelity. VFD Group, an investment company that owns VBank, a digital bank, has also signed up.\n\nThe startup-corporates face-off\n\nAdvances in digital technology have limited the barrier to service delivery in sectors like financial services. As mobile phones replace office buildings as access points, competition has increased between slow-moving old corporations and agile up-starts.\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s fintech space, the likes of Paystack and Flutterwave have taken command of online payments, enough to make respected institutions like Guaranty Trust Bank set up new structures to counter the threat.\n\nBut emerging market narratives of disruption that pit startups and corporates against each other gloss over many avenues of collaboration that currently lie fallow.\n\nFor all that is impressive about the current state of tech progress, the reality is that traditional corporates retain a stronger hold of offline markets and cover wider geographies than startups.\n\nOne example is Access bank. Founded in 1988, it has risen through managerial adjustments and corporate acquisitions to become Nigeria\u2019s largest bank.\n\nAccess has 36 million customers across 600 service locations in 12 countries on three continents. Somewhere in there is a trove of market resources that will be invaluable for startups that enter into strategic partnerships with the bank. Landing such a partner can signal a startup\u2019s ambition to competitors and legitimacy to customers.\n\nCorporates could benefit from startups\u2019 agility, innovation and flexibility to increase value to customers and speed up digital innovation, Carrro said.\n\nWhile their history and coverage are impressive, traditional banks were slow in pushing Nigeria past a 3% credit penetration mark until digital lenders came on board with avant-garde instant loans.\n\nBut partnerships are risky, yes?\n\n\u2018Leverage my market and network, while I leverage your tech and agility\u2019 should create a win-win for both sides. However, such business partnerships are not straightforward.\n\nA 2019 Harvard Business Review article explained that \u201cdisparities in size, structure and power\u201d can make it difficult for startups to connect with the right nodes within a large corporation. These disparities throw up risks for both parties.\n\nA startup may spend too much time building a custom solution for one large corporate partner, thereby failing to think of itself as a platform that can scale universally. Also, the corporate partner, distracted by other interests, may not devote the requisite high-level manpower to make the best of this partnership.\n\nThere are risks for corporates too. Startups are experiments and could come with reputational risks for corporates when they fail or splinter into some sort of scandal. As this World Economic Forum whitepaper notes, \u201cmany start-ups fail, so the investment risk for corporates is high compared to their usual investment projects.\u201d\n\nFrom the above, it becomes clear that for startup-corporate partnerships to succeed, some work needs to be done to mitigate the risks involved. It is possible that startups and corporates can, on their own, set up the right structures and interfaces to reduce such risks.\n\nBut what if a middleman does the work?\n\nDe-risking partnerships\n\nWith its Circle of Corporate Investors, Catalyst Fund hopes to be a partnerships accelerator by providing an ecosystem of tools that de-risk partnerships.\n\nIn its best form, such an accelerator should add precision to how corporates source, assess, and implement new innovations for their customers. Though its first members are banks, the initiative has plans to include telcos, FMCGs and logistics providers.\n\nThe perks of membership for corporates includes access to Catalyst Fund\u2019s portfolio of 40+ active startups in three regions. In Africa, that portfolio includes Chipper Cash, Cowrywise, Sokowatch and 27 other startups.\n\nCatalyst Fund is also promising \u2018custom toolkits\u2019 that will strengthen and streamline partnership processes. It plans to facilitate \u201cknowledge sharing roundtables\u201d with global corporate innovators.\n\nUntil now, Catalyst Fund\u2019s main focus has been to offer venture building support \u2013 product design, marketing strategy, and more to startups.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this experiment will fare. They point to helping Unilever reach millions of new consumers through Sokowatch as one instance of what they can help achieve.\n\nEither way, the Nigerian banks that have signed up think it will be a worthwhile adventure.\n\nNvalaye Kourouma, Chief Digital Officer at Ecobank, describes the initiative as \u201ca major step in building a framework for a productive engagement with startups and other key stakeholders to make this a success.\u201d\n\nFor VFD Group, it provides an opportunity to accelerate their vision of reaching the last mile with practical and empowering solutions, according to Gbenga Omolokun, the company\u2019s Executive Director for Group Risk, Compliance and Technology.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your whatsapp groups and telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Haifa Ben Salem\u2019s work at the International Trade Centre is shining a light on less popular African tech markets",
          "text": "The African tech ecosystem we know today is a force with many moving parts. From investors to entrepreneurs, everyone is contributing to the advancement of technology on the continent.\n\nSome people exist in the middle. They connect investors to entrepreneurs and ensure that regulators in countries are making policies that are beneficial to the ecosystem.\n\nThis is where Haifa Ben Salem comes in.\n\nOur call happens just at the end of her vacation. She is in Spain when we speak but Haifa lives in Geneva, Switzerland where the International Trade Centre (ITC) is headquartered.\n\nWith the World Trade Organisation and the United Nations as parent organisations, the ITC exists \u201cto foster inclusive and sustainable economic development\u201d. And while as a term, economic development can seem vague, Haifa\u2019s work focuses specifically on digital sector development in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nWhen you take a look at the countries of focus, you find that a lot of them have less mature markets and hence need a lot of help with growth.\n\n\u201cWe are very aware that the ecosystems [in these countries] are quite far from the ecosystems in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and recently, Egypt. So we position ourselves in ecosystems where more support is needed and where we think our contribution would have more impact.\u201d\n\nFrom growing up in Tunis to working at the UN office in Geneva, her journey has been filled with learnings and a passion for helping the African tech ecosystem.\n\nHer name is Haifa Ben Salem and this is her life in tech.\n\n\u201cIs there an engineer in the house?\u201d\n\nWhen Microsoft released the first version of the Windows 98 operating system, Haifa was about six years old and living with her parents in the capital city of Tunis in Tunisia.\n\nAs we begin to speak about her childhood, Haifa says emphatically \u201cI was always a geek.\u201d\n\nAnd as the geek that she was, tinkering with her first computer, which ran Windows 98, was an activity she enjoyed.\n\nThere was a running theme in her home where she was called the \u2018engineer of the house\u2019. It wasn\u2019t particularly because she loved tinkering with her computer, simply being able to print things with her computer was enough to earn her the title.\n\nWhen she tells me this, I laugh as it seems to be the shared experience of every African child. You do the simplest thing on a device as a child and your parents look to you to fix technical problems around the house.\n\nSo is this the point in the story where Haifa finds a passion for tech and continues in the field? Well, not exactly.\n\nLike many curious children, Haifa\u2019s affinity for technology was perhaps the beginning of that story. But it would take a detour when the time came for her to go to university.\n\n\u201cI mean, they wanted me to be a lawyer. I tried law school, but I did not like it.\u201d\n\nAfter making the decision not to continue at law school in Tunis, Haifa had to study something somewhere else.\n\n\u201cAt some point, I really wanted to go and live abroad and explore new opportunities to see how things are in another part of the world.\u201d\n\nBut beyond the desire to see the world, the factor that would make Switzerland the most appealing choice for her would be French \u2013 the language.\n\nHaifa speaks Arabic, French and English \u2013 and following her short trip to Spain, enough Spanish to order food.\n\nShe studied political science at the University of Geneva and following her graduation, she took on a role at an NGO focused on trading sustainability.\n\n\u201cIt was this network that led to where I work now.\u201d\n\nPutting the ICT in the ITC\n\nThe International Trade Centre\u2019s digital development efforts are currently in 10 ecosystems in Sub-Saharan Africa. They are Senegal, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Benin Republic, Mali, The Gambia, Uganda, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Zambia.\n\nSo what does the ITC\u2019s work look like in these ecosystems? Haifa puts it quite simply:\n\n\u201cWhat we do is provide support to entrepreneurs working in tech. So, in whatever vertical; fintech, healthtech, edutech. They must have a digital component in their business.\u201d\n\nThe support given to entrepreneurs takes on different forms. On one hand, there is the involvement with policymakers and regulators. An example is the ITC\u2019s work in Senegal to establish an export strategy for IT and BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) services.\n\nApart from helping countries export their tech services, the centre is also currently working with a few countries to establish their own national startup act. Acts like these, when they are made with the entrepreneurs in mind, create a conducive environment for businesses to launch and grow.\n\nOn another level, Haifa\u2019s work is with business support organisations. This covers startup accelerators, IT associations, chambers of commerce, and digital enterprises.\n\n\u201cSo, we don\u2019t situate ourselves only with very high growth scalable enterprises. We also work with more mature IT companies providing services on a less innovative aspect.\u201d\n\nThe ITC helps these organisations in various ways including training them on how to deal with startup cohorts and drafting their portfolios of services.\n\nHaifa\u2019s favourite part of the work she does is the direct work done with African entrepreneurs. The work usually involves capacity building for the entrepreneurs through training and also access to markets.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the ITC hosted events that allowed entrepreneurs to meet with individuals and entities from different markets hence allowing them a chance to connect with potential customers and investors.\n\n\u201cWe are not an investment body so we don\u2019t invest directly but we connect startups to our portfolio of investors and we already helped some startups raise funds.\u201d\n\nAn Africa full of \u2018engineers\u2019\n\nIn adjusting to the new normal, the ITC has moved a lot of its programs online and kept the events local where physical events can still be held. While this may be the reality for some time, Haifa is hopeful about continuing the work and expanding into more ecosystems and less mature markets.\n\nThe work Haifa does at the ITC is part of what makes the ecosystems function. With the right policies in place and access to services and an investor network, entrepreneurs are able to create digital solutions for their immediate environments.\n\nThese solutions are integral to making sure every African participates in the digital economy.\n\nWhen Haifa visited her parents in Tunis after being away for some time, she found that her mother was now telling her what apps she needed to download and what she needed to do on her phone.\n\nAnd just like that, we have more \u2018engineers\u2019.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

          "text": "Today I\u2019m discussing:\n\nNCC\u2019s licence review\n\nSeso Global\u2019s $600k funding\n\nMore Clubhouse rivals\n\nNCC\u2019s licence review\n\nNCC CEO, Umar Danbatta\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) plans to review its 18-year-old telecoms licence structure so it is on par with trends in the global Information and Communications Technology ecosystem.\n\nAlthough a standing committee is reviewing the current licence, it is evident that amendments of licensing fees and duration are imminent. According to Umar Danbatta, NCC CEO, the committee would also have to report on the effect some of these licences have on their holders.\n\nFor context, there are individual and class licences covering general and specific services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the latter is for every business offering communication services, the former applies to those offering Internet services, fixed wireless access, electronic directory services, Internet exchange, international cable infrastructure and landing station services, and colocation services, among others.\n\nIt\u2019s about time. An 18-year-old licensing framework is long overdue for review, considering the constant changes in global standards. However, we can only wonder why the primary focus is on fees for now. Interestingly, there is no statement about how the amendment will affect fees.\n\nCompared to South Africa\u2019s recent telecoms licensing fees \u2014 published in 2020 \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s current licensing structure is more expensive. Depending on the services and duration, an individual licence in Nigeria costs between \u20a6500,000 ($1,218) and \u20a644 million ($107,186). Whereas in SA, it costs R13,283 ($947.82).\n\nThe review will also consider technological evolution. For instance, an existing licensing category that covers setting up a cybercafe or installing a public payphone is outdated. More focus would be on infrastructure that supports sophisticated spectra like 4G and 5G.\n\nWe also suspect that the new licensing regime could include over-the-top (OTT) platforms like Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, and similar services hinted at during the Twitter ban.\n\nLater today, Ogheneruemu Oneyibo will attempt to clear grey areas of this intended review and its possible implications.\n\nSeso Global raises $600k pre-seed\n\nSeso Global team\n\nNigerian-based prop-tech startup, Seso Global, has raised $600,000 in a pre-seed funding round. Per Disrupt Africa, the round was led by Moabi Group, Kepple Africa Ventures, and Rising Tide Africa, with participation from angel investors: Ibrahim Sanga, Ecobank C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire CEO, Albert Essien, and Jamie Broderick, board member at Impact Investing Institute.\n\nSeso Global will use the funding to improve operations in Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana, where it recently expanded to in May 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in Nigeria in June 2019, the prop-tech startup recently introduced its Customer Relationship Management (CRM) portal that digitises property documentations and transactions.\n\nProperty marketplace: Seso Global offers a digital marketplace where sellers can list Nigerian, Ghanaian, and South African properties, and buyers can schedule a tour or request a mortgage.\n\nThe startup also aims to solve South Africa\u2019s tilting problem by creating a blockchain platform where data can be stored in a secure, decentralised database, and updated without any data loss.\n\nAnother Clubhouse rival\n\nMusic streaming service Spotify, on June 16, 2021, launched Spotify Greenroom, a mobile application that will allow users to host and be a part of live audio rooms. Interestingly, they can also turn the conversation into a podcast. This news comes after the company acquired Betty Labs, the creators of the Locker Room audio app, in March.\n\nAccording to Spotify\u2019s blog, the company marked the addition of live audio to its ecosystem after the acquisition. The new app is now available to iOS and Android users all around the world.\n\nAnother rival: Spotify Greenroom can now join the famous register of Clubhouse\u2019s rivals. The app, which broke the Internet with its live audio service in 2020, currently has Twitter, Facebook, and now Spotify to contend with.\n\nLive audio wars: Although live audio might be becoming a trend, the service is quite similar on different platforms. Perhaps, Spotify Greenroom will attract more users with its podcast and live text chat features.\n\nIncase you missed it\n\nNigeria\u2019s GIGL partners Nigeria\u2019s JET Motor Company to launch the country\u2019s first electric cargo vans.

Facebook began testing its live audio rooms in May 2021.\n\nOn Twitter Spaces, anyone with over 600 followers can host a space, a requirement not needed on either Clubhouse or Greenroom.\n\nA Clubhouse room hosts about 5,000 people.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s GIGL partners Nigeria\u2019s JET Motor Company to launch the country\u2019s first electric cargo vans",
          "text": "Nigerian logistics giant, GIG Logistics (GIGL), recently introduced four all-electric cargo vans into its Lagos fleet, in partnership with indigenous automaker, JET Motor Company (JET).\n\nSpeaking during a press conference held at GIGL\u2019s Lagos digital hub last Friday, GIGL Director of Operations, Ocholi Etu, revealed that the partnership \u201cstarted about two years ago, when we approached JET to provide us with a fleet of all-electric cargo vans, for last-mile delivery across Nigeria.\u201d\n\nGIGL Director of Operations, Ocholi Etu, speaking at the press conference\n\nBack in 2020, about 15 months earlier, JET announced raising $9m solely to fund research and development into building the \u2018Tesla of Africa\u2019. Before that, the almost four-year-old automaker had already established its petrol-powered JET Mover line with a respectable customer base.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s Director of Sales and Marketing, Rupani Sanjay, maintained at the time that the end goal was Africa-centric electric vehicles (EV), hence the capital raise (which was completed in 2019). The original plan was to launch the \u2018JET EV\u2019 cargo line in Q3 2020. Plans were, however, set back a couple of months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigeria is ridden with epileptic power supply and other infrastructural challenges that make electric vehicles basically impractical and, as some would argue, near-pointless in the market.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are kicking things off with the four electric vans over an intra-city route,\u201d JET Strategy Lead/Chief Financial Officer, Joseph Wemimo, clarifies.\n\nL-R: Ocholi Etu, Joseph Wemimo, and Rupani Sanjay (second from right) signing the Memorandum of Understanding\n\nBoth parties will be pacing themselves, even as JET is expected to provide GIGL with at least 46 more JET EV vans over the next two years.\n\nIn the meantime, they appear to have a lot of things figured out. For example, each JET EV van ships with a 107.8 kWh lithium-ion battery, which Wemimo says can cover a distance of about 240 km on a single charge.\n\nA peek under the bonnet of GIGL\u2019s JET EV van\n\n\u201cIn fact, they can actually cover over 300 km on a full charge,\u201d Wemimo points out, \u201cbut in our research, after considering traffic and load capacity, among other factors, we found that they can do a minimum of 240 km easily.\u201d\n\nA closeup of the charging station at GIGL\u2019s digital hub, Lagos. The facility can charge two vehicles at a time, to full capacity, all within two hours\n\nOther environment-specific features include shock absorbers that are \u201cstronger than average, higher ground clearance, bigger tires\u201d and other specifications carried over from the JET Mover line, which, as Sanjay explained to Techpoint Africa last year, is a product of over three years of research, testing, and iterative development, inspired by a mix of the best design and technology practices from Europe and Asia, and tropicalised for Africa.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to create a global product that is built to last. We were obsessed with getting it right because, if our vehicles can work well on Nigerian and African roads, they can succeed anywhere in the world,\u201d Sanjay explained at the time.\n\nWith regards to the effect Lagos\u2019 notorious traffic could have on battery life, Wemimo has this to say:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have optimised the batteries to discharge at the rate of only 2% while idling. So even if you spend 10 hours in traffic, you can still easily cover 240km if the battery is fully charged.\u201d\n\nFor perspective, 300km is the driving distance from Lagos to Benin. For even more perspective, a fully charged van that leaves GIGL\u2019s Lagos digital hub in Gbagada \u2014 currently the only location with charging stations \u2014 sets out for the GIGL outlet along Ilupeju, makes a stop at GIGL Jibowu before heading out for the GIGL outlet along the Lekki-Ajah expressway, and then back to the digital hub, would have covered only about 83km \u2014 roughly one-third of its single-charge capacity.\n\nGoogle Maps estimation of the hypothetical route\n\n\u201cThe plan is to continue establishing more charging stations across Lagos, but this is dependent on demand,\u201d Wemimo explains.\n\n\u201cOur end goal is for GIGL to be fully carbon-neutral,\u201d Etu adds, \u201cmeaning that every vehicle that we use will be fully electric. And hopefully, with support from the government for more charging stations along, say, Sagamu or Ijebu-Ode expressway, we can take it beyond Lagos.\n\n\u201cWhy do they need government support?\u201d you might ask. Wemimo explains:\n\n\u201cIf you look at developed markets like Norway, where the government plans to completely phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2025, there are various incentives \u2014 including tax waivers, cash incentives, and investments \u2014 to encourage mass consumer adoption and innovation in the EV space.\u201d\n\nL-R: Rupani Sanjay and Joseph Wemimo, JET Director of Sales & Marketing and Strategy Lead, respectively\n\nIn the same vein, Sanjay claims that at its current capacity, JET\u2019s Lagos-based assembly plant can produce five to seven vehicles a day \u2014 and about 5,000 annually \u2014 on demand.\n\n\u201cBut in the end, it doesn\u2019t matter how many units we can produce daily if there isn\u2019t enough demand, incentivised by government policies.\u201d\n\nTo clarify, even in South Africa, which is considered Africa\u2019s most developed EV market, only 1,000 out of every 12 million vehicles on the road are said to be electric-powered. Moreover, Cape Verde appears to be the only African country whose government is actively looking (PDF) to phase out electric vehicles within the near future. Compare this with Asia, Europe, and the Americas, where at least 17 countries have similar policies.\n\nNevertheless, GIGL and JET are soldiering on at a deliberate pace.\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait for infrastructure and policy to become favourable. We are moving ahead of the country, and hopefully, the country will catch up with us,\u201d Etu remarks.\n\nWithin the next five to seven years, GIGL hopes to convert over 60% to 70% of its fleet to fully electric vehicles. Furthermore, JET is contractually obligated to offer GIGL one year of free after-sales support and training for internal technicians to aid the transition.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanjay emphasises that JET is open to partnering with more brands and organisations besides GIGL.\n\n\u201cWhile our EV segment currently focuses on the cargo version for intra-city logistics, we are open to partnerships with everyone in Lagos and across Nigeria: private tour companies, medical services, schools, government, and even the military.\u201d\n\nRecommend Watch\n\nNigeria\u2019s Siltech produces electric vehicles, for a cleaner Africa",

It occurs because dryland ecosystems, which cover over one third of the world\u2019s land area, are extremely vulnerable to overexploitation and inappropriate land use. Poverty, political instability, deforestation, overgrazing and bad irrigation practices can all undermine the productivity of the land.\n\n\u201cThe World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought is observed every year to promote public awareness of international efforts to combat desertification.

He addressed State House reporters in Abuja.\n\nHe said the cases to be filed will border on public corruption and cybercrime.\n\nThe cases were delayed largely because of the strike by judiciary workers who shut down courts in Nigeria for over two months and only recently suspended the strike.\n\nAt the event, Mr Bawa also vowed that former Abia governor Orji Kalu \u201cwill be prosecuted all over again.\u201d\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how Mr Kalu was set free by the Supreme Court on technicalities after being convicted of stealing billions of naira when he was Abia State Governor (1999-2007).

We did not borrow the money.\n\n\u201cBut when we came, we had to, through the budget, complete Abuja-Kaduna. We completed Itakpe-Warri from our pocket, from the budget.

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nThe Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams has sent an alert to the United Nations, the African Union and others, on the killings of his people by \u201cmurderous Fulani herdsmen\u201d.\n\nThe letter titled, URGENT NEED TO STOP KILLINGS BY FULANI HERDSMEN IN YORUBALAND, was sent to the Secretary General, United Nations (UN), The Chairperson of the African Union (AU) and the Secretary of State, United States (U.S.)\n\nOther recipients were the British Foreign Secretary, European Union (EU) Member States and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\n\nRead the letter:\n\nYour Excellencies,\n\nThis is to bring to your attention \u2018a clear and present danger\u2019 threatening the fragile union of our great country, Nigeria.\n\nSenseless killings and massacre of Nigerians, almost on a daily basis, are tragically sliding toward an anarchical terminal point.\n\nThe inability or apathetical attitude of the Federal Government, pitiably as it is, is already compounding an already gory situation.\n\nWhile you already know, through diplomatic sources and the media, what is going on in world\u2019s most populous black nation, Nigeria, I want to urgently alert you that an agenda bordering on pogrom is gradually being executed in Yorubaland.\n\nFor your information, Yorubaland \u2013 in Western Nigeria and some parts of North-Central and South-South \u2013 has a population of more than 60 million people.\n\nYoruba people are in Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Ondo, Ekiti, Kogi, Kwara, Edo and Delta States.\n\nWe are peace-loving people, believing in one Nigeria but sadly, that belief, today, is shaking, due to the invasion of our space by murderous killer herdsmen.\n\nToday, the blood of innocent Yoruba men and women \u2013 the recent being the killing of scores of people in their sleep in Igangan, a rural community in Oyo State on June 6, 2021 \u2013 flows endlessly and those mandated to ensure protection of lives and property seem helpless. Or, according to popular belief, complicitous.\n\nTo begin to give statistics of prominent Yoruba people who have been murdered by these killer herdsmen and their collaborators will take too much space in this missive seeking your urgent intervention.\n\nBut, for emphasis, on July 12, 2019, between Kajola and Ore along the Ondo-Ore Expressway, Mrs. Funke Olakunrin, daughter of Yoruba leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti, was murdered.\n\nOn November 26, 2020, a first class traditional ruler in Ondo State, the Olufon of Ifon, Oba Israel Adeusi, was murdered between Akure and Owo. The attackers came from the bush and shot him dead.\n\nOn December 11, 2020, a philanthropist who returned from overseas to help grow the Yoruba economy, Dr. Fatai Aborode, was tortured and killed in Igangan, Oyo State by people suspected to be Fulani herdsmen.\n\nOn January 18, 2021, Dr. Amos Arijesuyo, Deputy Registrar Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA), was shot dead on the Ife-Ilesa-Akure Expressway.\n\nThe peace, stability and tranquility of Yoruba people in this geographical space called Nigeria are being tested by blood-thirsty maniacs through invasion of our land.\n\nIn our space, these herdsmen are accused daily of committing rape, kidnap and murder.\n\nSome family members in Yorubaland have been put under serious pressure through payment of ransom \u2013 running into millions of naira \u2013 demanded by these conscienceless, unscrupulous and ruthless murderers.\n\nNow, the agitation for them to leave our land has reached an alarming crescendo and the backing (that is the belief of our people) given to them by the Federal Government to continue to lay claim to the fact that \u2018nobody can chase anybody away from any part of the country\u2019, is not helping matters.\n\nThe invasion of Igangan, a rural community in Ibarapaland, Oyo State on June 6, 2021, leading to the massacre of scores of residents by these same band of roving killers, who prefer to stay in the forest because of their murderous intent, seems to be the last straw.\n\nThe patience of our people seems stretched to full limit because no one is safe anymore.\n\nIf not for the sake of conquest and murderous greed to grab land \u2013 as it is being done in Benue and some states in the North \u2013 what, I pray, will propel anyone or a group of killers to attack innocent residents of Igangan in the night, shooting them dead while sleeping?\n\nThe palace of the traditional ruler of Igangan, several houses and a petrol station were torched in this fit of lunacy.\n\nWhen I was installed as the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland by the Alaafin of Oyo, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, I vowed to defend Yoruba people anywhere they may be in the world.\n\nSo, it is because of the psychopathic killings going on in our land that I\u2019m writing this letter to you to please intervene in this murderous quagmire.\n\nWe have a situation in which the Federal Government appears overwhelmed and is fast losing grip of its constitutional mandate to protect the land.\n\nObviously, Nigeria is on the precipice, cascading downward in a dangerous and suicidal manner.\n\nWords of wisdom seem to have taken flight.\n\nBecause we live in a global world, I am drawing your attention that any crisis that happens in Nigeria may have a negative effect on the rest of the world.\n\nAnd it may happen soon because all the security establishments are already showing signs of virtual ineffectiveness.\n\nToday, tens of millions of Nigerians, especially, Yoruba people, no longer have a sense of belonging.\n\nEvery attempt by our people to protect themselves against these marauders is being frustrated by the Federal Government.\n\nWhen South-West governors mooted the idea of establishing the security network \u2018Amotekun\u2019 solely for the protection of our people, the Attorney-General and Justice Minister, Abubakar Malami (SAN), openly declared Federal Government\u2019s opposition.\n\nIt is an understatement to declare that Justice has taken flight from the country. This singular tragedy has already compromised Nigeria\u2019s existence because our people no longer belief in a system without fairness, equity and objectiveness.\n\nYou will recall that a former Chief of Army Staff and Defence Minister, Lt-Gen. T.Y. Danjuma, in May 2018, accused the military of collusion with bandits to kill innocent Nigerians.\n\nDanjuma, a man who should know, said inter alia: \u201cThe Armed Forces are not neutral. They are conniving with bandits that kill people. They facilitate their movement. They cover them. Nigerians must defend themselves.\u201d\n\nThe situation has got to a level in which some leaders of these killer herdsmen openly threaten governors who have banned open grazing, insisting there will be no peace unless Fulani herdsmen \u2013 armed with sophisticated weapons \u2013 are allowed to go from one state to the other.\n\nIn the process, farms are destroyed and farmers killed.\n\nI want to say that nobody wants war but our people will not sit idle while they are being slaughtered like chickens.\n\nI am raising this alarm because what is going on is provocative enough and the bubble may burst soon.\n\nThe North has enough land to accommodate the nomadic nature of Fulani herdsmen, so why come down south to destroy people\u2019s farms?\n\nWhy, if not for ulterior motive, use the peripatetic and crude nature of the job to kidnap, kill and carry out criminal activities in forests?\n\nYour Excellencies, if something urgent is not done, these series of attacks will soon have a negative effect on Western countries\u2019 investments in Nigeria.\n\nPlease accept the assurances of my highest consideration.\n\nIba Gani Abiodun Ige Adams\n\n15th Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland.ada",

          "text": "The Imo State Police Command Wednesday confirmed an attack on the country home of a lawmaker representing Orsu constituency in the state House of Assembly, Mr Ekene Nnodimele.\n\nThe state Commissioner of Police, Mr Abutu Yaro, confirmed this to journalists in Owerri, the state capital.\n\nYaro said during the attack which took place at about 1.00 am Wednesday, the hoodlums also beheaded a security guard on duty in the compound.\n\nHe said investigation was ongoing to unravel the cause and perpetrators of the attack and bring them to book.\n\nYaro said: \u201cWe can confirm that there was an attack on the country home of Nnodimele, resulting in the death of a security guard on duty who appeared to have been beheaded.\n\n\u201cAlso, the country home of the immediate past Attorney General of the state, Cyprian Akaolisa, was also attacked and investigation is also ongoing.\u201d\n\nAddressing journalists in his hometown, Obibi, Awo\u2013Idemili community, Orsu local government area of the state, Mr Nnodimele also confirmed that a security guard on duty in his compound was beheaded.\n\nNnodimele said the guard, attached to a private security firm met his death when he tried to resist the armed hoodlums.\n\nThe lawmaker expressed shock at receiving news of the attack, saying his constituents were neither violent nor rancorous.\n\nHe urged operatives to beef up the security of lives and property in the local government area and unravel circumstances surrounding the attack.\n\nThe lawmaker said: \u201cIt was very shocking news to me because my aged parents were there. It is not in our culture to take or end life arbitrarily so I believe it is the handiwork of foreign mercenaries and I leave everything to Almighty God.\n\n\u201cMy security man was not just killed but was beheaded. I call on security operatives to strengthen security in Orsu LGA and ensure that lives and property are protected,\u201d\n\nNnodimele further pledged continued support for the state government while urging his constituents to remain law-abiding and cooperate with law enforcement agencies so as to return peace to the area.\n\nThe lawmaker also confirmed an attack on Akaolisa\u2019s country home in the same council.\n\nHe said that gunshots were heard at the home of the erstwhile Commissioner for Justice before the hoodlums moved to his own home.\n\nNnodimele, however, added that although parts of the former commissioner\u2019s house were burnt, no lives were lost in the attack.\n\nZamfara gun duel\n\nIn a related development, the Zamfara state Police Command has confirmed the killing of four police officers during an exchange of fire with bandits who blocked Labar Bakura-Sokoto Highway and robbed many passengers last Sunday.\n\nThe command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, SP Muhammad Shehu disclosed this to journalists in a telephone interview Wednesday in Gusau, the state capital.\n\nBlueprint reports that in the fire exchange, a civil defence personnel was also killed by the hoodlums with another critically injured.\n\nThe police image maker said during the encounter, many of the bandits were nuetralised, adding , six AK-47 rifles were recovered as exhibits from them.\n\nHe said the ambush followed the killing of an unspecified number of bandits who blocked the highway Sunday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThey ambushed our troops killing four policemen, one Civil Defence personnel and another was critically injured but receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital,\u201d Shehu stated.\n\nHe further revealed that the command had reinforced and was on the trail of the criminals who had fled to the forest.\n\nThe command spokesman said another six AK-47 rifles belonging to the ambushed police personnel were also recovered.\n\nThe hoodlums, Blueprint further gathered, also set ablaze a patrol vehicle belonging to a private company in the area.\n\nThe police image maker however said normalcy had since returned to the area.\n\nDriver killed in convoy\n\nIn yet another development, some gunmen suspected to be kidnappers, reportedly attacked the convoy escorting an expatriate of Hartland construction in Uhunmwode local government area of Edo state.\n\nBlueprint gathered that the incident occurred Tuesday at Ute community on the notorious Benin-Auchi/Oluku Bypass.\n\nA driver with the construction firm, simply identified as Buhari, and two police officers were allegedly shot by the rampaging gunmen.\n\nIt was gathered that the driver (Buhari) and the policemen picked the expatriate at Benin airport and were heading towards Auchi when the gunmen suddenly appeared from the bush and opened fire on their vehicle.\n\nThe gunmen were said to have thereafter whisked the expatriate away to an unknown destination.\n\nThe state Commissioner of Police, Philip Ogbadu, confirmed the attack, but noted that the two officers survived.\n\nThe CP explained that \u201cthe style the kidnappers use is that on sighting a vehicle, they will immediately open fire so that they can force the vehicle to a stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt happened yesterday, the driver conveying a white man being escorted by two police men were shot at. The driver died but the officers held on to their rifles and they survived. The only thing is that the white man was taken away,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u2018Attacks on police facilities misplaced anger\u2019\n\nIn the midst of the insecurity across the country, a former chairman of the Police Service Commission (PSC), Mr Simon Okeke, has described as misplaced anger the incessant attacks on police officers and their facilities in the South-east.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Nnewi South local government area of Anambra state, Okeke decried the increasing security challenges in the country, particularly in the South-east as worrisome.\n\nHe said: \u201cThese incessant attacks on the police facilities can be linked to bottled anger or accumulated aggression or what we can call misplaced anger on the part of the citizenry.\n\n\u201cThough, there may be bad eggs in the police, but it does not justify the series of attacks on them or their facilities.\n\n\u201cThe prevailing situation is very worrisome. South-east had been among the safest states across the country, especially Anambra, but for some time now, that peace and serenity has been disturbed and uprooted.\u201d\n\nThe former PSC chair said 90 per cent of the police facilities were built by private individuals and through community efforts after which they were handed over to the police authorities.\n\nHe said: \u201cNothing happens without a cause. The #EndSARS protest broke down the peace we had. All sets of people, known and unknown hijacked the demonstration to loot and destroy government property.\n\n\u201cThese attackers do not realise that they are just destroying their own property. The police force cannot rebuild these facilities because they do not have the money. It is the same community that will rebuild them, which is currently happening.\n\n\u201cI agree that the citizens-police relationship today is not the same as it was in my own time. Even the police you are accusing have their own complaints against the government and society.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why people like me have been advocating for (sic) state police since 2003, without which things will continue to deteriorate.\n\n\u201cThis is because the needs of the Police Force have exceeded the budget approved by the Federal Government. Police prestige is no longer there as they are no longer being taken care of.\n\n\u201cIt is a vicious circle. People are angry because the police are not doing what they are supposed to be doing.\u201d (NAN)\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

Adams Jagaba Adams has also indicated interest to slug it out with the incumbent Senator at the PDP Senatorial primary billed for February 2022.\n\nWhile expressing his support for Senator Danjuma Laah\u2019s aspiration to seek re-election, a three-term member of Kaduna State House of Assembly Hon. Labari Tella said that the incumbent Senator is a formidable aspirant with a vision for his people.\n\nHe added that Sen. Laah is not only a political heavyweight in the entire Southern Kaduna but also a well-known politician and a businessman from Kaura LGA of Kaduna state.\n\nHon. Douglas Habu who served as special adviser to three different governors in the state said that senator Laah is a result-oriented politician with value and repute.\n\nThe Senator, he said, \u201cisn\u2019t contesting for the Senatorial slot in search of names, or is he hungry for power or position. For the very first term Laah broke the Political jinx in Southern Kaduna, which is notable for one term and returned twice given his hard work and legislative prowess\u201d.\n\nComrade Victor Bobai Mathew, convener of SDL 100% Support Group said exactly what the PDP needs is a fearless leader and a good team player whose major interest is all about his people.\n\n\u201cThis is a very serious challenge for Southern Kaduna. We cannot compromise our political leadership for those players that want names and fame,\u201d he told newsmen.\n\n\u201cAs of now the change in returning senator Laah is on the open primary election for the PDP to ensure that only card carriers of PDP would be allowed to select their candidate. This is because the party needs to democratize all its electoral activities this time.\n\nSenator Laah\u2019s leadership style has united his supporters, as he has continued to support the fight against banditry and insurgents\u201d, he said.\n\nAnother former member of the Senate, Senator Zego Aziz, a veteran politician, and founding member of the PDP in Kaduna and Nigeria, said that the campaign for 2023 will be more about issues and not about how many times one is contesting.\n\nA former Member State House of Assembly in Kaduna from Zonkwa constituency Hon Jeremiah Kantiok acknowledged how much it will mean for Southern Kaduna to have Senator Laah returned.\n\n\u201cLaah has beautiful projects ahead of him to accomplish like establishment of the Federal University of Technology Manchoch, State creation, Local Government Autonomy and establishment of security network to reduce insurgency and kidnapping in Southern Kaduna,\u201d he said.",

This sentence is coming after a trial that lasted over 12 years.\n\nIn delivering her sentence, Justice Okunnu held that the EFCC successfully proved its case against the convicts beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe judge rejected claims by the defendants suggesting that they were merely professionally negligent.\n\nShe specifically held that Atuche and Anyanwu abused their powers, ignored established rules and regulations thereby putting the bank and depositors\u2019 funds in danger.\n\nThe court also came to the conclusion that the convicts corruptly took advantage of their positions to confer on themselves undue financial benefits without regard to the health of the bank.\n\n\u201cThe convict stole from the bank and depositors and because of their action, taxpayers money was used to bail out the bank\u201d.\n\nJustice Okunnu held that she had considered the plea of the convicts, but there must be consequences for wrongdoing, adding that sentences are not just for punishment but also for deterrence.\n\nShe also ruled that the defendant should make restitution of the amount stolen from the bank. They are to pay back the sum of N25.7billion to the Federal government to replace the funds stolen from the public to bail out the bank.\n\nAccording to the Judge, they are to serve their jail terms at the Kirikiri maximum correctional facility in Lagos.\n\nAtuche\u2019s wife cleared\n\nJustice Okunnu however, cleared Atuche\u2019s wife on the charge of conspiracy and stealing.\n\nAccording to the judge, the EFCC failed to link her to the crime and insisted that suspicion no matter how strong can not take the place of fact.\n\nThe judge held that it was not proven that she was aware of the source of the funds she received into her account from her husband and she had no powers to take any decision to influence the transaction.\n\nCharges\n\nThe EFCC had alleged that between November 2007 and April 2008, the accused persons stole about N25.7bn belonging to the bank.\n\nThe anti-graft agency had also claimed that of the total N25.7bn, they stole about N14.7bn by fraudulently describing it as a loan to some companies and subsequently converted the said sum to personal use.\n\nThe Commission had listed the companies as Future View Securities, Extra Oil Limited, Resolution Trust and Investment Limited, and Tradjek Nigeria Ltd.\n\nThe EFCC also alleged that another N11bn stolen by the defendants was used to purchase about 984,375,000 units of Bank PHB shares for themselves.\n\nAccording to the commission, the sum used for purchasing the shares was described as a loan to some companies including, Guesstrade Services, Sentron Trading, Montrax Investico, Claremount Management Ltd., Trenton Trade, and others.\n\nIn proof of its case against the accused persons, the EFCC called 12 witnesses who gave oral evidence.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has promised to visit on insurgents and bandits the ferocity of the nation\u2019s firepower and the weight of the resolve to allow for peace and security.\n\nAddressing men and officers of the Armed Forces in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital during a visit to assess the security situation of the country and to commission some projects, the President said: \u201cBy pooling together, the collective resources and comparative advantages of the Armed Forces and other security agencies, we hope the enemy will now feel the ferocity of our firepower and the weight of our resolve.\u201d\n\nThe President who used the occasion to condole with the families of the nation\u2019s fallen heroes and pray for the souls of the departed, said: \u201cI want to assure you that this administration will spare no effort or resources to ensure that the widows and children of our fallen heroes who paid the supreme price in defence of our beloved country, are well cared for.\u201d\n\nHe however charged the men of the Armed Forces to continue the great work of defending the nation, he said: \u201cWe should not allow our adversaries the opportunity or breathing space to challenge or undermine our national interests and core values. The defence and security agencies should rest assured of the Federal Government\u2019s unalloyed commitment to winning the battle against terror and criminality.\u201d\n\nHe side by side the efforts of the Armed Forces and security agencies, his Administration is already developing a strategy for post-war reconstruction and peace-building.\n\nHe said: \u201cConcerted efforts are being made to fast-track re-construction and development programmes in the affected communities in the North East.\u201d\n\nHe said he would continue to ensure that our wounded comrades get the best medical attention towards their full recovery.\n\nHe told the soldiers that their collective efforts at decimating and degrading the terrorists and reaffirming the inviolable sovereignty of our nation is acknowledged, stressing that their steadfastness and untiring efforts in the face of the difficulties they experience in the Theatres of Operation is to his knowledge.\n\nHe said: \u201cYour collective efforts have resulted in the relative peace being enjoyed in the region today. Under my watch, the Armed Forces of Nigeria have been provided a firm strategy and clear sense of direction to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.\u201d\n\nHe added that: \u201cI am particularly happy to note the increasing understanding and cooperation within the military, as well as the inter-agency cooperation in the fight against the terrorists and other criminal elements in the North East.\n\nThe President said: \u201cAlongside investment in development and reconstruction, we will sustain our investment in the Armed Forces in a manner that balances the \u201ccarrot and stick\u201d.\n\n9. The outcome of this synergy is evidenced by the successes recorded in the ongoing Operation TURA TAKAIBANGO which has so far degraded the insurgents\u2019 capabilities in the Timbuktu Triangle, Sambisa Forest and the Lake Chad Region. I am therefore pleased to acknowledge that the military and other security agencies including civilian stakeholders are adhering to the true spirit of Operation HADIN KAI which implies \u201cjointness, synergy and cooperation.\u201d\n\nHe revealed that the repairs and maintenance of some of these vital weapons are now being carried out in the country thereby saving the nation a lot of foreign exchange and also creating jobs for our teeming population, stating that: \u201cAs personnel of our Armed Forces and security agencies, you must understand that these items of equipment must be put to good use against the terrorists and other criminal elements. There is no room for complacency, and no need to be less than 100 per cent alert at all times.\u201d\n\nMaiduguri, the Borno State capital was agog for the President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s official visit to the state.\n\nThe President had touched down at the Nigeria Air Force Base in Maiduguri at 10.15 am where he was welcome by Governor Babagana Zulum and other top dignitaries.\n\nDriving through the town in a long convoy, he was warming received by an array of students, civil servants and other section of the society who have lined the streets.\n\nThe President while in the town commissioned some projects and visited the palace of the Shehu of Borno and latter had meeting with the Service Chiefs who had arrived the town on Wednesday ahead of the Commander in Chief.",
