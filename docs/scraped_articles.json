          "title": "BUK Centre engages religious leaders to propagate anti-corruption messages",
          "text": ".\n\n\u2026secured $800,000 grant to implement project\n\nBy Bashir Bello, KANO\n\nThe famous Aminu Kano Centre for Democratic Studies, Bayero University Kano, BUK, popularly known as Mambayya House has engaged the services of religious leaders as influencers who command large respect and followers to propagate or preach anti-corruption messages to eradicate the cankerworm called corruption.\n\nThe Centre\u2019s Director, Prof. Ismaila M. Zango stated this during it maiden press briefing and dissemination of its results of a 3-year Anti-Corruption project (phase one) tagged \u201cPromoting Accountability and Anti-Corruption through Behaviour Change approaches \u2013 2018 \u2013 2020 at $1,000,000 grant which is funded by John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.\n\nProf. Zango who doubles as the Project Director said they engaged the religious leaders to join the fight against corruption through their sermons and admonitions to the general public and also public office holders in order to complement government efforts to checkmate the menace.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFollowing the successful completion of the first phase of the project \u201cCombating Corruption Through Interfaith Platforms in Nigeria\u201d from 2018 to 2020 with $1,000,000 grant, Mambayya house was re-granted another $800,000 to implement the second phase of the project, \u201cPromoting Accountability and Anti-Corruption through Behaviour Change approaches,\u201d for another 3 years from 2021 to 2024.\n\n\u201cAs a grantee, the Centre has been working on the project with four sub-grantees namely: The Interfaith Network Against Corruption (INAC) Kano, the Interfaith Mediation Centre (IMC) Kaduna, the Inter-religious Coalition Against Corruption in Nigeria (ICACN) Lagos and the University of Nigeria Nsukka Muslim Community (UNNMC) Nsukka.\n\n\u201cThe three year anti-corruption project entitled \u201cPromoting Accountability and Anti-Corruption through Behaviour Change approaches, 2021 to 2024, is aimed at mobilizing and educating citizens to actively engaged in activities that will strengthen social accountability and improve service delivery in local communities.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this, we target Civil Society Organizations, CSO, Faith-Based Organizations, FBOs, the media, Community Based Organizations, CBOs, students\u2019 associations and government agencies as the \u201cVoice actors\u201d of behavioural change for citizens to be able to recognize, speak out, resist and report any corrupt behaviour they encounter.\n\n\u201cThe project also adopts interfaith and communities based approaches to change the nonchalant attitudes of Nigerians and encourage them to imbibe a culture of close monitoring of their entitlements with regard to public service delivery, and use of redress mechanisms in case of defaulting services.\n\n\u201cThrough the project, we have equipped and empowered both Muslim and Christian clerics with requisite information on the dangers of corruption and how to speak against it using divine injunctions and the influence they have on their congregants. This is another feat in our sustained struggle against corruption.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that government alone cannot succeed in the fight against corruption without the inputs of religious leaders who command the respect and obedience of their followers across large segments of the citizenry.\n\n\u201cAs a multi-religious country and considering the all-encompassing networks of religious leaders and their intimate contacts with all segments of society, it is obvious that their powerful moral voices could be a huge resource yet to be deployed in the fight against corruption in Nigeria. Thus, the role of these leaders in transparency and Anti-Corruption efforts and how they can change social and moral values, spur learning and transform society needs not to be left behind.\n\n\u201cEvidently, in Nigeria, religious leaders have their inherent advantages in their routine activities for ordinary citizens. They are reputed for their ability to tap the potential of local communities. Further, clergymen of various Faiths have the potential to bring about or stimulate attitudinal change in the citizenry by teaching good virtues, such as sacrifices, patriotism, accountability, transparency, honesty and integrity to their large followership through sermons, admonitions and public preachings.\n\n\u201cConsequently, as respected community influencers, religious leaders should take the risk to face all the consequences of fighting corruption. Religious institutions have the power to combat corruption. The religious leaders can effectively make their followers shun corruption, as they have unhindered access to and responsibility to educate a broad spectrum of the public. Hence, both the FBOs and religious leaders are stronger together, to amplify anti-corruption messaging and galvanize community action to hold public officers accountable. Also, they can create a persuasive means of fostering positive behavioural change capable of reducing corruption in the society.\u201d He said.\n\nHe further said that the centre had also deployed other strategies to combat corruption such as the establishment of anti-corruption clubs 40 secondary schools, 27 tertiary institutions across the three geo-political zones of northern Nigeria, launching of an anti-corruption reporting website called \u201cReport Mago-Mago\u201d by ICACN in collaboration with US Consulate in Lagos as well as the publication of books designed to celebrate and document the lives and times of incorruptible leaders and anti-corruption role models for younger generations to emulate.\n\n\u201cIt is however our fervent hope and that of the MacArthur Foundation that by the end of 2024, there will be an increased number of communities demanding social services and accountability using available mechanisms to seek redress when they are shortchanged,\u201d the Project Director, Prof. Zango however stated.\n\nEarlier, in his welcome address, the Program Officer, MacArthur Foundation project, Prof. Moses T. Aluaigba said the project was part of efforts by the centre through the support of the MacArthur Foundation to contribute it quota to the fight against corruption in the country.",

          "text": "By Chinonso Alozie\n\nThe detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, has described as an evil act the last Saturday attack by unknown gunmen on the house of the President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Professor George Obiozor, at Awo-Omamma in Oru East Local Government Area of Imo state.\n\nKanu said this to newsmen in Owerri, on Tuesday through his lead counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, after their visit to the DSS, facility in Abuja, where Kanu condemned the attack on Obiozor\u2019s house in Oru East LGA.\n\nHe said Obiozor was at the front line of the struggle to release him (Kanu) from the detention facility of the DSS, however, he urged the authorities to go after those behind the attacks and fish them out.\n\nAccording to the IPOB leader, \u201cWe visited Onyendu who is in the custody of the Department of Security Services, Abuja. Our interaction with him was quite fruitful and ended on a positive note. Our discussion centred on two main things, namely, the frivolous criminal proceedings pending against him at the Federal High Court, Abuja, and the criminal destruction of the country home of Prof George Obiozor.\n\n\u201cOnyendu remains firm and resolute in his convictions that his present experience is part of the sacrifice he is bound to make for the actualisation of his dream for the emancipation of UMUCHINEKE.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nnamdi Kanu breaks silence\n\n\u201cHe re-affirms the confidence he reposes in the legal team defending him at the Federal High Court, Abuja, ably led by Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, and prays that the Ruling that would be delivered on the 8th of April, 2022, on the Notice of Preliminary Objection, would end in his favour.\n\n\u201cOnyendu also took some time to express his anger and grave disapproval of the heinous act of destruction of the country home of the elder statesman and President General of Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohaneze Ndi Igbo, Prof George Obiozor.\n\n\u201cHe describes the said destruction as cowardly and barbaric and condemns it in very strong terms. He further describes it as uncharitable, noting that the said elder statesman has been in the vanguard of behind-the-scene endeavours, discussions and negotiations, all aimed at exploring and implementing the option of a political solution, as a parallel way of ending the prevailing state of affairs.\n\n\u201cThe perpetrators of the heinous act shall not be forgiven and went ahead to direct that all persons who were in any way involved in committing the dastardly act to be fished out forthwith.\n\n\u201cHe reminds Umuchineke to be eternally conscious of several atrocities committed on our land by strangers whose primary objective is to destroy and plunder our land and then turn around to falsely accuse our people. He further notes that Prof Obiozor has been a commendable ally since his incarceration in June 2021, and made the point that he is not an enemy of Umuchineke.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat being so, the elder statesman should be protected and encouraged for speaking up against the several multifaceted ills meted out both to him and Umuchineke as a whole. He further notes that the elder statesman has been instrumental in the regular presence that members of Ohaneze Ndi Igbo have shown in all the court appearances of Onyendu.\n\n\u201cThis socio-cultural group has steadfastly and consistently made a legal representation in the criminal proceedings pending against Onyendu at the Federal High Court Abuja. Onyendu remains appreciative and eternally grateful to that body for this commendable gesture.\n\n\u201cFurther, Onyendu points out that it was at the instance of Prof George Obiozor that a delegation of Igbo elders, led by a former Governor of Anambra State, His Excellency, Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife, consistently showed visible presence in all his appearances in court and has gone ahead on several occasions to attempt to visit him at the DSS headquarters,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "2022 World Water Day: WaterAid, Britain survey reveals enough groundwater in Africa",
          "text": "\u2026as report debunks myth of Africa\u2019s running out of water\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu\n\nABUJA-AS Nigeria joins rest of the world to commemorate 2022 World Water Day, WaterAid and the British Geological Survey, BGS, Tuesday, revealed in a survey that most African countries have enough groundwater to tackle drought in five and 50 years to come.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued by WaterAid Nigeria, and reads in part, \u201cWaterAid and BGS produced a series of maps which chart current access to drinking water across Africa and drought resilience based on potential useable groundwater at national level.\n\n\u201cIt reveals: Most countries in Africa have sufficient groundwater for people to not only survive but thrive \u2013 in some cases for more than 50 years; This includes Ethiopia and Madagascar \u2013 where only around half the population have clean water close to home \u2013 and large parts of Mali, Niger and Nigeria; Every African country south of the Sahara could supply 130 litres of drinking water per capita per day from groundwater without using more than 25 per cent of the long-term average recharge ,and most less than 10 per cent. This means groundwater could provide a buffer against climate change for many years to come, even in the unlikely event that it doesn\u2019t rain.\n\nHowever, according to the statement, gross underinvestment in services to get the water out of the ground and to those who need it most and untapped or poorly managed resources means millions of people don\u2019t have enough safe, clean water to meet their daily needs, let alone face the impacts of the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cGroundwater: The world\u2019s neglected defence against climate change is released by WaterAid and BGS today as Heads of State meet at the World Water Forum in Senegal, West Africa.\n\n\u201cGroundwater \u2013 which exists almost everywhere underground, in gaps within soil, sand and rock \u2013 has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives and be the world\u2019s insurance policy against climate change.\n\n\u201cIt could help communities cope not only with slow onset impacts like drought and irregular rainfall, but also provide resilience to rapid onset impacts like floods by ensuring safe water is available for all, including in schools and hospitals, according to the report.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Executive of WaterAid in the UK, Tim Wainwright said, \u201cOur findings debunk the myth that Africa is running out of water. But the tragedy is that millions of people on the continent still do not have enough clean water to drink.\n\n\u201cThere are vast reserves of water right under people\u2019s feet, many of which are replenished every year by rainfall and other surface water, but they can\u2019t access it because services are chronically underfunded.\n\n\u201cTapping into groundwater would ensure millions have access to safe, clean water no matter what the climate crisis throws at them.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Country Director, WaterAid Nigeria, Evelyn Mere, said: \u201cThe potential of groundwater can only be realised if we overcome the complex global problems around accessing it.\n\n\u201cGroundwater is an invisible resource, so tapping it, particularly in places where it is harder to get to, relies on knowledge about the geology beneath our feet. The quantity and quality of the groundwater also varies, and in some areas, we simply don\u2019t know how much there is or its suitability.\u201d\n\nBut the statement noted that for example, it is difficult to find suitable locations to drill boreholes in parts of Enugu State in Nigeria because the underground rocks are made mainly of clay, which doesn\u2019t hold much water. This means you need to search for areas where the rock does hold water, like sandstone. But such exploration is expensive.\n\nPockets of shallow groundwater in Enugu can also be contaminated and only available for part of the year. By contrast, it is much easier to find suitable locations to drill boreholes in Jigawa State, Nigeria, as the rocks underground store large quantities of water.\n\nMeanwhile, BGS Groundwater Resilience Lead, Professor Alan MacDonald, said: \u201cGroundwater is nature\u2019s water reservoir, and a key resource to help the world adapt to climate change. It\u2019s widely available, controlled by natural variation in geology, but is out of sight beneath our feet.\n\n\u201cTo unlock the great potential of groundwater, we need the right investment in expertise to map groundwater, drill sustainable wells and find ways to maintain and manage water resources and services.\u201d\n\nKarimatu, 17, from Adamawa, Nigeria, who is featured in the report, wakes up at 6am every day to collect water from a nearby stream, making at least three trips before school. Karimatu would like to be a doctor but fetching water early in the mornings affects her schoolwork. \u201cGetting a steady water supply will make me happy,\u201d she told WaterAid.\n\nThe report also explains that while groundwater in sub-Saharan Africa is largely underused, in other parts of the world \u2013 mainly in south Asia \u2013 overuse is rife. This, along with a lack of regulation, insufficient expertise and investment, often leads to mismanagement, contamination and pollution \u2013 with potentially devastating consequences: There are hotspots within individual countries where high abstraction around cities (for example, Addis Ababa in Ethiopia and Nairobi in Kenya) or in highly populated areas (for example, some parts of Nigeria), that can lead to depleting local groundwater, particularly aquifers with low storage, such as granites or volcanic rocks. Despite this, groundwater storage could still act as a buffer for one to two years of drought in these areas.\n\nIn some areas, farming is responsible for up to 90 percent of all groundwater use. While crops flourish now, boreholesmay run dry meaning crops will be affected later and people resort to drinking unsafe water to survive. For example, in Pakistan,94% of pumped groundwater is for irrigation.\n\nIn other regions, groundwater is naturally contaminated with arsenic and fluoride which can lead to illness or even death. For example, in India, arsenic contamination affects the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and West Bengal in the east. Several districts of Odisha are affected with high fluoride, iron and salinity and parts of central and Southeast India also show higher levels of nitrate and iron contamination.\n\nIn both south Asia and Africa, groundwater is vulnerable to pollution whether it be from fertilisers and pesticides from intensive farming, toxic chemicals from poorly regulated industry or sewerage from poorly managed sanitation. For example, a recent survey of boreholes in Ethiopia, Uganda and Malawi saw E. coli present in the water from 20 per cent of rural hand pumps, likely as a result of poorly sealed boreholes, allowing contaminated water from nearby toilets to drain into the pump intakes.\n\nGroundwater: The world\u2019s neglected defence against climate change emphasises the need to increase water and sanitation financing for marginalised communities through a fixed percentage of annual government budgets and increased international donor and private sector investment.\n\nIt also stresses the importance of agreeing at COP 27 that investment in responsible groundwater development and the knowledge, expertise, finance and institutional support this requires, is key to securing life-saving sustainable and safe water and sanitation for communities living on the frontline of the climate crisis.\n\nOne of the ways to achieve this is to invest in better mapping and monitoring of the Earth\u2019s subsurface to determine where good-quality groundwater is not only available but also extractable in a sustainable and economical way, to unlock its full potential, WaterAid and BGS said.",

This is wonderful. I don\u2019t think there is any university that has this large turnout of people who are judged to be worthy in both learning and character,\u201dhe said.\n\nSpeaking further,Prof. Olufemi Peters said,\u201cWe have 25 inmates, one graduating in MSc and the remaining twenty four as undergraduate. All these are sponsored free by the university as our own contribution to social equality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe University is providing equity that we so desire in any egalitarian society. The equality is there because you have access to everybody.\n\n\u201cBy taking education to the Correctional centres, what we are doing is providing a future for those people who perhaps thought they were not going to have that opportunity,\u201dhe explained.\n\nPeters,who also said over 1, 500 graduates of NOUN have enrolled into the Nigerian Law School, added that products of the university were doing well at the Law School.\n\nA\u00e7cording to him, all the institution\u2019s programmes, including the law programme have been fully accredited by National Universities Commission,NUC.\n\n\u201cWe have about 1500 students who are graduates of our institution currently in the law school. We have about the same numbers that are yet to be enrolled in the law school.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I said it is a special relationship is that you recall that we had a slightly wonderful relationship with them because they were not sure about the kind of graduates we were producing and the idea now is let us try them first.\n\n\u201cSo they are trying us now and they found out to be extremely competent in terms of the people they have produced of good quality. So we are waiting until after this batch has finished, most likely this year then the next batch will come,\u201dhe further said.\n\nA breakdown of the figures showed that 69 would be awarded with First Class degree, 4, 337 Second Class, about 9, 499 Second Class Lower and 2, 700 students with Third Class.",

Olayiwola of the Federal High Court, Benin Judicial Division.\n\nThe Itsekiri National Youth Council who further presented a copy of a letter written to INEC chairman on 4th January 2019 requesting INEC to revert to the earlier 10 electoral wards instead of the 12, alleged that INEC has neither obeyed the court ruling nor honoured a memorandum they both entered ahead of 2019, in the interest of fairness, justice, and equity.\n\nAccording to Agbateyiniro,\u201d since INEC is a creation of the law, disobeying subsisting court judgments is an indication of taking a side in the matter, even at that we are counting strongly on you to do the needful by using only materials recognizing these 10 ward structures to conduct elections in Warri South Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cThis Council shall resist any attempt to use illegal wards to conduct elections in Warri South Local Government Area\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe protest is simultaneous. going on at INEC office in Warri adding that they were in Abuja to register their protest at the Unity Fountain instead INEC premises because of security issues\u201d.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari today commissioned the new 3 million Metric Tonnes capacity per annum state-of-the-art Dangote Fertiliser Urea Plant, with an emphatic assurance that the project would give a huge fillip to Nigeria\u2019s agricultural sector, which revitalisation has been a focal point of his administration\u2019s economic policy.\n\nThe new plant, which he commissioned in the presence of some 18 governors, ministers, captains of industries as well as prominent traditional rulers, is located at Ibeju Lekki, Lagos Free Trade Zone within the periphery of the Dangote refinery.\n\nA visibly excited President Buhari said the coming on stream of the plant would create huge opportunities in the areas of employment, trade, warehousing, transport and logistics. The Plant, according to the President \u201cwill greatly create wealth, drastically reduce poverty and secure the future of our nation\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the agricultural sector, another focal point of our economic policy, we expect a boom as fertiliser is now readily available. Many Nigerians who hitherto practiced subsistence farming because of non-availability of necessary inputs can now take up agriculture as a business. We expect a rise of new breed of agropreneurs who will add value to farming and make the nation self-sufficient in food production.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the federal government is now determined more than ever before to provide enabling environment for private sector investors to thrive, adding that his government would continue to improve on infrastructure, power, security and enact relevant laws and regulations that would drive investments in the economy.\n\nPresident Buhari reiterated that part of the government\u2019s effort in this regard was the partnership with the private sector government via a tax credit scheme, in the rehabilitation of roads across Nigeria under the Presidential Order No. 7.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, good roads contribute to easy movement of goods and services across the nation, thus reducing cost of doing business and improving productivity. We are also rehabilitating our railway lines and building new ones to lessen the burden on our roads and create more effective multi-model transportation networks,\u201d he added.\n\nIn an earlier welcome address, President of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote described the new plant as a game changer, as it has the capacity to make Nigeria become self-sufficient in fertiliser production, with spare capacity to export to other markets in Africa and the rest of the world. He added that already, Dangote fertiliser has reached the markets in the USA, Brazil and Mexico.\n\nAccording to him, the Fertiliser plant, which is the largest granulated Urea fertiliser complex in Africa, occupies 500 hectares of land, was built at a cost of $2.5 Billion, and is expected to reduce drastically level of unemployment and youth restiveness in the country through employment opportunities. To him, the plant is expected to generate new jobs with top quality fertiliser being available and in sufficient quantities for the farmers.\n\nHe stated that agriculture accounts for 20 per cent of the nation\u2019s GDP and that the new plant was an ambitious project that would provide both direct and indirect employment, thereby reducing youth restiveness\n\nDangote Fertiliser, according to him, would ensure emergence of farmers in the country, providing hundreds of jobs and ushering in a new era of agricultural entrepreneurs, (agroprenuers). \u201cThis breed of agroprenuers will take to farming on large scales, providing food and raw materials for our industries,\u201d he added.\n\nDangote stated that the fertiliser plant is rolling out with innovations that would transform the agricultural sector in the form of extension services for small and medium scale farmers. It has set up a well-equipped fertiliser soil testing laboratory to enable it analyse and identify soil deficiency and the appropriate fertiliser blend.\n\n\u201cStudies have shown that applying the right fertiliser to the soil will boost productivity. This service is to cover all the geopolitical zones, and will surely change agricultural landscape in the country by transforming farming into a lucrative profession.\n\n\u201cDangote Fertiliser is working with Farmer Associations, Corporate Farmers, NPK Blenders, NGO/development partners and State Governments all over Nigeria, and governments across Africa and beyond who are looking for sustainable approach to improving soil quality and farm yields,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaking at the occasion, Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele said Nigeria is indeed indebted to Aliko Dangote for his giant stride to add value to Nigeria\u2019s economy. According to him, \u201cIt is great that a Nigerian has taken not just this great initiative of helping to solve our perennial problem of importing petrochemical products including fertiliser but has taken advantage of the emerging huge market opportunity presented by recent global developments.\u201d\n\nEmefiele commended President Buhari for providing all the support needed to put in place economic policies that would reverse the trend of the doldrums, pointing out that the completion of the fertiliser plant is a stellar example of the realisation of the vision.\n\nThe CBN governor described the fertiliser plant as timely considering the recent developments in the global market, where prices of wheat, fertiliser and crude oil spiked by over 20 per cent, following the start of the Russia \u2013 Ukraine war.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the lessons we learnt from the protectionist actions of countries during the early days of COVID-19, this investment is again a glaring testament to the foresight and tireless efforts of Mr. President in encouraging domestic production of items that can be produced in Nigeria, especially agriculture. This would not only help to enable greater productivity of our agricultural sector but also help in insulating Nigeria farmers from depending on imported fertiliser,\u201d Emefiele stated.\n\nHe recalled that prior to 2015 when President Buhari resumed office, Nigeria had a fertiliser shortfall of about 3.5 million tonnes per annum compared to the over 6 million tonnes per annum required in the country.\n\n\u201cThen President Buhari inaugurated the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative and charged them with resolving this problem. With sustained efforts, other indigenous companies like Indorama and Notore with a combined capacity of over 2.5 million tonnes per annum have tried to match the market demand, yet the country still faced a huge shortfall of fertiliser supply. Today, Nigeria is self-sufficient in the production of urea, and we are also the leading producer of urea in the African continent,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Mahmood Abubakar called on other investors to rise up to the occasion, noting that the Dangote Fertiliser would help to solve the problem of fertiliser shortages in Nigeria. He also assured that the government would enforce standard in the industry to maintain quality.\n\nLagos state governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu commended Alhaji Aliko Dangote for always blazing the trail, noting that Lagos state government was happy to be hosting many of his businesses. He added that, \u201cwith the largest fertiliser plant in Africa in Lagos and the largest refinery in the world coming soon, there is nobody that would not be proud of Alhaji Dangote.\u201d\n\nThe governor stated that Nigeria would quickly forget its many economic problems if another entrepreneur like Dangote could be replicated in other regions of Nigeria.\n\nSanwo-Olu also said that private investors could always count on Lagos State government when it comes to provision of an enabling environment to make businesses thrive.",

          "text": "Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the Nigerian business community in the diaspora has written former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar.\n\nThe Nigerians, who are major stakeholders in the success and progress of the country, said they were concerned about the quality of political leadership in the country.\n\nThey pointed out that the success or failure of a country is directly proportional to the quality of its political leadership.\n\nAccording to the Nigerians, led by Prof. Isah Odidi, leadership requires imagination, resourcefulness, vision, experience, competence and formidable track record.\n\nThe group also reminded the former Vice President that above all, a leader must possess the ability to assemble the best and brightest in the management of the country\u2019s affairs.\n\nThe Nigerians in diaspora further noted that for a complex and diverse country like Nigeria, a leader must also be someone with a unifying vision, someone who understands and respects our ethnic and religious diversity.\n\nFull letter below:\n\nBased on these criteria of leadership, and from our assessment of the political situation in Nigeria, we came to the conclusion that your Excellency is the most adequately prepared for the task of rebuilding Nigeria and setting it on the path of economic growth and prosperity. Your record speaks for you.\n\nAs a former Vice President of Nigeria, you played a significant role in the implementation of the policy objectives of the Obasanjo administration. He gave you many responsibilities, including the implementation of the privatisation programme, which you discharged with distinction.\n\nYou participated fully in the successful implementation of the administration\u2019s economic reform programme. Besides, you assembled a formidable team of experts to help you execute those national responsibilities.\n\nOne of the most outstanding successes of the Obasanjo administration was the improvement in the country\u2019s GDP and boosting foreign direct investments in Nigeria. Your Excellency you were part of that success story.\n\nThe administration of which you served as vice president was able to achieve an $18 billion debt relief in 2006. Unfortunately, that effort is being bastardized today because the government of the day is taking us back into debt burden.\n\nSir, we are not happy to see Nigeria moving backward. We are facing serious challenges such as insecurity, unemployment, poverty, declining healthcare standards and education.\n\nLeadership is a serious task and therefore no country can afford to leave its fate in the hands of people who want power for its own sake, but lack the basic qualities or qualifications to cope with the challenges at hand. Every issue the APC administration has promised to solve is getting rapidly worse. The general despair in the country is a sign of leadership failure.\n\nAgainst this background, Sir, we are calling on you to answer the clarion calls of Nigerians to join the presidential race. Your experience as a successful investor not only in education, but also other spheres of business, is a valuable asset that you can put at the service of Nigeria. The economy is central to the success of all government policy objectives.\n\nYour business experience will stand you in good stead managing and growing the economy. Waiting for good luck is not an economic strategy. Nigeria needs a man like you who has the acumen for assembling a formidable economic team to strategise on the solutions.\n\nWe, Nigerians in the Diaspora recognize that you are pro business and in tune with modern business skills. Nigeria is best placed as a strategic hub for service delivery and the attendant jobs that would be created by it.\n\nAdditionally, the country is also in need of a knowledge and industrial economy if we are to make meaningful strides in our quest for development.\n\nBased on your track record, you are the most adequately prepared for the office of the president and the yearnings of Nigerians in the Diaspora.\n\nYour commitment to our unity and respect for our ethnic and religious diversity is unrivalled. Your commitment to do justice to all Nigerians is one of your strongest and most endearing virtues. Indeed, these are reasons we are inspired by your leadership qualities.\n\nYour Excellency, we have come today as Nigerians in the Diaspora to call on you to accept the clarion call of Nigerians and come out once again to contest the 2023 presidential election. We are facing an existential threat that requires a man of experience to tackle.\n\nYour track record is impressive. Democratic leadership is as effective as the qualities of those who are elected. Electing candidates who are not prepared for the office leads to disastrous outcomes.\n\nWe in the Diaspora are desirous of true change that can only come about by electing the right leaders like you. Sir, accept our call to join the race in order to fix Nigeria.",

          "text": "Senators were apparently divided on Tuesday over a call for the Senate to debate a Federal High Court ruling that declared Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act as illegal.\n\nJustice Evelyn Anyadike, in a judgment, heard that the Section of the Act was \u201cunconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and ought to be struck down as it cannot stand when it is in violation of the clear provisions of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the court ordered the Attorney General of the Federation to \u201cforthwith delete the said Subsection 12 of Section 84 from the body of the Electoral Act.\u201d\n\nJustice Anyadike in the Suit FHC/UM/CS/26/2022 held that Sections 66(1), 107(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that appointees of government seeking to contest elections were only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the election.\n\nAccording to her, any other law that mandates such appointees to resign or leave the office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null and void to the extent of its inconsistency to the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nTrouble started when Senator George Sekibo (Rivers East), citing order 42 of the Senate Standing Orders on Personal Explanation, challenged the judgment of the court on Section 84(12).\n\nCiting Section 4 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), Sekibo stated that the National Assembly is empowered by virtue of Its provisions to make laws for the peace, order and good governance of Nigeria.\n\nHe added that Section 228 lists such functions to include making laws to ensure internal democracy within political parties.\n\nThe section provides in part that, \u201cthe National Assembly may by law provide guidelines and rules to ensure internal democracy within political parties, including making laws for the conduct of party primaries, party congresses and party conventions; and the conferment on the Independent National Electoral Commission of powers as may appear to the National Assembly to be necessary or desirable for the purpose of enabling the Commission more effectively to ensure that political parties observe the practices of internal democracy, including the fair and transparent conduct of party primaries, party congresses and party conventions.\u201d\n\nHe argued further that the provisions of Section 318 of the 1999 Constitution clearly define who a public servant is, without including political appointees.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything against the Judge, but Mr. President, what is relied on in the judgment is not in tandem with the interpretation of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution defines for us who is a civil servant and who is a public servant. It does not include political appointees.\n\n\u201cMore so, Section 4 gives us the power to make good laws, and in our mind, any law we make here is good law.\n\n\u201cSection 228 gives us also the power to make certain laws to guard the Independent National Electoral Commission to effectively discharge its functions.\n\n\u201cWe felt that Section 84(12) as enshrined in the Electoral Act assented to, is for the interest of the people and country.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that somebody should go to court without joining the Senate or the House of Representatives where this law emanated from, because we are the origin of the law before the President assented to it.\n\n\u201cIf you think it is faulty, you either take us to court and make us part of that case. We did not know, we were not told and they just went there and got a judgment, destroying our work for over one year as of no one here has the head to do any good thing,\u201d Sekibo said.\n\nThere was however a mild drama after Senator Chukwuka Utazi seconded Sekibo\u2019s motion on the floor when Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, who presided over plenary, said the debate on the motion be deferred to another legislative day.\n\nHe noted that moving the debate to Wednesday would enable more Senators to make their contribution and also enjoy the presence of the Senate President Ahmad Lawan.\n\nAt this point, Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu supported the position of Omo-Agege on the need to defer the debate.\n\nHowever after a brief argument on the need to defer the debate, the Deputy Senate President, thereafter, put the question for a motion to be brought to the floor during plenary on Wednesday.\n\nThe voice vote received the overwhelming support of lawmakers for the motion to be considered.\n\nOmo-Agege, explained that his decision for the motion to be considered on Wednesday, was to allow Senators absent during Tuesday\u2019s plenary to make their contributions when the matter is taken.",

The papers are manifestly defective,\u201d the judge said while granting all the reliefs sought by the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe action of the 5th to the 25th Defendants is feeble and constitutes an attempt to pull a wool in the eyes of the court.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution...

He said he found gaps and loopholes in their defence as they tried to twist events to suit their own narratives.\n\nTaiwo noted that they not only defected loudly, \u201cthey took pictures of their defection and were received by the officials of the 26th defendant\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe is no doubt that the defendants can belong to or join any political association and assembly as they are free to do so. I consider the attempts of the 6th \u2013 25th defendants to justify their defection, feeble in the circumstances of this case.\u201d\n\nTaiwo said the public voted for the lawmakers through the plaintiff who sponsored them and they were not elected as independent candidates.\n\n\u201cThey had a vehicle which conveyed them and that vehicle belongs to the plaintiff. They cannot abandon the vehicle,\u201d he held.\n\nThe judge said politicians treat citizens who elected them into power as if they do not matter when they assume office. He said a day will come when elected officers must resign if they migrate to another party \u2014 or seek the permission of the people before they decamp.\n\nHailing the judgment, the Cross River PDP chairman, Venatius Ikem, said: \u201cIt was a heart-warning judgement and a victory for Cross Riverians who voted for PDP in 2019 general election.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari says the 2.5 billion dollar Dangote Fertiliser Plant in Ibeju Lekki, Lagos, will boost Nigeria\u2019s foreign exchange earnings and accelerate economic growth.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Buhari spoke on Tuesday while inaugurating the three million metric tonnes per annum urea production plant.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis fertiliser plant is further expected to enhance our administration\u2019s drive towards achieving self-sufficiency in food production in the country.\n\n\u201cI commend the Chairman, Board and Management of Dangote Industries Ltd., for their business initiative in establishing this plant.\n\n\u201cIt will reduce our dependence on importation of fertiliser, create jobs, increase the inflow of foreign exchange and accelerate economic growth.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of the plant demonstrates the commitment of Dangote Industries Ltd. to the socio-economic development of the country and the well-being of Nigerians.\n\nThe president expressed optimism that the investment in the plant would replicate the group\u2019s earlier experience in the cement sector where it had become a leading name in Nigeria and across the African continent.\n\nHe said: \u201cDangote Industries Ltd. has created thousands of jobs across Nigeria. It is the second biggest employer of labour in this country after the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThis is very pleasing because job creation by the private sector will help to improve security and take thousands of youths off the streets.\u201d\n\nThe president said the nation also stood to gain extensively in forex earnings through excess production and exports from the plant.\n\n\u201cI am informed that you have already started exporting to other countries including the United States, India and Brazil.\n\n\u201cThe coming on stream of the plant is creating huge opportunities in the area of job creation, trade, transport and logistics to earn significant wealth, reduce poverty and helping to secure the future of our nation,\u201d said Buhari.\n\nHe noted that the agricultural sector was a critical aspect of the economy and availability and affordability of fertiliser would lead to increased yields for farmers.\n\nBuhari added that he was expecting a rise of new breeds of \u2018agropreneurs\u2019 who would take to farming and make the nation self-sufficient in food production.\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to assure all Nigerians that our government is focused on providing the enabling environment for the private sector to thrive.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to improve on infrastructure, power and security and other initiatives that will drive investments in our economy.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we are partnering with the private sector through a tax credit scheme for the rehabilitation of roads across Nigeria under the Executive Order Seven.\n\n\u201cWe know good roads contribute to easy movement of goods and services across the nation thus reducing the cost of doing business and improving productivity.\n\n\u201cWe are also rehabilitating our railway lines and building new ones to lessen the burden on our roads and create an effective modern transportation network.\u201d\n\nMr Godwin Emefiele, Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), lauded the Buhari-led administration for the support to end shortage of fertiliser in the country.\n\nEmefiele noted that this had led to a significant increase of active fertiliser blending plants in Nigeria from seven in 2015 to 48 in 2022.\n\nHe said the import bill on fertiliser had not only dropped significantly but the country was now earning forex through exportation of fertiliser.\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said the Lekki Free Trade Zone was conceived by former Governor Bola Tinubu in 2003 to attract investments to the state.\n\nHe said the free trade zone today was host to Dangote Fertiliser Plant, which was the largest fertiliser plant in Africa and the second largest in the world.\n\nThe governor said there was also the 650,000BPD Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Plant and the Lekki Deep Sea Port within the same axis, making it a prime investment destination.\n\nOn their parts, Mr Niyi Adebayo, Minister of Trade, Industry and Investment and Dr Mohammad Abubakar, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, enjoined other companies to emulate the strides of Dangote Industries Ltd.\n\nEarlier, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, President, Dangote Industries Ltd., said the fertiliser plant would drastically reduce the level of unemployment and youth restiveness through generation of direct and indirect employments.\n\nDangote said: \u201cAgriculture accounts for over 20 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product, and the country is a leading producer of various agricultural commodities.\n\n\u201cThe sector has the potential of becoming the biggest source of income for our nation, providing employment and raw materials for industries.\n\n\u201cHowever, low fertiliser usage has been a major reason for low productivity in the sector.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that nonavailability of the product, in quantity and quality, rather than affordability, is the primary constraint to the use of fertiliser.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make fertiliser available in sufficient quantities and quality for our teeming farmers, assuring greater agricultural output.\u201d (NAN)\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Emefiele said this while briefing journalists at the end of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja.\n\nAfter MPC meeting, the second in 2022, the CBN resolved to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), otherwise known as the interest rate, at 11.5 per cent with the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR.\n\nBut Emefiele urged the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) to take urgent steps to ensure adequate supply of petroleum products in the country to reduce the rate of arbitrary increase in price of these petroleum products by oil marketers.\n\nThe CBN governor\u2019s comment came a day after THISDAY reported similar concern expressed by Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Austin Avuru, who called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector, revealing that up to 80 per cent of oil pumped in the country, particularly in the East, is stolen. Avuru spoke few days after a businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr. Tony Elumelu, also bemoaned the worsening state of the industry, stressing that about 95 per cent of oil production does not get to the terminal. Elumelu has his oil assets in the Niger Delta.\n\nJust about a week ago, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), operators of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) pipeline, threatened to exit the facility due to incessant vandalism, perennial sabotage and outright theft.\n\nThe company sated, \u201cAEEPCO remains gravely concerned about the persistent heightened attack on our production facilities and the NCTL. These attacks appear to have escalated in intensity and effect.\n\n\u201cAll our current efforts to sustain and increase crude production are being aggressively undermined, even wiped out by the activities of economic saboteurs whose audacity continues to be growing by the day.\u201d\n\nAiteo disclosed that its NCTL had been targeted, with considerable success, for the sole and devastating objective of aiding crude theft.\n\nThe company stated that given the level of losses, occasioned by massive oil theft, it was experiencing, as joint operator of the NNPC/AITEO JV, it was now left with the unavoidable option of actualising a total exit from the NCTL.\n\n\u201cWe are giving active and urgent consideration to this course of action because the consequences of continuing to operate in this manner now represents an existential threat to our survival,\u201d the firm stated.\n\nThe CBN also left other monetary policy parameters unchanged, namely the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 per cent and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nMPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and it often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nThe MPC also voted to maintain CRR at 27.5 per cent as well as the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nThe CBN governor said six out of the 10 MPC members present voted to retain monetary parameters, adding that while loosening could trigger liquidity surfeit in the system, a tightening stance would impact the fragile recovery of the economy, reverse credit expansion and yet, fall short of taming inflation.\n\nEmefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, however expressed worry that whereas global oil prices had gone up, this had been compounded by shortage of supply of petroleum products.\n\nThe CBN also expressed optimism that in the medium term, the proposed take-off of the Dangote refinery this year, would help to improve the supply of petroleum products in the country.\n\nEmefiele said the CBN remained optimistic that food prices would trend downwards in 2022 as security agencies sustain efforts to subdue the activities of bandits so as to allow farmers back to their farmers.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnd now what we are saying is that if farmers are able to access their farms, do they have the wherewithal to procure the inputs, seeds, fertilizer and other inputs with which they can go back to the farm and farm? We are making all those available. And that is why we still remain reasonably optimistic that food prices would moderate in 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said the MPC further noted with concern the effect, which the global price increase in petroleum and other products was having on all economies. He pointed out that this had resulted in imported inflation on the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe committee believed that specific actions were required to ensure that the trend did not continue, given the adverse consequences and aggressive rising price level could have on the cost of living and purchasing power of Nigerians.\n\nEmefiele noted that before the Russia-Ukraine war, the MPC was optimistic that the moderate decline in inflation was sustainable due to the positive impact of good harvest on price levels. But it expressed worry that, whereas global prices had gone up, this had been compounded by the shortage of supply of petroleum products.\n\nHe added that the rising price of diesel had been compounded by the inadequate electricity supply, which has adversely impacted domestic prices.\n\nThe MPC, however, advised the CBN and the fiscal authorities to take specific and urgent actions to avoid many power generating stations shutdown for turn-around maintenance, resulting in the current unwarranted shutdown of generating assets.\n\nThe CBN said the committee was, nonetheless, relieved that food inflation declined marginally due to good harvest.\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cAlthough some scarcity is expected as we approach the planting season, the committee is optimistic that with the high level of strategic grain reserves of the CBN, it is relieved that food prices would remain relatively moderated.\u201d\n\nThe committee further advised the apex bank to redouble its development finance initiatives aimed at boosting domestic food output, which would help in moderating food inflation. going forward, thereby moderating headline inflation.\n\nOn the global scene, the committee noted with concern the recent heightening of uncertainties confronting the recovery of the global economy as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and numerous sanctions against Russia, introduced a new dimension of risk to the tepid recovery of the global economy.\n\nAmong other things, the committee took into cognisance the lingering headwinds associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain constraints, rising inflationary pressure, and more recently, the progression of an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve Bank and Bank of England (BOE).\n\nMembers noted that the on-going war and the resultant sanctions against Russia will continue to have a considerable impact on the global supply chain as both countries are major players in the global commodities market.\n\nEmefiele said global financial conditions were thus, expected to tighten in the short-term as the investment horizon gradually becomes clearer, adding that this is expected to impact capital flows to emerging market economies as risk-averse portfolio investors adopt a wait-and-see approach.\n\nHe said the risks to the overall recovery of the global economy remained heightened and called for cautious policy manoeuvring to avoid a sharp downturn, such as experienced in 2020.\n\nProviding update on the N15 trillion Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria (Infraco), the CBN governor said the company had commenced operation in earnest, adding that it has secured about N250 billion bridged loans to finance three projects.\n\nHe told journalists, \u201cInfraco is set up, the board is running and the MD has been appointed, asset managers have been appointed. We have currently three assets that are under finance. We\u2019ve done bridge finance of almost about N250 billion for that purpose and the remaining sum, asset managers are going to be going into the data room to see the numbers, to determine viability of those roads\u2026Lagos- Ibadan, Abuja-Kano-Kaduna (AKK) project as well as the second Niger Bridge which is almost completed now.\n\n\u201cI am sure we are only meant to complete the funding that the federal government has put into it before now. And we will do it. And the Permanent Secretary, Finance, who also is assisting at least in terms of collaboration between fiscal and monetary authority also assured that there are pipelines of infrastructure to be looked at.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOf course, Infraco as an institution that looks at commercial viability, we will look at each of those projects, determine their commercial viability and determine particularly how would revenue be realised to repay the loans and from there it would be done.\n\n\u201cSo I believe we are on the fast mode and 2022 would be a very aggressive year in the tenure of Infraco.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Party inaugurates media committee\n\n\u2022Sule: APC govs have resolved their differences\n\n\u2022Uzodinma confident March 26 is sacrosanct\n\n\u2022Senate has no consensus candidate, says spokesperson\n\n\u2022How Buni saved Akpanudoedehe after caretaker members threatened to stage walkout\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale, Sunday Aborisade in Abuja and Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia\n\n\n\n\n\nFour days to the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), slated for this weekend, March 26, Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, yesterday, stormed the national secretariat of the party, where it harmonised the sub-committees and immediately after, inaugurated the media committee for the convention.\n\nBuni, who got to the secretariat around 3:25pm to take charge of the office, arrived to a rousing welcome by members of staff.\n\nTHISDAY also gathered that the presence of the chairman at the secretariat confirmed that the party would commence the screening of aspirants vying for various party positions today.\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman of the Media Committee for the APC Convention, Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State, said the APC governors had resolved their differences and put behind them all the bickering witnessed in recent weeks.\n\nIn a related development, Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, yesterday, declared that nothing would stop the national convention from holding this weekend. Uzodinma spoke in Abuja after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThat was as the APC caucus in the Senate, yesterday, said it had not endorsed any of its colleagues for the position of national chairman of the party. And facts emerged about how a walkout by CECPC members to protest the presence of sacked APC National Secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, at a meeting of the caretaker committee was averted.\n\nThe screening of aspirants ahead of the convention, according to the timetable and schedule of activities, ought to have started last Saturday and ended on Sunday, but the exercise could not commence due to late submission of forms by aspirants.\n\nTHISDAY had reported on Monday that the delayed harmonisation of the screening committees had halted the screening. All things being equal, the screening exercise would commence today following the harmonisation of the committees set up by Buni and Niger State Governor Abubakar Bello, who acted while Buni was away.\n\nA party source, who pleaded anonymity, confirmed that the committees had been harmonised and the screening would commence today.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cWe have stopped the sale of forms. The aspirants are still submitting forms, but the sale of forms has been stopped. The screening will commence tomorrow (today). The lists will be ready today (yesterday).\n\n\u201cThe lists of the aspirants are being compiled zone-by-zone, as requested by the screening committee, so that it will be convenient for them during the screening. That\u2019s what they are sorting out now.\u201d\n\nSule stated in Abuja at the inauguration of the media committee and its sub-committees that the rift among the APC governors had been resolved. In a statement issued by the secretary to the committee and Special Adviser to the President on Media, Garba Shehu, the governor revealed that the committee had broken into subcommittees that had moved on to their various assignments aimed at delivering a successful convention.\n\nSule said, \u201cThe leadership of the party under Governor Mai Mala and the members of the caretaker committee are making every effort to take everyone along and I believe it is the only path for a successful convention and victory at elections. We believe in unity in diversity, and this is the mantra of our convention.\u201d\n\nUzodinma reiterated APC\u2019s readiness for the March 26 national convention after a meeting with Buhari.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen at State House, Abuja, the governor said, \u201cOn the APC convention, I don\u2019t know what kind of sign you want to see before you know that the convention will hold on Saturday. As at yesterday (Sunday), all the sub-committees had started meeting. The screening committee, the accreditation committee, and I\u2019m aware that they are only waiting. The venue is being prepared.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know the kind of machines you want, whether you want caterpillar or bulldozer before you now know that there will be convention. I told you people that APC is the party to beat.\n\n\u201cIt is the wish of our opponent to see that APC is scattered, or is not united. But that is their wishful thinking. APC cannot afford to lose what they have, because what we have is the trust of over 200 million people.\n\n\u201cAnd we don\u2019t just have a choice, we must remain united to be able to continue with this programme. So, I want to assure you that we\u2019ll have a very peaceful, very successful convention on Saturday. If anybody is thinking otherwise, well, that person should go and pray because God has already approved our convention.\u201d\n\nSenate Has No Consensus Candidate, Says Spokesperson\n\nThe APC caucus in the Senate said it had not endorsed any of its colleagues vying for the office of APC national chairman as consensus candidate.\n\nThree senators \u2013 Abdullahi Adamu, Sani Musa, and Tanko Al-Makura \u2013 are contesting the position of APC national chairman at the party\u2019s convention. There was tension in the red chamber yesterday, when the news went round that the APC senators had settled for Adamu.\n\nA certain report claimed that the leadership of the 9th Senate led by the Senate Leader, Senator Abdullahi Yahaya, made the declaration last Thursday during the launch of Adamu\u2019s campaign headquarters in Abuja.\n\nThe development caused serious confusion among the senators, as those of them, who were contacted, denied ever endorsing anyone, let alone, Adamu.\n\nThe senators said they needed the party to move forward with the emergence of an energetic person, who would be elected through a transparent process.\n\nSpokesperson for the senate, Dr. Ajibola Basiru, when contacted, said the APC members in the red chamber had not endorsed any of the aspirants.\n\nBasiru stated, \u201cI am not aware that the APC senate caucus has adopted any senator for the position of the national chairman of the All Progressives Congress. I know that three senators are contesting and there was nowhere or occasion, when we took any decision to adopt any particular candidate.\n\n\u201cWe would be very happy if any of them emerge as the APC national chairman on Saturday. The emergence of any of the three senators would be a good omen to our institution.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, the APC senate caucus hasn\u2019t endorsed any of them or agreed to pick any of them as the consensus candidate. Senators Adamu Abdullahi, Sani Musa, and Tanko Al-Makura are in the race.\u201d\n\nHow Buni Saved Akpanudoedehe After Caretaker Members Threatened Walkout\n\nBut for the fervent intervention of the chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mai Mala Buni, members of the committee had threatened to stage a walkout if the sacked National Secretary of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, was allowed to be part of their meeting yesterday.\n\nMembers of the committee had in a leaked notice dated March 8, 2022, and signed by majority of the members, passed a vote of no confidence on Akpanudoedehe. His removal was to be ratified at the emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting before it was cancelled following Buni\u2019s return to the leadership of the party.\n\nHowever, at yesterday\u2019s meeting, presided by Buni, members of the committee insisted that they stood by the vote of no confidence passed on the secretary.\n\nA source privy to the meeting told THISDAY that when the meeting commenced, other members of the committee insisted that Akpanudoedehe would not be part of the gathering.\n\nThe source added that it took Buni about an hour to plead with members of the committee, who threatened to walk out if the secretary was allowed to be part of the meeting.\n\nThe source said, \u201cWhen they started the meeting, all other members of the caretaker committee insisted that the secretary cannot sit with them. But the chairman pleaded with them and they threatened to walk out if the secretary should sit. It took the chairman almost an hour to apologise on his behalf.\u201d\n\nThe source said members of the committee told Buni they had been receiving pleas on behalf of the secretary from top ranking members of the party, including governors.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cThe committee members made the chairman understand that they still stand by the vote of no confidence they passed on him. They told the chairman that it was during the acting period of the Niger State governor, Abubakar Bello, that they really acted as caretaker members, because responsibilities were given to them. Buni apologised and pleaded with them that the days of the caretaker committee were numbered.\u201d\n\nThe source said Buni directed the secretary to formally apologise to other members of the committee and to also apologise to Bello.\n\n\u201cIt was on that note that they allowed him to sit with the committee,\u201d the source said.\n\nWhile the meeting was on, Uzodinma arrived at the party secretariat, apparently to plead on behalf of the secretary.\n\nAnother party source, who equally pleaded anonymity, said some of the governors came to beg on behalf of the secretary.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThe governors came to beg on behalf of the national secretary, for him not to be sacked. They want to give him a soft-landing, because if he\u2019s sacked, it\u2019s a dent on his image.\n\n\u201cAlmost 90 per cent of the caretaker committee members voted against him. So, that is what they are addressing now. They want them to temper justice with mercy, so that he can rewrite the wrong. Other issues pertaining to the committee and how to fund the convention are being discussed.\u201d\n\nWhen approached, Akpanudoedehe asked the journalists to look for the National Youth Leader of the party, Ismaeel Ahmed, to brief the press on the outcome of the meeting.\n\nBuhari Support Group Endorses Mustapha\n\nNational Coalition of Buhari Support Organisations (BSO) declared support for the aspiration of Malam Saliu Mustapha, who was vying for the position of APC National Chairman.\n\nA statement issued yesterday by media aide to Mustapha, Mr. Dapo Okubanjo, said the group made its position known during a courtesy call at their campaign headquarters in Abuja.\n\nThe group, led by its Chairman, Mr Peter Oganto, said Mustapha was a product of Buhari\u2019s politics.\n\nOganto said, \u201cSaliu Mustapha is a product of Buhari politics, who stood solidly behind the president through thick and thin, and still remained faithful to the cause, in spite of the injustice he has suffered in the party.\n\n\u201cSo, having gone round to see other chairmanship aspirants, we have decided to endorse him as the only one that can truly keep the Buhari legacy alive long after the president must have left office.\u201d\n\nResponding, Mustapha commended the group for their show of support, while also using the opportunity to outline his plans for members of the ruling party.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAside from what we are bringing to the table in terms of our 10-point agenda, we are the only ones with real experience of party administration.\n\n\u201cAs a founding APC member, I have enough institutional memory of the party to ensure that members are duly rewarded for their efforts in building the party to what it is today.\u201d\n\nMusa Possess Requisite Qualities to Lead APC, Says Yahaya\n\nGombe State Governor Inuwa Yahaya said the All Progressives Congress (APC) deserved a visionary and highly competent person, like Senator Sani Musa, as its national chairman. Yahaya said Musa possessed the qualities that could lead the APC to victory in the 2023 general election. According to a statement by the media assistant to Musa, Nasir Mohammed, Yahaya stated this when Musa paid a visit to him at the Gombe State Governor\u2019s lodge in Abuja yesterday.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe APC, in all sincerity of purpose, deserves the best hand to manage its affairs at this time and I am convinced that Senator Sani Musa possesses the right leadership qualities for the job as we head into the national convention.\n\n\u201cI urge Senator Sani Musa to continue with his consultations across all the party leaders and pray for his successful outing at the convention. I will be looking forward to working with him should he emerge the next national chairman of the APC.\u201d\n\nMusa\u2019s visit to Yahaya, the statement added, was in continuation of his consultation with stakeholders and party leaders.\n\nMusa and Yahaya spoke extensively on ways to move the party forward, especially, with regard to the March 26 national convention of the APC.\n\nWhile presenting his agenda for the party if elected as the national chairman, Musa disclosed that he was fully prepared to bring about a visionary leadership to the APC and rejig the entire party architecture in line with international best practices.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Imoke hails judgement\n\n\u2022State govt appeals, files stay of execution\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\n\n\n\n\nBarely two weeks after a Federal High Court in Abuja sacked the governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, his deputy and 15 members of the House of Assembly, another court has ordered the immediate removal of two House of Representatives members and 18 legislators of the Cross River State House of Assembly.\n\nJustice Taiwo Taiwo of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court yesterday ordered their removal from office on account of their defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nTaiwo, in his judgement, held that the affected federal and state legislators could not continue to occupy office having dumped the party that brought them into office.\n\nThe two House of Representatives members to vacate their office were, Micheal Etaba and Legor Idagbor, those ordered out of the Cross River State House of Assembly included, Eteng William, Joseph Bassey, Odey Agbe, Okon Ephraim, Regina Anyogo, Mathew Olory, Ekpo Bassey, Ogbor Udop, Ekpe Okon, Hillary Bisong, Francis Asuquo, Elvert Ayambem, Davis Etta.\n\nOthers included Sunday Achunekan, Cynthia Nkasi, Edward Ajang, Chris Ogar and Maria Akwaji.\n\nThe sacked lawmakers had joined the Governor, Prof Ben Ayade, and his deputy to dump the PDP for the APC in May last year.\n\nBut the PDP in a suit instituted on its behalf by Mr. Emmanuel Ukala, had approached the court to challenge the legality of the actions of the decampees.\n\nAmong the issues it brought before the court for determination were, \u201cWhether upon a proper interpretation of the provisions of Sections 68 (1)(g) of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and in view of the decision of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in the case of ABEGUNDE vs. ONDO STATE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY (2015), the 6 and 7 Defendants being persons whose election to the House of Representatives was sponsored by the Plaintiff and having become members of another political party, the 26 Defendant, before the expiration of the period for which the House was elected, that is, June 11, 2019 to June 10, 2023, the 6 and 7 defendants have not thereby vacated their seats in the House of Representatives?\n\n\u201cWhether upon a proper interpretation of the provisions of Section 109 (1)(g) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and in view of the decision of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in the case of ABEGUNDE V. ONDO STATE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY, (2015), the 8 to 25 Defendants being persons whose election to the Cross River State House of Assembly were sponsored by the Plaintiff and having become members of another political party, the 26 defendant, before expiration of the period for which the House was elected, that is, June 11, 2019 to June 10, 2023, the 8 to 25 defendants have not thereby vacated their seats in the Cross River State House of Assembly?\u201d\n\nPDP submitted that if the above questions were answered in its favour, then the court should go ahead to declare their seats vacant on account of their defection to the APC.\n\nPDP then prayed the court for an Order of Injunction restraining the six to the 25 Defendants, respectively or collectively from acting or in any manner howsoever continuing to act as members of House of Representatives and Cross River State House of Assembly haven defected to the APC.\n\nThe PDP further sought another order restraining the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Speaker of the House of Representatives, Clerk of the National Assembly, and Clark of the Cross River State House of Assembly, who were the first to fifth defendants, respectively, from continuing to recognise the defectors as legislators on account of their defection.\n\nThe main opposition party sought, \u201cAn Order of Mandatory Injunction compelling the 1st defendant to accept from the Plaintiff the list of its candidates for the purpose of filling the vacancy created by the exit of the 6 to 25 defendants from the House of Representatives (for the 6th and 7th Defendants), and the Cross River State House of Assembly (for the 8 to 25 defendants) by reason of becoming members of a different political party, (the All Progressives Congress) before the expiration of the term for which they were elected into office and the sponsorship of the Plaintiff and to present certificate of return to the said candidates contained in the Plaintiff List, alternatively for an order compelling the 1st defendant to conduct election (within 90 days) into the offices formerly occupied by the 6th to 25th defendants now vacant by operation of Sections 68(1)(g) and 109 (1g) of the Constitution.\n\nDelivering judgement in the suit, Taiwo held that the case of the plaintiff had merit and accordingly granted the reliefs sought by the plaintiffs.\n\nThe court earlier dismissed the submission of the defendants challenging jurisdiction, maintaining, \u201cThere is nothing against the law that the suit be heard by this court,\u201d adding that the 6-25th defendants are joined with other defendants who have their offices in Abuja.\n\n\u201cWhere there are more than one defendant, the suit can be established anywhere subject to the discretion of the court,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI find no merit in the application for transfer.\u201d\n\nTaiwo, similarly, dismissed claims by the sacked lawmakers that there was disagreement in the PDP, which led to their expulsion from the party.\n\nWhile he held that the defendants were free to belong to or join any political association and assembly of their choice, the court stressed that this freedom or liberty ended where others\u2019 started.\n\nHe said, \u201cI consider the attempts of the 6th \u2013 25th defendants to justify their defection, feeble in the circumstances of this case,\u201d adding that the public voted for the lawmakers through the plaintiff who sponsored them and they were not voted for as independent candidates.\n\n\u201cThey had a vehicle which conveyed them and that vehicle belongs to the plaintiff. They cannot abandon the vehicle,\u201d he held.\n\nTaiwo further remarked that politicians treated citizens that elected them into power as if they did not matter, adding that a day will come when elected officers must resign their post if they migrate to another party or seek the permission of the people before they decamp.\n\nHaving agreed with the plaintiff that the defendants\u2019 continued stay in office amounted to an illegality, having crossed over to another party and also holding that votes belong to a political party and that the electorates voted for the legislators because they contested under the platform of the PDP and not in their individual capacity, the judge, therefore, ordered them to vacate office immediately.\n\nThe court also held that the plaintiff could forward names of its candidates to fill the vacant seat or in the alternative INEC should conduct another election within 90 days.\n\nAnother judge of the Federal High Court, Justice Inyang Ekwo, had on March 8, sacked 15 lawmakers of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly as well as Governor Dave Umahi and his deputy for defection.\n\nHe had held that votes in an election do not only belong to political parties but such votes cannot be transferred from party to party by politicians when they decamped from one party to another.\n\nJudgment was however awaited in a suit filed against Ayade and his deputy.\n\nImoke: Judgement, Restoration of C\u2019River Democratic Mandates\n\nFormer Governor of Cross River State and leader of the PDP in the state, Sen.

          "text": "\n\n*Holds serving governors, other members of committee not on paid employment\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nJustice Y. Halilu of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court has dismissed a suit challenging the legality of the Caretaker /Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nHalilu, in a judgement delivered March 1, with its Certified True Copy Dated March 18, which was sighted by THISDAY, held that the claimant woefully failed to prove allegations made against the defendants.\n\n\n\nThe claimant, former Chairman of the Kwara State APC, Bashir Bolarinwa, had last year dragged the party and members of CECPC to court challenging the legality of the committee set up June 25, 2020 as well as his removal as Kwara State APC Chairman. Bolarinwa also challenged the powers of APC\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) to dissolve the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee in 2020, among other issues.\n\n\n\nAPC, CECPC Chairman Mai Mala Buni, John Akpanudoedehe, Abubakar Bello, Isiaka Bello, Stella Okotete, Professor Tahir Mamman, Ken Nnamani, Senator Abubakar Yusuf, Hon Akinremi Olaide, Dr. James Lalu, Chief David Lyon, Senator Abba Ali, Ismael Ahmed, and Abdulahi Samario, were the first to 15th defendants, respectively, in the suit.\n\nAmong the issues Bolarinwa took to court for determination were: whether the appointment of the 2, 4, and 5 defendants, being serving governors of Yobe, Niger and Osun states respectively, as Chairman and members of CECPC of the APC, was legal and constitutional, having regard to the provisions of Section 183and 223 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\n\nHe said if the question was answered in the negative, whether their appointment was not a gross violation of the constitution.\n\nClaimant further urged the court to determine whether the decision of the APC NEC made on December 8, 2020 to extend the tenure of the CECPC for a period of six months was valid, having regard to Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17 of the APC constitution.\n\n\n\nAmong the declarations Bolarinwa sought from the court was that Buni and the other serving governors\u2019 presence in CECPC was illegal and unconstitutional with regard to Sections 183 and 223 of the constitution. He further called for another declaration that having violated the provisions of Sections 183 and 223 of the constitution, the governors were no longer entitled to Section 308, which guaranteed their immunity from prosecution.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the claimant urged the court to declare that all decisions and actions taken by CECPC from June 25, 2020 till they were removed from office were illegal, null and void, having regard to Section 183, 223 of the 1999 Constitution and Article 17 of the APC constitution.\n\n\n\nThe court was then urged for an order removing the second to 14th defendants from office as chairman and members of CECPC, as well as another nullifying and setting aside all actions and purported removal of claimant by the second to 14th defendants on January 4, 2021\n\nBolarinwa had sought, \u201cAn order nullifying and setting aside the purported ward congresses conducted by the CECPC in Kwara State on July 31, 2021\n\n\u201cAn order of perpetual injunction restraining the first to 14th defendants from conducting any other congresses into any office in the APC pursuant to the Notice of Congress issued by the second to 14th defendants or from performing any other functions in their capacities as CEPCC.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, after an examination of the case of the claimant, the court came to the conclusion that the, \u201cContention of the claimant is borne out of the misinterpretation and misconception of the provisions of Sections 183, 223 of the constitution as well as provisions referred to in this case which clearly shows the claimant\u2019s failure to appreciate the essence and purpose of the resolution of the APC\u2019s NEC on June 25, 2020.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe court also noted that the fulcrum of the claimant\u2019s complaint against the dissolution of the NWC were that the appointment of the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 14th defendants contravened Section 183 and Article 17 of APC and that the appointment of CECPC by NEC to take the place of NWC was not democratic in line with Section 223 of the constitution.\n\nThe court explained that all the allegations were denied by the defendants, thereby putting the claimant to the strictest proof of the same.\n\nAccording to the judge, the claimant could not prove that the governors and other members of CECPC, who are sitting and serving members took up the appointment in full capacity or are in paid employment in that executive official capacity to constitute an infraction or contravention of the provision of Section 183 of the constitution.\n\nHalilu stated that the counter affidavits of the defendants also showed that they were constituted to temporarily perform the function of conducting the national convention of APC and nothing more.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of the dissolution of the Oshiomhole NWC, the court held that NEC did not violate the constitution of the party as Article 13 (3) of the APC constitution empowered it to intervene when there was crisis in the running of the party and that by setting up CECPC, which was mandated to conducted a national convention to elect new NWC, , NEC was in order.\n\n\n\nThe judge further explained that Section 223 of the constitution was not a guarantee of tenure of office of four years but rather for the conduct of election into the party elective offices by political parties.\n\nOn the removal of the claimant by CECPC in January last year, the court held that he who had power to appoint also had the power to fire, adding that NEC donated its powers to CECPC when it inaugurated the committee to replace the NWC in the interim.\n\n\n\nThe judge accordingly dismissed the suit for lacking in merit.\n\nHalilu held, \u201cClaimant has woefully failed to justify the grant of reliefs sought in his originating summons. The entire suit having regards to the facts and circumstances of the same, constitute an abuse of judicial process and liable to be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\u201cI shall dismiss the said suit by consigning the same to a forlorn of judicial debris.\n\n\u201cAccordingly suit number CV/2006/2021 is hereby dismissed for the reason advanced.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Some members of the house of representatives on Tuesday tackled Abubakar Aliyu, minister of power, over the electricity situation in the country.\n\nAliyu had appeared at an interactive session organised by the committee on power.\n\nThe lawmakers expressed reservations over the erratic power supply experienced across the country in recent weeks.\n\nThey said the ministry takes a \u201cfire brigade approach\u201d to dealing with the power outage and has shown no commitment to fixing the problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuraina Ajibola, a lawmaker from Oyo state, said the government is not prepared to provide constant power supply to citizens.\n\n\u201cThese problems are not just starting now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor instance, we know every year there will be shortages of water and then they would be a problem at this time. We also know that during the period between January and March there is usually this shutdown. We have an abundance of gas but we are not making use of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we do is fire brigade approach. It is when that same problem is repeating itself that we will stand up from somewhere and say we are repairing this.\n\n\u201cThe summary of it is that we are not prepared to give our people power. This is very sad because even when there is electricity, some constituencies like mine don\u2019t even have light. There is light only when they want to send billing to us \u2014 estimated bills.\u201d\n\n\u2018POWER MINISTRY NOT IN CHARGE\u2019\n\nAlso speaking, Aishatu Dukku, a lawmaker from Gombe, said her \u201cheart bleeds\u201d because the situation may not subside anytime soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe permanent secretary said until the end of next year. So that means we will continue to be in total darkness until the end of 2023,\u201d she said.\n\nSada Soli, a legislator from Katsina, said the ministry has failed to meet the expectations of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the ministry of power is in charge,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is a complete abdication of their responsibility. It is not their responsibility to deliver power to the consumers but they have a role to play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the ministry is doing. I think he should not be narrating this essay to this committee. Left for me, it\u2019s a tutorial.\n\n\u201cI have the utmost respect for the permanent secretary but they have written this for him to present to us. We are grateful for the information but we need to know the generation as of today.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018NO MORE EXPLANATIONS\u2019\n\nMariam Onuoha, a lawmaker from Imo state, said Nigerians need light \u2014 and not more explanations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want to express my displeasure at the way the federal ministry of power and their agencies are handling the issues of power and power-related programmes,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI want to assume that there is some level of conspiracy targeted at bringing down government efforts despite all the money we have appropriated. Why is this happening when we are about to round up the present administration?\n\n\u201cMr. chairman, you will agree with me that there is no project this ministry has brought before us that has seen the light of day. It\u2019s always from one story to the other. Tell us what effects you are making to cure the defects.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hear the complaints. We need practical steps to solve these problems. We want light. That\u2019s what you were engaged to do. Give us light and the heat this period is unconsiderable.

Give us light.\u201d\n\n\u2018TRANSFER NBET FROM FINANCE MINISTRY TO POWER\u2019\n\nSpeaking earlier, Aliyu who was represented by Nebeolisa Anako, permanent secretary of the ministry, said the power blackout is caused by the disruption in gas supply to power plants.\n\nHe, however, said the outage has started to subside in some areas because the ministry and its partners are working to alleviate the challenges.\n\nMagaji Aliyu, chairman of the committee, said the permanent secretary should return on Friday to present concrete steps taken by the ministry to address the power situation.\n\nThe chairman also said efforts should be made to return the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET) from the ministry of finance to power.\n\n\u201cIt is our opinion that we have to revisit the privatisation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe thought you would come with a list of how many plants we have and their capacities today. We have to do everything possible to bring back NBET under the ministry of power.\n\n\u201cWe will never make progress if NBET is elsewhere. We will involve our leadership to ensure that the right thing is done for this country. There is nothing you have told us that is new \u2014 nothing!\n\n\u201cSo you have to go back and tell the minister that we are not on the same page with the ministry and we did not agree with this submission in totality. There must be light. We have to work hard to ensure that this problem is solved. Where are the NIPP projects? How many plants do we have? What is the generation, transmission, distribution, everything? The president must hear this.\n\n\u201cWe want you to come back to this by Friday with better solutions.\u201d",

          "title": "Tyranny in the workplace: The chaotic culture of Bento Africa",
          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020\n\nTechCabal is working on a follow-up story exploring hostile work culture in African startups.

Equiano is expected to land in South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena later in the year, connecting the continent with Europe.\n\nThis announcement marks a milestone in Google\u2019s plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Last October, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa, of which project Equiano is part of.\n\nMap of Africa indicating Lisbon, Togo, and Cape Town landings with branching units\n\nFor Togo which currently ranks as the sixth-best country in Africa regarding ease of doing business, the landing of Equiano opens up more possibilities and opportunities. It\u2019s expected that once connected to Equiano, it will provide 20 times more bandwidth than any other cable currently serving West Africa, helping Togo attract even more investments and further boosting its vibrant startup culture.\n\n\u201cBroadening the access to high-speed internet is a fundamental part in our national digital development process as we strive towards achieving the objectives set out in our Digital 2025 Strategy,\u201d Cina Lawson, Minister of Digital Economy and Digital Transformation for Togo said.\n\nAccording to an economic impact assessment of Equiano in Togo from Africa Practice and Genesis Analytics, it is estimated that the subsea cable will add approximately 37,000 new jobs between 2022 and 2025, and increase Togo\u2019s economic output by an additional USD 351 million during the same period.\n\nNitin Gajria, Managing Director of Google Sub-Saharan Africa commented, \u201cThe landing of Equiano affirms Google\u2019s commitment to the African continent, to support Africa\u2019s digital transformation. We are thrilled that Togo will be Equiano\u2019s first landing on the African continent, as it aligns with the country\u2019s continuing efforts to promote digital inclusion for Africa.\u201d\n\nThis announcement is coming a year after Google shut down project Loon, a cost-effective solution to the difficult challenge of bringing internet access to people in underserved remote areas.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello!\n\nIt was a black Monday in China yesterday following a crash of flight MU5735 in Guangxi province. According to reports, a 6-year-old Boeing 737-800 carrying 132 people crashed after it sharply dropped from an altitude of 29,100 feet to 3,225 feet in three minutes.\n\nMy reaction to the unfortunate news was, \u201cBoeing, not again!\u201d after I remembered a Netflix documentary, Downfall: The Case Against Boeing, detailing the Boeing MAX 737 scandal.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I mentioned how real-crime documentaries leave me upset and how I\u2019m, unfortunately, obsessed with them. If you\u2019re wondering what upsets me about these documentaries outside the crimes, it\u2019s how little justice is served if ever it gets done. There\u2019s only so much the heart can take, you know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, let\u2019s get into what we\u2019re discussing this today:\n\nOf scandals and toxic work cultures\n\nLendsqr: Shopify for African lenders\n\nFund rain in Kenya\n\nOf toxic workplace cultures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian Tech Twitter came alive yesterday following an investigative piece by TechCabal\u2019s Damilare Dosumu about Nigerian payroll startup, Bento Africa\u2019s co-founder/CEO, Ebun Okubanjo, who was accused of verbal abuse, undeserved termination of employment, inappropriate behaviour, and overall toxicity at the workplace.\n\nThe article, which incited a lot of emotions, took a long time to put together before a break came in March, as revealed by the author. This was after initial efforts to be granted interviews by former employees failed. Eventually, some ex-staff and current workers at the startup contributed to the piece either anonymously or with full disclosure.\n\nGet the full gist: Tyranny in the workplace: The chaotic culture of Bento Africa\n\nThe central topic of discussion \u2014 toxic workplace cultures \u2014 has been escalated by different people who have either been recipients of such harsh conditions at other organisations or have had to come to the rescue of someone who was. Asides from that, there\u2019s been a lot of finger-pointing, too many to keep track of.\n\nIf anything, the attending reactions have encouraged more people to speak up; some legal personnel were seen promising support to anyone interested in litigation and health workers encouraged victims to consider therapy. Consequently, a Twitter Space with over 17,000 participants at its peak and ran for more than five hours had people sharing experiences.\n\nAll these leave some questions behind. When the initial rage wears out, what would be the long term implications of discoveries like this? Would it push employers to be deliberate about promoting a healthy workplace culture? Could it encourage more aggrieved employees to speak out in real-time to expose any infringement on rights? Does this mean Africans will give sincere reviews about companies without fear on platforms like Glassdoor?\n\nFor a moment, it appears we\u2019re moving away from the reality that protecting employee interest in the Nigerian tech space is harder than it looks. And, I think that\u2019s great. What do you think?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShopify for African lenders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe, Founder, Lendsqr\n\nEfforts to help Africans build strong credit muscles didn\u2019t start today, and they are coming in different forms. From digital lending platforms to buy-now-pay-later models, to loan retrieval solutions.\n\nIn a recent development, Adedeji Olowe, Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria, came up with a solution to give credit access to Africans, a pretty tricky space to play, in my opinion. However, leaning on his neck-deep experience in the fintech space, he seems to have covered the basics.\n\nRead his story here: Adedeji Olowe is building a global reputation as Africa\u2019s open banking leader\n\nThe deets: Deciding not to go the conventional way, the resulting startup, Lendsqr\u2019s ultimate goal is to build a large-scale lending infrastructure in Africa.\n\nHow is it doing this? Lendsqr provides small to medium-sized lenders with a comprehensive technology and data stack to lend to customers at scale using the best of breed decision engine, integration to payments systems, and data for quality decisions.\n\nSo far, the founder claims that Lendsqr already has over 100 lenders offering credit to almost half a million users.\n\nThere\u2019s a whole lot of information to unpack, why don\u2019t you enjoy the full story as written by Emmanuel Paul.\n\nRead here: Lendsqr is building the Shopify for lending in Africa\n\nFund rain in Kenya: Powered by People, Apollo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R: Eli Pollak (Co-founder & CEO), Benjamin Njenga (Co-founder & CCO), and Earl St Sauver (Co-founder). Source: Supplied\n\nAfrica\u2019s eCommerce scene seems to be getting streams of investments despite the argument that the industry is barely thriving on the continent.\n\nEmmanuel tried to make sense of this a few months ago, and you can catch a bit of a similar conversation on Techpoint Africa Podcast latest release (Ignore the warning).\n\nBack to the gist. Doesn\u2019t it seem investors are seeing what many people aren\u2019t? Last week, it was Wasoko(formerly, Sokowatch) raising $125m series B led by Tiger Global.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difficulties in Africa\u2019s financial sector create room for many opportunities. Like a giant onion bulb, when one financial service issue is resolved, other layers reveal more issues to be solved.\n\nWhen businesses found it difficult to receive payments online, people hurt under ridiculous bank charges, but fintech companies have come to the rescue.\n\nToday, financial inclusion has improved considerably from previous years. For example, Nigeria\u2019s banked adult population has increased from 36 million in 2016 to 47.7 million in 2020. As of March 13, 2022, the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) places the number of Nigerian bank account holders at 53 million.\n\nHowever, the bulk of Nigeria\u2019s financial inclusion growth has come from savings and payments, leaving a considerable gap in the credit and insurance space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdedeji Olowe, Open Banking Nigeria Trustee, believes that unlocking credit access is a surer method of boosting financial inclusion in Africa. Tying into his ambition to democratise banking in Nigeria, he is currently building Lendsqr, a startup that would create large-scale lending infrastructure in Africa.\n\n\u201cI believe that without an evolving middle-class, we may not come out of our national morass. But without credit to help people stand up, the middle-class wouldn\u2019t emerge.\u201d\n\nWith over two decades of experience in banking, credit, technology, and venture capital, Olowe delved into lending in his two-year (2006 \u2013 2008) stint at First City Monument Bank (FCMB), one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks, where he built a lending system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdedeji Olowe\n\nOlowe, who is on the boards of Sparkle and Paystack, has been neck-deep in Nigeria\u2019s financial space, having previously been the chairman of TeamApt.\n\nOlowe is currently building a reputation as Africa\u2019s Open Banking leader, and our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi, went behind the scenes of his enviable LinkedIn profile. However, building any lending solution is tough, but what the fintech mogul has planned with Lendsqr is a different beast entirely.\n\nThe stubborn onion bulb\n\nNigeria\u2019s lending space could be likened to the difficult parts of the onion bulb that are not so straightforward to peel. Accessing credit in Nigeria is difficult, and for good reasons.\n\nA 2021 Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFInA) report reveals that in 2020, only 3% of Nigeria\u2019s 106 million adults had access to credit from a regulated financial institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch a low percentage points to a considerable gap, and per Lendqr\u2019s analysis, the credit market is worth \u20a672 trillion ($173.5 billion) in Nigeria alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTraditional financial institutions should be jumping at the opportunity, right? Apparently not, and for a good reason.\n\nMost financial institutions across Africa are only willing to lend to the most creditworthy of borrowers like governments, large corporations, and high-net-worth individuals. The scenario is different for small businesses and regular individuals.\n\n\u201cSmall firms and individuals borrow at high rates because of the high risks involved as lenders do not have information on their credit behaviours,\u201d said Juma Reli, Bank of Tanzania Deputy Governor, at the launch of the country\u2019s official databank.\n\nIn recent years, several digital lending platforms have sprung up in Nigeria, but going by current events, most have been operating illegally and unethically. The few legal ones constantly deal with loan defaulters.\n\nIn 2009, just 15 million Kenyans had access to credit, but that number rose by 7.2 million in the next seven years.\n\nHowever, loan defaulters and rogue lenders are also increasing.\n\nAll things considered, Olowe believes it may be hard to blame institutional lenders. The average Nigerian\u2019s credit score has not improved considerably, and the low lending percentage says it all.\n\n\u201cThen came the light bulb moment \u2014 what if tech and data are combined, made available at bargain prices, to enable lenders to lend securely and responsibly? Wouldn\u2019t that make lenders expand? Wouldn\u2019t that curb chronic debtors and block them from abusing credits?\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t that make institutional investors make capital available to lenders? Wouldn\u2019t lenders be able to reach Africans at the point of need through BNPL?\u201d Olowe asks.\n\nProviding a solution\n\nTo tackle the issues with lending, Lendsqr provides small to medium-sized lenders with a comprehensive technology and data stack to lend to customers at scale using the best of breed decision engine, integration to payments systems, and data for quality decisions.\n\nAn excellent way to explain the startup\u2019s value offering would be Canadian tech giant, Shopify. The platform allows retailers to create and manage their online stores. If you have anything to sell online, Shopify takes the pains of creating your website and lets you customise the platform to attract visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Lendsqr provides a platform for any company interested in entering the lending game.\n\n\u201cOur stack has 100% of everything a lender needs to lend. And they can register and issue their first loan in five minutes, running off one of the largest data repositories for credit in Nigeria. All for free.\u201d\n\nFor context, data on a business or an individual is critical for any lending decision. Your employment history, your income level, and your debt-to-income ratio all come into play. Behind the scenes, there are hundreds of data variables to choose from.\n\nOlowe explains that this data comes from lenders already on Lendsqr and from other established lenders, who he prefers to keep secret for now. Lendsqr is also plugged into the CRC Credit Bureau and Credit Registry.\n\nRecall that in 2020, a former OKash CEO went on to create a Blacklist, a platform for small digital lenders to access data on Nigerian borrowers.\n\nThe Blacklist creator, Darlington Onyeagoro, who\u2019s currently CEO of Aladdin, a digital bank, argued that such a platform would create little escape room for serial defaulters.\n\nOn the flip side, such a platform can be positively used by lenders to make decisions.\n\n\u201cWe plan to use this data to unleash credit for the underbanked. And we\u2019re powering our lenders to reach their customers via our Web app, Android app, iOS app, and Web SDK,\u201d Olowe explains.\n\nLendsqr has painstakingly assembled a team of engineers and data experts with experience in Nigeria\u2019s credit and tech space. However, there are players with similar value offerings.\n\nIn 2020, Evolve Credit went live as a marketplace for borrowers to review and choose the best lenders to borrow from. Since its launch, it has evolved into a platform offering a cloud-based solution for would-be lenders. It claims to help them set up in 24 hours.\n\nIndicina\u2019s product, Originate, helps lenders digitise identity verification, credit decision/analytics, and disbursements and collections.\n\nThough initially offering similar features to the other two, Creditclan, has pivoted to aid the process for buy now, pay later (BNPL) companies, a growing sensation in the eCommerce space.\n\nInterestingly, Lendsqr claims its customers can start lending in five mins with already configured products and domain names.\n\n\u201cOur cost of set up and user onboarding is as cheap as free (\u20a60). Our decision engine is very smart with over 300 data variables available for lenders to tweak as they wish, yet we provide them with simple start configurations, to begin with,\u201d Olowe submits.\n\nContinuing, he says, \u201cOur collections and recovery is relentless; it hunts down bad borrowers until the very end. We have one of the largest blacklists to protect lenders from predatory borrowers and chronic debtors.\n\n\u201cFor our APIs, unlike the credit bureau and others, we only charge if and only if it finds data.\u201d\n\nSolutions can be tearful\n\nLendsqr\u2019s aggressive approach certainly comes at a cost. Few people can boast of not tearing up when peeling an onion or trying to build a startup\n\nIf Lendsqr has zero costs for setup and user onboarding, how does it make money? The answer seemingly lies in playing an Amazon-esque long game.\n\n\u201cThe core of our revenue model is charging a fee when we help lenders collect their loans. And there is an alignment \u2014 we don\u2019t charge them before \u2014 our bread isn\u2019t buttered before theirs,\u201d Olowe insists.\n\nConsidering this, any keen observer can guess Lendsqr will earnestly chase growth and try to corner the lending market. So far, it is growing an enviable user base.\n\nThe CEO claims that Lendsqr already has over 100 lenders offering credit to almost half a million users.\n\n\u201cLendsqr will break even after two years. We follow the model of Amazon \u2014 amazing technology and data play at basement level pricing,\u201d Olowe maintains, and for emphasis, adds Jeff Bezos\u2019 famous words, \u201cYour margin is my opportunity.\u201d\n\nWhen building products for the African market, its peculiarities have to be addressed. For instance, the challenges involved with building a lending infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe cost of underwriting is high in Africa, which puts lenders in a bind. The technology is too expensive to build. Or the cost of data (Credit bureau and statement) is so expensive it is ruinous to small ticket loans.\u201d\n\nOlowe and his team at Lendsqr have had to draw on their wealth of experience and network to navigate the space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to engage with different data providers, credit bureaus, and others. We successfully argued cases for cheaper and scalable lending with the likes of CRC and Mono, who are partners in this journey.\u201d\n\nThese were just some of the wins, though, as Lendsqr had to walk away from some data providers with unnecessarily high usage costs.\n\nThe rewards at the end\n\nWhen eating a well-prepared meal, few people remember the tear-filled eyes of the onion-slicing cook. The same applies to the founder of a unicorn. For a financial sector replete with lending-averse financial institutions, Olowe is adamant that Lendsqr is tailored to match the market\u2019s reality.\n\n\u201cWe are a scale company. We understand that the categories of lenders we are serving are super sensitive about pricing, and we offer propositions that are unmatched in value anywhere in Africa.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer Olowe, Lendsqr is using its scale to pass on cost savings to the lenders, which invariably leads to cheaper loans for Africans and Nigerians.\n\nSo far, Lendsqr\u2019s approach has won the hearts of investors as it has closed an undisclosed pre-seed round. On the strength of this, Lendsqr has some major upgrades in sight.\n\n\u201cIn four months, our lenders would have access to native mobile SDKs that allow them to lend even to the mass market, using their phone data for free instead of paying over $0.5 (\u20a6250) as offered by many lendtech providers.\u201d\n\nThe startup also plans to hit customers at their point of need by targeting BNPL players across different sectors.\n\nBeyond technology, it also plans to connect lenders with capital providers to help them scale their lending.\n\nOlowe encapsulates Lendsqr\u2019s immediate vision with the following words:\n\n\u201cWithin 18 months, 1 in 4 consumer credit in Nigeria would either be originated by lenders on Lendsqr or Lendsqr would have provided data comfort to other lenders.\u201d\n\nTo understand the full impact of Lendsqr\u2019s development, one only needs to look at the recent funding trends for BNPL startups, credit-led neobanks, and innovative companies like Indicina and Evolve Credit playing in the space. All things being equal, Africa\u2019s lending scene looks set to explode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

They gain a better understanding of business processes and meet individuals with similar interests. It wasn\u2019t different this time, and the event kicked off by 5:15 p.m.\n\nProviding credit financing for Africans\n\nAfter a brief introduction, the first entrepreneur \u2014 Dayo Oyekanmi \u2014 stepped up to pitch his startup \u2014 Harmony. Harmony plans to play in the increasingly competitive buy now, pay later industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOyekanmi shared that it plans to focus on providing credit financing for its consumers. Rather than hold inventory, the startup will assess data provided by a prospective customer to determine how much credit they can extend. Currently running its private beta, the startup also plans to issue credit cards that will be used to shop at partner merchants.\n\nEmergency responses for Nigerians\n\nThe second person to pitch was Oluwafemi Adeleke. His startup, Siara, plans to provide emergency response and security services for Nigerians using a community model. Unlike Harmony, Adeleke disclosed that Siara had not launched but was still in development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback and networking\n\nProviding feedback to entrepreneurs is an integral part of Pitch Friday. Occasionally, entrepreneurs whose business models are still unclear get more clarity from questions asked by the audience.\n\nAfter the two entrepreneurs had pitched, they got questions and feedback from a highly engaged audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Oyekanmi, many of the questions revolved around the risk management and profitability of the business. He explained that the startup uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to assess a customer\u2019s capability to repay a loan while clarifying that it intends to focus on credit financing.\n\nWith Siara appearing to be offering too many services, the audience grilled Adeleke on the startup\u2019s core proposition.\n\nWhen the event ended at 6:30 p.m., participants hung around to meet each other. April\u2019s edition of Pitch Friday will be held on Friday, April 8, 2022, and you can register to pitch your startup or join the audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Most of our strategy in terms of thinking of our future has been drastically changed as a result of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cFor us, our focus is on our culture; how to engage the world to preserve our ecosystem, which includes our forestry, and utilize technology to drive development, particularly in the area of education, skill development and security.\n\n\u201cOur aspiration is to plan our cities and take the opportunity of the post-COVID-19 era to build infrastructure. We have a 30-year project to develop our state and invest in our people. We are taking the opportunity of job creation to impact young people.\n\n\u201cCOVID 19 taught us that we are on our own and must begin to build our people and infrastructure with the instrumentality of technology. The redefinition of our city, post-COVID-19, is to focus on culture. We want to connect our past to our cities. We have designed a cultural district and would build a pavilion to hold the artefacts being returned to our state.\n\n\u201cWe have a technology park that would train young people to take advantage of the boom in the technology sector. We have designed a medical district and we expect more investments and partnerships to help in growing the sector,\u201d Obaseki noted.\n\nOn his part, Mr. Konrad Fijolek, Mayor of Rzeszow, Poland showcased the government\u2019s efforts on the Urban Lab of Rzeszow, a space for developing innovative solutions and ideas for the city, where testing and implementation of those ideas help improve the quality of lives of city residents.\n\nAlso, Cammy Day, Deputy Leader of City of Edinburgh Council, United Kingdom, who spoke on the city\u2019s waste management efforts towards realizing a smart city, said the government is deploying litter bin sensors across the city to provide accurate bin usage and align with collection activities.\n\nThe Summit, which is the world\u2019s largest networking platform among smart city governments, provides a high-level dialogue platform for global mayors and city leaders to exchange innovative strategies and visions on future city developments.\n\nThis year, the summit was conducted in a hybrid form. In concordance with the theme of SCSE: Digital Transformation Takes Smart Cities to New Heights, the topics for the roundtable sessions are \u201cHow do cities respond to the \u201cNew Normal\u201d with digital transformation?\u201d and \u201cIn face of the \u201cNew Normal\u201d in the pandemic era, what role do city governments play in driving the city\u2019s digital transformation?\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026 chides political elite for failing to engender devt\n\n\u2026 Edo attracts $500m investment into agric sector\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said Nigeria can adopt the novel interventions and radical changes implemented in Edo State in tackling the myriad of challenges and stem the country\u2019s current slide to economic and socio-political crisis.\n\nThe governor said this while delivering the 2022 Nigeria Institute of International Affairs (NIIA) Distinguished Lecture Series titled, \u201cMaking Politics Work for Citizens, Governance and Development: The Edo State Experience,\u201d at the Institute, in Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cWe should also reflect on why we the political actors particularly those of us who are the political elite, who have the responsibility not only to institutionalize the democratic process but also to develop a political culture which should foster and enhance development, have so far failed to do so.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that although politics and democracy have not dealt favourably with Nigeria, this does not deny the existence of the potential for democracy to be the vehicle for the delivery of development to the people.\n\nThe governor said some of his achievements include attracting $500m into the state\u2019s agriculture sector; creation of 300,000 jobs; the 95MW Ossiomo power project; improved basic education for over 400,000 pupils, and the 6000bpd-capacity Edo modular refinery, among others.\n\n\u201cIn Edo, we had to take deliberate and intentional steps to retool our politics to engender development. This has led to the introduction of people-centric policies and programmes which have won our administration significant public trust,\u201d he said.\n\nDecrying the failure of the political class, Obaseki added, \u201cAs we commence another political transition in our democratic journey, we must reflect on the challenges faced in this Republic, so that we can better understand why our democratic experience to date has not provided good governance and why our economic and socio-political development have remained stunted.\u201d\n\nSome of the defects of Nigeria\u2019s political system, according to him, include entry barriers to the political system such as age restriction and high cost of nomination and expression of interest; negative perception of politics and the attendant skirmishes including mudslinging, deliberate character assassination and blackmail, which make it unattractive to accomplished professionals to participate in; prohibitive cost of the electioneering process; proliferation of political parties with no clear ideology, and electoral malpractices which have instigated voter apathy.\n\nOn the reforms implemented in Edo State, he said his administration inherited a state that was essentially under the control of various non-state actors who served as enforcers for the old political order in the state, noting that in exchange for their loyalty and service, the pay off was the collection of revenue that should have accrued to the public purse.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFollowing this, we were able to open up the political space to a broad range of players to the chagrin of the godfathers. These patrons of the old order thrived in the exclusion of the majority from participating in the political process. For them, the fewer the actors in the system, the more relevant they were and the more they were able to take the process hostage.\n\n\u201cWith the opening up of the political system, we embarked on institutional reforms to enhance the capacity of the government to deliver public services. This was done by enhancing the work environment, ensuring regular payment of salaries and pensions, improving compensation packages, and creating better conditions of service for workers.\n\n\u201cWe also revamped the public service to cut back on waste and with this, we were able to deliver more projects with less resources than would have been required.\n\n\u201cHaving built public trust, we had to open up the business environment which led to robust partnership with the private sector and international development organisations. With their support, we have been able to substantially curb the menace of human trafficking and irregular migration, which once pillaged our most valuable resources \u2013 our young people.\u201d\n\nThe governor added: \u201cWe rolled out infrastructure projects in a fair and equitable manner that engenders a sense of inclusion among the people across the various sections of the state.\n\n\u201cWe were able to win the trust of the electorate in Edo State because we had focused on ideals that have come to define our politics and through which we have made the most impact in their lives.\n\n\u201cWe placed the people at the center of our politics, which led to huge investment in human capital development, particularly across all tiers of the state\u2019s education system, starting with the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) programme, which has transformed the lives of over 400,000 pupils across the state and improved learning outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere has been a deliberate emphasis on strengthening partnership with the private sector, from which we have reaped immense benefit. We signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Ossiomo Power Company to provide stable power to government institutions and to also drive the state\u2019s industrial sector. Today, the company generates 95MW out of 550MW it has set out to provide, supported with a distribution infrastructure that has been developed to supply government offices, streetlights and the state\u2019s growing industrial sector with constant electricity.\u201d\n\nOn the Edo example, the governor said Edo presents a very striking example of how Nigeria can fix its intractable electricity problem, which has plagued the country since independence.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith robust partnership with the private sector, the state government has succeeded in encouraging generation by attracting firms like Azura (450Mw) and Ossiomo Power (95MW), and is now proceeding to create its own electricity markets to encourage investments in the distribution of power within the state. Currently, there is stable electricity to power public institutions and infrastructure in metropolitan Benin City.\n\n\u201cIn agriculture, we have attracted almost $500 million investment into palm oil cultivation, having allocated the first phase of 60,000 hectares of land under the Edo State Oil Palm Production Program (ESOPP). Nigeria has not witnessed this scale of oil palm cultivation since independence.\n\n\u201cFollowing the effort to change the paradigm in Edo State and the result it yielded, which highpoint was victory at the election, in which the people freely exercised their franchise and elected a leader of their choice, there is a need to scale this political achievement to the entire country.\n\n\u201cIf what happened in Edo can be replicated in the forthcoming Presidential and National Assembly elections, Nigeria would have taken a critical step to democratic consolidation.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Director General of NIIA, Prof. Eghosa Osaghae said the lecture is rich because the governor is stewed in the classical tradition with his background in classics, which is demonstrated with the achievements recorded in the state since his foray into politics.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the occasion, Prof. Bola Akinteriwa, said the lecture is a reminder that foreign policy is an extension of domestic policy, noting, \u201cWe do not have a good international image because of the way we govern ourselves. People often believe that anything goes in Nigeria. But today, we have someone who is doing things well. Whoever wants a constructive solution must learn from the experience of others. It is going to be empirical and a case study.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun state government on Tuesday, disclosed that over 50 small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) have been fully engaged since the introduction of its food support scheme one year ago.\n\nThe government noted that the impact of the scheme which was introduced to provide food support to vulnerable residents, has been very holistic and greatly felt in different sectors of the state\u2019s economy.\n\nThis is even as the government marked the one year anniversary of the existence of the scheme with the flag-off of the 12th edition which held at the open space of the Local Government Service Commission, State Government Secretariat, Abere, Osogbo.\n\nAccording to the government, the initiative has helped to feed 360,000 vulnerable residents with the multiplier effects on over one million people constituting various households that had benefited in one way or the other since the inception of the programme last year.\n\nSpeaking at the flagoff ceremony of the 12th edition of the programme, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, said the positive impact of the scheme on the economy of the State cannot be over-emphasized as it had helped to stimulate the economy through the promotion of local production, encouragement of local entrepreneurs and by extension, alleviation of poverty and hunger.\n\nOyetola, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prince Wole Oyebamiji, said the government was fulfilled in the execution of the programme as promised on monthly basis saying its sustenance had in no measure contributed to the growth of the local economy.\n\nThe Governor said: \u201cExactly a year ago when we launched the monthly Food Support Scheme, a lot of people were skeptical about its sustenance and doubt that the programme would last for three months. But to the glory of God and in line with our promise that as long as I remain the Governor of the State, we will continue to feed 30,000 vulnerable citizens, we are here to mark the 12th edition of the scheme.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we decided to distribute gari as we did last month to boost local production and encourage our local entrepreneurs. When we are talking of agriculture, when you produce and there is nowhere to sell, you will not assist the economy of the State, so, I am sure that our cassava farmers today are happier than they were five months ago .\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is the essence of government and what good governance stands for, people must be happy with the government and the best way to achieve that is to ensure economic base that is why our government has been working hard to build a better economic base for the development of the people of Osun and advancement of the State.\n\n\u201cSince we commenced the programme, the level of acceptance and feedback has been very unimaginable as being demonstrated so far by many of those that have benefitted in one way or the other from the initiative. As you can see, women have been extremely involved in the scheme, take for instance, in the production of gari, women play dominant role and don\u2019t be surprised that there are women farmers who cultivate cassava too in this state because if you go through the Ministry of Agriculture, there is a unit for women in agriculture and they are extremely doing very well.\n\n\u201cSo, women play a key role. In other clime, women are highly illustrious, they are industrious and they are intellectually based. I advice them not to take agriculture for granted so also our young ones, there are programmes and policies that have been designed to support whoever shows interest in farming.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Commissioner for Special Duties and Regional Integration, Engr. Olalekan Badmus, said the execution of the initiative has been very participatory, collective and holistic.\n\nBadmus noted that the scheme had brought a paradigm shift to local production just as it had really helped to advance and promote the cause of local entrepreneurs who were hitherto not fully engaged.\n\nHe added that the testimonies received through the feedback mechanism provided to assess and evaluate the impact of the scheme has been very encouraging to the extent that people have keyed into the little opportunity provided to galvanise, stimulate and lubricate the economy of the State for the growth, progress and development of the State.\n\n\u201cGoing by the 11th edition that we did, you can see that the level of appreciation was very good and basically the feed back has been very encouraging as this had helped in no measure to surge up the level of productions by the suppliers.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that so far, we have done 360,000 households and the implication of this is that most of these households have father, mother and children and what this implies is that over one million lives have been impacted through this scheme.\n\n\u201cSo, this is enormous and it is only in Osun you can talk of this people-oriented programme. The impact has been well felt and people appreciate it and they are also aware of what Mr. Governor has been doing to reach out to the people particularly the vulnerable citizens.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have been able to engage 50 Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMSEs). We are happy to have made this feat within one year particularly on gari production, because we have been able to show that consistently, our local entrepreneurs can produce the product.\n\n\u201cThis has helped them to expand their business, get more patronage through the awareness we have created for them among other advantages.\n\n\u201cBasically, this has been very impactful to them and I am sure this is going to improve the SMEs in the State particularly women entrepreneurs, because from the investigation we have done, women are largely involve in the production of most of the local staple foods\u201d, he added.",

          "title": "Osun Debt Portfolio and Wale Bolorunduro\u2019s unending display of arrogance and ignorance, By Tunde Adejumo",
          "text": "Whereas, it was thought that the clarifications made through a release by my office (Osun Debt Management Office-\u2018\u2019Osun DMO\u2019\u2019) last week would have sufficed to clear the grey areas about the unending narratives on Osun Debt portfolio which has remained a daily topical issue in the State, i was however taken aback by the arrogant display of ignorance by the former Finance commissioner in the State in person of Wale Bolorunduro in his further rhetoric on the subject.\n\nThe referenced clarifications of mine were in response to one of Wale\u2019s uncouth insinuations earlier published in the State\u2019s local newspaper-Osun Defender. To my utmost shock, rather than taking his time to carefully read through the clarifications and perhaps consult necessary literature on contemporary Public debt management before further outburst, Wale in his characteristic manner, decided to take a roguish, degrading and self-destructive path further on the matter.\n\nWhile i had decided at this time not to make any comments on Wale\u2019s open display of arrogance as exhibited in the opening paragraphs of his jumbled publication (alluding to some unfounded claims about my credentials before joining the services of the State), it is considered important to reveal his awful ignorance about Public debt management, and take him through some rudiments on the concept. Issues relating to his attacks on my personality in his referenced publication of last week Friday shall be addressed appropriately through a proper medium.\n\nFirst, as the current head of the State\u2019s Debt management office (DMO), i wish to maintain that the Debt portfolio passed by the last administration to the current administration in the State is in excess of =N=200billion. At this time, i think i need to explain to Wale that Public debt portfolio of either a Sovereign or Sub-national does not refer only to borrowings (which could be either domestic or external), but also includes domestic expenditure arrears. These are government liabilities on financial obligations already dispensed with or services rendered with whose payments are yet to be made. These include Contractors\u2019 arrears, Salary arrears, Pension and gratuities, judgemental debts, and government-to-government debts. The totality of this, added to loan amount is what is referred to as Debt stock. I am indeed shocked that a former Finance commissioner will be questioning the rationale (and the applicable Accounting standard) for my inclusion of domestic arrears as part of government\u2019s liability or Debt portfolio. If Salary arrears, contractors\u2019 arrears, Pension and gratuity outstanding are not debt hanging on the State government, how come workers, contractors and pensioners in the State keep agitating for settlement of their arrears?. Am certain all the people concerned will be shocked to hear from Wale that their expected arrears do not qualified to be classified as debt in the State\u2019s record simply because they were not collateralised as indicated in his roguish outburst.\n\nApart from recognising them as part of debt portfolio, all the states in the country are currently being urged to develop workable framework for managing Domestic arrears considering their numerous economic and multiplier impacts. For us in Osun, the process of verification of the various domestic arrears and development of the required framework for managing same are yet to be concluded while the current administration keeps allocating funds to reduce this. Hence my office\u2019s restrain on quoting a specific figure on same.\n\nSecond, on the issue of disclosure of necessary details on the State\u2019s Debt portfolio, I wonder the level of disclosure expected from the State\u2019s DMO by Wale. Aside from fulfilling the routine reporting obligations on the State\u2019s debts to the Federal DMO, our office has since 2020 been publishing comprehensive annual report on the State\u2019s Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) and Debt management Strategy (DMS) on the State\u2019s official website. This important and public document contains among other details, the State\u2019s total revenue, expenditures, Medium term fiscal framework, and debt stock. This is contrary to Wale\u2019s claim, and in fulfilment of additional reporting requirements aimed at ensuring transparency on sub-nationals\u2019 financial management. This is in tandem with practices across informed climes.\n\nInterested members of the public are encouraged to check this up from the State\u2019s website. I am certain Wale\u2019s level of ignorance about the State\u2019s financial affairs, full knowledge of which he was always arrogantly claiming will be fully revealed. Members of the public can then judge who is ignorant and unprofessional between my humble self and Financial engineer Wale Bolorunduro who continues to showcase the limit of his understanding of Public financial management. Ignorance they say, is \u2018the root of misfortune, and an enemy even to its owner\u2019\u2019.\n\nFinally, if there are other issues unsettling Wale\u2019s mind about Governor Gboyega Oyetola himself, or his ably-led administration in the State, i will like to urge any of Wale\u2019s allies to counsel him to find a courteous way and better avenue to address them instead of continuously exhibiting his arrogance and lack of depth on contemporary Public debt issues and financial management. Else, Wale might be garrulously driving himself to his \u2018\u2019Golgotha\u2019\u2019.\n\nTunde Adejumo, PhD is Osun state\n\nDirector-General, of Debt Managrment Office",

          "text": "With no end appearing to be in sight to the debilitating fuel crisis in the country, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has stepped forward to intervene in the matter, raising hopaces of a quick resolution.\n\nThe CBN bank governor, Godwin Emefiele, who revealed this move yesterday at the month\u2019s meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee of the CBN, said the bank would take measures to mitigate the impact of the fuel crisis on the Nigerian economy by engaging with key government agencies.\n\nThe apex bank is looking to help improve the supply and distribution of the commodity across the nation.\n\nThis is coming two months after the importation of the off-spec petrol which plunged the country into fuel scarcity of massive proportions. The Russia-Ukraine war has also resulted in supply shortage for import-dependent countries like Nigeria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe CBN governor said the bank would first be engaging with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited towards finding ways to end the lingering petrol scarcity, which had pushed up the price of petrol to between N165 and N230 per litre, while diesel sells for between N700 and 800/litre in the last eight weeks.\n\nEmefiele pointed out that the substantial upward push to price levels continued to be influenced by supply-side factors such as the scarcity of PMS, persisting insecurity and backlash from the Russia-Ukraine war. These require a careful and focused policy intervention to address and resolve.\n\nHe expressed belief that a reduction in the arbitrary prices of petrol and diesel would automatically result in gradual moderation in prices of the products, which would ultimately result in the moderation in the prices of other products whose prices would have gone up as a result of the arbitrary increase in the prices of these items.\n\n\u201cIf these actions are taken, we are positive that inflation will come down,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe CBN governor further stated that product scarcity was responsible for the arbitrary increase in the prices of diesel and petrol across the country. He expressed concern that the increase in energy prices was a major cause of the rise in headline inflation that rose to 15.7 per cent in February.\n\nThis is as NNPC Ltd. has dismissed a report that it had increased prices of petrol at the depots. In a statement shared via its social media channels, it advised the public and relevant stakeholders to disregard the information.\n\n\u201cIt is fake news obviously concocted to cause confusion and to undermine the progressive drive of the NNPC to restore normalcy to the market,\u201d it said.\n\nOn electricity, Emefiele said the apex bank would also partner with power sector regulators to address the challenges still affecting stable power supply in Nigeria. He said the recent nationwide blackout as a result of collapse of the national grid had also increased the demand for diesel to power private generators, and, by implication, increased demand in the already scarce product.\n\n\u201cWe will be engaging with the power minister, NBET and NERC to see whatever we can do to support them,\u201d the CBN governor stated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to him, the CBN had disbursed over N1.3 trillion in the last five years to support both the power generating and distribution companies. The facility was to improve capacity of the power sector to meet national demand and for the system to continue to operate.\n\nOn the call by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the CBN to scale back its intervention schemes, Emefiele said the apex bank was simply deploying home grown solutions through its development finance mandate to support the fiscal arm of the government by providing support facilities to businesses, individuals and households.",

          "text": "Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN), the Federal Ministry of Environment and the British High Commission have jointly launched an updated version of the Nigeria Energy Calculator 2050 (NECAL 2050) to tackle climate change.\n\nAccording to a statement issued yesterday by the British High Commission in Abuja, this makes Nigeria the first country in Africa to perform such feat, stressing that it is an energy and emissions model to assist Nigeria in achieving its climate goals.\n\nPresent at the event in Abuja yesterday were Catriona Laing, British High Commissioner to Nigeria; Sharon Ikeazor, Minister of State for Environment; Pauline Tallen, Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development; Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Prof. Eli. Jidere Bala, the director-general/ CEO Energy Commission of Nigeria, and various stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe update, the first in Africa, was delivered under the UK Government\u2019s international 2050 Calculator programme, which is funded by the UK\u2019s International Climate Finance, and was led by global engineering, management and development consultancy Mott MacDonald, and a consortium which includes Imperial College, Climact and Ricardo,\u201d the statement said.\n\nAt the event minister of science, technology and innovation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, said, \u201cThis is an energy planning tool that enables choices in energy development pathway to be examined, along with its environmental consequences. The NECAL2050 model should form part of our national energy planning tools. This will be used in planning energy needs for Nigeria\u2019s Vision 2050 and beyond. This will reflect Nigeria\u2019s commitment to cleaner and more sustainable energy utilisation.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe present version of the NECAL 2050 Calculator \u2013 a tool that allows users to trial different options for reducing emissions at a faster rate and to build a pathway that meets long-term emission targets to 2050 \u2013 is designed to help industries and the energy sector to set their greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, as well as to identify realistic solutions which support the implementation of Nigeria\u2019s climate commitments, also known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).\n\nThe British high commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing in her remarks said, \u201cThe launch of the Nigeria Energy Calculator 2050 further strengthens bilateral collaboration between the UK and Nigeria on the clean energy transition. Nigeria\u2019s energy sector accounts for 60 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions and the sector is also key to the delivery of Nigeria\u2019s many development priorities; it is therefore critical to understand the options that are available to reduce emissions while matching energy supply and demand.\n\n\u201cI look forward to seeing the NECAL2050 tool supporting different sectors of government to design and deliver high-quality policies that enhance the conditions for strong governance, growth, job creation and poverty reduction.\u201d\n\nAlso, minister of state for environment, Sharon Ikeazor, said, \u201cThe ministry as the national coordinating body of climate activities will leverage on this tool for policy and decision making for the implementation of Nigeria\u2019s long-term strategy for climate change under the Paris Agreement, as well as identify realistic solutions towards supporting the implementation of Nigeria\u2019s NDCs.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has inaugurated the new Terminal Building of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos.\n\nThe terminal has sixty-six check-in-counters, sixteen Immigration desks at arrival, twenty-eight Immigration desks at departure, and eight security screening points, among others.\n\nBuhari said it would go a long way in contributing to the socio-political and economic prosperity of the country,\n\nHe said the completion and delivery of five brand new international airport terminals since 2015, which were at 11% completion level then, aligns perfectly with the Aviation Roadmap.\n\nThe road map was developed in 2016, for the purposes of establishing critical infrastructure, including a National Carrier as well as maintenance, repairs and overhaul centre, and improved Airports Terminals through concession.\n\nThe President described as unprecedented the administration\u2019s investments in inter-state rail connectivity, road networks, agriculture, power and telecommunications.\n\nThis was done despite limitations in resources.\n\nHe the robust initiatives have been complemented with specific fiscal policies to drive aviation infrastructure renaissance.\n\n\u2018\u2018These include the designation of 4 airports, namely Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt as Free Trade Zones, in which customs duty is not applicable; removal of VAT on all forms of shared transportation, including air transportation; and exemption of commercial aircraft and spare parts from VAT payment.\n\n\u2018\u2018Similar projects at both the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport and Port Harcourt International Airport were completed and commissioned by this administration and our people have since been benefiting from the positive economic impacts of those magnificent terminals.\n\n\u2018\u2018The one in Kano has also been completed, and will be commissioned soon, while work continues apace to complete that of Enugu shortly,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe added that the improvement in Lagos terminal would increase airport operations and management services to about 14 million passengers per annum, create 3,000 direct and indirect jobs, increase inflow of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) and exponential growth in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nHe thanked the Government and People of the Republic of China, through the China Export-Import Bank and CCECC Nigeria Limited, (FAAN), for their commitment and support towards the completion of the project.\n\nThe President also commended the Federal Ministry of Aviation and its agencies, particularly, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, for working assiduously towards the realization of the project.\n\n\u2018\u2018With the delivery of this project, a new era of safety, security, and comfort has been ushered into the Nigerian aviation industry, and I am persuaded that it will get better with the passage of time,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe Governor of Lagos State Babajide Sanwo-Olu said it was instructive that Lagos State in one day had witnessed the evolution of three major infrastructure development projects that will change the Nigerian landscape while commending President Buhari for the infrastructural renewal and redevelopment necessary for a city like Lagos.\n\nHe lauded the private sector in the aviation industry for their continued contributions to the growth of the country despite the challenges.\n\nThe Governor informed the gathering that Lagos State Government was forming a partnership with FAAN towards ensuring that the new international terminal enjoys easy access which would be achieved by creating a bypass, the Airport \u2013 Alimosho Bypass Project, to create an alternative route to the airport.\n\nThe signing of the agreement for the partnership was later done by the officials of the Lagos State Government and FAAN.\n\nIn his remarks, Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika said aviation is the worldwide rapid transportation network that facilitates international trade, commerce and tourism, the only medium for achieving continental integration and interaction towards achieving the AU Agenda 2063.\n\nHe commended the administration of President Buhari for efforts towards resolving the problems inherited in the aviation industry in 2015 such as lack of professionalism, scarcity of foreign exchange, obsolete equipment, poor facilities, blocked funds for airlines among others, adding that more still needed to be done.\n\nThe Minister said the airport concession project including the new terminals has reached an advanced stage with the Ministry issuing requests for shortlisted firms before the end of March.\n\nAccording to the Minister, a study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) on Nigeria in 2020, \u201cshowed that the sector created 241,000 jobs, direct and indirect, and contributed $1.7billion to the economy,\u201d with a hope to grow the contribution of the sector from the current 0.68% to 5% or approximately $14.16billion.\n\nSenator Sirika gave assurances that the new terminal will be linked to the railway system.",

And once these things begin to happen, there is bound to be a problem.\n\n\u201cBut Chief Willie Obiano is not that kind of man. I do not see him as that kind of man who will want to interfere.\n\n\u201cHe is a gentleman, an honourable man, and I give it to him. I mentioned him even in my inaugural speech, he is a man who stands by his words,\u201d Soludo said.\n\nThere have been insinuations that the governor, Prof. Soludo may have already fallen apart with his predecessor but Soludo in the programme rather praised Obiano for his forthrightness, and unwavering tenacity in standing by him, after they both accepted to work together, during Obiano\u2019s reelection bid, while also working for his (Soludo\u2019s) election last year.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has commissioned the Dangote Fertiliser Plant in the Ibeju-Lekki area of Lagos.\n\nHe inaugurated the multi-billion dollar facility on Tuesday at an event well attended by many political, traditional, and religious leaders, as well as key members of the private sector from various parts of the country.\n\nThey include the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; Chairman of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Kayode Fayemi; as well as members of the forum including Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Darius Ishaku (Taraba), and Badaru Abubakar (Jigawa).\n\nRead Also: President Buhari Commissions New Airport Terminal In Lagos\n\nPresident of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote; Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations, Mrs Amina Mohammed; the Vice-Chairman of Channels Media Group, Mrs Olusola Momoh; Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele; as well as former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, were among the dignitaries present at the event.\n\nPresident Buhari inaugurated the facility as part of activities lined up for his working visit to Lagos. He was also billed to inaugurate the newly built terminal at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, as well as inspect the ongoing construction at the Dangote Refinery and the Lekki Deep Sea Port.\n\nThe Dangote Fertiliser Plant is Africa\u2019s largest granulated urea fertiliser complex. It occupies 500 hectares of land in the Lekki Free Trade Zone and was built at about $2.5 billion.\n\nIt is expected to help Nigeria retain $125 million in import substitution and provide $625 million from exports of products from the fertiliser plant.\n\nWhile Nigeria is estimated to need about five to seven million metric tonnes of fertiliser per annum amid its current level of fertiliser consumption which is 1.5 million metric tonnes, the Dangote fertiliser complex was established to produce three million metric tonnes of urea fertiliser per annum in its first phase.\n\nIn the course of its construction, the complex is said to have provided about 5,000 direct and indirect jobs in all categories, an additional 5,000 jobs within the community, as well as created 500 permanent jobs.\n\nSecured Future\n\nIn his speech before commissioning the facility, President Buhari was delighted that the plant would further advance his administration\u2019s drive towards achieving self-sufficiency in food production in the country.\n\n\u201cI commend the Chairman, Board, and Management of Dangote Industries Limited for their business initiative in building this plant to reduce our dependence on importation of fertiliser, create jobs on a massive scale, increase the inflow of foreign exchange and accelerate economic growth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis new plant is a testament to the widely acknowledged patriotism of Aliko Dangote and the leadership of Dangote Industries Limited. It also demonstrates their commitment to the socio-economic development of our country and the wellbeing of our people.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\u201cI am confident that the investment in this plant will replicate the group\u2019s earlier exploit in the cement sector where Dangote Cement holds the enviable record as our continent\u2019s largest cement producer with footprints in 10 other African countries. The group\u2019s investment in integrated cement plants, spanning the value chain from quarry to bagging has effectively ended Nigeria\u2019s dependence on imported cement products.\u201d\n\nAccording to the President, Dangote Industries Limited, along with several other subsidiaries, has created thousands of jobs across the country.\n\nHe described the company as the second biggest employer of labour in Nigeria after the Federal Government, stressing the importance of job creation by private sector operators to national security.\n\nRise Of Agropreneurs\n\nNigeria, President Buhari stated, also stands to gain extensively in earnings of foreign exchange from the excess production and export from the plant.\n\n\u201cI am informed that you have already started exporting to other countries, including the United States, India, and Brazil,\u201d he said. \u201cThe coming on stream of the plant is creating huge opportunities in the areas of job creation, trade, warehousing, transport, and logistics.\n\n\u201cThis will create significant wealth, reduce poverty, and help in securing the future of our nation. In the agriculture sector, another focal point of our economic policy, we expect a boom as fertiliser is now readily available in greater quantities and better quality.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians who hitherto practised subsistence farming because of the inability of necessary inputs can now take up agriculture as a business. We expect the rise of a new breed of agro-preneurs who will add value to farming and make the nation self-sufficient in food production.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari assured Nigerians that his government would remain focused on providing an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive.\n\nHe also promised that they would continue to improve on infrastructure, power, and security, as well as enact relevant laws and regulations that would drive investment in the economy.\n\nTackling Youth Restiveness\n\nIn his speech, the President of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, believes the plant will make Nigeria self-sufficient in fertiliser production, with excess capacity to export to other African markets and the rest of the world.\n\nHe described its commissioning as very historic, saying it is the largest granulated urea plant in Africa and the second-largest in the world.\n\nAfrica\u2019s richest businessman hinted that the plant would help Nigeria retain about $125 million in import substitution and provide $625 million from exports of its products.\n\n\u201cIt is an ambitious developmental project which will drastically reduce the level of unemployment and youth restiveness in this country, through the direct and indirect employment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make fertiliser available in sufficient quantities and quality for our teeming farmers in achieving greater agricultural outputs and to help realise this potential, we are rolling out initiatives that will transform the agriculture sector including services for all small and medium-scale farmers.\u201d\n\nDangote informed the audience at the event that the plant has established well-equipped soil testing laboratories to ensure appropriate fertiliser blends were applied to specific soil and crop types.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday commissioned a new terminal at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos.\n\nThe new MMIA Terminal is expected to handle 20 million passengers a year.\n\nIt comprises of a four-storey Main Terminal Building, three-storey Finger Building, two-storey Cargo Terminal Building, 82,925sqm apron, and external and ancillary works.\n\nThe terminal also has about 60 sets of check-in counters and six boarding bridges.\n\n3,000 jobs\n\nThe terminal is one of five being built in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Kano and Enugu, in a bilateral arrangement between the Nigeria and China.\n\nThe ones in Abuja and Port Harcourt have been completed and commissioned already, while that of Kano has been completed and will soon be commissioned.\n\nThe new terminal is built on a land mass of approximately 56,000 square metres.\n\nOther facilities in the terminal include five baggage collection carousels, 16 Immigration desks at arrival, 28 Immigration desks at departure, eight security screening points, two food courts, four premium lounges, 22 guest rooms and spa, 16 airline ticketing offices, visa on arrival and port health facility, as well as praying area, more than 3,000 square metres of duty free space, approximately 5,000 square metres of lettable utility space, amongst others.\n\nThe new terminal is expected to generate about 3,000 direct and indirect employment for Nigerians, as well as enhance passenger facilitation and comfort at the Lagos airport.\n\nThe Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria will also sign a memorandum of understanding with the Lagos State Government on the 9km Airport-Shasha-Alimosho link Road to be constructed by the State Government.\n\n\u2018World class infrastructure\u2019\n\n\u201cIt is with great pleasure that I am here today to perform the official commissioning of the newly constructed terminal building at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Lagos,\u201d the President said at the terminal commissioning on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis event is an eloquent testimony to the strong commitment of our administration to the development of world class infrastructure across all sectors of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cOur continuous investment in the building of long-lasting infrastructure in the aviation sector, road and rail transportation, agriculture, telecommunications and other critical sectors is yielding massive results and the people of Nigeria are now increasingly attesting to the benefitting from the associated dividends.\n\n\u201cStarting from the year 2015 when we commenced our first tenure in office as government, we have been deliberate and consistent in identifying and investing in critical projects that will improve the standards of living of our people as well as contribute immensely to our growth and development as a nation.\n\n\u201cDespite obvious limitations in terms of availability of resources, our investments in inter-state road connectivity, rail networks, agriculture, power and telecommunication just to mention a few have been unprecedented.\n\n\u201cBearing in mind the importance of airport infrastructure as a catalyst for economic growth, foreign direct investment and development globally, this administration decided to prioritise the completion and delivery of five brand new international terminals which were at 11 percent completion level when we came into power in 2015. This aligns perfectly with our aviation roadmap which was developed in 2016 for the purposes of establishing critical infrastructure including a national carrier, maintenance, repairs and overhaul centre and improved airport terminals through concession to boost aviation practice and take the industry to the next level reflecting global standards.\n\n\u201cWe have also complemented these robust initiatives with specific fiscal policies to drive aviation infrastructure renaissance. This include the designation of four airports name Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt as free trade zones in which Customs duty does is not applied. Removal of VAT on all forms of shared transportation including air transportation and exemption of commercial aircraft and spare parts from VAT payment. Similar projects at both Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport and Port Harcourt International Airport were completed and commissioned by this administration and our people have since been benefitting from the positive economic impact of these magnificent terminals. The one in Kano has also been completed and will be commissioned soon while work continues to complete that of Enugu shortly. I therefore congratulate all Nigerians on the successful completion and commissioning of the terminal building of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Lagos, our premier airport.\u201d",

          "text": "Civilians making the dangerous escape from Ukraine\u2019s embattled southern port hub of Mariupol described fleeing through street-to-street gun battles and past unburied corpses as a steady Russian bombardment tried to pound the city into submission.\n\nWhile Russian forces carried on with the siege after the city\u2019s defenders refused demands to surrender, the Kremlin\u2019s ground offensives in other parts of the country were advancing slowly or not at all, knocked back by lethal hit-and-run attacks by the Ukrainians.\n\nThe Ukrainian army said early Tuesday that it had forced Russian troops out of a strategically important Kyiv suburb following a fierce battle. The regained territory allowed Ukrainian forces to retake control of a key highway to the west and block Russian troops from surrounding Kyiv from the northwest.\n\nBut Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said Russian forces battlinBut Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said Russian forces battling toward Kyiv were able to partially take other northwest suburbs, Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, some of which had been under attack almost since Russia\u2019s military invaded late last month.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces are increasingly concentrating their air power and artillery on Ukraine\u2019s cities and the civilians living there, killing uncounted numbers and sending millions fleeing.\n\nA senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the military\u2019s assessment, said Russia had increased air sorties over the past two days, carrying out as many as 300 in the past 24 hours, and has fired more than 1,100 missiles into Ukraine since the invasion began.\n\nIn a video address Monday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed those who have fought back against Russia.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to organize resistance,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cResistance for Ukrainians is part of their soul.\u201d\n\nIn Mariupol, with communications crippled, movement restricted and many residents in hiding, the fate of those inside an art school flattened on Sunday and a theater that was blown apart four days earlier was unclear. More than 1,300 people were believed to be sheltering in the theater, and 400 were estimated to have been in the art school.\n\nPerched on the Sea of Azov, Mariupol has been a key target that has been besieged for more than three weeks and has seen some of the worst suffering of the war.\n\nBut no clear, independent picture emerged of how close its capture might be. Ukraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that their forces were still defending the city and had destroyed a Russian patrol boat and electronic warfare complex.\n\nRussia for now controls the land corridor from Crimea, the peninsula it annexed in 2014, and is blocking Ukraine\u2019s access to the Sea of Azov, the ministry said.\n\n\u201cNobody can tell from the outside if it really is on the verge of being taken,\u201d said Keir Giles, a Russia expert at the British think tank Chatham House.\n\nOver the weekend, Moscow had offered safe passage out of Mariupol \u2014 one corridor leading east to Russia, another going west to other parts of Ukraine \u2014 in return for the city\u2019s surrender before daybreak Monday. Ukraine flatly rejected the offer well before the deadline.\n\nMariupol officials said on March 15 that at least 2,300 people had died in the siege, with some buried in mass graves. There has been no official estimate since then, but the number is feared to be far higher after six more days of bombardment.\n\nFor those who remain, conditions have become brutal. The assault has cut off Mariupol\u2019s electricity, water and food supplies and severed communication with the outside world, plunging residents into a fight for survival. Fresh commercial satellite images showed smoke rising from buildings newly hit by Russian artillery.\n\nMariupol had a prewar population of about 430,000. Around a quarter were believed to have left in the opening days of the war, and tens of thousands escaped over the past week by way of the humanitarian corridors. Other attempts have been thwarted by the fighting.\n\nThose who have made it out of Mariupol told of a devastated city.\n\n\u201cThere are no buildings there anymore,\u201d said 77-year-old Maria Fiodorova, who crossed the border to Poland on Monday after five days of travel.\n\nOlga Nikitina, who fled Mariupol for the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, where she arrived Sunday, said gunfire blew out her windows, and her apartment dropped below freezing.\n\n\u201cBattles took place over every street. Every house became a target,\u201d she said.\n\nA long line of vehicles stood on a road in Bezimenne as Mariupol residents sought shelter at a temporary camp set up by Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk region. An estimated 5,000 people from Mariupol have taken refuge in the camp. Many arrived in cars with signs that said \u201cchildren\u201d in Russian.\n\nA woman who gave her name as Yulia said she and her family sought shelter in Bezimenne after a bombing destroyed six houses behind her home.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we got in the car, at our own risk, and left in 15 minutes because everything is destroyed there, dead bodies are lying around,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t let us pass through everywhere \u2014 there are shootings.\u201d\n\nIn all, more than 8,000 people escaped to safer areas Monday through humanitarian corridors, including about 3,000 from Mariupol, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.\n\nRussian shelling of a corridor wounded four children on a route leading out of Mariupol, Zelenskyy said.\n\nElsewhere, Britain\u2019s defense ministry said Ukrainian resistance has kept the bulk of Moscow\u2019s forces more than 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the center of Kyiv, but the capital \u201cremains Russia\u2019s primary military objective.\u201d\n\nIn the Russian-occupied southern city of Kherson on Monday, Russian forces shot into the air and fired stun grenades at protestors who were chanting \u201cGo home!\u201d Kherson early this month became the first major city to fall to Russia\u2019s offensive.\n\nUkrainian authorities also said Russia shelled a chemical plant outside the eastern city of Sumy, sending toxic ammonia leaking from a 50-ton tank, and hit a military training base in the Rivne region of western Ukraine with cruise missiles.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion has driven nearly 3.5 million people from Ukraine, according to the United Nations. The U.N. has confirmed over 900 civilian deaths but said the real toll is probably much higher. Estimates of Russian deaths vary, but even conservative figures are in the low thousands.\n\nTalks between Russia and Ukraine have continued by video but failed to bridge the chasm between the two sides. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine disarm and declare itself neutral. Zelenskyy told Ukrainian television late Monday that he would be prepared to consider waiving any NATO bid by Ukraine in exchange for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Russian troops and a guarantee of Ukraine\u2019s security.\n\nZelenskyy also suggested Kyiv would be open to future discussions on the status of Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014, and the regions of the eastern Donbas region held by Russian-backed separatists. But he said that was a topic for another time, after a cease-fire and steps toward security guarantees.\n\n___\n\nAP",
