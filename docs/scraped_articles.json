          "title": "All not well at Maritime varsity, VC admits",
          "text": "The Vice-Chancellor of Nigeria Maritime University, Okerenkoko in Gbaramatu, Warri South-West Local Government Area of Delta State, Prof. Emmanuel Adigio, has admitted that all is not well at the institution but reaffirmed commitments in tackling some of the major challenges confronting the University in the new year.\n\nThe VC maintained that it would be insensitive on his part to claim that all is well in the University when, according to him, there are \u201cobvious challenges facing it, as the inconveniences both the staff and students are currently passing through are synonymous with newly established institutions in the country until they are fully stabilized.\u201d\n\nAdigio lamented the plights of some staff in terms of cost of transportation to work, inadequate accommodation and unsettled end of year bonus, but assured that all the problems are surmountable if they can all join hands together to find lasting solutions to them.\n\nWhile soliciting the patience and understanding of both staff and students of the University in the collective efforts to build a solid institution, the Vice-Chancellor denied knowledge of any N3billion reportedly released to the University by Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency for payment of allowances.\n\nMaking the assertions while speaking with journalists in Warri, Delta State, the Vice-Chancellor insisted that the University had no record of such money, noting that the monitoring of funds made available to federal government establishments by the anti-graft agencies in the country has made it very difficult to divert funds meant for a particular project in any institution.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor declared, \u201cOn the issue of N3billion said to have been released by NIMASA, no such money was sent down here. You see, the way funds are being monitored in the country today, you cannot misappropriate funds again.\n\n\u201cIf you divert any fund meant for a particular project on something else, then you are inviting trouble to yourself as the officials of the Anti-graft agencies are monitoring such funds. So if I\u2019ve diverted such huge funds, by now they would have come after me.\n\n\u201cPermit me, therefore, to set the record straight that at no time was such money released for the settlement of allowances by NIMASA. So the issue of the N3billion you raised is unfounded.\n\n\u201cIf such money had been released to this institution, I think I would be most excited and I\u2019m sure everybody would have been smiling by now. But as far as such fund is concerned, it was not released to us.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The government came into power with several promises including that of revamping of the railways, job creation, ending terrorism among others and today we are enjoying the fulfillment of these Promises\u2019\u2019. Hon. Obidike said that it was important to look back and take stock.\n\nHe commended the Buhari administration and charged Nigerians to keep faith with the APC leadership and 2022 will usher in more beautiful opportunities especially as the president has signed the 2022 appropriation bill into law.

Many attribute this to the prevailing political differences in the state. These arrested and kidnapped young men are said to be held in concentration camp conditions\u201d.\n\nContinuing, the Igbo leaders pointed out that the state of affairs in Imo is largely blamed on a few politicians of the state and their cohorts which have constituted an assault on the dignity and well being of the people of Imo and the Igbo nation.\n\nThe leaders also urged all the political leaders in contestations and their followers to cease and desist from all actions that will escalate or compound the situation in the state while calling for an examination of the conscience of the actors in Imo state, FCT, Abuja, or elsewhere.\n\n: \u201cWe trust that Igbo spirit, which guided our intervention in the run-up to the recent Anambra state Governorship election and resulted in peaceful and salutary outcomes, will lead the key antagonists in Imo state politics to collaborate with us to help reconstruct the social order in the state to greater civility.\n\n\u201cTo pursue one\u2019s political interest to the detriment of the interest of the people that seek to serve violates the essence of the Igbo way and good leadership. As such we call on all the political gladiators, requesting that they note that the ethos of ndigbo is stepped in \u2018egbe belu Ugo ebelu\u2019. We know what fate is cast on the one that does not allow the other to perch\u201d.",

          "text": "Abia State Governor Victor Ikpeazu has said the Southeast is the most qualified zone to produce the next President in 2023.\n\nHe argued that if the principles of justice and equity were applied by all political parties, including the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP), the Southeast deserved the presidential slot.\n\nIkpeazu added that no other tribe in Nigeria has demonstrated practical belief in the Nigerian nation than the Igbo \u201cas can be seen from the fact that our people live and invest heavily in every part of the country.\u201d.\n\nHe spoke when former Senate President Anyim Pius Anyim visited his country home in Umuobiakwa, Obingwa Local Government Area at the weekend to inform him of his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe governor, who also hosted his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike, told Anyim that he was fully in support of a President of Southeast extraction. He stated that all the Igbo were asking was to be given a chance to produce President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe, therefore, assured Anyim, who is a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation(SGF), of his support, going by his public service credentials and experience.\n\n\u201cIn the Southeast and indeed across the country the credentials of Senator Anyim stand very tall,\u201d Ikpeazu said.\n\nThe former SGF had called for the support of Ikpeazu and PDP in Abia State, assuring that he would be a candidate and a president that Nigeria would be proud of.\n\n\u201dI decided to make myself available to contest this presidential seat \u201cafter a careful analysis of my antecedents, experience, passion, and wide contacts across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nAnyim was accompanied on the visit by a member of the House of Representatives, Livinus Makwe;\n\nformer Deputy Governor Eric Acho Nwakanma; Darlington Nwokocha , Chimaobi Ebisike, Solomon Akpulonu, Kennedy Njoku, Thomas Nkoro, Nnamdi Nwachukwu, Uzodike Aaron and Asiforo Okere.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Ikpeazu, and Wike restated the need for the PDP to forge a united front to rescue Nigeria.\n\nThey argued that a united PDP was critical to the survival of Nigeria.\n\nIkpeazu described Wike as a courageous and patriotic leader, who is committed to the unity of the nation.\n\nHe described the visit by Wike and PDP stakeholders in Rivers State as a fresh start of a relationship between the two states.\n\nThe governor hoped that 2022 would bring forth good tidings for the people of the two states and for \u201cour country, Nigeria\u201d\n\nEarlier, Wike had stated that he was on a New Year\u2019s visit to Abia State to show appreciation to Ikpeazu for being a true friend and brother.\n\nHe described Ikpeazu as a man of character whose contributions have assisted the party to resolve controversial issues.\n\nWike said that he cherished the \u201cdeep and very strong personal relationship\u201d he shared with his Abia State counterpart.\n\nThe governor, who lamented that Nigeria was at a crossroads because of worsening insecurity, challenged the PDP to rise to the occasion by joining forces to take over power from the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023.\n\nWike was accompanied on the visit by a former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Chidubem Nwuche; the state House of Assembly members, chairmen of Local Government Areas in the state, chairmen of the PDP in some LGAs, as well as former members of the National Assembly and State House of Assembly.\n\n* PDP in for shocker in 2023, says Ngige\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment Chris Ngige has said that the APC will shock the PDP in 2023.\n\nHe also said the ruling party will honour its zoning agreement in choosing the 2023 presidential candidate.\n\nNgige, who pointed out that zoning was an unwritten agreement among politicians in the country, stated that the APC was expected to zone its presidential slot to the South.\n\nHe added that since the dominant mood in the country was for a Southerner to succeed Buhari, the APC was already tilting towards that direction.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe expect that our national chairman this time around will come from the North and our presidential candidate will come from the South. It will be left for Southerners to decide the zone it will go among Southeast, Southsouth, and Southwest. For equity and moral ground, the Southeast should, being the only one among the three zones in the South, yet to produce the president since 1999.\u201d\n\nNgige alleged that the PDP leadership was planning to choose a Northerner as its candidate, adding that Nigerians will shock the party (PDP) if it does that.\n\nThe minister told journalists in Anambra State that, as a former PDP member and its founding member, he was aware the PDP constitution supports the rotation of political offices between the North and South.\n\nNgige said: \u201dTheir top apparatchik thinks they are smart. They want to play a fast one. They are waiting for APC to say South. Their calculation is that when that happens, they will go North. Number one, that will be an act of bad faith because it will mean that they have taken the people in the Southsouth and Southeast that have all along supported PDP 90 percent in all the elections, for a ride.\n\n\u201cThe PDP will be shocked the way the Southeast, the Southsouth, and minorities, in fact, Nigerians as a whole will revolt.\n\n\u201cI was a founding member of the PDP. I was in its National Executive Committee as the Assistant National Secretary, Southeast, and served in many strategic standing committees. I was elected governor on the platform of the PDP. I know that the constitution of the PDP is clear on the rotation of power and zoning of offices between the North and South.\n\n\u201cSo, if they are waiting for our party (APC) to choose a Southern candidate so they can quickly turn and present a Northern candidate at a point the dominant mood in the country is for power to shift to the South, then, they are deceiving themselves. Nigerians will shock them.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ngige, even the country\u2019s constitution tacitly supports zoning and power rotation as it ensures no particular tribe or region dominates others unnecessarily.",

          "text": "A strange succession crisis has hit Ibadanland, following the passage of the Olubadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji.\n\nAlthough the next-in-line to the throne, the Otun Olubadan, High Chief Lekan Balogun, is perceived as the natural successor, former Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice Michael Lana has written to Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde not to approve his appointment, if selected by the Olubadan-In-Council.\n\nLana, who is counsel to Osi-Olubadan, Senator Rashidi Ladoja, said since Balogun has been elevated to an Oba and received a crown, he should not be installed as Olubadan.\n\nThe Olubadan-In-Council is divided as Ladoja, a former governor of the state, is believed to have opposed Balogun as successor.\n\nHowever, the kingmakers have declared at a meeting that they would follow the tradition in naming the next Olubadan, regardless of their elevation to obas.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nLana, who is counsel to Ladoja in his suit against elevation of high chiefs to obas in 2017, warned Makinde against the \u2018dangers\u2019 of approving Balogun as the next Olubadan.\n\nLadoja, who ranks next to Balogun on the Olubadan line to the throne, was the only chief who did not receive a beaded crown as oba.\n\nHe challenged the elevation in court and won, but Balogun, along with his elevated colleagues, challenged the judgment, which is still pending in court.\n\nLana, in the January 3, 2022 letter, reminded the governor that except Balogun withdraws his suit challenging the nullification of their elevation, he is not entitled to the throne of Olubadan.\n\nHe argued that nowhere in the 1957 Olubadan Chieftaincy Declaration is it stated that an already beaded crown-wearing oba can be enthroned for the second time as the Olubadan.\n\nHe stressed that approving Balogun while still holding on to the title of an oba, may create the ground for legal battles, which are alien to the Olubadan throne.\n\nShould Balogun be disqualified, Ladoja may be the next Olubadan as he is next-in-line on the Olubadan line, which is to produce the next Olubadan.\n\nLana\u2019s letter entitled: \u201cRe: Installation of A New Olubadan of Ibadanland, reads: \u201cMay I firstly, commiserate with you on the demise of His Royal Majesty, Oba Saliu Adetunji, Aje Ogunguniso I. the Olubadan of Ibadanland. May his soul rest in peace\n\nSecondly, may l humbly draw your attention to a traditional aberration and illegality that may occur in an attempt to install another Olubadan of Ibadanland, in view of the existence of Suit No./22/2020 HRM Oba (Senator) Lekan Balogun & ORS versus Governor of Oyo State & ORS\n\n\u201cKindly note, Your Excellency, that your predecessor in office, without thinking of the legal effects of his actions on the future of Ibadan traditional institution, conferred the title of obaship on some high chiefs and baales and gave them the right to wear beaded crowns and coronets in 2017. This action was challenged in Suit No. M317/2017 by High Chief Rashidi Ladoja, the former Governor of Oyo State. The High Court Judge, Aiki, nullified the said conferment, which was actually a total contravention of both the Chiefs Law and the Ibadan Chieftaincy Customary Law.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Court of Appeal, in Appeal No. CA/1B/99/2018, set aside the said judgment of Aiki on technical grounds without touching on the merit of the case and sent the case back for retrial.\n\n\u201cUpon Your Excellency\u2019s assumption of office, it was resolved that the matter be settled amicably and same was settled through the instrumentality of a Terms of Settlement, which became the judgment of the court. The said Terms of Settlement recognised the illegality of the said actions and therefore, set aside the Gazettes by which the said chiefs became obas with a right to wear beaded crowns and coronets.\n\n\u201cThese high chiefs and baales were dissatisfied with this consent judgment and therefore, instituted two separate suits to set aside the consent judgment while at the same time clinging to the title of obas, which actually is in contempt of court.\n\nOne of these cases is Suit No.1/22/2020 \u2013 HRM\n\nOba (Senator) Lekan Balogun & ORS versus Governor of Oyo State & ORS.\n\nNow, may I draw, Your Excellency\u2019s attention to the fact that in committing this aberration, which changed the Ibadan chieftaincy customary law, the Olubadan Chieftaincy Declaration of 1957 was not amended and therefore, remians extant. Under that declaration and all relevant laws, no oba can ascend to the throne of Olubadan. In other words, as long as the high chiefs still cling to the title of oba, they cannot ascend to that throne and any installation of any of them during the pendency of that suit, is illegal, null and void.\n\n\u201cIn the entire history of Ibadanland, we have never had such a situation where the legality or otherwise of the installation of the Olubadan would be an issue and this was what your predecessor did not take into consideration before venturing into an illegal journey. Ibadan chieftaincy elevation had always been smooth and without any rancour to the envy of all other towns. It is in line with this legal situation that I most humbly advise that you should withhold any approval of any high chief to become the Olubadan so that you will not also join in the desecration of Ibadan chieftaincy customary law.\n\n\u201cThere are only two ways to deal with this situation: one is for the high chiefs to withdraw the aforementioned cases and the other is to wait for the Court to pronounce on it before any step is taken to install an Olubadan. If the court holds that they have the right to be Obas and entitled to wear beaded crowns, then, they are perpetually barred from becoming another oba. Nowhere in the customary law of any Yoruba town is an oba elevated to become another oba.\n\n\u201cIf on the other hand, the court holds that the Terms of Settlement stands, and their obaship title is illegal, then, they are free to be elevated to the post of Olubadan. The ball, Your Excellency, is in their court.\n\n\u201cI wish you well as you consider, as an Ibadan man and as governor, your place in history.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Olubadan-In-Council maintained that it would follow tradition in naming the next Olubadan, despite their elevation to obas.\n\nAfter a two-hour closed-door meeting at the residence of the Otun Olubadan, Balogun, members of the council said they would meet and announce the next Olubadan in line with tradition after the mourning of Oba Adetunji is over.\n\nLadoja and two other members of the council were absent at the meeting, according to a source.\n\nThe statement by the council reads: \u201cFollowing the demise of the 41st Olubadan of Ibadanland, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso I, on Sunday, members of the Olubadan-in-Council on Monday condoled with the Governor of Oyo State, Engr. Oluseyi Makinde, the people of Ibadanland and family members of the late monarch.\n\n\u201cRising from a two-hour closed-door meeting held at the Alarere residence of Otun Olubadan and the would-be successor to the throne, Sen. Dr. Lekan Balogun, the Olubadan-in- Council described the deceased leader of the Council as an indefatigable ruler, whose reign would be difficult to forget.\n\n\u201cWhile praying for the repose of the soul of the departed king, the council urged the bereaved family of the deceased to remain joyous and happy for the legacies of good reign left behind by their patriarch.\n\n\u201cThe council reiterated that the historical and traditional succession plan to the throne of Olubadan remains sancrosanct, the elevation conferred on all the members of the Olubadan-in-Council as Royal Majesties notwithstanding.\n\n\u201cMembers of the council were elevated to the Royal Majesties status by the previous administration in the state, led by the late Governor Abiola Ajimobi, and it became contentious and litigatious\u201d.\n\nThe Olubadan-in-Council said the elevation granted its members, who also serve as kingmakers, had not in anyway altered the age-long and enviable traditional succession plan to the Olubadan throne.\n\nIt added: \u201cThere should be no controversy as to who becomes the next Olubadan amongst us as the previous elevation that made us Royal Majesties did not in anyway affect our respective offices in the Olubadan-in-Council and would not preclude any of us to mount the Olubadan throne whenever it is the person\u2019s turn.\n\n\u201cWe are the kingmakers and we will do the needful at the appropriate time. For now, we are still all in the mourning mood of our departed father and reverred leader in the Council and we just want to assure the generality of our people, both home and in the Diaspora, that there\u2019s no cause for alarm.\u201d",

We believe that, by coming on a quarterly basis to supervise them, we would ensure that before the end of this year, we will see the trains on top of the tracks. That is our commitment and we will begin to monitor and check ourselves.\n\n\u201cIt is a very iconic and landmark project that we are truly proud of. On behalf of the government, I want to commend all of our contractors because they are very committed. They have assured us that whatever it takes, they will complete all of the projects on schedule and on budget,\u201d the governor said.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu, who was accompanied by some of his cabinet members and heads of agencies, said the inspection tour to the blue and red line rail project stations was in regards to the promise made by his administration to monitor the pace of works in the areas on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe governor, who promised to intensify supervision and monitoring of the projects quarterly to facilitate speedy completion, also commended the contractors for keeping up with the timeline at the stations visited, considering improvements at the sites of the projects.\n\n\u201cWe embarked on this similar tour about three or four months ago and we did mention that we would be doing it every quarter so that we can see how far the constructions are going. As we all have seen, I am happy to report that the construction is going on according to schedule.

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nInter\u2013Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has commended the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari to withhold assent to the amended Electoral Act Bill due to the inclusion of compulsory direct primary for political parties.\n\nIPAC said the president was right in rejecting the bill, stressing that at this stage of democratic journey, Nigeria does not appear to be sufficiently ripe and prepared for the direct primary model in the selection of political party standard bearers.\n\nIPAC National Chairman, Yabagi Yusuf Sani, told newsmen at a press conference in Abuja, yesterday, that the decision of the president was taken in the interest of Nigerians, even though many refused to admit.\n\nHe said: \u201cIPAC is impressed with the lawmakers for the courage, commitment and patriotism exhibited in the passage of a bill that was widely applauded as groundbreaking and transformative in the annals of the nation\u2019s legislative chambers.\n\n\u201cLawmakers, this time, disregarded partisan differences in favour of superior national interest, and stood in a spirited battle in the course of democracy even in the face of intimidation and blackmail.\n\n\u201cThe only expressed grouse of the president was the mandatory use of direct primary in the selection of standard bearers of all the political parties. While many never concede to the explanations of security challenges with the other reasons given by the president, we won\u2019t disagree with him on the reason of complex logistics and huge financial burden that direct primary will imply for Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\n\u201cMany have canvassed the view that no amount of money should be considered too high in the efforts to sanitise the nation\u2019s electoral process and that the legislature should therefore, invoke its veto powers to overrule the president. Such action may be tantamount to a wholesale wrecking of the boat. It will result in fruitless exercise if at the end of the day, its implementation was not supported by the required funding by the executive.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cLawmakers may have acted as interlopers by trying to run political parties from the hallowed chambers because, objectively in the context of international practices primary cannot be legislated upon, and are best left to the discretion of the political parties. It\u2019s an attempt to usurp the constitutional rights of parties as to the method of choice of party standard bearers.\u201d\n\nIPAC, thus, submitted that the way out of the logjam was for the shifting of grounds by all parties for a compromise and amicable resolution that would result in a win-win scenario.\n\n\u201cThis should not be a difficult task given that the two arms are, incidentally, controlled by the same political party, the All Progressives Congress. Lawmakers should simply expunge the clauses regarding direct primary, thereby, saving the other provisions among which are the one on the mandatory electronic transmission of election results by INEC. By that, we believe the president should have no further reason to withhold his assent.\u201d\n\nIPAC also raised concerns over the flagrant abuse of the constitution regarding defection from one political party to another.\n\n\u201cConstitutional provision stipulate that elected officials can only legally change from one party to another while in office if a clear case of divisions or fictionalisation is perceived to exist in the party on whose platform he or she rode to the office in the first instance.\n\n\u201cMost incidences of defections in recent times, have occurred without the obvious existence of such situations. We must know that frivolous and wilful cross carpeting only exists in a parliamentary democracy and not in a presidential system of democracy that is extant in Nigeria.\u201d",

He was a great man, a quintessential democrat and outstanding statesman who has left very bold prints both on the politics and political history of Nigeria,\u201dthe governor said in the statement.\n\nChairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, described Tofa\u2019s death, as the exit of a political icon.\n\nThe ruling party boss and Yobe State governor equally condoled with the government and people of Kano State.\n\nIn a statement by Mamman Mohammed, director general, Press and Media Affairs to the party chairman, Buni said Nigeria lost the late politician at a time the country\u2019s democracy needed his wise counselling.\n\n\u201cHe was an iconic politician who shares the values of politics as a call to service, to promote good governance and to improve the lives of the electorate.\n\n\u201cTofa was a fine gentleman, a true democrat and a nationalist with a definition of politics as a tool for service delivery,\u201d Governor Buni said.\n\nHe prayed Allah to grant him eternal rest in Aljannatur Firdausi and to grant his family, associates and the people of Kano State the fortitude to bear the loss.\n\nIn his reaction, former Abia State governor, Dr. Kalu, described the death of Tofa as a huge loss to the country.\n\nWhile acknowledging the noble contributions of the late politician to nation-building through various platforms, he said the deceased was a statesman, philanthropist, and strong advocate of democracy.\n\nThe former governor conveyed his condolences to the government and people of Kano State, Emir of Kano and Kano Emirate Council over the irreplaceable loss.\n\nThe Senate chief whip prayed to Allah to forgive the shortcomings of the deceased and make al-Jannah Firdaus his final abode.\n\n\u201cI condoles with the government and people of Kano State over the passing of former presidential candidate of the National Republican Convention in the June 12, 1993 election, Tofa.

His demise is a huge blow to the political class and Nigeria in general. I urge the Tofa family to uphold the good deeds of their patriarch.\u201d\n\nKalu also conveyed his condolences to friends, associates and followers of the deceased.\n\nCNG\u2019s spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, in a statement, yesterday, said the group owes immeasurable gratitude to Tofa, whose leadership, sacrifice, statesmanship, patriotism and unwavering commitment to the interests of the people of northern Nigeria, and citizens of Nigeria, have few parallels.\n\n\u201cWe mourn the passing of this great man from whose life and works we have drawn inspiration and we must strive, in all we do, to live by the personal and social values and standards he lived and set for himself,\u201d he said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

Nigeria has lost an illustrious son, a consummate politician who was denied the opportunity to provide leadership with the annulment of the presidential elections In 1992.\n\n\u201cThe Forum lost a loyal founding member, a firm believer in responsible and visionary leadership.\n\n\u201cTofa was the embodiment of the best combination of private enterprise and unparalleled philanthropy.

Former President Goodluck Jonathan, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and former President of the Senate, Anyim Pius Anyim, commiserated with the people of Ibadan and the family of the 41st Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, who passed away on Sunday at the age of 93.\n\nA statement released at the end of a two-hour closed-door meeting held at the residence of Otun Olubadan of Ibadanland, High Chief Lekan Balogun, said members of the council would meet and announce the next Olubadan in line with tradition after the mourning period for Oba Saliu Adetunji.\n\nCuriously, the Osi Olubadan, High Chief Rasheed Ladoja, and two other members of the council were absent at the meeting.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cFollowing the demise of the 41st Olubadan of Ibadanland, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso 1, on Sunday, members of the Olubadan-in-Council on Monday condoled with the Governor of Oyo State, Engr. Oluseyi Makinde, the people of Ibadan land and family members of the late monarch.\n\n\u201cRising from a two-hour closed-door meeting held at the Alarere residence of Otun Olubadan and the would-be successor to the throne, Sen. Dr. Lekan Balogun, the Olubadan-in-Council described the deceased leader of the Council as an indefatigable ruler, whose reign would be difficult to forget.\n\n\u201cWhile praying for the repose of the soul of the departed king, the council urged the bereaved family of the deceased to remain joyous and happy for the legacies of good reign left behind by their patriarch.\n\n\u201cThe council reiterated that the historical and traditional succession plan to the throne of Olubadan remains sacrosanct, the elevation conferred on all the members of the Olubadan-in-Council as Royal Majesties notwithstanding.\n\n\u201cMembers of the council were elevated to the Royal Majesties status by the previous administration in the state led by the late Governor Abiola Ajimobi and it became contentious and litigatious.\n\n\u201cOlubadan-in-Council said the elevation granted the members, who also serve as kingmakers, had not in anyway altered the age-long and enviable traditional succession plan to the Olubadan throne in Ibadan land.\n\n\u201cThere should be no controversy as to who becomes the next Olubadan amongst us as the previous elevation that made us Royal Majesties did not in anyway affect our respective offices in the Olubadan-in-Council and would not preclude any of us to mount the Olubadan throne whenever it is the person\u2019s turn.\n\n\u201cWe are the kingmakers and we will do the needful at the appropriate time. For now, we are still all in the mourning mood of our departed father and revered leader in the Council and we just want to assure the generality of our people both home and in the diaspora that there\u2019s no cause for alarm.\u201d\n\nBut Lana, in a letter to Makinde and which was copied to the Oyo State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, claimed that approving the appointment of any of the High Chiefs and Baales would amount to an illegality, and would, therefore, be null and void.\n\nIn the letter dated January 3, Lana claimed that the Chieftaincy Declaration of 1957, which has not been set aside, forbade the elevation of an Oba to the position of Olubadan.\n\nThe seat of Olubadan became vacant on Saturday, January 1, 2022, following the death of His Royal Majesty, Oba llu Adetunji, Aje Ogunguniso 1, the Olubadan of Ibadanland.\n\nLana, in his letter to the governor, advised that the governor should withhold his approval of any of the High Chiefs or Baales as Olubadan to avoid involvement in the desecration of Ibadan Customary Chieftaincy Law.\n\nAccording to the lawyer, Makinde\u2019s predecessor had violated the Chieftaincy Law, when he, \u201cWithout thinking the legal effects of his actions on the future of Ibadan traditional institution, conferred the title of Obaship on some High Chiefs and Baales and gave them the right to wear beaded Crowns and coronets, in 2017.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the action of the former governor was challenged up to the Court of Appeal before the matter was resolved out of court.\n\nLana stated in the letter to Makinde, \u201cUpon Your Excellency\u2019s assumption of office, it was resolved that the matter be settled amicably and same was settled through the instrumentality of a Terms of Settlement, which became the judgement of the Court.\n\n\u201cThe said Terms of Settlement recognised the Illegality of the said actions and, therefore, set aside the Gazettes by which the said Chiefs became Obas with a right to wear beaded Crowns and coronets.\n\n\u201cThese High Chiefs and Baales were dissatisfied with this Consent Judgement and, therefore, instituted two separate suits to set aside the Consent Judgement while at the same time clinging to the title of Obas (which actually is in contempt of court).\u201d\n\nLana further pointed out that in committing this alleged aberration, which changed the Ibadan Chieftaincy customary law, the Olubadan Chieftaincy Declaration of 1957 was not amended and, therefore, remained extant.\n\nHe said, \u201cUnder that Declaration and all relevant laws, no Oba can ascend to the throne of Olubadan. In other words, as long as the High Chiefs still cling to the title of Oba, they cannot ascend to that throne and any installation of any of them during the pendency of that suit, is illegal, null and void.\u201d\n\nHe said in the entire history of Ibadanland, appointment of the Olubadan had never been an issue; hence, the governor should not do anything to make it so.\n\nAccording to Lana, \u201cIt is in line with this legal situation that I advise, most humbly, that you should withhold any approval of any High Chief to become the Olubadan so that you will not also join in the desecration of Ibadan Chieftaincy Customary law.\n\n\u201cThere are only two ways to deal with this situation: one is for the High Chiefs to withdraw the aforementioned cases and the other is to wait for the court to pronounce on it before any step is taken to install an Olubadan. If the court holds that they have the right to be Obas and entitled to wear beaded crowns, then they are perpetually barred from becoming another Oba.\n\n\u201cNowhere in the customary law of any Yoruba town is an Oba elevated to become another Oba. If, on the other hand, the court holds that the Terms of Settlement stands, and their obaship title is illegal, then they are free to be elevated to the post of Olubadan. The ball, your Excellency, is in their court.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Jonathan, while commiserating with the government and people of Oyo State, expressed sadness over the exit of the monarch, describing him as a renowned leader and king, who had the interest of his people at heart.\n\nHe said in a condolence message, \u201cOlubadan was a compassionate and sagacious traditional ruler, who served as a worthy custodian of the custom and culture of his people.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jonathan, the late monarch will continue to \u201cbe remembered for the way he channelled his wisdom and energy towards the growth and development of Ibadanland, serving as a sage and moral compass in his domain.\u201d\n\nThe former president noted that the late Olubadan would be missed, not only in Ibadanland, but across the country, because of his significant contributions to the growth of the society.\n\nSanwo-Olu, in his condolence message, said the late traditional ruler\u2019s service to the people of Ibadanland, Oyo State, and Nigeria as a whole, would remain his enduring legacy.\n\nSanwo-Olu, in the message issued yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, described Oba Adetunji\u2019s death as a great loss to the people of Ibadan and the traditional institution in Oyo State.\n\nThe governor urged the family, friends, and associates of the deceased as well as the entire people of Ibadan, whose interests the late monarch represented and worked tirelessly to protect during his lifetime, to work towards immortalising him.\n\nSanwo-Olu said in the message, \u201cOn behalf of the government and people of Lagos, I commiserate with my brother, the Oyo State Governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde, and the people of the ancient city of Ibadan, the deceased family, friends and associates on the transition of the 41st Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, who joined his forebears yesterday (January 1).\n\n\u201cThe death of Oba Adetunji is a great loss to the people of Ibadan and he will be greatly missed. He made lots of positive impact during his lifetime, contributing meaningfully to the growth and development of Ibadan, Oyo State, and Nigeria at large as a philanthropist, foremost music promoter, and, later, as a traditional ruler.\n\n\u201cOba Adetunji, as a first class traditional ruler, left a lasting legacy that the people of Ibadanland will continue to cherish. I pray that Almighty God be pleased with the soul of the late monarch and grant the royal family and the people of Ibadan the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.\u201d\n\nAnyim, on his part, said Oba Adetunji was a patriotic Nigerian, who was deeply committed to the peace, unity and development of the country.\n\nAnyim worded his commiseration, thus, \u201cI have received with sadness, news of the death of our highly respected traditional ruler, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Saliu Adetunji, the Olubadan of Ibadan. Let me convey to your Excellency, the family of His Royal Majesty, and the good people of Ibadan, my deepest condolences on this sad event.\n\n\u201cLate Oba Adetunji was a patriotic Nigerian, who was deeply committed to the peace, unity and development of our country. His nearly six years on the throne brought peace and great development to his kingdom and the entire Oyo State.\n\n\u201cHis demise will be greatly felt, as Oyo State and the country at large would miss his invaluable advice and wise counsel as the nation searches for solutions to her many challenges. I pray that the Lord will comfort his family and grant his soul eternal rest in His bosom.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He was buried in-between the graves of his parents at the Hajj Camp cemetery in Kano metropolis. He was aged 74 years.\n\nThe Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, and former governor of Kano State, Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau, were among prominent Nigerians that attended the funeral prayer.\n\nApart from the president, Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, and Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni were among those, who sent early tributes to the deceased.\n\nBuhari, while leading the nation in mourning Tofa, described him as a politician of note, who was also a promoter of Islamic culture and civilisation. The president described Tofa as a true nationalist that would be difficult to replace.\n\nThe president said regarding the former presidential candidate, \u201cHe was, till the end, a patriot to the core. He envisaged a better Nigeria for all. We pray that this dream and collective aspiration and necessary commitment will not go with him. We owe it to his memory and to the nation.\u201d\n\nHe Allah to repose his soul and grant fortitude to the bereaved family and friends, the Kano Emirate Council, as well as the government and people of Kano State to bear the loss.\n\nBuhari recalled that Tofa set up the Bureau for Islamic Propagation (BIP) in the mid-80s that helped to unite Muslim scholars in the northern states, narrowing the differences that characterised their relationships. The BIP also published books and newspapers.\n\nIn addition to his tributes, the president sent a four-man delegation to Kano with a condolence letter to Ganduje. The team was made up of Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Magashi (rtd), and Minister of Water Resources, Engineer Sulaiman Adamu. It was accompanied by Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media and Publicity), Garba Shehu, and Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris.\n\nIn a statement by the Kano State Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, and chief mourner, Ganduje recalled the sacrifices of Tofa, who started taking up leadership responsibilities at an early age, when he was elected councillor in Tofa community in his late 20s, and remained vibrant and dynamic up till the time of his death.\n\nHe said as a businessman, trader and philanthropist, Tofa touched the lives of many people, especially, the downtrodden, and expressed the belief that the legacies of the deceased would be approximated for posterity.\n\nGanduje stated in his tribute to Tofa,\n\n\u201cThe legacy of his political beliefs and triumphs will be important footnotes in the literature of Nigeria\u2019s government and politics for generations yet to come.\n\n\u201cHe was a great man, a quintessential democrat and outstanding statesman, who has left very lasting impressions both on the politics and political history of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe prayed the Almighty Allah to grant his soul Aljannah Firdausi and grant Tofa\u2019s family, friends, and associates the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.\n\nAtiku, in a press release by his media office in Abuja, described the late Tofa as a thoroughbred democrat, whose contributions to the growth of democratic governance in Nigeria is invaluable.\n\nThe former vice president noted that throughout his political career, Tofa was a politician, who believed in the power of ideas and ideologies and was never associated with political violence or any other anti-democratic behaviour.\n\nThe Waziri Adamawa was in touch with Tofa until his last days\n\nAtiku stressed that the statesman and politician, who had been preoccupied with the state of affairs in Nigeria in recent times, and, especially as it impacted the North, was a \u201cbalanced and incisive\u201d personality.\n\n\u201cHis style of politics and the panache with which he engaged political opponents will remain classical in Nigeria\u2019s political history and are worthy of emulation by contemporary political actors and the future generations,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nBuni, while describing Tofa as an iconic politician, said in a statement by his Director General, Press and Media Affairs, Mr. Mamman Mohammed, that Tofa was an iconic politician, who shared the values of politics as call to service.\n\n\u201cLate Tofa was a fine gentleman, a true democrat and a nationalist with a definition of politics as a tool for service delivery,\u201d Buni said, noting that Nigeria lost the late politician at a time the country\u2019s democracy needed his wise counsel.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FG Commences Collection of Income Tax on Bonds, Short-term Securities from Today",
          "text": "\u2022Stockbrokers express divergent view over new policy\n\nKayode Tokede\n\nThe federal government will today commence the collection of income tax on bonds, short-term securities.\n\nThis followed the expiration of a 2012 gazette which exempted Companies Income Tax (CIT) from bonds and short-term securities in the past 10 years.\n\nThe federal government had in 2012 granted tax waiver on all bonds and debt instruments issued by all tiers of government and corporate entities.\n\nBut the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had last month introduced a 0.025 per cent charge on fixed income (Bonds) secondary market transactions, which was expected to become effective today.\n\nThe capital market regulator had in a circular explained: \u201cIt will charge 0.025 per cent of the total value of all secondary market transactions on bonds, while the Securities Exchange on which the transaction occurs will charge an amount not exceeding 0.025 per cent of the total value of secondary market transactions on bonds while bond transactions by dealing members will attract a single regulatory fee of 0.0001per cent of the total value of the secondary market transactions on bonds, and are exempt from the 0.025per cent fee charge earlier stated.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, capital market operators which included the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS) and the Association of Securities Dealing Houses of Nigeria (ASHON) have expressed support for the move by the federal government.\n\nPresident, Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS), Mr Olatunde Amolegbe said the introduction of the policy by the apex capital regulator would bring significant regulation to the market.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe regulator\u2019s decision comes at significant cost which needs to be covered by the ultimate beneficiaries which are the investors. Therefore, there is no issue with the introduction of a regulatory charge on transactions.\n\n\u201cHowever, whether it should be as high as 0.02 per cent is open to discussion. We can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that such will definitely increase the net yield on instruments, reduce spreads and might impact trade volumes. I am sure the market ecosystem will ultimately arise at a point of equilibrium for all participants.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman, Association of Securities Dealing Houses of Nigeria (ASHON), Mr. Sam Onukwue said: \u201cI do not think it\u2019s out of place for the SEC to do so.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has been charging on equities all along. The proposed charges on fixed income securities should not discourage investors from the asset class.\n\n\u201cInvestors have their preferences and would always weigh their risk tolerance and other fundamentals in making investment decisions.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cWe have risk-takers and risk averters. The former invest more in equity while the latter have a strong hold in fixed income securities.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, the President of the Association of Capital Market Academics (AMAN), Prof. Uche Uwaleke said the introduction of the fee would empower SEC to carry out effective regulation and enhance the capital market.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe charge is on transactions in the secondary segment of the bond market and it is very much in order as it is already in place in the secondary segment of the equities market.\n\n\u201cIt will financially empower the SEC to carry out effective regulation and development of the Nigerian capital market. Besides, 0.025per cent is not significant to the point of discouraging transactions in the bonds market.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, some market operators disagreed with the policy, arguing that it would discourage investors from federal government debt instruments.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, the oldest trading stockbroker on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), Mr. Rasheed Yusuf noted that the new fee would hike the cost of transactions in the fixed income instruments.\n\n\u201cBoth the buyer and seller of fixed income instruments will have to pay the additional cost. Will it make prospective investors mull on the additional cost and conclude that the yield is no longer attractive? These are the things we will be looking out for.\n\n\u201cWe will need to find out if the additional cost is sufficient to discourage players in the fixed income market or it will bring about a marginal effect.\n\n\u201cHowever, it will be a function of the volume an investor is buying from the fixed income market. Can you imagine 0.025 per cent fee on N1billion worth of investors transaction in the fixed income market unlike someone buying N1 million in the same market?\u201d he queried.\n\nOn his part, the Vice President, Highcap Securities, Mr. David Adnori said the implementation of the policy would affect liquidity in the capital market.\n\n\u201cWith the imposition of fees and income tax, it will escalate cost on the capital market, which is expected to discourage investment.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening is irrational and it seems that every arm of the government is imposing tax and levies on investment. In other countries, the government gives incentive to enable investment.\n\n\u201cWhat the government should have tax is consumption not on investment. When you tax investment, your destroying investment flow into the economy and indirectly injuring economy entities that should have provided employment and drive economy growth,\u201d he added.\n\nA Lagos-based analyst, Mr. Moses Ojo noted that the introduction of tax income on government securities would further reduce activities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He was arrested when the audio leaked to media and was published. He is being detained at the EFCC in Abuja,\u201d the source said.\n\nRecall that SaharaReporters had on December 21, 2021 reported how in the leaked audio conversation with one Abdulbari Yusuf, a younger brother to a retired Rear Admiral and former Director of Navy Accounts, Tahir Yusuf, who was facing charges of corruption, Idris accused Malami of compromising cases of corruption Nigeria.\n\nSee Also Scandal Leaked Audio From Anti-graft Agency EFCC Operative Exposes How Attorney-General, Malami Ordered Unfreezing Of \u2018Big Cases\u2019 Bank Accounts\n\nThe detained EFCC operative while giving Yusuf\u2019s brother hints on how to defeat the anti-graft commission at the Court of Appeal as well as ways to evacuate money from a particular account, said, \u201cIf he has money in any account linked with his BVN (Bank Verification Number), he should quickly evacuate them.

The commission encourages citizens who encounter any such unprofessional conduct by personnel of the EFCC to report to the commission in support of our quest to build a better agency.\n\n\u201cFinally, the commission wishes to assure the public that its operations are guided by established professional precepts which do not support the kind of discretion that could allow for manipulation by external actors.\u201d",

In fact, the lawmakers have increased all but one of the seven budgets presented to them since Buhari assumed power in 2015.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of various budget proposals, and the \u201calterations\u201d therein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2016 BUDGET REDUCED BY N20 BILLION\n\nThough Buhari assumed power in 2015, ex-President Goodluck Jonathan had signed the 2015 budget into law before leaving office in May.\n\nSubsequently, in December 2015, Buhari assented to the 2015 appropriation amendment act passed by the national assembly, extending the 2015 financial year till March 31, 2016, and presented a proposed budget of N6.08 trillion for the 2016 fiscal year to the national assembly.\n\nThe national assembly passed the budget on March 23, 2016, reducing it to N6.06 trillion \u2014 but the president withheld his assent and returned the document on grounds that there were \u201cgrey areas\u201d that needed corrections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuhari later signed on May 6, 2016, after the lawmakers had worked on the grey areas.\n\nThis was the first and only time the national assembly reduced a budget proposal presented by Buhari.\n\n2017 BUDGET INCREASED BY N143 BILLION\n\nBuhari presented a N7.298 trillion budget estimate for 2017 to the national assembly on December 14, 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the time the senate passed the appropriation bill on May 11, 2017, it had jumped to N7.44 trillion \u2014 an increase of N143 billion.\n\nA month later, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, who was then acting president while Buhari was away on medical vacation in London, signed the appropriation act, christened \u2018Budget of Economic Recovery and Growth\u2019, into law.\n\n2018 BUDGET UP BY N500 BILLION\n\nThe presidency submitted the 2018 budget proposal of N8.612 trillion to the national assembly in November 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSix months later, the national assembly passed the budget and raised it to N9.12 trillion \u2014 an increment of N500 billion.\n\nIn June 2018, Buhari assented to the appropriation bill. While signing the budget, Buhari accused the lawmakers of reducing allocations for important projects and injecting 6,043 projects.\n\n2019 BUDGET INCREASED BY N86 BILLION\n\nOn December 19, 2018, Buhari presented a proposed budget of N8.83 trillion for 2019 to a joint session of the national assembly.\n\nThe lawmakers passed the budget in April 2019, but not before increasing it by N86 billion to N8.916 trillion.\n\nA month later, the president signed the bill into law.\n\n2020 BUDGET INCREASED BY N260 BILLION\n\nBuhari proposed a 2020 budget of N10.33 trillion, but the national assembly increased it to N10.59 trillion \u2014 adding N260 billion.\n\nThe lawmakers also added N3 billion to the national assembly budget, increasing it from N125 billion to N128 billion.\n\nAgain, Buhari signed the budget as presented to him by the legislative chambers.\n\nMeanwhile, the 2020 budget approval period was the fastest since Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999. The budget signing also placed Nigeria on the January-December budget cycle.\n\n2021 BUDGET INCREASED BY N505 BILLION\n\nFor 2021, the president submitted a proposed budget of N13.08 trillion on October 8 2020, but the lawmakers increased it by N505 billion to N13.58 trillion.\n\nIn the proposed budget, a total of N128 billion was earmarked for the national assembly, but the lawmakers increased their budget to N134 billion.\n\nOn December 31, 2020, Buhari signed the 2021 appropriation bill of N13.588 trillion into law.\n\nIS IT A BUHARI THING?\n\nNo, it is not. Padding the nation\u2019s budget by the national assembly isn\u2019t a new development or peculiar to the Buhari administration.\n\nIn December 2013, Jonathan, through Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, then minister of finance, presented a budget of N4.642 trillion for the 2014 fiscal year to the national assembly. The national assembly raised the figure to N4.695 trillion \u2014 adding N53 billion.\n\nJonathan signed the bill into law in May 2014, after the presidency complained of distortions to the budget.\n\nIn 2000, former President Olusegun Obasanjo refused to sign the budget passed by the national assembly, claiming it had been padded with about N2 billion. Obasanjo had submitted a proposal of N667.51 billion to be spent in the 2000 fiscal year.\n\nThe national assembly was allocated N22.7 billion, but the lawmakers added an extra N2 billion to their budget, raising it to N24 billion.\n\nAfter weeks of a face-off between the executive and legislature, Obasanjo agreed to sign the budget on the condition that he would bring a supplementary bill to address the contentious issues.\n\nAlso, late ex-President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua was faced with issues of budget padding by the national assembly.\n\nFor the 2008 budget, Yar\u2019Adua had proposed N2.45 trillion. However, the national assembly raised the allocation for some items, a move the president was unsatisfied with, which led to him withholding assent to the bill.\n\nA budget of N2.74 trillion \u2014 down from the national assembly\u2019s initial N2.89 trillion \u2014 was eventually approved after weeks of disputes between the executive and the legislature.",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why startup funding in the Maghreb ecosystem is low",
          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Cars45, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs. The other companies that attained unicorn status before this year are Interswitch, Jumia, and Fawry.\n\nThat\u2019s all for 2021! What events did we miss out on, and what first-time surprises do you think await us in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ask an Investor: Twelve insights from Africa\u2019s top investors",
          "text": "At one point or the other, every startup founder or CEO was a newbie in navigating the murky waters of institutional investment. They maybe even got burnt because they didn\u2019t know the right questions to ask, or what to look out for.\n\nSo, we started the Ask an Investor series to help explain why and how investments in companies happen in Africa from the people who make them happen.\n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve interviewed over 20 investors who\u2019ve shared their thoughts on what investors look out for in founders and startups before investing, the lessons learnt and mistakes made, key trends, and other relevant nuggets.\n\nI\u2019ll be highlighting a few insights from the published interviews here and think you should read the full version of the interviews.\n\nFounders Factory: A hands-on approach\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that I learnt early on from my conversations with different investors, it\u2019s that all investors are not the same. Their approach to investing is often influenced by their background and experiences. While most people easily associate investors with just money, Founders Factory Africa (FFA) would rather have you think of more.\n\nIn a conversation with Sam Sturm, one of the founding partners of FFA, he explains why:\n\n\u201cWe believe that capital isn\u2019t the only way to support a business. You need it so that you can execute but at the end of the day, capital isn\u2019t what solves problems. We believe that the challenges of product-market fit, customer acquisition, or retention are not the kind of challenges that capital alone can solve. Those are the challenges that you\u2019re looking to entrepreneurs to solve, that you\u2019re looking to the team to solve. If you can supplement them with experienced and talented people, you\u2019d be successful.\u201d\n\nAlongside providing capital, FFA is a venture building studio, this means that a portfolio startup can expect to get support from private coaches, product managers, product designers, etc.\n\nMicrotraction: A novel approach\n\nFive years ago, Yele Bademosi saw that it was difficult for people to raise funds if they didn\u2019t have a wealthy relative or network, so he set out to make it easier for founders to raise money.\n\nBut first, the Microtraction team had to do away with the status quo. This meant no batches, no programmes, and no demo days. Microtraction invested on the go.\n\nAnother different thing about Microtraction\u2019s approach is its bias for investing in startups with technical founders/co-founders. Why?\n\n\u201cIf we give you money, and you\u2019re using it to outsource development, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong. The first version of your product is almost always wrong. So that\u2019s what caused our bias for tech founders.\u201d Bademosi explained. \u201cWe\u2019re also biased towards having a co-founder because for the most part, we genuinely believe that it is incredibly difficult to start a company yourself. However, there\u2019s always an exception to every rule.\u201d\n\nAcumen: Patient capital\n\nThe original idea for Acumen was to bring the best of philanthropy to focus on solving problems for the poor. So Acumen goes a step further beyond providing donations and grants to startups. It\u2019s a non-profit that uses donations received to invest in startups working on socially relevant issues.\n\nMeghan Curran, West African Director of Acumen, explained this: \u201cIn our model, nothing goes back to the investors because the investors in the first place are donors. Instead that money comes back to Acumen, and we redeploy and reinvest it. We may use it to make follow-on investments in our existing portfolio, or we may use it to make new investments and to continue to grow our portfolio.\u201d\n\nAcumen is able to invest at an early stage and wait a little longer than other traditional venture capital firms because they don\u2019t have to return the money back to donors.\n\nSawari Ventures: North Africa\u2019s leading VC firm\n\n2021 was an exciting year for North Africa as it garnered a lot of attention and funding. Before the boom, Sawari Ventures, which was founded over a decade ago, has been backing North African startups. The founders of Sawari Ventures also founded Flat6Labs\u2014the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator.\n\nIn our conversation, Tamer Azer explained the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup.\n\n\u201cVC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime. They have a 10-year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing, and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\n\u201cJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing cheques, we have to get the money to be able to write these cheques first. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these cheques. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\u201d\n\nUnconventional Capital: Removing gut feelings and bias in startup investment\n\nWithin the first 10 minutes of my conversation with Franziska Reh, CEO of Unconventional Capital, I understood why the word \u201cunconventional\u201d was befitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how early-stage investment mostly happens: An investor and an ambitious entrepreneur get talking. After a few background checks and business plan conversations, the investor decides whether to invest. But not before checking their gut feeling. Along the way the investor is constantly asking, \u201cDoes this feel right?\u201d\n\nAt Uncap, the team decided to flip this approach upside down by relying on algorithms to make these decisions.\n\nReh explained, \u201cAt Uncap, in our investment process, no one in our team makes investment decisions. The selection process is based on an algorithm that focuses very much on the potential of the entrepreneur. It\u2019s a model that measures entrepreneurial potential as a predictor of future success. Afterwards, we invest through a standardised model.\u201d\n\nThis model allows Uncap to invest in thousands of entrepreneurs. Interestingly, Uncap exits the portfolio companies gradually over a period of time\u2014an unconventional exit strategy.\n\n\u201cThese companies we invest in buy back their equity through 5% of their quarterly revenues. They transfer 5% of their quarterly revenues to us. By this act, over time, they buy back the whole investment, plus the price that we\u2019ve paid before. It\u2019s a fixed multiple on the investment, it\u2019s basically the same for everyone.\u201d\n\nTomi Davies: Tales of an African angel Investor\n\nThe conversation with Tomi Davies, or TD as he\u2019s fondly called, started off with him explaining how he was able to partner with some of the brightest minds on the continent to build the angel investment space in Africa. He was part of the team that started the Lagos Angel Network and the African Business Angel Network (ABAN).\n\nWhile many know TD for his role in the African Angel community, but he\u2019s more than that.\n\n\u201cI wear many hats: I\u2019m chief investment officer at Greentech, President of ABAN, co-founder of Lagos Angel Network, and sit on the board of the Global Business Angel Network. I\u2019m a founding member of the World Business Angel Forum,\u201c Davies said.\n\nHe also shared his proprietary framework for investing in startups.\n\n\u201cOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve interacted with entrepreneurs all over Africa and refined the POEM model. So it\u2019s essentially vision, proposition, organisation, economics and milestones. If you take those, what you want to understand around the vision when you meet the founder is, \u2018Is the founder capable? What drives them?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe second one is how significant the problem they\u2019re tackling is. What\u2019s the problem? How many people are bothered by this? Because you\u2019re thinking about economic value.\n\n\u201cFinally, you ask: is the solution innovative? Is the offer compelling and unique? Also, is the business model sustainable? Those are things I look out for when I meet a founder.\u201d\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: Angel investor and startup advisor\n\nWhen I visited Ghana in July, Ato Bentsi-Enchill was one of the people I met. One thing that stood out to me was that he moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did he learn all these?\n\n\u201cIn the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network.\u201d Bentsi-Enchill explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\u201d\n\nAs a startup advisor, he helps African startups raise capital and protects them from difficult investors. In our conversation, he cites some instances where he\u2019s helped.\n\n\u201cFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts\u2014a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\nAdam Molai: African industrialist\n\nZimbabwe is known more for the Victoria Falls (the largest waterfall in the world) than its tech ecosystem, but still, Adam Molai is one of the few investors looking to change that.\n\nIn 2000, Molai started investing in other African companies through TRT Investments. Last year, he started the $2-million Jua Fund to provide African entrepreneurs with much-needed access to capital, mentoring, advice, and networks.\n\nOver the past 20 years, he has been investing in African startups and, through the Jua Fund, has backed Kenya\u2019s GrowAgric, Madagascar\u2019s Jirogasy, Zimbabwe\u2019s BRYT, Nigeria\u2019s PowerStove, and many others.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye, he shared one of the best practices startups should adopt in getting funded.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve seen is that there\u2019s often a lack of belief that they\u2019ll get the fund, so they go in, try to get the funds, then look for what\u2019s required of them to comply. I think they should be looking at it in totality. Startups should think like this: I\u2019m going to get the fund and because I\u2019ll get the fund, this is what I must put in place to enable me get the fund. What happens when they don\u2019t think like this is that for some it takes months before accessing the funds. They need the funds, the funds are there for them, but they can\u2019t access the funds because they\u2019ve not fulfilled the due diligence process.\u201d\n\nSunu Capital: A pan-African fund with a solo general partner\n\nSince Benjamin Schmerler left the United States at the age of 18, he\u2019s lived and worked in nearly every corner of the globe. Interestingly, he stumbled on the name for his firm\u2014SUNU Capital\u2014 while in Senegal.\n\nHe heard the word sunu in a song, and when he found out that it meant \u201cour\u201d, it resonated with him. \u201cI used it as the name of my firm because it\u2019s a simple word and, more importantly, because I believe in collective effort; working together to build more wealth for everyone and leave this planet a better place for our children,\u201d Schmerler said.\n\nOne thing he\u2019s been thinking about recently is how to aggregate African markets.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really interested in is how to break the borders between countries so we can get a larger aggregated market that can be efficiently served. I believe if we can do this, we would see exits on a scale beyond anything we have seen to date.\n\n\u201cI talk to entrepreneurs all the time and they show me the total addressable market (TAM) of Africa, a map of 54 countries. They hint at the possibility of expansion, and I\u2019m thinking, how do we unlock Gabon? What does it take to be a part of Cameroon as well? There is so much untapped potential all over the continent that I am absolutely excited by infrastructure that turns the 4 or 5 markets where all the activity is happening into 10, 20, 30 countries over the next handful of years.\u201d\n\nKepple Africa: Creating new industries\n\nA few minutes into our conversation, Satoshi Shinada reminded me that I need to visit more African countries. At the age of 18, he left Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years.\n\nFor Kepple Africa Ventures, the big vision is to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nIn our conversation, Shinada shared some mistakes he\u2019s made.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything, and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\n\u201cAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\u201d\n\nLoftyInc: Not playing by the rules of VC investing\n\nIn 2012, Idris Bello and his partners, then in their early 30s, left their lucrative jobs and raided their savings to create the LoftyInc Afropreneurs Fund. Over the years, through trials and errors, they\u2019ve seen some level of success. Today, LoftyInc operates three funds that have deployed over $12 million into over 75 African startups like Flutterwave, Andela and Trella.\n\nBello, who believes in sharing a full picture of his investor journey, shared some notable deals missed or mistakes made along the way.\n\n\u201cThose are the aspects of investing that people don\u2019t say much about. I remember when we wanted to start our Fund 2, we decided to register in Mauritius because we were told it was better. It turned out to be a bad decision because of the tedious registration and documentation process there. The KYC (identity verification) was unnecessarily complicated as they wanted to know \u2018everything\u2019 about everyone who was investing, and it got expensive and complicated very fast. In hindsight, it was a bad decision. We ended up cutting our losses and registering in Delaware, US.\n\n\u201cMost of the mistakes we made were as a result of wrong judgment calls. Here\u2019s another that probably cost me a few million. In 2013, I remember committing to invest $20,000 in Fora, which later became Andela. Unfortunately, on that same day, someone else came to me with another idea. So I told Iyin to bring back the $20,000 cheque. I split it into two and gave both start-ups $10,000 each. Today it is clear I shouldn\u2019t have gone back on my initial investment.\u201d\n\nCapria ventures: Backing local funds and startups\n\nFive years ago, Jack Knellinger, Dave Richards and Will Poole formed Capria ventures, an investment firm that started out investing in local funds (VC firms) across the global south\u2014Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. Recently, Capria Ventures has begun investing directly in startups, providing the much needed growth stage capital for them.\n\nToday, Capria Ventures has investment activity in about 50 countries with $650 million worth of current assets under management.\n\nIn my conversation with Jack Knellinger, he enlightened me on how they support VC firms\u2014a subject rarely spoken about.\n\n\u201cObviously, the main thing top of mind is fundraising\u2014helping them close their fundraising. Here, it involves everything from introductions to reviewing pitch materials. We look at how the funds are being positioned as well as the terms and negotiations with limited partners to ensure there\u2019s alignment between the fund managers, general partners, and limited partners.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the fundraising is done, we move to portfolio management. How are they putting in place the right systems and processes to grow, scale, and institutionalise the firm? Here, there\u2019s a wide range of things to be done in that regard, from team development to appropriately conducting due diligence before investing. When the fund managers have built up their portfolio of companies, we move to how they think about exits. What\u2019s the right time to exit? Do they want to look at partial exits?\n\nWhen a firm has mastered these aspects and gone on to raise multiple funds. We look at how they\u2019re telling the story of the firm and the funds you\u2019ve managed.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s all for this year! Thank you to all the investors who took their time to talk to me and help others learn more about investing in startups.\n\nWhich investors/firms will you like me to talk to in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Considering that about 2,287 Nigerians lost their lives to insecurity in the third quarter of 2021, according to a report by SBM Intelligence and EiE Nigeria, most people were advised to cancel planned trips to locations considered unsafe for the festive celebration last year.\n\nAs well, some parts of the country, particularly the South Eastern, which experienced lots of intimidation from security operatives across the year and killings by unknown gunmen, surprisingly welcomed more people during the festive season than in 2020.\n\nIt would be recalled that few months to the Anambra State gubernatorial election, the South East zone, which has been on partial lockdown on the order of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) witnessed a spike in insecurity with killings almost every day by \u201cunknown gunmen,\u201d a situation that warranted most Igbo town unions to advise their kinsmen to stay back in the cities for safety.\n\nHowever, the advice to stay back in safer cities fell on deaf ears as more people travelled to celebrate the 2021 festive season despite the very exorbitant transport fares, though usual because of the Christmas rush.\n\nThe intrigue, according to Marcel Okeiyi, a manager at Starline Motors Jibowu, Lagos, is that despite the hike in transport fares, many travelled and were paying without complaint.\n\n\u201cOur average fare across the year is N9,000 to the farthest town in the country, but it increased to over N22,000 on December 24, 2021, and people paid without complaint. Now, we are shifting the hike to the return leg from January 3, 2022, to about N18,000 and people will still pay,\u201d he said.\n\nRead Also:Defying the Pandemic: How Nigerian MSMEs are Coping\n\nTo meet the huge demand, the manager noted that the young transport company had to increase its destinations from seven to 12 and fleet from 30 buses to 75, with a loan from the Bank of Industry, and hopes to pay back within two years.\n\n\u201cWe will pay back the loan on schedule because the business is good and we are already surpassing our target for the festive season,\u201d he said.\n\nLibra Motors, an interstate transport company, had to introduce about 30 pieces of the all-new Toyota Hiace 2020 buses to complement its existing Toyota Hiace commuter 18 seater buses, as well as other top players such as: The Young, Peace Mass, GUO, God Is Good, ABC Transport, among others.\n\nWhile the transport companies load an average of 1,500 buses out of Lagos every day during the off season, they load a combined 5,000 buses every day during the festive season. This number is expected to drastically reduce from late January when the rush to return would have been over and many of the buses packed or used to replace old ones.\n\nIkenna Ezekwesili, a manager at GUO Transport, noted that the volume of passengers in 2021 was so unprecedented that the company had to bring back some of the buses it leased to hotels and private companies.\n\n\u201cIt was as if everybody in Lagos was leaving town, we were overwhelmed by passengers and we had to seek a solution to meet our huge demand. We also made huge revenue because it is usually our season to make money. We raked in millions of naira, I mean enough to pay for the buses we newly acquired,\u201d he said.\n\nMike Onyekwere, a driver with Libra Motors, lamented that he had no days off during the peak of the festive period because of the huge demand by travellers.\n\n\u201cI had to move from Lagos to Owerri, return the next day with an empty bus, then load the next day to Owerri full and repeat the same until December 31, 2021. I will start the January return from January 4th and no rest until January 9th,\u201d he said.\n\nEbere Onyeaso, a festive season celebrant, who has been in Abagana, his hometown, since December 23, 2021, noted that the so-called militarisation of the South East was not correct, as he experienced fewer military checkpoints as against the many people purported to be across the zone.\n\n\u201cWe had a smooth drive home and security checks by the military, especially in the South East, were not as bad as people said,\u201d he said.\n\nSam Ogazi, who has also been in his hometown in Enugu State, said the roads were smoother than most people imagined and security operatives were rather welcoming people home than harassing them.\n\n\u201cThe only place we had issue was at Onitsha Head Bridge where the Army was controlling traffic, and one military checkpoint on the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway. But they were friendly and did their jobs professionally. I was not harassed by any security agent on the road,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, travellers along the Onitsha-Owerri-Aba route had a smooth drive as security operatives focused on their job without harassing innocent passengers.\n\nI was surprised at the smooth drive and few military checks as against what we were told and expected on our journey home this festive season. The military checkpoint at Awomama before Owerri was the only place we were delayed because the driver was reckless. But the soldiers freed us later,\u201d Anselm Obiako, a medical doctor, said.\n\nSpeaking on the reason for the mass travel, Esther Asabe, a psychologist and university lecturer, noted that travel is part of life and that many who could not travel last Christmas because of the pandemic took advantage of the respite in the various spread this year to travel.\n\n\u201cYes, the Omicron variant is spreading, but with the vaccination a lot of people hit the road and also they are mostly people who could not travel last year because of the pandemic,\u201d she said.\n\nBode Alamutu, a lawyer and entrepreneur, attributed the huge travel last year, despite the economic hardship, to natural wanderlust among Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAn average Nigerian wants to travel whether overseas, within the country or his village. But COVID-19 impacted our passion for travel and those who cannot travel because of the cost now had to head somewhere this Christmas,\u201d he said.\n\nThe mass travel was also against the outcry by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), which noted a week before Christmas that the country would witness community transmission of the COVID-19 Omicron variant if many travel for the festive period.\n\nOn December 26, 2021, the Centre confirmed community transmission and disclosed that though Nigeria had not recorded any death from the variant, about 39 cases of the Omicron variant had been discovered. This brings the total to 45, a number that has increased since then and is expected to spike this January as travellers return.\n\nAbdulahi Nuru, a security operative, who had to travel during the festive period to see his family in Bauchi, noted that he did so because he had completed his vaccination.\n\nFor him, some who travelled believed that with vaccination, they are protected, while sadly many among them were still not vaccinated or partially vaccinated.",

          "title": "Industrial real estate offers hope with 12% annual yield",
          "text": "The Nigerian industrial subsector of the real estate sector has offered green flag to yield-hungry investors with 12 percent annual yield, which places it ahead of other sub-sectors including residential, commercial office and retail.\n\nAcross key economies in West Africa, including Nigeria, Ghana and Cote d\u2019Ivoire, the industrial subsector has the highest prime yield of about 12 percent, according to Yomi Olugbenro, West Africa tax leader at Deloitte.\n\nIn Nigeria, where the yield is between 4 and 5 percent for residential, commercial office space, 9 percent and retail 8 percent, industrial real estate offers 12 percent and that is the highest in the sub-region. In Ghana, even though it is lower than Nigeria\u2019s at 10 percent, it is still higher than other segments.\n\nIn that country, residential real estate offers 7.5 percent, office 8.30 percent while retail gives 7.5 percent. In Cote d\u2019Ivoire, the yield for residential real estate is 7.50 percent. Office gives 9 percent, retail, 9 percent while industrial offers 12 percent.\n\nIn Nigeria, real estate remains an icing on the cake in terms of investment opportunities, more so when other investment assets such as Treasury Bill, Bonds, Equities, etc, are no longer viable options.\n\nThough Chudi Bosi, an estate surveyor and valuer, reasons that unless the Federal Government reviews its economic policies, increase manufacturing activities and provide environment conducive for export, Nigeria\u2019s industrial warehouse space may continue to nosedive, but Ayo Ibaru, research director at Northcourt Real Estate, thinks differently.\n\nIbaru had, in a report on Industrial Real Estate, said, \u201cDemand for logistics and last mile distribution centres are likely to remain strong investment opportunities for most of 2021.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Trends that defined real estate market segments in 2021\n\nAccording to Ibaru, positive industrial real estate fundamentals drove asset values to record highs, pointing out that this was amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, which hastened the move to online retailing and intensified pressure on logistics frameworks.\n\nHe pointed out further that demand for inner city warehouses had increased and that this was especially so for last mile assets in central business districts. \u201cInvestors have taken notice and are competing for the limited number of available deals. The demand for last-mile logistics is expected to grow, driven by the transition of retailing from brick and mortar to online,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nThere are challenges, though, which Ibaru explained, make it difficult to work seamlessly. Part of these challenges is the under par infrastructure. \u201cThe supply of standard buildings is restricted, and those that exist are unsuitable, creating a market for small to mid-size warehousing facilities,\u201d he noted.\n\nBut investors can find opportunities in Grade A warehouses, which can make it possible for investors to mark rents to international benchmarks. These are particularly attractive for investors who should bear in mind however that the question of where to locate a warehouse has historically been a trade-off between low cost but easily accessible facilities, road transport networks and final product destinations.\n\nBesides industrial real estate, the hotel sector is another attractive investment haven, according to Olugbenro, who spoke at this year\u2019s edition of West Africa Property Investment Summit.\n\nHe noted that across the five sub-regions in Africa, West Africa ranks third with regards to infrastructure development. It comes behind North, Southern Africa and the African average and ahead of East and Central Africa.\n\n\u201cWest Africa accounts for 30 percent of Africa\u2019s hotel development pipeline, with 24,689 rooms, and that is only slightly below North Africa\u2019s 39 percent pipeline,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNigeria leads the West African park with over 9,000 rooms, followed by Senegal and Cote d\u2019Ivoire. These three are the only West African countries in Africa\u2019s top 10 countries by number of hotel rooms. A slow recovery is expected for current stock, while the hotels already in the delivery phase are expected to be completed, albeit with a pushed-out delivery date,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Tax Leader encouraged investors to see opportunities in the real estate sector and key into them, pointing out that the sector has shown resilience in the face of macro-economic issues that have affected other sectors of the economy.\n\nAfter a historic recovery in the first quarter of 2021 from 12 straight quarters of recession, real estate services recorded 3.85 percent GDP growth in the second quarter of 2021. This growth, which was the sector\u2019s highest in six years, was higher than Q2 of 2020 by 25.84 percent and 2.08 percent higher than Q1 2021 growth.\n\n\u201cReal estate services recorded real GDP growth of 2.32 percent in Q3 of 2021, higher than the growth recorded in third quarter of 2020 by 15.72 percent points, and lower by 1.53 percent points relative to Q2 2021,\u201d Olugbenro noted, adding, \u201creal estate services contributed 5.49 percent to real GDP in Q3 2021, lower than the 5.58 percent it recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olugbenro, in Q3 \u20182021, construction grew in real terms by 4.10 (YoY), higher by 1.25 points from prior year and 0.40 percent points above preceding quarter. \u201cConstruction contributes 3.22 percent to total real GDP,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Loan apps defy Google, Nigeria\u2019s data and cyber laws to humiliate defaulters",
          "text": "The ability of securing loans within minutes just after a few clicks in a mobile app, and particularly without collateral made loan apps a darling of many people. What the borrowers did not know, however, was that the hundreds or thousands of contacts (as the case may be) on their mobile phones, was the ultimate collateral. The numbers stored on their phones and accessed by the loan apps, were the lenders\u2019 insurance against any inability to repay. In essence, their reputation and dignity or whatever was to be left of it was to be used in guaranteeing repayment of loans from N5,000 to N100,000 ( $12 to $240).\n\nIt could be a business partner, customer, or even love interest and hundreds of other people a person would not want to get humiliated in their presence, but this, was the ultimate card the loan apps counted on to get paid.\n\n\u201cIt is not a good experience,\u201d said Jane, who defaulted on a loan. After the lender reached out to her phone contacts, to console herself, she said in a mixture of Pidgin and English; \u201cWho no dey borrow? Even Nigeria dey borrow, it is a normal thing. But they should have focused on me paying their money and not reaching out to my contacts.\u201d While she may have been humiliated beyond her imaginations, the psychological impact was a feeling of nothing else to lose.\n\n\u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\u201d as may be recalled by Game of Thrones fans, was the chant as Cersei, the Queen Mother, was paraded through the fictional town of King\u2019s Landing, as atonement for her \u2018sins\u2019. The same can be replayed, when hundreds or thousands of numbers on a person\u2019s phone are contacted, all in a bid to shame a borrower into loan repayment.\n\nRead Also:Loan apps or loan sharks: How digital lending apps trap the poor\n\n\u201cChristmas is over, if you know you borrowed money from any loan App, biko (i.e. please) go and pay back. I don\u2019t want to receive unnecessary messages because of you. Walahi, I go carry them come your house,\u201d wrote Collins Nnabuife on his Facebook page, intended as a joke but also a portrayal of the current reality many live through. Not only for those who have borrowed, but their phone contacts who are harassed with threatening messages, even when they were never used as guarantors for the loan.\n\nThe post by Collins was not unconnected to messages he had received, including one about a female acquaintance, which among other things read; \u201cThis is to inform the general public that Miss Jane Doe (real name withheld) with phone number: 00000000 is a thief and dubious criminal currently on the run with companys (sic) money. She has been declining and avoiding company calls to pay back.\n\n\u201cKindly notify her on getting this notice, as pictures of her will be posted on social media platforms today for criminal act and BVN number blacklisted on failure to pay back today. We will submit her relevant details publicly and treat as fraud.\u201d\n\nSome of the loan apps that have been reported to indulge in similar acts include; 9Credit, NairaPlus, Lcredit, NewCredit, ncash, Kash Kash, iCoin, xCredit, Mint, and Soko Loan, which was recently fined N10 million following petitions by aggrieved users.\n\nWhile the apps mostly claim the lowest loan tenor is 91 days, in order to \u2018pass\u2019 Google playstore requirement for the apps to be hosted, all as recounted by \u2018victims\u2019, actually offer loans from seven days.\n\n\u201cWe do not allow apps that promote personal loans which require repayment in full in 60 days or less from the date the loan is issued,\u201d states Google on a web page on conditions for Financial Services apps. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow apps that expose users to deceptive or harmful financial products and services,\u201d it also says.\n\nChristmas is over, if you know you borrowed money from any loan App, biko (i.e. please) go and pay back. I don\u2019t want to receive unnecessary messages because of you\n\nLoan apps are required to indicate minimum and maximum period of repayment, maximum annual percentage rate, and other information, which most either misrepresent or omit. In particular, by offering loans of just seven days, for instance, these providers clearly flout a major criterion by Google that no tenor should be less than 60 days.\n\n\u201cI was broke then and under pressure to settle certain things,\u201d said Chidi, who borrowed N10,000 each from three of such apps in mid-2021, a total of N30,000 ($72) but defaulted after the 2-week tenor. This led to a tsunami of messages and calls, first to threaten him to repay, then to all his phone contacts. He identified iCoin as one of the apps but couldn\u2019t recollect the others when interviewed.\n\nThe amount a person is eligible to borrow is determined by the work they do and income. Also, when a person borrows and pays back, it qualifies them for another (higher) loan.\n\nThis was the strategy employed by Jane (mentioned earlier), who borrowed an initial N10,000, and repaid so she could be eligible for a higher amount of N20,000, on which she later defaulted. She told BusinessDay there was a sick relative in her care and there was no other person to provide money urgently needed the day she took the first loan. Someone she asked for help had recommended as app she called \u2018Mint\u2019.\n\nTo prevent defaulting on the payment after the one-week tenor, she borrowed from another person, used their money to pay the loan app, which qualified her for another loan. She would then take the second loan, this time N20,000 out of which she repaid the person.\n\nThe second loan was the source of her humiliation, but, curiously, after she had been thoroughly embarrassed, she now appears indifferent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried anymore. After all, they already did their worst by sending out messages to all my contacts,\u201d Jane said. \u201cAs they sent out messages to my contacts, I told them as punishment, I will not repay till after the Christmas and New Year festivities.\u201d\n\nA Google spokesperson, when asked for the company\u2019s reaction to conducts of loan apps hosted on playstore, told BusinessDay the company has very strict policies that guide apps that are allowed on the Playstore platform. \u201cWhen we find violations, we take very strong actions, including sometimes taking down the app from our platform. Violations can be reported by clicking the \u2018Flag as inappropriate\u2019 link under the menu on the Google Play store. When reports are received, We investigate, and take clear actions,\u201d Google said.\n\nApart from violating the terms by Google playstore, the loan apps have also been alleged to contravene Nigeria\u2019s data privacy law on one hand, and cyber security law on the other.\n\nWhen Soko loan, one of the loan apps was fined N10 million by NITDA, it was hinged on complaints by users who accused it of breaching their privacy and defaming them by reaching out to their phone contacts.\n\n\u201cThis action was taken after receiving series of complaints against the company for unauthorised disclosures, failure to protect customers\u2019 personal data and defamation of character as well as carrying out the necessary due diligence as enshrined in the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation,\u201d NITDA said in August, 2021. Months later, the action taken against Soko loan has not deterred other loan apps from similar practices.\n\nHowever, an August 2021 publication on the legality of the fine imposed by NITDA on Soko loans, by Aluko & Oyebode, a law firm, suggested the decision may be flawed, citing some other cases. But the question remains, what can be done and who will rein in the excesses of the loan providers many now refer to as unethical loan sharks.\n\n\u201cAs for the \u2018loan defaulters\u2019, whether their right to privacy has been breached depends on the terms and conditions they agreed upon before the loan or facility was given out. If you agreed for the lender to have access to your contacts in the event of default, I see no reason why you should complain,\u201d was the view of Olaitan Akinnubi, a Lagos-based lawyer.\n\nHe however said, \u201cWhere I think the lenders go too far, is sending unsolicited messages to \u2018innocent\u2019 contacts who they have no business or relationship with. This, in my opinion is an invasion of privacy.\u201d\n\nAn example of such messages sent to Akinnubi by Xcredit, read; A chronic thief and fraudster, \u2026\u2026\u2026, of \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 street, Lagos, (phone number), used you as an emergency contact and has absconded with the company\u2019s money. Inform him to pay back now else he would be arrested and you would be implicated and sanctioned.\n\n\u201cAssociating me with an alleged \u2018chronic thief and fraudster\u2019 and also threatening to \u2018implicate and sanction\u2019 me constitutes an harassment or what you can say is cyber bullying,\u201d according to him.\n\nHe further explained that section 24 (1) (b) of the Cybercrimes Act 2015 provides thus: \u201cAny person who knowingly or intentionally sends a message or other matter by means of computer systems or network that he knows to be false, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another or causes such a message to be sent: commits an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not more than N7,000,000.00 or imprisonment for a term of not more than 3 years or to both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d\n\nRecently, it was announced that a joint committee comprising the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), will be working to tackle violation of consumer rights in the money lending industry, with a view to shutting down illegal businesses.\n\nIt is yet to be seen how this committee will ensure loan apps continue operating, without abusing the privacy of users. More so, if violated users will take steps to seek redress, at the very least, reporting the apps to Google for sanctions.",

Some even add a maternity side by side with the orphanage homes where they deliver people of babies and turn the place into a baby factory; they bring underage children to such homes to make babies and sell same, or traffic these children, as far as outside Nigeria, despite the restriction on international adoption.\u201d\n\nEdeko continued: \u201cOrphans are vulnerable persons; they are subject to all forms of exploitation; they are vulnerable to being trafficked, abused and sold. You will understand that the issue of human trafficking has been a very strong challenge globally and at the state level, Governor Godwin Obaseki has made serious efforts to stamp out human trafficking in Edo State.\n\n\u201cAs the ministry with the responsibility to investigate any adoption process, in line with the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Agenda, we are committed to sanitizing the system and will be setting up a committee to audit orphanage homes in Edo State and come up with holistic policies on adoption and management of orphanage homes, in line with the child rights law. This is topmost on our agenda for the new year.\u201d\n\nShe further stated: \u201cThe government of Governor Obaseki is talking about institutional reforms and sectoral reforms. It then means we must reform every department that is within the purview of this ministry. So, we have continued to train and retrain the proprietors and proprietresses of these orphanage homes, and looking at these children today, I can see they are very beautiful; they are doing things that normal children will do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are going to do an audit and remove all those that came into this as a business. It is a charity and if you do not have the heart to do charity, you cannot be in the issue of managing orphanage homes. If you are here for the wrong reason, better take your leave. It is not going to work and we will put many of them behind bars and we will close the orphanages that are for business.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly those that are for true charity will be allowed to function, as there are standards for running orphanage homes in Edo State,\u201d the commissioner noted.\n\n...",

This development had forestalled crime and criminality in major cities, towns and communities across the state.\n\nThe trend has seen an increase in activity and investment in the creative and entertainment industry as well as retail and hospitality sectors, which has witnessed a boom with new players.\n\nA cross-section of residents in Edo State hailed the state government for the peaceful atmosphere in which they marked the Yuletide festivities.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Benin City, they said the celebrations went on peacefully, owing to interventions by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration, which include support to the Edo Police Command, deployment of vigilante security network and other security agencies that ensured that the Yuletide was celebrated in a peaceful atmosphere.\n\nMr. Lawrence Edgar, a resident in Benin City, said \u201cThe Christmas and New Year festivities have been quite pleasurable and eventful.

It is a good thing that people are able to move freely.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Mr. Emmanuel Aroyameh, said the state government\u2019s effort in restoring streetlights to major parts of the city also helped in ensuring security, noting, \u201cThe state government\u2019s support to security agencies and local vigilantes must be commended. What is happening in Benin City with the streetlights is interesting and the palliative work on the road made driving around the city easy and pleasurable.\u201d\n\nA finance expert, Mr. Ikponwonsa Nosakhare, said improved security in the state has had a huge impact on the investment scene as it has ensured a lot of investment in different sectors of the state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPeople are often concerned about the safety of their investment.

Olayiwola Afolabi, a Benin based legal practitioner and advocate of social Justice praised EDSTMA for being a viable traffic agency whose display of professionalism has helped to restore faith and respect in the Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s led administration.\n\nHe appreciated and commended the agency and its officers for their stellar performance during the yuletide celebration where they had to work late into the night for ease of vehicular movement which helped to reduce road rage and incidents of road traffic crashes within the Benin metropolis.\n\nManaging Director EDSTMA, Dennis Oloriegbe speaking on achievements for year 2021, said, aside from carrying out its basic function, which is traffic management, the agency was able to reduce traffic menace to fifty percent (50%). There was also an expansion of operations to outside Benin, to Auchi, Uromi and Ekpoma.\n\nFor 2022, Oloriegbe declared the need to expand to Okada and Owan axis. There is need to expand to the hinterland within the Benin metropolis such as Ugbor zone which comprises \u201cfirst and second Ugbor zone.\u201d\n\nHe revealed that EDSTMA was receiving a tow truck for official use this year which would boost efficiency and professionalism aside easing the stress of going out to borrow a tow truck for use when there is a breakdown.\n\nAvowing that there are already a bucket list of activities for the year, the EDSTMA boss said, \u201cWe are starting with the installation of bus-stops haven identified such. We want passengers to be able to identify their bus-stops. This would stop the menace of drivers stopping anyhow on the road.\n\n\u201cBefore the end of January, we would start installation. What we are doing now is production. We are coming up with bus-stop road signs with the names of such bus-stops. A driver should be able to call a name to which a passenger responds. Not just stopping at random everywhere. This is one of the basic cause of holdups in Benin.\u201d\n\nOloriegbe reiterated that the level of sensitization of drivers last year was high with the enactment of traffic transportation policies especially with the Obhakhawaye Central Transport Terminal coming into place. Modalities were put in place to sensitize drivers in that park and other parks on the dangers of driving against traffic (one way traffic violation),\n\n\u201cWe built a synergy with the Psychiatric Hospital, Uselu, which was strange to drivers. We had to sensitive them that it was just to evaluate the mental health of violators. It is not a punitive measure on all drivers as was erroneously believed. We sensitized them on the fact that drivers should just keep to the laws. If they keep to the law, they would not be harassed or arrested.\u201d\n\nAs part of the end of year activities EDSTMA unveiled its maiden anthem. There was a parade display/competition from its twelve zones. The EDSTMA headquarters brigade clinched the first prize closely followed by zones 4 and 6. There were a lot of games which had immediate rewards for winners.\n\nAn interesting twist was added to the ceremony when two officers Ode Christiana and Momoh Martins based on public recognition were rewarded with money and a bag of rice each by Olayiwola Afolabi an awardee, to spur them to greater heights, in the discharge of their duties.\n\n...",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Attorney and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, has said the President Muhammadu Buhari government is yet to officially designate bandits as terrorists because the government is following international best practices.\n\nMalami who spoke on Tuesday while appearing on Channels TV breakfast programme, \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 said his office was in the process of gazetting a court judgement that ordered the government to declare bandits as terrorists and that the process would be concluded in a matter of days.\n\nThe Buhari government had come under criticism for hastily declaring separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) as a terrorist group in 2017, while refusing to label bandits carrying out killings and kidnappings across the North.\n\nIn the case of IPOB, Malami was able to gazette the designation of IPOB as terrorists on the same day that Justice Abdu Kafarati gave the order on September 20, 2017.\n\nBut speaking on Tuesday, Malami said the government acted swiftly in declaring IPOB and Boko Haram as terror groups because of the \u201cthreats to lives and properties they have caused in the nation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cGovernment has a responsibility to act but within the context of acting, you equally expected to operate within the confines of international best practices associated with engagement and one of such best practices is that you can only use maximum force on groups, individuals that are declared terrorists and that is where the application of the Terrorism Act comes in place.\n\n\u201cWith that in mind, Nigeria acted, first by proscribing IPOB, taking into consideration the threats to lives and properties they have caused in the nation. Boko Haram was proscribed.\u201d\n\nMalami claimed that the good results arising from outlawing IPOB and Boko Haram buoyed the government to consider the proscription of bandits, and the use of military hardware against them.\n\n\u201cNow, we are confronted with another threat in the North-West associated with banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and in all these, these people are using weapons to attack Nigerians, kidnap them and created a situation of serious security challenge and fear in the system,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhatever military hardware you acquire there are limits within the context of the international convention as to how it can be used, when it can be used and against who it can be used. And that is how the idea of looking at the activities of the bandits, cattle rustlers, kidnappers come into being.\n\n\u201cOur assessment taking into consideration that they are causing a major threat to the territorial peaceful co-existence and causing a major threat to lives with weapons, the idea then came about that indeed they (bandits) have satisfied the criteria of being declared terrorists within the context of the law so that whatever military hardware at the disposal of the Federal Government can best be used against them within the context of the international convention and within the context of the law.\u201d\n\nOn why his office has not gazetted the court order designating bandits as terrorists, Malami said, \u201cThe gazetting of a court order or judgement is a process but what matters fundamentally within the context of international convention is the judicial declaration and that has been obtained; the court has declared bandits, kidnappers, cattle rustlers as terrorists.\n\n\u201cSo, with or without the gazette, what gives effect to such declaration is a judicial pronouncement but the gazette is a mere formality and it has been on and I believe within a matter of days, it will be concluded.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

We believe that by coming on a quarterly basis to supervise them, we would ensure that before the end of this year, we will see the trains on top of the tracks,\u201d NAN quoted as saying.\n\n\u201dThat is our commitment and we will begin to monitor and check ourselves.\n\n\u201dIt is a very iconic and landmark project that we are truly proud of. On behalf of the government, I want to commend all of our contractors because they are very committed.\n\n\u201dThey have assured us that whatever it takes, they will complete all of the projects on schedule and on budget,\u201d the governor said.\n\nHe promised to intensify supervision and monitoring of the projects quarterly to facilitate speedy completion.\n\n\u201dWe embarked on this similar tour about three or four months ago and we did mention that we would be doing it every quarter so that we can see how far the constructions are going.\n\n\u201dAs we all have seen, I am happy to report that the construction is going on according to schedule. All the contractors are here even today not being a working day, they are all on-site working,\u201d Mr Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nHe also disclosed the plan by the state government to relocate the market around the Train Station at Yaba, as the government was engaging concerned stakeholders on how best to relocate traders to another place.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s tour to the four stations by Mr Sanwo-Olu, there were significant improvement in construction works at the sites of the Ikeja, Yaba, Ebute-Metta and Marina stations, compared to September 25, 2021 visit to the sites.\n\nAt the Ikeja Station, which will be the main iconic station for the red line project, the station was at the foundation level in September, but the project is now at the second-floor level, remaining the third floor, which is the final floor, NAN reported.\n\nThe road works at Ikeja, as well as the overpass from Obafemi Awolowo to Agege Motor Road are also ongoing.\n\nAt the Yaba site, about three months ago, the contractor was at the excavating stage but, they are now decking to go to the second floor, in line with the matching order to the contractor to ensure that they keep to the timelines and the deadline.\n\nThe Ebute-Metta Station is far ahead of delivery because the contractor has finished the carcass of the station as the governor\u2019s entourage was able to walk into the station safely.\n\nThere are also great improvements in the pace of work at the iconic Marina Station, as beams meant for the construction of the station have already been precast and kept in a safe place.",

They are too busy talking about GYB and never talking about themselves.\n\n\u201cThey are too busy throwing mud at GYB and never telling the people what they have in stock for Nigeria. So interesting they have made the phenomenal history maker called GYB, their politics.\n\n\u201cAfter 61 years of nationhood, Nigeria needs a leader who is sincerely committed to building on the success of the administration he intends to succeed.

He is not prevaricating like the others. And he is not hypocritical.\n\n\u201cTell those seeking the office of President to campaign on their merits, tell them to learn from GYB and his team, and predicate the politics of 2023 on issues. And tell them, the Youths want debate on issues, that Nigerians crave a new republic of issues based politics, and that we must get.\n\n\u201cWe are tired of the politics of falsehood, deceit, lies and chicanery. Tell the Cynics that whilst they continue to make hysteria, apologies to Rev. Jesse Jackson, GYB will continue to make history, as we are committed to redefining the fabrics of our politics with competency and capacity rather than mudslinging and tommyrot.\n\n\u201cIn the days, weeks and months ahead Nigerians craving for a New Deal in leadership will find sufficient reasons and cause to stick to and with the phenomenal history maker called GYB as the great strides and feats of his watch over Kogi State shall reach even greater heights in the year 2022. With GYB a more prosperous united Nigeria is assured,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Senator Rochas Okorocha, the former governor of Imo State, and his son-in-law, Chief Uche Nwosu, have been named as sponsors of kidnapping and banditry in the state by the Imo State Government.\n\nWhen he meets with Imo stakeholders today, Tuesday, January 4, 2021, incumbent Governor Hope Uzodimma promised to name those responsible for the state\u2019s insecurity.\n\nHowever, the administration announced in a statement signed by Chief Press Secretary/Media Adviser to the Governor, Oguwike Nwachuku, that Okorocha and Nwosu have been implicated by suspects currently in detention ahead of the meeting scheduled for 12:00 p.m. at Government House, Owerri.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Okorocha and Nwosu have been specifically mentioned by suspects who are in the custody of security agents, as being sponsors of kidnapping and banditry in Imo State, using their relationship with former ex-militants to perpetrate the crimes\n\n\u201cRather than clear their names, they appear bent on using both overt and covert means to blackmail the Police High Command, which legitimately arrested Uche Nwosu. They are also actively seeking to dent the image of the fine security officers attached to the Governor of Imo State,\u201d the statement issued on Monday and made available to News Express via e-mail, said.\n\nBelow is the statement in full:\n\n\u201cPlot by those believed to be fueling insecurity, particularly kidnapping, banditry, arson and cannibalism in Imo State ahead of January 4, 2022 Imo Stakeholders meeting got to a head on Monday with false news of the alleged arrest of the security officers attached to Governor Hope Uzodimma.\n\n\u201cGovernor Uzodimma, it is believed, will use the Stakeholders meeting to expose the identities of those behind insecurity and other forms of criminality in Imo State. This has prompted Imo citizens to become more curious to discover the identities of those undermining their peace and prosperity. Thus, the current media frenzy by both Rochas Okorocha and Uche Nwosu appears to be strengthening the notion of their culpability.\n\n\u201cTo discredit the government and undermine the peace which the Governor has achieved so far, as was evident in the large number of Imo people who came back home from around the world for Christmas and New Year festivities, the duo have resorted to publishing falsehood yet again about security officers in the State Government House.\n\n\u201cTheir claim of the arrest and detention of a certain Shaba, whom they falsely allege to be the CSO to the Imo State Governor is strange as the Governor\u2019s CSO is not known by the name of Shaba both officially and otherwise. In addition, no security officer in the Governor\u2019s security team was either arrested or is currently unaccounted for. As such, the entire story can best be described as a poorly scripted fabrication aimed at misleading the unsuspecting public.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Okorocha and Nwosu have been specifically mentioned by suspects who are in the custody of security agents, as being sponsors of kidnapping and banditry in Imo State, using their relationship with former ex-militants to perpetrate the crimes.\n\n\u201cRather than clear their names, they appear bent on using both overt and covert means to blackmail the Police High Command, which legitimately arrested Uche Nwosu. They are also actively seeking to dent the image of the fine security officers attached to the Governor of Imo State.\n\n\u201cThe public must be informed that the entire report is false and a failed attempt to frustrate the Imo Stakeholders meeting taking place on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe mass of Imo People, who are undoubtedly peaceful and fun loving are enjoined to discountenance the serial falsehood that continue to be churned out by the embattled duo. The focus and direction of the Gov. Uzodimma led government, it must be emphasized, will continue to be about the wellbeing of the people of the State, no matter what it takes.\u201d",

This is a business between Lagos State government and the Adeyiga family.\n\n\u201cWe are under seige; the police have been here for two weeks, they came in December to take possession of properties on behalf of Adeyiga family and others.\n\n\u201cSince then, we\u2019ve gotten in touch with prominent personalities to intervene and get the police off our estate.\n\n\u201cWe are victims, even inside our own homes.

Normalcy has returned, as both vehicular and human mobility were unaffected.\n\nNormal activity continued unabated in Enugu\u2019s metropolis.\n\nAirline companies also maintained regular flight schedules from the Akanu Ibiam International Airport.\n\nThe major markets were not open because they were still closed for the New Year\u2019s celebrations, as directed by their authorities. People who came to make one or two purchases, particularly foodstuffs and other delicacies, were able to trade outside the closed markets.\n\nThe population in the city center, on the other hand, was sparse because many individuals who had traveled to the countryside for the New Year\u2019s celebrations had yet to arrive.\n\nMarriage ceremonies and community events were held in various sections of Anambra State yesterday, indicating that residents had forgotten about the Monday sit-at-home. The markets in Awka were open for business, as were most of the filling stations.\n\nAccording to the Imo State Police Command, members of the ESN were injured while attempting to attack the palace of Eze Emmanuel Okeke, Chairman of the Imo State Traditional Rulers Council. Micheal Abattam, the state Police Public Relations Officer, told reporters in Owerri about it.\n\nOther hoodlums who sustained gunshot injuries jumped into the forest, according to the police. The incident occurred around 1pm in the Amaifeke community in the Orlu local government area.\n\nOn how the police got to know about the planned attack, he said, \u201cSequel to the recent attacks on the palaces of some traditional rulers in the state by some unknown gunmen, the Commissioner of Police, Imo State Command, CP Rabiu Hussaini, in his bid to curb this menace deployed the command\u2019s tactical teams to patrol every community in the state while closely monitoring the palaces of traditional rulers.\n\n\u201cToday, the 3rd of January, 2022 at about 0100hrs, the strategy paid off as the Command\u2019s tactical teams working in synergy with vigilante groups of the area were able to repel the attack/attempt to set the palace of Eze Imo; HRH Eze Dr E. C. Okeke on fire by men suspected to be members of the proscribed IPOB/ESN groups at Ezioha Amaifeke in Orlu LGA of Owerri, lmo State.\n\n\u201cThe hoodlums, in their numbers, besieged the palace of the traditional ruler armed with assorted weapons but were subdued by the superior fire-power of the Command\u2019s tactical teams and in the process, one of the hoodlums was neutralised while others fled into the bush with bullet injuries.\u201d",

          "text": "A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Director General Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) Salihu Moh Lukman has faulted campaign in some quarters for the postponement of the party\u2019s national convention from February date.\n\nThe APC chieftain described as \u2018illogical\u2019 recommendation through a letter written by Senator Orji Uzor Kalu to the APC CECPC Chairman, Mai Mala Buni, dated December 13, 2021, calling for the postponement of the APC convention.\n\nIn an open letter to all the APC leaders Monday in Abuja, Lukman warned of the repeat of 2019 Zamfara experience if the needful was not done.\n\nThe APC chieftain said: \u201cIt is very difficult to excuse the CECPC from the campaign to postpone the February Convention. If the CECPC is not interested in the postponement of the Convention from the agreed February 2022 date, why is it difficult to make formal announcement about the date and venue of the Convention? Statutorily, by the requirement of the Electoral Act, the party is expected to serve at least 21 days\u2019 notice of the Convention to INEC, which basically means that if the Convention is to hold any day before February 28, 2021, the notice to INEC should be given on or before February 7, 2022. That being the case, the temptation could be to argue that there is more time. Some reminders would be necessary at this point.\n\n\u201cOnce that is the case, we would have succeeded in making the 2019 Zamfara electoral disaster a national phenomenon in 2023. Is that what the CECPC members under the leadership of His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni want to subject the party to?\u201d\n\nThe letter warned Governor Mai Mala Buni not to allow all his good work as CECPC be destroyed.\n\n\u201cWith the emergence of the CECPC in June 2020, His Excellency Mai Mala has done an excellent job by bringing down tension within the party. Sadly, all the good work of the CECPC under His Excellency Mai Mala is about to be destroyed once it yields to the temptation of staying longer than February 2022,\u201d the PGF boss said.\n\nWhile calling on APC leaders to wake up to the responsibility of providing the needed political leadership to the country, Lukman said: \u201cNo one should imagine that agendas set in 2014 or 2019 are sufficient to respond to contemporary challenges, which post-2023 governance will be expected to respond to. If anything, it may also be important to emphasise the fact that to respond to contemporary challenges facing the country would require massive investment in human capital development in the country.\n\n\u201cThis will call for a deliberate and aggressive policy to mobilise large scale public investment to rebuild public schools at all levels. The correlation between collapse of education since the mid 1980s, rising levels of unemployment and insecurity are very glaring. As a party, we must come up with practically convincing answers, which should form the basis of public support by Nigerians to guarantee victory in 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThe burden of responsibility to strengthen the capacity of the APC to put itself on a vantage position to commence internal negotiation around all these issues is on the CECPC, especially, the Chairman, His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cInability to discharge this responsibility or avoid it by toying the path of a deceptive campaign for postponement of Convention can only spell doom for the APC and return Nigeria to the hands of those who laid the foundation for all the challenges facing the country.\n\n\u201cBy way of an appeal to APC leaders, as much as the question of who emerge as the candidate of the party is very important, it is not only who emerge as a candidate of the party that can win the election. But how united are party leaders behind the candidate will be a more determining factor. President Buhari, with all his mass support in the Northern part of the country, may not have won the election in 2015 without the unity of all APC leaders from every part of the country. All APC leaders must be reminded that, there is no one political leader in the country that enjoy convincing mass support of any region of the country.\u201d\n\nInsisting on agreed February date for the national convention, Salihu said: \u201cThe only reason why some leaders, perhaps including the members of CECPC, are attracted to campaign for postponement for the Convention is the deceptive belief that any candidate who emerged, whether elected or imposed on the party can win the 2023 elections. This is a big lie!\n\n\u201cFinally, we must also appeal to the CECPC to ensure that the February 2022 Convention is not just about electing NWC members. There must be some reflections about the challenges facing the country, with priority focus on problems of insecurity, rebuilding public education and health through mobilisation of massive financial investment in these sectors.\u201d\n\nObahiagbon urges Buhari, CECPC\n\nIn a related development, an APC chieftain and former federal lawmaker, Hon. Patrick Obahiagbon, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari and the Buni-led CECPC to propound a pathway for the party ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nObahiagbon gave the charge Monday in Abuja, in a letter of commendation to the committee chairman.\n\nThe former legislator further advised that personal and selfish interests must not override the interest of the party.\n\n\u201cThe party interest is more paramount than parochial and self centered agitations from a microscopic few\u201d he said.\n\nHe said \u201cthe facts are indubitably too plain to be contested Your Excellency, that our great party was largely fractious and tottering at its perilous precipice and brinks, when both destiny and history beckoned on you to provide durable leadership for us all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the considered opinion of the majority of our party members that Your Excellency has not just only steered the party away from avoidable cataracts and icebergs but that you have also enviably returned our party to its winning ways and glorious path,\u201d he said.\n\nThe legislator said the inspiring leadership style and consultative approach of the Chairman in addition to the \u201ccoruscating humility, visceral connectivity with the rank and file of the party and disciplined interpersonal skills has commended itself to all and sundry.\u201d",

          "text": "A renowned Third Republic politician and runner-up in the controversially annulled June 12, 1993 election, Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa is dead.\n\nThe 74-year-old former presidential candidate of the defunct National Republican Convention (NRC), family sources said, passed on after a brief illness at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital Kano at about 4.00am Monday.\n\nIt was also gathered that the elder statesman was just recovering from an illness he had battled with for about a week which he could not however survive.\n\nHis death came 23 years after his opponent in the 1993 election and candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Bashorun MKO Abiola passed on under some mysterious circumstances while in incarceration.\n\nThe shocking news of Tofa\u2019s death came at a time residents were in their homes battling with the cold weather and observing the new year holiday.\n\nHis corpse was buried at Hajj Camp, a public cemetery in the Kano metropolis, with the brief funeral rites completed at his Gandun Albasa residence after the Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado-Bayero, prayed for the repose of his soul.\n\nAt the solemn ceremony wereformer governor of Kano state, Senator Ibrahim Shekarau, a former Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, and a former Secretary to the Kano State Government, Sule Yahaya-Hamma among several others.\n\nAnd as a mark of respect, President Muhammadu Buhari has sent a federal government delegation to Kano to commiserate with the deceased\u2019s family.\n\n\u2018Death premonition\u2019\n\nThe elder statesman was in recent time at various public functions, including a one-day sensitisation workshop organised two months ago by the Gidado Mukhtar-led Northern Reform Organisation (NRO) at the Centre for Democratic Studies, Mambaya House, Kano some two months ago.\n\nAddressing the gathering comprising northern youth, the politician told his audience that he and his age group were at the point of exiting the world and meeting their creator, a statement suggesting he may have had the premonition of his death.\n\nHe used the forum to admonish the North to embrace the concept of unity and brotherhood for the region to maintain and uphold its revered status.\n\nTaking his turn at the event, the business mogul said where leaders at the top echelon of authority became utterly spineless and inactive; the situation could only be complicated with no lasting solution in sight.\n\n\u201cThe North is almost on the precipice in all directions. Banditry, kidnapping by those who are heartless have become the order of the day and the degree of insouciance and lack of concern exhibited by those calling the shots in the corridors of power is highly outrageous. It is high time for all concerned northerners to wake up from their slumber. There is the compelling need for us to match our words with action.\n\n\u201cThe future of the country belongs to the youths who are supposed to rise to the challenge of the present time. It is your responsibility to buckle up and do what is right in the bid to reposition the country on a high pedestal. We are telling you this because we have almost exhausted our sojourn on the planet. What is left for us at present is to answer the call of our creator. We did what we were supposed to do in pushing the country to greater height,\u201d the elder statesman had said.\n\nWhile also counselling youth on their relationship with politicians, he said: \u201cI also want to remind you people on the need to avoid falling into the hands of some egocentric and self-centred politicians whose major pre-occupation is to use you as cannon-fodder in achieving their selfish and capricious design at the time they became desperate to clinch power. They are using you as mere guinea pigs in the dirty game to grab power at all cost. You should be wary of this sinister design.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call yourself a leader when you are stealing and fleecing the public treasury. You can\u2019t be respected while you are busy amassing ill-gotten wealth at the expense of the peoples\u2019 interest. We have had our time, and we are not going to remain on this planet forever. We want people most especially the youths to rise to the challenge of resisting leaders with primordial interest and egocentric permutations,\u201d Tofa further told his audience.\n\nBuhari, Ganduje mourn\n\nAnd in a condolence message, President Muhammadu Buhari described Tofa as \u201ca politician of note, who was also a promoter of Islamic culture and civilisation.\u201d\n\nHe said the deceased was a true nationalist that would be difficult to replace\n\nThe president said this in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe late Tofa was noted for his untiring commitment to public enlightenment and was unafraid to speak the truth all the time that he lived.\n\n\u201cHe set up the Bureau for Islamic Propagation, BIP, in the mid-80s that helped to unite Muslim Scholars in the Northern States, narrowing the differences that characterised their relationships. The BIP also published books and newspapers.\n\n\u201cHe was, till the end, a patriot to the core. He envisaged a better Nigeria for all. We pray that this dream and collective aspiration and necessary commitment will not go with him. We owe it to his memory and to the nation.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari prayed Allah to repose his soul and grant the bereaved family and friends, the Kano Emirate Council as well as the government and people of Kano state the fortitude to bear the loss.\n\nThe statement also said the president dispatched a delegation to Kano with a condolence letter to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje.\n\nOn the team were Ministers of Defence, Bashir Magashi, and Water Resources, Sulaiman Adamu, accompanied by the Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media and Publicity), Garba Shehu, and the Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris.\n\nGanduje\n\nIn a similar condolence, Governor Ganduje said Tofa\u2019s contributions to Nigeria\u2019s democracy remained indelible.\n\nIn a statement by the Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, the governor said Tofa started taking up leadership responsibilities at an early age when he was elected councillor in Tofa in his late 20s.\n\nThe governor said he remained vibrant and dynamic up till the time of his death.\n\nAs a businessman, trader, and philanthropist, the governor said Tofa touched the lives of many people, especially the down-trodden, and expressed the belief that the legacies of the deceased would be approximated for posterity.\n\n\u201cThe legacy of his political beliefs and triumphs will be important footnotes in the literature of Nigeria\u2019s government and politics for generations yet to come.\n\n\u201cHe was a great man, a quintessential democrat and outstanding statesman who has left veryhold prints both on the politics and political history of Nigeria, \u201cthe statement further said.\n\nHe prayed Almighty Allah to grant his soul Aljannah Firdausi and the fortitude for his family, friends and associates to bear the irreparable loss.\n\nAtiku\n\nSimilarly, former Vice President and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar, described Tofa as \u201ca thoroughbred democrat whose contributions to the growth of democratic governance in Nigeria is invaluable.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by his media adviser, Paul Ibe, the former VP noted that, \u201cthroughout his political career, the late Tofa was a politician who believed in the power of ideas and ideologies and was never associated with political violence or any other anti-democratic behaviour.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Waziri Adamawa, who was in touch with Tofa until his last days, stressed that the statesman and politician, who had been preoccupied with the state of affairs in Nigeria in recent times, and especially as it impacted the North, was a \u201cbalanced and incisive\u201d personality.\n\n\u201cAccording to Atiku, his (Tofa\u2019s) style of politics and the panache with which he engaged political opponents will remain classical in Nigeria\u2019s political history and are worthy of emulation by contemporary political actors and the future generations.\n\n\u201cAtiku therefore expresses his deepest condolence to the bereaved families and associates of the late patriarch and political icon and the people and government of Kano State. He prays to the Almighty Allah to grant him Aljannah Firdaus,\u201d Ibe said.\n\nAnyim, Badaru too\n\nAlso, a presidential aspirant of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) described him as one committed to a peaceful Nigeria.\n\nThe former Senate President said \u201cthroughout the electioneering campaigns leading to the 1993 presidential elections, in which he was the candidate of the National Republican Convention (NRC), Alhaji Tofa never did anything, in words or actions, that could have instigated crisis in any form.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by his media adviser, Sam Nwaobasi, the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation(SGF) noted that the late Tofa was a committed Nigerian who throughout his more than 40 years of active partisan politics demonstrated his strong belief in politics of accommodation and consensus building.\n\n0\u2033He was so committed to a peaceful Nigeria that throughout the electioneering campaigns leading to the 1993 presidential elections, in which he was the candidate of the National Republican Convention (NRC), Alhaji Tofa never did anything, in words or actions, that could have instigated crisis in any form.\n\n\u201cSen. Anyim commends Alhaji Tofa\u2019s \u201cpolitics without bitterness\u201d and strongly recommends such disposition to politicians of today in the interest of the peace, unity and harmony of our dear country even as we approach the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cSen Anyim regrets that Alhaji Tofa died when his experience and elderly counsel would be most needed as the country battles with multiple challenges.\n\n\u201cSen. Anyim deeply condoles with the late Alhaji Tofa\u2019s family, the good people of Kano State and Alhaji Tofa\u2019s many friends and associates all over Nigeria. He prays that Almighty God will grant the Soul of Alhaji Tofa eternal rest,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn another condolence message, Jigawa state Governor Muhammad Badaru lauded the late politician as a statesman, industrialist, politician and community leader.\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Habibu Kila, the governor said the politician lived and died in the service of humanity.\n\nNorthern speakers mourn\n\nIn yet another message, the Northern Speakers Forum lauded the deceased industrialist as a perfect gentleman.\n\nThe forum\u2019s chairman and Speaker Kaduna State House of Assembly, Yusuf Zailani, said this in a statement by his media aide, Ibrahim Danfulani.\n\nHe said: \u201cAll through his life time, he was never named among controversial politicians that flame embers of disunity, confusion and disintegration.\u201d\n\nThey said Tofa never played do-or-die politics, noting that he was an embodiment of democracy at its finest.\n\n\u201cHe will be deeply missed by all for his silent role in stabilising the polity,\u201d the statement added.\n\nNRO, Arewa youth\n\nIn his tribute, NRO chairman, Alhaji Mukhtar described the deceased politician \u201cas a great icon of high repute who had toiled blood and sweat in serving humanity.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the late elder states man died with the ambition of making Kano a citadel of pride in all spheres of human endeavours, stressing that losing a personality of his calibre is a great loss to the entire society.\n\nHe extolled the Tofa\u2019s in the promotion of the norms and ideals of the Islamic religion and called on his contemporaries to emulate him.\n\nIn another message of condolence, the chairperson, Arewa Youth Consultative Council (AYCC), Zaidu Ayuba, described Tofa as the most reliable, promising and listening pillar of the group.\n\nAyuba said the deceased who was the patron to the AYCC was its greatest pillar that always tried to \u201cshield us from misbehaving as youths with exuberance. He always taught us tact and approaches in politics.\n\n\u201cToday, we lost our greatest pillar. This is a non recuperating loss. We pray for Allah\u2019s mercy and Rahma to his soul. May Aljannah be his home, May we find the fortitude to bear the loss with strong Iman. Farewell to our leader,\u201d AYCC said in a statement.\n\nNorthern summit on hold\n\nMeanwhile, a Coalition of 52 Northern Groups (CNG) has postponed its planned security summit following the death of Alhaji Tofa.\n\nCNG\u2019s national coordinator, Balarabe Rufai, announced this Monday while briefing journalists in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the late Tofa was billed to chair the occasion which was earlier slated for the 5th and 6th of January 2022 in the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nWhile noting that Tofa\u2019s death came as a huge shock, Rufai said: \u201cOn behalf of the entire CNG family and affiliates, we express a deep sense of sorrow over the death of this elder statesman and mentor, who was a one-time presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe CNG owes immeasurable gratitude to the late Bashir Tofa whose leadership, sacrifice, statesmanship, patriotism and unwavering commitment to the interests of the people of Northern Nigeria, and citizens of Nigeria as a whole has few parallels.\n\n\u201cWe mourn the passing of this man from whose life and works we have drawn inspiration and we must strive, in all we do, to live with the personal and social values and standards he lived and set for himself.\n\n\u201cThe late Tofa was a passionate believer of the organic links between generations who was always available for young people.\n\n\u201cThe CNG in particular, the North and Nigeria generally have certainly lost a great statesman, but the youth lost a mentor, guardian, living history and an embodiment of all the exemplary qualities young Northerners should strive to achieve.\n\n\u201cAs a mark of respect and with a grieving heart, we wish to announce the inadvertent postponement of the planned Pan Northern Security Summit scheduled for 5th and 6th of January to a date to be announced soon. The late Bashir Othman Tofa was to be the chairman of the occasion,\u201d Rufai said.\n\n\u201cWe also wish to condole with the convener of the Northern Elders Forum, Professor Ango Abdullahi; the Chairman of Arewa Consultative Forum, Chief Audu Ogbeh; the BOT Chairman of Coalition of Northern Groups, Dr Nastura Ashir Sharrif; and the entire CNG family over the loss of this great man,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Fallen US biotech star Elizabeth Holmes was convicted on Monday of defrauding investors in her blood-testing startup Theranos, in a high-profile case seen as an indictment of Silicon Valley culture.\n\nHolmes is a rare example of a tech exec being brought to book over a company flaming out, in a sector littered with the carcasses of money-losing companies that once promised untold riches.\n\nHer case shone a spotlight on the blurred line between the hustle that characterizes the industry and outright criminal dishonesty.\n\nREAD ALSO: Two Drones Shot Down Targeting Iraq Base \u2013 Anti-IS Coalition\n\nJurors took seven days of deliberations to reach their verdict, finding her guilty of four counts of tricking investors into pouring money into what she claimed was a revolutionary testing system.\n\nBut the panel \u2014 who had listened to weeks of sometimes complex evidence \u2014 also acquitted her on four charges and could not reach a verdict on three others.\n\n\u201cThe guilty verdicts, in this case, reflect Ms. Holmes\u2019 culpability in this large-scale investor fraud and she must now face sentencing for her crimes,\u201d US Attorney Stephanie Hinds said in a prepared statement read outside the courthouse by a representative.\n\nHolmes made no comment as she left the court when asked if she intended to appeal.\n\nThe 37-year-old now faces the possibility of 20 years behind bars for each conviction. She remains at liberty ahead of another hearing on the terms of her bail next week. No date was set for sentencing.\n\nHolmes had vowed to revolutionise health diagnostics with self-service machines that could run an array of tests on just a few drops of blood, a vision that drew high-profile backers and made her a billionaire by the age of 30.\n\nShe was hailed as the next tech visionary on magazine covers and collected mountains of investors\u2019 cash, but it all collapsed after Wall Street Journal reporting revealed the machines did not work as promised.\n\nProsecutors spent 11 weeks presenting over two dozen witnesses, as they painstakingly laid out their argument that Holmes knew her technology fell short, and deliberately misled investors and patients.\n\nShe personally put the logos of pharma giants Pfizer and Schering-Plough onto Theranos reports hailing the company\u2019s blood-testing technology, which were then shared with investors.\n\nThat was done without the firms\u2019 permission and was a key piece of the prosecution\u2019s argument that she purposely tried to inflate Theranos\u2019s credibility in order to win backers.",

The major gap, however, is that no date or details of Committees, their membership and terms of reference, were given,a worrisome situation.\n\nGiven the roll out of political activities for the year, Mr Lukman advised the Caretaker Committee to set up relevant committee for the party\u2019s national assembly, to rest speculations is some quarters that the convention will not hold in February.",

The roof of the Old Wing, which dates back to 1884 and houses the upper chamber, the National Council of Provinces, also partially collapsed.\n\nThe new blaze broke out on Monday.\n\n\u201cAround midnight the fire was brought under control,\u201d Cape Town city officials said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cTeams are now working their way through the maize-like building, room-for-room, as they attempt to locate and extinguish [hot spots].\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a lengthy process, as some rooms are needing to have their interior wooden cladding pulled apart, in order to identify any concealed hot spots,\u201d they said.\n\nThe fire swept through the buildings but officials have said important sections including a museum with artworks and heritage objects were saved, as was an embroidered tapestry telling the story of the Eastern Cape on the ground floor of the Old Assembly Building.\n\n\u201cThis building is very important to South Africans,\u201d Al Jazeera\u2019s Jillian Wolfe, reporting from outside the complex, said. \u201cIt is a place that is the heartbeat of democracy, it is the place where the parliamentarians gather to debate policy and legislation, and it is also where the president delivers the state of the nation address,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThere is going to be some significant cost involved in refurbishing this building.\u201d\n\nOn Monday evening, crowds of people gathered outside the complex as crews of tired firefighters continued their hours-long efforts to put out the flames.\n\n\u201cTo see the walls burning like this, it makes me very sad,\u201d Danny, a Cape Town resident, told Al Jazeera. \u201cI\u2019m actually lost for words to see this happening.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Parliament said in a statement only six of the 10 fire trucks were now remaining on the scene and it was hoped that more trucks would be withdrawn during the course of the morning.\n\n\u201cFurther damage has been caused, with more floors of the building, which houses offices of Members of Parliament and support staff, being completely gutted,\u201d the statement said.\n\nA 49-year-old man charged with arson and other offences including theft was expected to appear in court on Tuesday.\n\nThe elite Hawks police unit said on Monday the suspect was believed to have gained entry to the Parliament through an office window.",

Goita initially pledged that the February elections would be held as planned but the government has since cited persistent insecurity in Mali\u2019s restive north in its decision to postpone the polls.\n\nLarge parts of the country\u2019s territory remain out of the government\u2019s control as self-defence militias and armed men affiliated with al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS) mete out violence on civilians and soldiers.\n\nThe violence, in which ideologically-motivated armed groups have stoked ethnic tensions while jockeying for power, has spilled into the neighbouring countries of Niger and Burkina Faso, destabilising the wider Sahel region and leaving a massive humanitarian crisis in its wake.",

          "title": "South Africa Parliament Fire Flares Up Again",
          "text": "A devastating fire which swept through South Africa\u2019s parliament in Cape Town reignited just hours after it was said to be under control.\n\nFlames were seen billowing from the building\u2019s roof on Monday, as firefighters tried to douse the blaze.\n\nThe fire first broke out on Sunday and completely destroyed the National Assembly, or lower chamber.\n\nPolice have arrested a suspect who will appear in court on Tuesday on charges of arson, housebreaking and theft.\n\nAuthorities had warned that flare-ups would be possible because of carpets and wooden floors in the building, with parliamentary spokesman Moloto Mathapo telling South Africa\u2019s TimesLive some firefighters had \u201cworked throughout the night\u201d to try and prevent further blazes.\n\nBut just 12 firefighters were on site when the wind reignited wood above the National Assembly on Monday, according to news agency AFP. Despite reinforcements being sent, flames could still be seen emerging from the building as night fell.\n\nAn update from the city council at 22:00 local time (20:00 GMT) said the building\u2019s fourth and fifth floors had been completely destroyed. It was not immediately clear if the blaze had been extinguished.\n\nOn Sunday, President Cyril Ramaphosa \u2013 who admitted the building\u2019s sprinkler system had not functioned properly \u2013 praised firefighters for responding to the \u201cterrible and devastating event\u201d in minutes.\n\nGovernment minister Patricia de Lille separately admitted that CCTV cameras were not being monitored at the time the initial fire started.\n\nThe chairperson of the upper chamber, Amos Masondo, said Sunday\u2019s fire had led to the \u201ccomplete burning down\u201d of the National Assembly chamber. Other areas of the parliamentary complex \u2013 parts of which date back to 1884 \u2013 were also badly damaged.\n\nThe parliament is not currently in session because of the holidays, and no-one was injured.\n\nThe building is home to thousands of treasures including historic books, photographs and important works of art, which officials said had been saved.\n\nThere had been particular concern that the valuable Keiskamma Tapestry, which is 120m (394ft) long and documents South Africa\u2019s history, may have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe Houses of Parliament in Cape Town are made up of three sections, with the oldest dating back to 1884. The newer sections built in the 1920s and 1980s house the National Assembly. The government is based in Pretoria.\n\nMr Ramaphosa on Sunday spoke of his sadness at \u201cthis destruction of the home of our democracy\u201d.\n\nParliament said \u201call efforts\u201d would be made to limit any disruption to its work, but it is expected to be many months before the building can be used again.\n\nCape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said the city\u2019s council chamber would be made available as an alternative place for parliament to meet.\n\nIt was the second fire at the parliament in under a year. In March there was a fire caused by an electrical fault.\n\nLast year, a wildfire ravaged part of the University of Cape Town\u2019s library, which was home to a unique collection of African archives.",

But as evidence mounted, the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Aerospace Force said an air defence unit had mistaken the Boeing 737-800 for a US missile.\n\nIran\u2019s air defences had been on high alert because the country had just fired ballistic missiles at two Iraqi military bases hosting US forces.

          "title": "Former Theranos CEO Holmes Convicted of Fraud and Conspiracy",
          "text": "In a case that exposed Silicon Valley\u2019s culture of hubris and hype, Elizabeth Holmes was convicted Monday of duping investors into believing her startup Theranos had developed a revolutionary medical device that could detect a multitude of diseases and conditions from a few drops of blood.\n\nA jury convicted Holmes, who was CEO throughout the company\u2019s turbulent 15-year history, on two counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud after seven days of deliberation. The 37-year-old was acquitted on four other counts of fraud and conspiracy that alleged she deceived patients who paid for Theranos blood tests, too.\n\nThe verdict came after the eight men and four women on the jury spent three months sitting through a complex trial that featured reams of evidence and 32 witness \u2014 including Holmes herself. She now faces up to 20 years in prison for each count, although legal experts say she is unlikely to receive the maximum sentence.\n\nThe jury deadlocked on three remaining charges, which a federal judge anticipates dismissing as part of a mistrial ruling that could come as early as next week. The split verdicts are \u201ca mixed bag for the prosecution, but it\u2019s a loss for Elizabeth Holmes because she is going away to prison for at least a few years,\u201d said David Ring, a lawyer who has followed the case closely.\n\nFederal prosecutors depicted Holmes as a charlatan obsessed with fame and fortune. In seven days on the witness stand, she cast herself as a visionary trailblazer in male-dominated Silicon Valley who was emotionally and sexually abused by her former lover and business partner, Sunny Balwani.\n\nThe trial also laid bare the pitfalls of a swaggering strategy used by many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs \u2014 conveying a boundless optimism regardless of whether it\u2019s warranted, known as \u201cfake it \u2018til you make it.\u201d That ethos helped hatch groundbreaking companies such as Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Apple \u2014 the latter co-founded by one of Holmes\u2019 heroes, Steve Jobs.\n\nHer conviction might lower the wattage \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 on the brash promises and bold exaggerations that have become a routine part of the tech industry\u2019s innovation hustle.\n\nThe trial\u2019s outcome \u201cwill send a message to CEOs that there are consequences in overstepping the bounds,\u201d predicted Ellen Kreitzberg, a Santa Clara University law professor who attended the trial. But she also believes greed will keep hyperbole alive in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cInvestors are still going to want to make more money on a promising idea.,\u201d Kreitzberg said. \u201cThey will always go in for the golden ring.\u201d\n\nHolmes remained seated and expressed no visible emotion as the verdicts were read. She bowed her head several times before the jury was polled by U.S. District Judge Edward Davila. After the judge left the courtroom to meet with jurors individually, Holmes got up to hug her partner, Billy Evans, and her parents before leaving with her lawyers.\n\nDuring a brief break after the verdict read, a visibly shaken Evans stepped into the courthouse hallway to get a get drink from a water fountain while apparently trying to compose himself.\n\nHolmes did not respond to questions about the verdicts lobbed at her during a three-block walk from the courthouse to the nearby hotel where she has stayed during jury deliberations.\n\nShe was to remain free on bond while awaiting sentencing, which will be determined by the judge. The judge indicated that he is likely to hold off on the sentencing until the completion of a separate trial involving similar fraud charges against Balwani, who was Theranos\u2019 chief operating officer from 2009 to 2016. Balwani\u2019s trial is scheduled to start next month in the same San Jose courtroom where Holmes\u2019 legal saga unfolded.\n\nIn a written statement, U.S. Attorney Stephanie Hinds thanked the jury for navigating the case through the pandemic and said Holmes must now be held \u201cculpable\u201d for her crimes.\n\nAlthough she was convicted of bamboozling investors, Holmes received a reprieve from the jury on the fraud accusations involving patients who submitted to inaccurate blood tests that could have endangered their health.\n\nRing said the charges related to the patients looked more difficult to prove from the outset because Holmes never directly communicated with them, as she did with investors.\n\nThe bold dream Holmes pursued when she founded Theranos in 2003 at the age of 19 had become a nightmare by the time she was indicted on felony charges in 2018.\n\nDuring that span, Holmes went from an unknown to a Silicon Valley sensation who had amassed a $4.5 billion fortune on paper to a vilified failure. Her downfall was dissected in documentaries, books, podcasts and will soon be rehashed in a Hulu TV series called \u201cThe Dropout\u201d starring Amanda Seyfried in the lead role.\n\nHolmes set out to create a less painful, more convenient and cheaper way to scan for hundreds of diseases and other health problems by taking just a few drops of blood with a finger prick instead of inserting a needle in a vein. She aimed to upend an industry dominated by giant testing companies such as Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp, starting with setting up \u201cmini-labs\u201d in Walgreens and Safeway stores across the U.S. that would use a small Theranos device called the Edison to run faster, less intrusive blood tests.\n\nThe concept \u2014 and the way Holmes presented it \u2014 enthralled wealthy investors eager to buy an early stake in a game-changing company. It helped Theranos raise more than $900 million from savvy billionaires such as media mogul Rupert Murdoch and software magnate Larry Ellison, as well as well-to-do families such as the Waltons of Walmart and the DeVos clan behind Amway.\n\nHolmes also wooed a well-connected board that included two former U.S. secretaries of state, Henry Kissinger and the late George Shultz: two former secretaries of defense, Gen. James Mattis and William Perry; former Sen. Sam Nunn; and former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich. She charmed former President Bill Clinton in an on-stage presentation and impressed then-Vice President Joe Biden, who effusively praised her during a 2015 tour of a Theranos lab.\n\nWhat most people did not know at the time was that Theranos\u2019 blood-testing technology kept producing misleading results. That forced patients to undergo regular blood draws instead of the promised finger sticks and led Theranos to secretly test those samples using conventional machines in a traditional laboratory setting. Evidence presented at the trial also showed that Holmes lied about purported deals that Theranos had reached with big drug companies such as Pfizer and the U.S. military.\n\nThe deception came to light in 2015 after a series of explosive articles in The Wall Street Journal and a regulatory audit of Theranos uncovered potentially dangerous flaws in the company\u2019s technology, leading to its eventual collapse.\n\nDuring her testimony, Holmes occasionally expressed contrition for her handling of a variety of issues, but she often contended that she had forgotten the circumstance surrounding some of the key events spotlighted by the prosecution. She insisted she never stopped believing that Theranos was on the verge of refining its technology.",
