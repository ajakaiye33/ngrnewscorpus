          "title": "Why young women with cancer should freeze their eggs before chemotherapy \u2013Gynaecologist",
          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nA Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Dr. Morenikeji Olaniyi has urged young women who have cancer to consider freezing their eggs before starting chemotherapy treatment.\n\nOlaniyi, who is a fertility specialist with Bridge Clinic Fertility Centre, made this call in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise.\n\nShe noted that freezing eggs by young women with cancer was necessary before undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nEgg freezing is a process in which a woman\u2019s eggs are extracted, frozen and stored as a method to preserve reproductive potential in women of reproductive age.\n\nShe said that due to chemotherapy and radiation treatment that women with cancer will undergo, freezing their eggs enhances their chances of having children in the future.\n\n\u201cCryopreservation is also for young women coming down with cancer. Ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, anal cancer or any form of cancer that may require chemotherapy.\n\n\u201cSo, we advise them to come for ovarian cryopreservation.\n\n\u201cEven sometimes we cryopreserve the ovarian tissues in which we may later stimulate to get eggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause once you expose them to radiation and chemotherapy, such treatments may kill those cells, they may regenerate abnormally and give problems to the offspring.\n\n\u201cSo, in those situations, we advise the women to go for cryopreservation before undergoing surgery for cancer.\n\n\u201cI have a young lady under the age of 22 who has cancer.\n\n\u201cTreatment was to commence and in such a case we had to bring her in so that we could get her eggs and cryopreserve them for her. \u201cWhen she is clear cancer and clean she can always come back for the eggs,\u201d she said.\n\nThe consultant gynecologist stated that it was advisable not to freeze eggs for more than 10 years.\n\nOlaniyi also urged women who wish to preserve their eggs to consider doing so before they turn 35.\n\nThis, she said, is to prevent the freezing of low-quality eggs that may not yield the desired result in the future.\n\n\u201cAs we grow older our fertility drops and the older women grow the poorer the quality of their eggs.\n\n\u201cOnce a woman is 35 and it looks like she may not likely get married in the next few months or years, it is best she freezes her eggs. Because if you are freezing eggs for a woman at 40, the quality can never be the same as freezing a woman\u2019s eggs at 30,\u201d she said.\n\nThe problem with freezing the eggs of a 40-year-old woman, Olaniyi said, is that after 40, the quality of the egg produced is reduced.\n\n\u201cYou are getting like three or four eggs and you cannot even guaranty the quality. So, it is a problem.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, if you stimulate a woman at 30 or 35 years you can get like 15 to 20 eggs and the quality is top-notch. And that is what gives you the results for fertilisation by the time you need them in years to come,\u201d the gynaecologist said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nDayo Johnson Akure\n\nLeaders and youths in Ifon Community, in the Ose council area of Ondo state, have cried out over high profile killings by gunmen in the area.\n\nRecall that a first-class traditional ruler, the Olufon of lfon Oba Israel Adegoke Adewusi was gruesomely murdered by suspected herdsmen at Elegbeka village while returning from a meeting in Akure, the state capital on November 26 last year.\n\nAlso, last week, a chieftain of the ruling All Progressive Congress in the state and a member of the state executive committee, Hon Dele Isibor, was shot dead by suspected kidnappers along Imoru road in Ifon town.\n\nThe Coordinator of Progressive Minds, Hon. Olaniyi Eni-Olotu at a meeting in lfon, who lamented the killings said that\u201d the killing of Isibor which occurred last weekend, was coming when the area was yet to recover from the sudden killing of the Olufon of Ifon, late Oba Israel Adegoke Adeusi on the 26th of November, 2020 by yet to be identified gunmen at Elegbeka village while returning from a meeting in Akure\n\nEni-Olotu said that the community was again thrown into \u201canother round of pandemonium on the 13th of June, 2021, when kidnappers struck again along Imoru road in Ifon town, shooting sporadically at all the vehicles plying the route last weekend.\n\n\u2018\u201dThis unfortunate incidence led to the killing of the APC chieftain, Dele Isibor, having sustained severe injuries from the gunshot and four people were kidnapped by the gunmen.\n\n\u201d The influx of the heavily armed herdsmen from other neighbouring states into the forest reserves and farmland in and around the community is now making life miserable for farmers and the inhabitants of the area.\n\nEni-Olotu said it is so sad to note that the Police Divisional Headquarters in Ifon as well as the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Ifon office have no functional patrol vehicles which constitutes a major challenge for the security agencies in doing their job effectively and efficiently.\n\nHe pleaded with the state government for special consideration to be given to Ifon indigenes for the recruitment into the Amotekun Corps, as they are more familiar with the terrain and work more to fight insecurity confronting the area.\n\nThe community, he added also pleaded for the intervention of the President, Inspector General of Police and the Government to fish out the killers of Oba Israel Adegoke Adeusi and Dele Isibor in order to bring them to book without further delay.\n\n\u201cWe also appeal that for the provision of patrol vehicles for the security agencies in Ifon to enhance their smooth operations of securing the land, also through the heavy deployment of security operatives, especially to the forest reserves.\n\n\u201cAll illegal occupants of the forest reserves and farmlands must be chased out without further delay.\n\nOne of the community leaders, Sunday Amudeli who spoke at the meeting said that Ifon community had been in the news for over a year as a result of insecurity and other wrong reasons either about killing or kidnapping.\n\nAmudeli further stated that Ifon occupies a strategic location in the State, serving as a boundary to Edo and Ondo State.\n\n\u201c A Mobile Police Station is needed as a matter of urgency or an establishment of a Military barracks or a naval base. The community is conducive and is ready to provide the land for stability, peace and to maintain law and order.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Youths, Abdullahi Ekere said that they do not want to take law into their hands, hence they are calling on President Buhari, the IGP, Military and the state government to provide effective security in the area",

John James Akpanudoedehe in a statement said the Committee will be inaugurated on Wednesday, June 30th, 2021 at the Party\u2019s National Secretariat, Abuja.\n\nMembers of the committee are Sen. Julius Ucha, Hajia Maryam Mamu Salifu, and Alh. Bukar Ali Dalori while Dr. Ijeoma Arodiogbu will serve as Secretary.\n\nALSO READ: Immigration boss, others hail Ugwuanyi on peace, development, support to security agencies\n\n\u201cIn this capacity, the five-member committee is expected to hear all appeals arising from the conduct of the Primary Election in line with the provisions of our Party\u2019s Constitution and Guidelines for the nomination of candidates\u201d, the statement added.\n\nMeanwhile, seven aspirants of the party have faulted the exercise, describing it as a charade.\n\nThey are Chief Edozie Madu, Chief George Moghalu, Paul Orajiaka, Sir Azuka Okwuosa, Chidozie Nwankwo, Onunkwo JohnBosco and Col. Geoff Onyejegbu.\n\nThe aspirants in a statement after many long months of actively campaigning in every corner of the State, \u201con Saturday we mobilised party men and supporters to the designated voting centres and waited from morning till night for elections that did not hold\u201d.\n\nThey added that \u201cin the three hundred and twenty-six (326) electoral wards of Anambra State, party members waited for election officers and materials to arrive and for accreditation and voting to begin. In some areas, those materials arrived late in the evening, hours after the polling should have ended, and by which time voters had gone home. In other places, neither materials nor officials came.\n\n\u201cIn the evening at about 6pm, eleven of the fourteen aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) held a briefing with the members of the press to inform the nation of what was happening. At the time of the briefing, elections had not begun in the State.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Minister of Labour and Productivity, and leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State, His Excellency Dr. Chris Nwabueze Ngige informed both the Chairman of the Primary Election Committee for Anambra State and the National Chairman of the Party, His Excellency Mai Mala Buni of the unfortunate development and also spoke to the press indicating his disappointment that neither election materials nor officials had arrived in his community or any other part of Anambra State to hold elections. The State Chapter of the party, through the Publicity Secretary, Okelo Madukaife also raised alarm about the fact of no elections in any part of the State.\n\nALSO READ: NIN: NIMC registers 57.3m Nigerians\n\n\u201cYet, in the early hours of Sunday, 27th June 2021, the Primary Etection Committee for Anambra State led by the Governor of Ogun State, Prince (Dr.) Dapo Abiodun announced purported results and declared a winner. Setting aside for the moment our profound disappointment with the abominable conduct of Dapo Abiodun and the Committee he led, let us State categorically and with the highest confidence that the results announced Sunday morning are figments of the imagination of the announcers and have no basis in reality. What we are witnessing now is a show of shame that ridicules all of us, and further erodes the standing of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State, and the South East of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have gathered evidence including pictures and videos, sworn statements by security officials, and party election officials, and we are able to prove in any arena we are called, that primary elections did not hold in Anambra State on Saturday. We will wish each one of us, take action together and separately to prevent the imposition of a candidate who has neither the popular support nor the personal integrity and character to lead our Party and Govern our State.\n\n\u201cAnambra State is too big, and the cause of good government is too important for us to allow the future of our dear State to be mortgaged by the actions of politicians from outside the State for whom politics is merely an opportunity for personal advancement by circumventing the democratic decisions of millions of fellow citizens. We jointly reject these results without reservation. And we call on the National Party to take action to prevent the imminent demise of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State and the South-east of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Ugwuanyi on his administration\u2019s impactful rural development agenda as well as his uncommon leadership qualities, describing the governor as humble, simple, proactive and a team leader.\n\nOn his part, the Air Vice Marshal Okparah, who described Gov. Ugwuanyi as a friend to the Nigerian Air Force, appreciated him for the partnership and the immense support his administration has been rendering to the Air Force as well as the existing peace in Enugu State.\n\nIn his address, the State Comptroller of Corrections equally applauded the governor\u2019s resilience and assistance to the Command and other security agencies in the state, saying: \u201cSince I assumed office, I have acquainted myself through records, with your numerous interventions and contributions to the Correctional Service especially in the areas of security and welfare of staff and inmates\u201d.\n\nStressing that Gov. Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration has placed the Nigeria Correctional Service in the front burner, Onokohwomomo, on behalf of the officers, men and inmates of the Service thanked the governor for his \u201ckind gestures and unrelenting efforts towards a better and more efficient and effective service delivery in the state\u201d.\n\nAccording to the State Comptroller of Immigration, \u201cYour Excellency, as a devout Christian, I cannot agree less with your administration\u2019s emphasis that \u2018Enugu State is in the Hands of God\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt is on good record that before the recent disruptions and distortions to the considerable peace and security pervading the South East region, Enugu State enjoyed the indisputable reputation as the safest and most peaceful state in the country.\n\n\u201cThis has not changed significantly even in the face of recent highly condemnable activities of some armed bandits across the South East of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWithin my short stay since assumption of office as State Comptroller of Immigration, I have observed that Enugu State is thriving under your dynamic and focused leadership.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, Ndi Enugu are enjoying unprecedented peace and safety with an accompaniment of stupendous rural transformation and development in every sector, all of which are manifestation of your proactive governance strategies and infectious sense of humility, simplicity and team spirit\u201d.\n\nEnumerating the core responsibilities of the agency in policing the nation\u2019s air, sea and land borders as well as controlling and monitoring of foreigners/migrants in Nigeria, the State Comptroller of Immigration Service assured Gov. Ugwuanyi that \u201cmy leadership will be relentless in the discharge of our onerous statutory duties in collaboration with other security agencies to make the state safer for all\u201d.\n\nOlumba therefore solicited further support and goodwill of the state government as well as the cooperation of the people of the state especially the traditional rulers, community and religious leaders and landlords, among others, through provision of information about foreigners/migrants within their domain to enable the agency monitor them more closely.\n\nIn his separate responses, Gov. Ugwuanyi formally welcomed Olumba, Air Vice Marshal Okparah and Onokohwomomo to Enugu State and congratulated them on their new feats.\n\nThe governor assured them that his administration will continue to support and cooperate with their agencies in actualizing their mandate for the progress of the state, and security and wellbeing of residents.",

          "title": "Can the change come from the top?",
          "text": "By Samuel Ogunnaike\n\nSIR: In less than a decade, the term \u201c change\u201d echoed and vibrated hugely in the Nigerian space. This vibration was so strong that concepts such as hope, restoration, and better life were drowned. The majority of us wanted change. I suppose we knew that change means to make someone and something different. No doubt, things have significantly changed at least for many of us. Whether this is a desired or an agonizing change is an issue for everyone who has been affected to decide.\n\nWho can change and what can change? Arguably anyone and everything can change. For example, Dr. Ben Carson changed from a D \u2013 student to an A- learner. Equally important is the apt case of the Singaporeans. Singapore changed from a paralysed economy to a buoyant one. These are remarkable and desired changes. On the negative side, too, nations and individuals have descended from the top to the bottom. While the above questions seem pertinent, it is more prudent to ask, \u201c Can the change come from the top? I suppose it should, since the power to make and enforce laws are deposited in the top.\n\nTo call a spade a spade, for us \u2013 Nigerians, our own change may not be top effected. The \u201c Ogas\u201d at the top, starting from the councillors to the presidents are, arguably, incapable of bringing us the much-anticipated change. When next we hear them talk about change, transformation and better life, we should hit the hay. Evidently, the hope of this country may not be in their hands, political party, regardless. Change only comes through change. For emphasis, those who claim to change our economic woes must first change themselves.\n\nIf they change their money politics, then, we may believe they can positively alter the economy. As long as they remain convinced that votes are economic commodities that can be bought and sold, they can\u2019t bring us the change we want. Anyone who will ask us to sell our votes to him cannot positively impact on our nation. Anyone on the side of a government that despises peaceful protest, cannot bring us the change we want. Anyone who will intimidate and selfishly censor the reports of the media cannot change our economic woes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThose who play the harlot political game cannot effect the change we desire. Those who value power above integrity cannot bring us the transformation. Those who employ thugs during an election cannot revamp the economy. Those who are nepotistic in their national appointments cannot bring us the change. Those who wish to continue to be paid humongous salaries in the face of an entrenched debt profile cannot impact on the economy. Those who play the party game instead of speaking truth to the power that be, cannot bring us the change. Men who value their appointive positions over social justice cannot bring us the change. Those who expend our collective money on endless foreign trips cannot bring us the change.\n\nFor us as a nation, change will come from the bottom when we can say to them \u201c yes, you are from my state, but you messed up, I am not voting for you. Yes, we hold the same religious belief, but you messed up, I am not voting for you. Yes, you are a member of my party, but you messed up, I am not voting for you. Change from the top, in our context, is illusionary.",

As of today, the breakdown of the number of people vaccinated and the vaccine consumption is as follows:\n\n\u20182,265,805 people vaccinated with the first dose; 1,175,341 people vaccinated with the second dose and this means 88 per cent of vaccine doses have been used\n\n\u2018Based on these data and comparative information from other countries, Nigeria continues to have the highest vaccination rates in Africa with approximately 87,000 people being vaccinated daily. Egypt, South Africa, Ghana and Senegal each have daily vaccination rates of 72,000, 52,600, 12,100 and 4,790, respectively.\u2019\n\nShuaib further said that \u2018it is pertinent to note that as of today, there is no vaccine with the expiration date of June 28th that has not been utilized, which means that there is currently zero balance of such vaccines in the country. Again, this is to demonstrate our commitment to ensuring that only safe and potent COVID-19 vaccines are administered to Nigerians.\n\n\u2018Although we have had reported cases of mild, moderate and severe reactions since our COVID-19 vaccination roll out in March 2021. 125 Severe AEFI cases were reported while 13,663 mild to moderate cases were reported. These are often expected reactions from normal vaccination and people who experienced any of these have recovered fully and are doing well. More pleasing to mention is that with over 3million people vaccinated, Nigeria has not recorded any death case directly linked with Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI).\n\n\u2018As you may be aware, we are working closely with NAFDAC and NCDC to determine whether such medical incidences are connected to the vaccination. There is also the MED-SAFETY App which is available free for download on the [Google] Play Store for Android devices and Apple Store for IOS devices, whereby people can report vaccine side effects for themselves or on behalf of others and will receive a timely response.\n\n\u2018While we are vigilant that no expired vaccines are used in Nigeria, we advise all eligible people (18 years and above) to take advantage of the opportunity offered in the reopening of first dose administration so that they get vaccinated against COVID-19. We are equally calling on those who received their first dose not later than May 17th and are yet to take their second dose to make themselves available for their second dose in order to be fully protected against the disease. Please note that this vaccination phase will close on the 5th of July, 2021 and people are requested to go for their vaccination between now and July 5th.\u2019\n\nOn those who took the first jab abroad, the NPHCDA boss said \u2018provision has been made for people who may have taken their first dose of the vaccine outside the country and want to take the second dose back home. They can go to any designated health facility nearest to them to receive their jab, as we have informed our Health workers not to turn them back.\u201d\n\nHe also added that the government was procuring a total of 29,850,000 of the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nAccording to him, the government has also recently received communication from the COVAX facility for additional allocation of 3,924,000 doses of AstraZeneca/AZD1222 vaccine, which according to the supply forecast, will be available for delivery into the country by July/August 2021.\n\n\u2018Similarly, the government is procuring a total allocation of 29,850,000 of Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine through the African Union Commission and the AfreximBank arrangement. This is expected by September 2021.\u2019\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",
          "summary": "\u2018I am glad to inform you that 3,441,146 doses have so far been utilized for the 1st and 2nd dose vaccinations, which is approximately 88 per cent of the total AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine stock in the country.\n\u2018Although we have had reported cases of mild, moderate and severe reactions since our COVID-19 vaccination roll out in March 2021.\nMore pleasing to mention is that with over 3million people vaccinated, Nigeria has not recorded any death case directly linked with Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI).\nWe are equally calling on those who received their first dose not later than May 17th and are yet to take their second dose to make themselves available for their second dose in order to be fully protected against the disease.\n\u2018Similarly, the government is procuring a total allocation of 29,850,000 of Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine through the African Union Commission and the AfreximBank arrangement.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has replied the Niger Delta Avengers, a militant group in the oil-producing Delta region threatening to resume attacks amid rising insecurity and disagreements over the share of oil wealth communities should get.\n\nThe president said it was curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after he met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, where he responded to the germane issues raised, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nThe group had in 2016 attacked oil installations that affected the country\u2019s oil production.\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, he said threat was unnecessary.\n\nHe reproduced the full text he read when he received the elders of the region on Friday, June 25, 2021, which answers to all the issues raised.\n\nThe full text read in part: \u201cAs the symbol of the collective voice of the Ijaw people, which is one of Nigeria\u2019s main ethnic groups, the existence of a focused and people oriented leadership would go a long way in articulating the demands of the Ijaw people and making sure these demands are made part of the national discourse.\n\n\u201cI particularly note your ten-point demand to the Federal Government in your inaugural speech and assure you that this administration is frontally addressing them.\n\n\u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the Niger Delta and as you are aware the HydroCarbon Pollution Remediation Project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the Minister of Environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, under the same ministry of Environment is working to make sure that oil spills are reduced and new ones prevented. As you are also aware, all the responsible agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria, has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.\n\n\u201cI completely agree with your call to allocate operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people. However, like you know, the process of granting licenses is guided by laid down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region. Based on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board would be inaugurated. However, I would like to implore you that the Ijaw National Congress should play a more active role in making sure that the mismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note your call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people and I will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest.\n\n\u201cLike you well know, completion of the East-West Road is top on my infrastructure agenda and I will look to its speedy conclusion. Again, the occasional disturbance by youths in some communities along the route to construction work would require your close attention and guidance.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we have made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the recent affirmation of your belief in a United Nigeria and while I thank you for standing with me, I will also implore you to use your leverage in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity, so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.\n\n\u201cI would like now to commend Professor Okaba for your emphasis on supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms as well as working with other institutions in the country to address our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile I thank you once more for this visit and I will continue to count on your support as we work towards resolving our current challenges.\n\n\u201cGod Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano, Laleye Dipo in Minna, Daji Sani in Yola and Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia\n\nThe efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to reclaim old grazing routes for herdsmen may be hampered by the building of roads, hospitals, schools and other public utilities on the ways carved out for feeding cattle in the 1950s, THISDAY investigation has revealed.\n\nContrary to the clamour for an end to open grazing and the need to adopt modern ranching techniques to curb incessant clashes with farmers, Buhari has insisted that the federal government will reclaim the old grazing routes for free movement of herders.\n\nHowever, THISDAY\u2019s investigation has revealed that the grazing routes have been taken over, over the years, by modern facilities built for the public good.\n\nIn Kano State, the state government has acknowledged that the grazing routes have been taken over by public infrastructure, including schools.\n\nFollowing this development, the state Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje, has set up a Rural Grazing Area that is popularly known as (RUGA), as part of his government\u2019s efforts to secure alternative grazing areas and accommodation for herdsmen.\n\nGanduje\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Abba Anwar, told THISDAY at the weekend that the RUGA in Kano has become the first cattle herders\u2019 settlement in the country, where the nomads are to be accommodated for expansive grazing of their flock.\n\nHe stated that the first phase of 25 housing units out of the projected 200, situated on 4,413 hectares of land at Dansoshiya Forest in Kiru Council Area of the state has been delivered by the state government.\n\nAnwar added that work is in progress on phase two and phase three of the project.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that at Falgore forest in Tudun Wada Local Government Area, the remnants of the cattle routes have been lost due to the infiltration of bandits and their attendant negative activities.\n\nGanduje, however, has urged herders to stop open grazing and return to the state, saying there is now modern grazing of animals going on at Dansoshiya Forest.\n\nHe said the investments made by his administration in grazing areas would curb the recurring clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nThe governor added that fodder seeds, which will be cultivated at Dudduru in Ajingi Local Government Area will be planted at Dansoshiya Forest to provide feeds for cattle and other small ruminants.\n\nAlthough Niger State has 11 grazing routes, covering about 1,865 kilometres, 1,368 kilometres of these routes are primary routes while the remaining 496 kilometres are secondary routes.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Magama to Rijau route is an international route linking the country with the Benin Republic from Borgu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nBut the Permanent Secretary in the state Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development, Dr. Jonathan Wasa, told THISDAY in an interview that all the routes have been encroached upon by major highways, private developers, including small-scale industries.\n\nAccording to him, with the advent of development, cattle now share the major highways with motorists.\n\nHe stated that the state does not have the resources to reclaim the routes taken over by highways and other infrastructure.\n\nWasa said due to the encroachment on the grazing routes, the major focus of the state government is to organise nomads and others into groups and settle them in grazing reserves as being done in other parts of the world.\n\nHe stated that there are the Bobi grazing reserves, which span over 36,000 hectares located in Mariga and Magama local government areas.\n\nIn addition, the state government has also designated seven other reserves. These include: Audi Kanchi in Lavun LGA, Sheyi in Shiroro LGA, Garin- Gabas in Rafi LGA, Gabi in Lapai Ndadokun and Kpotun Woro in Agaie LGA and Iri in Rijau LGA.\n\n\u201cWe are advocates of ranching but it has to be done gradually; it cannot be done abruptly,\u201d Wasa added.\n\nIn Adamawa State, the Permanent Secretary of the State Ministry for Livestock Production, Alhaji Abdulrahman Tukur, told THISDAY that the state government had set up a committee to address the frequent clashes between farmers and herders.\n\nHe said the committee had submitted its report to the state government in which is recommended, among others, that the state government should reclaim the grazing reserves for the settlement of herdsmen and stop their movements.\n\nTukur said the old grazing routes had been taken over by schools, primary healthcare centres, roads, petrol stations and other facilities, which will not allow for movement of cattle.\n\nHe said the ministry had earlier before the wet season set up a committee for each of the 30 grazing reserves gazetted and identified in the map of the state to sensitise stakeholders on the plan to reclaim the grazing reserves to settle the herders.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe committees are working with already list of encroachers on the grazing reserves and discussions are in top gear to reclaim these grazing reserves.\n\n\u201cThose farmers that are farming on the grazing reserves; we allow them to continue farming temporarily but when they do their harvest, they would allow the herders\u2019 cattle to feed on the residues of their crops until we make the condition better for herders and stop them from movement.\u201d\n\nIn Nasarawa State, THISDAY gathered that the state government has donated all the seven grazing reserves located at Awe, Keana, Doma, Assakio, Konva, Gitata and Kurudu to the federal government for the National Livestock Transformation Programme (NLTP), as part of the efforts to stop the free movement of cattle.\n\nThe Commissioner for Agriculture and Water Resources, Prof. Alanana Otaki, told THISDAY that the state government has succeeded in claiming all gazetted cattle grazing reserves in the state without hitches.\n\nThe Sokoto State Government has also reclaimed the grazing reserves to settle herdsmen.\n\nIn a telephone interview with THISDAY, the Commissioner for Careers and Security matters, Col. Garba Moyi (rtd), said the reserves were inside the forests.\n\n\u201cFor us in Sokoto, the policy is not new to us. I could recall when I was a local government chairman some years ago, I introduced the policy which was also adopted by other local governments in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nMoyi added:\u201d \u201cMost of these grazing reserves are in the bush and we directed the Fulani to graze on any crop planted on them.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Zamfara State Government stated that it would use the grazing reserves to resettle the herders, being the worst hit by the clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nThe Special Adviser on Media and Public Enlightenment to the Governor, Mr. Zalaini Bappa, said even some former governors who trespassed on the grazing reserves returned the land.\n\nAccording to him, the state government has also started building Ruga for the Fulani in order to prevent clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Petrol Subsidy Bites Harder, NNPC Proposes N114.3bn Deduction in June",
          "text": "\u2022Under-recovery quadrupled in four months\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s three tiers of government may have to look elsewhere to augment revenues accruing monthly from the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is set to make another N114.2 billion deduction from oil revenues in June to pay for petrol subsidy.\n\nA document obtained by THISDAY from the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, detailing the NNPC\u2019s presentation to the committee, which took place between June 22 and 23, indicated that as earlier reported, the corporation, which has continued to shoulder the payment of what it calls under-recovery, deducted N126.2 billion from FAAC for May.\n\nWhat the NNPC has termed under-recovery is the difference between the actual market rate of petrol and the price at which the commodity is sold at the pump, which the federation bears in order to keep the pump price stable at N162 per litre.\n\nHowever, whereas it made zero contribution to the Federation Account in April, which was shared in May, the national oil company managed to remit about N29 billion from its finances to the joint account in May cycle, which was distributed among the three tiers last week.\n\nFor January to May\u2019s funding performance, the data showed that under-recovery or subsidy claims deducted from oil revenues by the NNPC amounted to N25.374 billion in February, N60.396 billion in March and N61.966 billion in April. But it rose astronomically to N126.298 billion in May before falling to N114 billion in June.\n\nThese implied that the deduction by the NNPC more than quadrupled from the N25.374 billion in February to N114 billion in June.\n\nThis development has justified the clamour for the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry to allow market forces to determine the price of petrol.\n\nHowever, the NNPC remitted a marginal net sum of N29.647 to FAAC in May, which was shared in June, as opposed to its zero contribution in April, its N90.860 billion in January, N64.161 billion in February and N41.184 billion in March.\n\nTo date, according to the document, the NNPC has been able to contribute a net sum of N225.852 billion to the federation for the year, out of its yearly projected remittance of N1.473 trillion and monthly value addition of N122.7 billion, leaving a variance of N820.684 billion.\n\nThe presentation, signed by Mr. Bello Abdullahi, on behalf of the NNPC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Mr. Umar Ajiya, showed that the N50 billion, which is part of the corporation\u2019s financial obligations to its Joint Venture (JV) partners, meant to have been subtracted from the latest round of deductions remains pending.\n\nGross revenue from JV crude, gas and other receipts for May was N320.314 billion, less royalty of N58.3 billion, JV cost recovery of N124 billion, Profit Before Tax (PBT) of N104.4 billion, to yield a profit after-tax value of N33.26 billion.\n\nThe document showed that for April, crude oil and gas sales and receipts, available in May and shared in June, the volume of export crude oil stood at 2.78 million barrels with a monetary value of $181.191 million and equivalent of N69.360 billion, while domestic crude oil due in July was 6.63 million barrels and sold at $434.8 million. Added to export crude oil, the revenue generated was $616.037 million.\n\nNLNG feedstock gas was 27.605 MBTU valued at $38.5 million or about N16.011 billion while the total oil and gas sales stood at $654.601 million or roughly N85.3 billion, according to the corporation.\n\nIn May, export crude oil receipt was $167.7 million, about N64.2 billion, NLNG feedstock gas amounted to $34.31 million, the equivalent of N13.17 billion, while the gas company\u2019s paid arrears stood at N623.4 million, to hit a total of N77.96 billion for the receipt from oil and gas for the month.\n\nAll the transactions were hinged on N382.80 to one dollar exchange rate as advised by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), according to the national oil company.\n\nThe report said: \u201cThe sum of N126,298,457,944.36 was deducted as value shortfall resulting from the difference between the landing cost and ex-coastal price of PMS (petrol) recorded in April 2021.\n\n\u201cIn addition, May value shortfall of N114,337,097,352.49 is to be deducted from June federation proceeds in July 2021 FAAC meeting. Also, the balance of March 2021 value shortfall of N50,000,000,000.00 remains outstanding.\u201d\n\nIt stated that the overall NNPC crude oil lifting of 9.42Mbbls (export and domestic crude) in April 2021 recorded 23.59 per cent increase relative to the 7.62MbbIs lifted in March, while Nigeria maintained 1.4 million bpd Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production cut in April 2021.\n\n\u201cCrude oil export revenue received in May 2021 amounted to $167.72 million, equivalent to N64.2 billion. Domestic gas receipts in the month were N2.9 billion. Feedstock valued at $38.56 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period, out of which $34.32 million was received during the month, the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\n\u201cThe sum of $16.53 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage fees and interest income was received in May 2021,\u201d it stated.\n\nA total loss of 4.527 million barrels of crude was recorded during the month due to shut-ins, repairs, leaks, power outages as well as shutdowns due to protests as a result of non-payment of community workers\u2019 salaries in Batan station and Olomoro, Uzere and Kokori.\n\nOther issues resulting in shutdowns included seawater pump trips, technical issues like high gas to oil ratio or production deferment due to vessel swap.\n\nOf the government \u2018calendarised\u2019 priority projects worth $2.680 billion, given a $536 million monthly budget, the NNPC stated that it had so far funded the projects by $636.472 million from January to May.\n\nThe document showed an outstanding balance of $1.464 billion in JV cash call arrears to International Oil Companies (IOCs) as of May 31, with the NNPC having offset $3.22 billion from a total negotiated debt of $4.689 billion.\n\nThe national oil company told FAAC that it spent N2.263 billion on security and maintenance, N1.580 billion on pipeline and other facilities repairs as well as the payment of a \u201cstrategic holding\u201d of N304.183 million, totalling N4.148 billion in May.\n\nIn addition, it spent N4.412 billion on national domestic gas development, N3.91 billion on gas infrastructure development, N659 million on crude oil pre-export inspection agency expenses, N3.2 billion on frontier exploration services and N196 million on renewable energy development.\n\nBesides, the corporation said it expended N5 billion on export financing, N8.3 billion on the non-functional refineries and N83.3 billion on the ongoing Nigeria/Morocco pipeline.\n\nDepot price of fuel remained at N128, while 1.885 billion litres were imported and landing cost for the 35 import vessels that brought in fuel ranged from N185.17 to N199.90.\n\nLast week, NNPC told the nation that Nigeria now loses about 42 million litres of petrol to smuggling through the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres.\n\nWith the menace now gaining more momentum and illegal dealers more daring, the national oil company stated that the under-recovery or the subsidy that the government pays on the product every month has begun to hover between N140 billion to N150 billion.\n\nThe development has made the corporation unable to contribute to the national coffers, as the subsidy it pays has kept wiping out the little gains made from rising international oil prices, which has now exceeded $75 per barrel.\n\nSpeaking when he met with stakeholders, including the leadership of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Department of State Service (DSS), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and chief executives of agencies in the petroleum ministry, Group Managing Director of the corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, said smuggling had gone beyond what the NNPC could handle.\n\nHe stated that with the current exchange rate, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre, adding that if the NNPC was to sell at the going rate, and incorporating the current exchange rate, fuel would be selling for about N256 a litre.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari: Drug Trafficking, Abuse Pose More Threat than Insurgency, Banditry",
          "text": "\u2022Says drug abuse already stretches across three generations\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, identified drug trafficking and abuse as more threatening to the stability of the nation than banditry and insurgency that are prevalent in some parts of Nigeria.\n\nThe president, declared that drug abuse has become so endemic in the country now that it already stretches across three generations of grandparents, parents and their wards.\n\nThis is just as the the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), has disclosed that within the last five months, no fewer than 2,180 suspected traffickers including five drug barons had been nabbed across the country.\n\nPresident Buhari, who was represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustaph, spoke at the launch of the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), an initiative of the NDLEA to mark the United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking themed: \u201cShare Facts on Drugs. Save Lives.\u201d\n\nThe President emphasised that the anti-drug war was more deadly than the insurgency in the Northeastern part of the country or the acts of banditry in the Northwest or the acts of kidnapping that transcends all the geopolitical zones of this country.\n\nAccording to him, it is a war that is destroying three generations, because there were clips of some grandparents on drugs, parents on drugs, and by extension, their wards and children had also taken to drugs.\n\n\u201cSo, this is a war that is targeting three generations in a stretch. So, it is more deadly than even the security challenges that we are having in this country and I believe strongly that every effort must be put in place to ensure that we deal with the issues of substance abuse and trafficking and manufacture so that we can get to the root cause of the mirage of insecurity problems that are confronting this nation and I believe strongly, with every bit of conviction, that if we are able to deal with the issues of drug abuse, substantially, our security challenges will drastically reduce as we walk towards a drug free, Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe President also charged the NDLEA to intensify efforts at ridding the vast forests of the Southwest and South-South regions of the country of criminal elements, who had made the places their hideouts, from where they launch criminal onslaughts as well as for farming marijuana.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cI am directing the NDLEA to develop a robust risk-communication and community engagement strategy that will not only disseminate the four pillars of the plan to responsible entities, but also deal with destroying production sites and laboratories, break the supply chain, discourage drug use and prosecute offenders as well as traffickers, rehabilitate addicts and enforcement of relevant laws.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly draw the attention of the agency to the fact that the use of many of our forests as criminal hideouts is because large swathes of cannabis plantations are hidden deep within those forests, especially, in the Southwest and the South-South.\n\n\u201cYou may, therefore, need to drive these criminal elements from such hideouts, because they use it for the growth of these plants and also as a repository for criminal elements to conclude and plan their adventures on our people\u201d.\n\nHe, however, called on all families, schools, civil society organisations, professional associations, religious organisations, the academia, community leaders and individuals to work for the common good in order to rid their communities of drug use and trafficking.\n\n\u201cAs your President, I will continue to address underlying causes of drug abuse, including poverty reduction, for which my pledge for lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years and strengthened by the recently developed National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy signposts my unwavering commitment.\n\n\u201cI would like to appreciate our stakeholders and international collaborators, especially, the European Union, and the United Nations Office for Drugs and Control, for their unwavering support to our drug control efforts, including the development of our roadmap. Also appreciated are the members of the inter-ministerial committee on drug control, civil society organisations, the academia, for their contributions and efforts to our National Drug Control initiatives.\n\n\u201cThe war against drugs is a war that must be fought by all, it is therefore my pleasure, to declare on behalf of the good people of Nigeria, a War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), not just as a slogan, but a call for civil action for all Nigerians to take active part in this war\u201d.\n\nShedding more light on their current efforts, Chairman of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd) put the cash value and drugs seized in the past five months since he assumed office at over N90 billion adding that over 2,180 traffickers had been arrested, including five drug barons controlling different cartels across Nigeria.\n\nHe also revealed that a record 2.05 million kilograms of drugs were intercepted and seized across the country; and 2,100 drug offenders prosecuted with 500 already jailed by courts.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhile the statistics are impressive, we wouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves that we have succeeded in cleaning the Augean Stable in five months. We have only made a head start. We need to sustain the momentum. We need to win the drug war. We cannot afford to be complacent.\u201d\n\nMarwa said going by the available statistics, Nigeria ranked the highest users of cannabis worldwide, adding that revelations from kidnapped victims have collaborated the facts that illicit substances were enablers of insecurity currently plaguing the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not difficult to conclude that drugs have been catalysts of terrorism, kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and various violent conflicts that are currently Nigeria\u2019s albatross. The enormity of the danger of drug abuse calls for an urgent need to nip the problem in the bud. This is the reason we have redoubled our efforts in the past five months with the Maxim of Offensive Action.\n\n\u201cToday, it is a glaring fact that Nigerian youths are involved in drug abuse. Over the years, an undesirable subculture had flourished whereby adolescents and young adults wantonly indulged in the abuse of illicit substances. They not only became addicted to conventional substances such as cannabis and prescription opioids, such as tramadol and codeine, they also experimented with dangerous mixtures leading to novel psychotropic substances such as \u2018monkey tail\u2019 and \u2018skoochies\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the context of that warped reality, they also normalised the smoking of cannabis as we have seen in some popular music videos and on social media. \u2018High\u2019 became part of their social media. So, it wasn\u2019t surprising, when research began to give us bleak statistics. The National Drug Survey 2019, for example, indicated that cannabis is the most commonly abused substance by an estimated 10.6 million Nigerians, some of whom started smoking as early as 19 years of age.\n\n\u201cThe Global Drug Survey 2019, also, cited cannabis as the most abused substance with West Africa having the highest abuse prevalence. The World Health Organisation on substance abuse also stated unequivocally that cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in Africa, with the highest prevalence, between 5.2% and 13.5%, found in West Africa. Ladies and Gentlemen, West Africa, by implication, means Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe NDLEA boss linked the successes recorded by the agency so far to the resolution of officers and men of the NDLEA to clean up Nigeria and make the country drug free.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd in this campaign, we are tackling the scourge of drug abuse and trafficking on all fronts. In addition to the arrest and prosecution of drug offenders, we have worked out intensive drug abuse awareness and sensitisation programmes targeting different groups, with an emphasis on youths. In this regard, my administration has thrown the door open to all for partnership in the fight against abuse of illicit substances. It is to this end that we have set up a Special Purpose Committee to involve stakeholders in the cause.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, called on the President to approve the appointment of 10,000 additional workers for NDLEA, which he said was currently \u201cunderstaffed\u201d, \u201cunderfunded\u201d, and \u201cill-equipped\u201d.\n\nGbajabiamila, who was represented by Chairman, House Committee on Drugs and Narcotics, Hon Francis Agwu, said the NDLEA was using weapons used during the civil war, stressing the need to fight the menace of drugs abuse in the country as all crimes were enabled by narcotics drugs addiction.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly was working to amend the Police Trust Fund Act to ensure that other policing agencies like NDLEA benefitted from the pool, adding that efforts would be made to guarantee accelerated endorsement of the president after its amendment.\n\n\u201cIf the surge in crimes must be minimised, then, we must fight narcotics drugs addiction,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the United Nations General Secretary, Antonio Guterres, lamented that the world drug problem remains an urgent challenge that threatens to exacerbate damage impact and hinder a healthy recovery.\n\nRepresented by Oliver Stolpe, the Country Representative, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the UN Scribe urged law enforcement agents to go after the criminals at the upper level of the drug trafficking chain, who reap the highest profit and wreak the greatest havoc.\n\nGuterres said, the 2021 world drug report of UN, showed that death and crime attributed to disorders have nearly doubled over the past decade, adding that while new HIV/AIDS infections among adults have declined worldwide but not among people, who injected drugs, which accounted for 10 per cent of new infections in 2019.\n\nHe, however, claimed that international cooperation had helped to limit the proliferation of new psycho active substances but the problem was shifting to poorer regions, where control systems were weaker, drug sales continued to rise and non-medical use of pharmaceutical such as Tramadol and Codeine was expanding.\n\nHe too agreed that drug trafficking and organised crime fuel and perpetuate circles of violence and conflicts, adding that armed groups and terrorists profited from the illicit drugs trade, even as the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has left millions of people more vulnerable to drug crime and illicit drug cultivation.\n\nIn a related development, the Niger State Commander of the NDLEA, Mr. Haruna Kwatiche, has said bandits, kidnappers and terrorists operated after consuming hard drugs, which usually gave them fake confidence and strength.\n\nKwatiche, who disclosed this in Minna, Saturday, said these categories of people often claimed they did not know how and why they embarked on such acts after being arrested and when the effect of the drugs had worn out.\n\nSpeaking at an event to mark this years United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and illicit Trafficking, Kwatiche said the country should rise up to stop the circulation of hard drugs by bringing all peddlers under the law if the activities of bandits kidnapers and terrorists were to be reduced to the barest minimum in the country.\n\nHe admitted that 90 per cent of other crimes and criminalities were committed under the influence of drugs and warned that, \u201cUntil all stakeholders join hands together to fight this menace, crimes and criminalities will continue to increase\n\n\u201cThe NDLEA is committed to confronting circulation and consumption of hard drugs frontally\u201d the Niger commander declared, adding that to achieve this the Agency required the support of all the major stakeholders in the states of the federation.\n\nThe Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, commended the NDLEA for its renewed war against drug abuse and illicit trafficking in the state and assured the agency of government\u2019s support in order to reduce the menace of drug abuse in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nIn monetary terms, changes in marginal fields\u2019 ownership in the oil and gas industry were worth about $584 million in 2019, the latest report on the sector by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has indicated. The report showed that the changes were mainly due to internal reorganisation by asset owners, inability to pay outstanding debts owed to government, and non-development of oil assets, leading to revocation of licences.\n\nIn all, eight of the deals yielded the $584 million, the sum generated by three of the changes were not available in the report, while four changes were due to revocation of operating licences of the original owners by the federal government.\n\nThe licences cancelled were those belonging to Allied Energy Resources, Cavendish Petroleum, Express Petroleum and Gas, Pan Ocean Corporation Asset, and Summit Oil International Limited, which operated OML 120, 110, 108, 98, and OPL 206, respectively.\n\nWhile 7 Energy transferred 62.5 per cent shares of 51 per cent equity in Stub Creek Universal Energy Resources in a transaction worth $3.682 million, it also moved 100 per cent ownership of its shares in Uquo marginal field to Savannah Petroleum Plc in a $10.586 million deal.\n\nIn the same vein, FHN transferred its 100 per cent interest to Cape Energy Limited, Vertex Energy, and Earl Act Global in a $1.99 million deal while PanOcean allocated OML 98 to the NNPC JV worth $99.836 million in a deal that was expected to be fully paid for by January 2021.\n\nForty per cent equity of Ubima field, according to the document, was assigned to Wester Ord Oil and Gas Limited for $700,000, while there was a reassignment of 38.67 per cent interest from OML 141 to Emerald Energy, Amni, and Blue Water Group.\n\nEroton E&P also assigned 16.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent of Sahara field and Bolton in a deal worth $6.901 million.\n\nBesides, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) acquired OML 11, formerly operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), in a contract totalling $456.03 million. Full payment is due in Q4 2021.\n\nSimilarly, New Age Exploration Nigeria Limited acquired OML 113, while Vitol transferred 12.83 participating interest in the field in a $4 million sale.\n\nDuring the year under review, seismic data acquisition was up by 348 per cent, field development plans 65 per cent, well activities 45 per cent, while gas development plan was down by 75 per cent, with six approved for 2019, as opposed to 24 in 2018.\n\nIn terms of deferred production due to shutdowns, scheduled repairs and maintenance, pipeline breaks/leaks, and general force majeure, SPDC was the biggest casualty, with deferred production of 30.9 million barrels, comprising 56.10 per cent of the entire quantity during the year.\n\nSeplat was next with 7 million barrels, followed by SNEPCo, with 3.8 million barrels.\n\nIn addition, NPDC and Neconde suffered losses and subsequent deferment of 3.7 million barrels, Newcross\u2019 was 3.2 million barrels, Aiteo deferred 2.84 million barrels, Energia\u2019s share of deferment was 1.7 million barrels, while APDNL\u2019s loss was 733,000 barrels during the year.\n\nAll deferred production amounted to 55.2 million barrels while there were 1,387 pipeline breaks, with Mosimi recording the highest with 637 breaks, followed by Port Harcourt, 536, and Warri with 96 breaks.\n\nAccording to the report, in 2019, 43 companies emerged buyers of Nigeria\u2019s federation export crude oil, compared to 41 in 2018, with 20 of the entities accounting for 73 per cent of total sales while the rest 23 accounted for 27 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, companies operating in the Nigeria oil and gas space expended $896 million on social expenditure, including a mandatory sum of $815.59 that is paid to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), while the non-mandatory expenditure stood at $81.2 million. Of that amount, NDDC got $721.275 million from its three per cent statutory allocation, while NCDMB received $94.3 million.\n\nOf the 34 companies, three entities, including Agip, Total Upstream, and Sterling Global Resources, topped the list of the non-mandatory social expenditure companies, with $12 million, $11 million, and $10.2 million, respectively.\n\nNon-mandatory social expenditure is voluntary payment for or to the host communities and other commitments across the country. They include provision of social amenities, like roads, boreholes, health centres, etc.\n\nNEITI further observed that the requirement for all companies, including government-owned enterprises, in Nigeria to submit Audited Financial Statement (AFS) to the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and Auditor General of the Federation in six months after the preceding year was not strictly adhered to by all covered entities.\n\n\u201cThis has the potential of creating an assurance uniformity gap for the data used in the exercise,\u201d NEITI stated.\n\nHowever, the Dr Ogbonnaya Orji-led agency said despite that limitation, the additional steps taken by the independent administrator using other elements of the accounts covered the gap caused by the development.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Investigation: How Yakubu Dogara, UBEC Squandered N1 Billion Model School Projects",
          "text": "Three years ago, the Universal Basic Education Commission released the sum of N97 million to three companies for the construction and rehabilitation of classrooms in the federal constituency represented by Yakubu Dogara in Bauchi State.\n\nThe money was part of a N1 billion consistency project of the former speaker of the House of Representatives who currently represents the area at the National Assembly.\n\nQuickfix Property Limited, Delta Force limited and Maridiq Nigeria Limited received the money for the construction and rehabilitation of schools in the area, according to Budeshi, an open contracting platform.\n\nAt the Government Day Technical College in Tafawa-Balewa, no single project has been executed despite the school being listed as one of the beneficiaries of the intervention project.\n\nMr Jatau Daniel, principal of the technical college told WikkiTimes that the school had been neglected for years, adding that he was not aware that it was billed to receive such intervention.\n\nBut it is not only the Government Day Technical College in Tafawa-Balewa whose classrooms renovation and construction are up in the air despite money being released by UBEC. Investigations by WikkiTimes show that other schools that were listed as beneficiaries either got shoddy construction or none.\n\nBuilt in 1978, the Government Day Technical College Tafawa-Balewa is the only technical school in Dogara\u2019s constituency, but the school has deteriorated, leaving more than 1400 students in a poor learning environment without basic amenities.\n\nThe principal said the last building in the school was constructed about 20 years ago and renovation has been done through the contributions of the Parents Teachers\u2019 Association (PTA).\n\n\u201cI have had the privilege of meeting with Hon. Yakubu Dogara last year,\u201d Mr Daniel said. \u201cI tabled all the challenges faced in the school and how the school is on the verge of total collapse. After receiving my proposal, we have not gotten any response from him till date after telling me he will get back to us.\u201d\n\nInside the school, cracks appear in-between the walls, inviting reptiles and insects into the classrooms.\n\n\u201cSee how bad the school looks,\u201d said exasperated Mr Emmanuel Barau, head of sciences laboratory in the school.\n\nScience Laboratory, Government Day Technical College Tafawa-Balewa\n\nStudents suffer the neglect. At Samuel Alheri\u2019s classroom, the ceiling is about to cave in. The windows and floor of the classrooms are all broken. The students sit four per chair with some lapping each other. \u201cThe chairs are not enough to accommodate all of us,\u201d Alheri said.\n\n\u201cThroughout last term, we could not have physics class because we don\u2019t have a physics teacher,\u201d Alheri told WikkiTimes.\n\n\u201cI am in the computer science department. I only go to the lab with other students where we just sit for a while and then return back to our classes,\u201d said Idi Miyaki, Alheri\u2019s classmate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a computer science teacher,\u201d Miyaki continued. \u201cNo light or generator to even power the few computers, I don\u2019t know anything about computer. I am just here wasting my time. As soon as we close, I just rush to the farm where I can make meaningful use of my time.\u201d\n\nAnother school in the area, Central Primary School was listed as a beneficiary in the zonal intervention project by UBEC, but like the technical school, no construction was ever carried out despite money being released to the contractor.\n\nIn 2018, a contract for the construction of a block of three classrooms was awarded to Maridiq Nigeria Ltd, the same company that also got a contract for that of the technical college. It was awarded at N19 million.\n\nThe most recent block of two classrooms in the school was built in 2016 which was done under the Sustainable Development Goals\u2019 intervention project.\n\n\u201cLook at all the roofs falling apart with so many classrooms, not in use,\u201d Mary Maikomo, a native of Tafawa Balewa town, pointed out. \u201cThey are so dilapidated and not habitable for learning\u201d, she added.\n\nMr Emmanuel Iliya, youth leader of Zaar Youth Development Association, ZAYODA told WikkiTimes that children in the area deserve a better school and quality learning to secure their future.\n\n\u201cYou can see the pitiable state of the school,\u201d Iliya said. \u201cIt\u2019s at the mercy of God. This is a school that has graduated a lot of prominent people in this country, and the school in its bad look has lost its entire legacy.\u201d\n\nHowever, at Nahuta Primary School in Tafawa-Balewa, another beneficiary of the zonal intervention project, the contract was executed but was incomplete. A block of three classrooms was constructed but the supply of teaching materials and furniture was left out.\n\nThe block was built within three months, according to Mr Amos Bature, the head teacher at the school. It was hastily and poorly done with the doors and windows looking out of shape.\n\nThe contract was awarded to Quickfix Property Limited for N19 million failed to supply classroom furniture and teaching materials as contained in the contract.\n\n\u201cI just wish Hon. Yakubu Dogara will come and see for himself and then tell the public how proud he is of the school,\u201d Mr Bature said. \u201cPrimary schools are supposed to give a foundation to children especially these ones in rural communities. These children have to suffer what their counterparts in urban cities enjoy.\u201d\n\nShoddy And Incomplete Projects\n\nAt Government Junior Secondary School located at the roadside, a few metres away from Bogoro main town, a three-classroom block has been built by Quickfix Property Limited but without teaching aids and furniture as spelt out in the contract.\n\n\u201cBeing in a rural community, we sometimes use the money paid by the student as PTA levy to buy attendance booklets and even some of the textbooks we use in the school,\u201d said Mrs. Bilhatu Daniel, principal of the school.\n\n\u201cWe were only given 80 pieces of 40 leaves exercise books in a school of 398 students,\u201d Mrs Daniel continued. \u201cMy pain is not just as a teacher or the principal of the school, but as a mother, seeing children with brighter future in such a mess with little or no hope of getting the best basic education they need at this age and time.\u201d\n\nQuickFix Property Limited also constructed a three-classroom block at Upper Basic Primary School in Shall Gwartar, the only benefiting school in Dass Local Government Area.\n\nBut the building which was constructed last year is already falling apart with its foundation exposed and the walls already tearing into different parts, just as the floor in the classes already broken, leaving the newly erected classes in a wretched state.\n\nDogara\u2019s collapsing model schools built in 2020\n\nThe structure was erected in the first quarter of 2020, shortly before the COVID-19 lockdown. It was awarded at N19 million.\n\nYa\u2019u Yusuf, the PTA Chairman of Upper Basic Secondary School, Shall Gwartar and Yusuf Gambo, a volunteer guard told WikkiTimes that the construction was done in two months, and it started collapsing immediately after the erection.\n\n\u201cThe contractor was using substandard materials. We saw it for ourselves,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cI personally stopped them, and they went to tell the Honorable himself,\u201d Yusuf said. \u201cAfter some days, they returned back to continue their work with the same materials and at this point, I had to allow them.\u201d\n\nYusuf described the building as a death trap to students, adding that they feared that the building would finally collapse at any time.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a time when leaders are so greedy and selfish as now,\u201d Yusuf said. \u201cThey can eat up everything allocated to a rural community without any fear or conscience.\u201d\n\nHaruna Danladi, village head of Shall Gwantar, could not hide his disappointment when describing to WikkiTimes how students sit on bare floor to learn.\n\n\u201cWe have no option,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only accept what they give to us no matter how bad or good it looks. The award of a contract by the government is usually for their own profit not for the benefit of the community. If not, quality and durable materials would have been used in a school.\n\n\u201cWhen they come to carry out the project, they never seek our advice. They just begin work and so we just sit aloof and watch them.\u201d\n\nThe principal of the school, Mr. Sulaiman Yunusa who shared his experience with WikkiTimes explained how teachers struggle to maintain the school with zero support despite hefty allocations that come with the intervention project.\n\n\u201cWe never received any book or teaching materials from anyone,\u201d he said.\n\nGwarangah, Dogara\u2019s Home Town also neglected\n\nOutsiders would assume that the hometown of a former speaker of the House of Representative who has been in the House for over 17 years would have basic amenities like good roads, constant power supply, pipe-born water, and standard schools as well as primary healthcare facilities.\n\nBut it is the opposite. The racketeering in the execution of the school projects in other communities did not also spare Gwarangah, his village. In comparison to other schools in Bogoro, Dass, and Tafawa-Balewa where the 2018 projects were either not carried out or poorly executed, a block of three classrooms was constructed by Delta Force Ltd.\n\n\u201cI am Dogara\u2019s Uncle and the principal of this school, as well as the NUT chairman of the local government,\u201d said Mr Gideon Gambo, who said that the new building belongs to the primary school which share premises with the secondary.\n\n\u201cHere in Gwarangah Junior Secondary school, as the principal, I have to buy chalk which we use because from SUBEB they only give us one carton of chalk for the whole term. How do you expect us to use just one carton in a term? So, we resort to taking money from the PTA levy which the students pay terminally to buy chalk which we use in our classes.\n\n\u201cImagine students preparing for junior WAEC and other exams, no library and no textbooks. At what point is the government supposed to come in and help these children. In the whole of this community, no single ICT centre and this is the community which produced the number four citizen in this country.\u201d\n\nThe purported ICT centre in the community has been converted to an APC warehouse used by Dogara. The building which has an APC logo, the political party of Dogara, is behind his house.\n\nA peep into Dogara\u2019s house shows several undistributed stashed tricycles. Members of the community told WikkiTimes that the books meant to be distributed to the schools in the area had been stashed inside Dogara\u2019s house as well.\n\nContractors Operate in the Shadow\n\nThe contractors that executed the N1 billion Dogara Models Schools project mostly operate in the shadow as no trace of their offices in either Bauchi, the seat of government or at Dogara\u2019s constituency.\n\nSearch conducted by WikkiTimes on Corporate Affairs Commission\u2019s website shows that the three companies that were awarded the contracts \u2013 Quickfix Property Limited, Delta Force Engineering Limited and Maridiq Nigeria Limited were all incorporated. Further efforts to confirm the companies\u2019 profiles and other necessary information through the paid service, was not successful as the companies only have physical addresses in Abuja. But there are no emails or phone numbers. The companies do not have functional websites nor any active social media accounts for public engagement.\n\nExpert Faults Project, Claim Amount, Inflated\n\nAn expert in quantity survey and lecturer at the Department of Quantity Survey who doubles as the Current ASUU Chairman, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi, (ATBU) argued that the pictures shown to him by WikkiTimes purportedly built at N19 million were highly inflated.\n\n\u201cWith these pictures, you have just shown me, considering the cheap labour and already available land to carry out the project, the amount said to be spent on this project is shoddy and questionable,\u201d Dr Inuwa Ibrahim.\n\n\u201cN19 million only is a lot of money, and for a structure said to be erected in 2018 of such standards, such amount is enough to give us around three to four of such blocks of three classrooms of which there was no fencing and other sophisticated equipment needed,\u201d he said.\n\nA proprietor of one of the biggest secondary schools in Bauchi, who doesn\u2019t want her name mentioned, corroborates Dr Inuwa regarding the inflated cost of the Dogara\u2019s model schools.\n\nShe said N19 million will enable her erect another private school.\n\n\u201cIf given N19 million I can comfortably open another branch and erect like six to seven classrooms of a good standard because I already have the land.\n\n\u201cI may not be so particular to tell you the actual cost of my school and the maintenance, but it is my pleasure to let you know that N19 million will give me a new section and some change (additional money) to pay salaries of my staff for some months.\u201d\n\nShe said N19 million \u201cis a lot of money which can be used to build a standard school with ultra-modern science equipment that can be compared to some schools in some bigger schools.\u201d\n\nDogara, UBEC, Ignore Interview, FOI Request\n\nA freedom of information request sent to the official email address of the Universal Basic Education Commission, UBEC by WikkiTimes requesting the commission\u2019s response on its findings were not responded to days after it was sent. WikkiTimes also contacted the spokesperson of the commission Mr David Apeh requesting an official response regarding the commission\u2019s shoddy execution of Dogara\u2019s projects. Mr David requested the reporter to send an official email requesting comments, but days after the reporter sent the email, it fell on deaf ears, just as repeated calls to remind him about the earlier correspondences was equally ignored.\n\nSeveral calls and text messages to Yakubu Dogara and his spokesman Turaki Hassan were not replied.\n\nDr Aliyu Tilde, a former Bauchi Education commissioner who was contacted before he was sacked by his principal, Governor Bala Mohammed also declined to answer questions about the projects. Instead, he referred WikkiTimes to State Universal Basic Education (SUBEB).\n\n\u201cI do not handle education projects in LGAs. Please contact the State Universal Basic Education for any clarifications,\u201d said Tilde in a text message.\n\nThen SUBEB directed WikkiTimes to speak with its director of planning, Dr. Aliyu Abdulrashed who said UBEC would be most appropriate in answering the questions relating to the projects.\n\n\u201cWe are only the beneficiary,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not the supervising body or the awardees of the contract, and so if you need any information about the project, you should reach out to the Universal Basic Education Commission.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Civic Media Lab under its Grassroots News Project with support from the National Endowment for Democracy.",

          "title": "Investigation: How Yakubu Dogara, UBEC Squandered N1 Billion Model School Projects",
          "text": "Three years ago, the Universal Basic Education Commission released the sum of N97 million to three companies for the construction and rehabilitation of classrooms in the federal constituency represented by Yakubu Dogara in Bauchi State.\n\nThe money was part of a N1 billion consistency project of the former speaker of the House of Representatives who currently represents the area at the National Assembly.\n\nQuickfix Property Limited, Delta Force limited and Maridiq Nigeria Limited received the money for the construction and rehabilitation of schools in the area, according to Budeshi, an open contracting platform.\n\nAt the Government Day Technical College in Tafawa-Balewa, no single project has been executed despite the school being listed as one of the beneficiaries of the intervention project.\n\nMr Jatau Daniel, principal of the technical college told WikkiTimes that the school had been neglected for years, adding that he was not aware that it was billed to receive such intervention.\n\nBut it is not only the Government Day Technical College in Tafawa-Balewa whose classrooms renovation and construction are up in the air despite money being released by UBEC. Investigations by WikkiTimes show that other schools that were listed as beneficiaries either got shoddy construction or none.\n\nBuilt in 1978, the Government Day Technical College Tafawa-Balewa is the only technical school in Dogara\u2019s constituency, but the school has deteriorated, leaving more than 1400 students in a poor learning environment without basic amenities.\n\nThe principal said the last building in the school was constructed about 20 years ago and renovation has been done through the contributions of the Parents Teachers\u2019 Association (PTA).\n\n\u201cI have had the privilege of meeting with Hon. Yakubu Dogara last year,\u201d Mr Daniel said. \u201cI tabled all the challenges faced in the school and how the school is on the verge of total collapse. After receiving my proposal, we have not gotten any response from him till date after telling me he will get back to us.\u201d\n\nInside the school, cracks appear in-between the walls, inviting reptiles and insects into the classrooms.\n\n\u201cSee how bad the school looks,\u201d said exasperated Mr Emmanuel Barau, head of sciences laboratory in the school.\n\nScience Laboratory, Government Day Technical College Tafawa-Balewa\n\nStudents suffer the neglect. At Samuel Alheri\u2019s classroom, the ceiling is about to cave in. The windows and floor of the classrooms are all broken. The students sit four per chair with some lapping each other. \u201cThe chairs are not enough to accommodate all of us,\u201d Alheri said.\n\n\u201cThroughout last term, we could not have physics class because we don\u2019t have a physics teacher,\u201d Alheri told WikkiTimes.\n\n\u201cI am in the computer science department. I only go to the lab with other students where we just sit for a while and then return back to our classes,\u201d said Idi Miyaki, Alheri\u2019s classmate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a computer science teacher,\u201d Miyaki continued. \u201cNo light or generator to even power the few computers, I don\u2019t know anything about computer. I am just here wasting my time. As soon as we close, I just rush to the farm where I can make meaningful use of my time.\u201d\n\nAnother school in the area, Central Primary School was listed as a beneficiary in the zonal intervention project by UBEC, but like the technical school, no construction was ever carried out despite money being released to the contractor.\n\nIn 2018, a contract for the construction of a block of three classrooms was awarded to Maridiq Nigeria Ltd, the same company that also got a contract for that of the technical college. It was awarded at N19 million.\n\nThe most recent block of two classrooms in the school was built in 2016 which was done under the Sustainable Development Goals\u2019 intervention project.\n\n\u201cLook at all the roofs falling apart with so many classrooms, not in use,\u201d Mary Maikomo, a native of Tafawa Balewa town, pointed out. \u201cThey are so dilapidated and not habitable for learning\u201d, she added.\n\nMr Emmanuel Iliya, youth leader of Zaar Youth Development Association, ZAYODA told WikkiTimes that children in the area deserve a better school and quality learning to secure their future.\n\n\u201cYou can see the pitiable state of the school,\u201d Iliya said. \u201cIt\u2019s at the mercy of God. This is a school that has graduated a lot of prominent people in this country, and the school in its bad look has lost its entire legacy.\u201d\n\nHowever, at Nahuta Primary School in Tafawa-Balewa, another beneficiary of the zonal intervention project, the contract was executed but was incomplete. A block of three classrooms was constructed but the supply of teaching materials and furniture was left out.\n\nThe block was built within three months, according to Mr Amos Bature, the head teacher at the school. It was hastily and poorly done with the doors and windows looking out of shape.\n\nThe contract was awarded to Quickfix Property Limited for N19 million failed to supply classroom furniture and teaching materials as contained in the contract.\n\n\u201cI just wish Hon. Yakubu Dogara will come and see for himself and then tell the public how proud he is of the school,\u201d Mr Bature said. \u201cPrimary schools are supposed to give a foundation to children especially these ones in rural communities. These children have to suffer what their counterparts in urban cities enjoy.\u201d\n\nShoddy And Incomplete Projects\n\nAt Government Junior Secondary School located at the roadside, a few metres away from Bogoro main town, a three-classroom block has been built by Quickfix Property Limited but without teaching aids and furniture as spelt out in the contract.\n\n\u201cBeing in a rural community, we sometimes use the money paid by the student as PTA levy to buy attendance booklets and even some of the textbooks we use in the school,\u201d said Mrs. Bilhatu Daniel, principal of the school.\n\n\u201cWe were only given 80 pieces of 40 leaves exercise books in a school of 398 students,\u201d Mrs Daniel continued. \u201cMy pain is not just as a teacher or the principal of the school, but as a mother, seeing children with brighter future in such a mess with little or no hope of getting the best basic education they need at this age and time.\u201d\n\nQuickFix Property Limited also constructed a three-classroom block at Upper Basic Primary School in Shall Gwartar, the only benefiting school in Dass Local Government Area.\n\nBut the building which was constructed last year is already falling apart with its foundation exposed and the walls already tearing into different parts, just as the floor in the classes already broken, leaving the newly erected classes in a wretched state.\n\nDogara\u2019s collapsing model schools built in 2020\n\nThe structure was erected in the first quarter of 2020, shortly before the COVID-19 lockdown. It was awarded at N19 million.\n\nYa\u2019u Yusuf, the PTA Chairman of Upper Basic Secondary School, Shall Gwartar and Yusuf Gambo, a volunteer guard told WikkiTimes that the construction was done in two months, and it started collapsing immediately after the erection.\n\n\u201cThe contractor was using substandard materials. We saw it for ourselves,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cI personally stopped them, and they went to tell the Honorable himself,\u201d Yusuf said. \u201cAfter some days, they returned back to continue their work with the same materials and at this point, I had to allow them.\u201d\n\nYusuf described the building as a death trap to students, adding that they feared that the building would finally collapse at any time.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a time when leaders are so greedy and selfish as now,\u201d Yusuf said. \u201cThey can eat up everything allocated to a rural community without any fear or conscience.\u201d\n\nHaruna Danladi, village head of Shall Gwantar, could not hide his disappointment when describing to WikkiTimes how students sit on bare floor to learn.\n\n\u201cWe have no option,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only accept what they give to us no matter how bad or good it looks.

But there are no emails or phone numbers. The companies do not have functional websites nor any active social media accounts for public engagement.\n\nExpert Faults Project, Claim Amount, Inflated\n\nAn expert in quantity survey and lecturer at the Department of Quantity Survey who doubles as the Current ASUU Chairman, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi, (ATBU) argued that the pictures shown to him by WikkiTimes purportedly built at N19 million were highly inflated.\n\n\u201cWith these pictures, you have just shown me, considering the cheap labour and already available land to carry out the project, the amount said to be spent on this project is shoddy and questionable,\u201d Dr Inuwa Ibrahim.\n\n\u201cN19 million only is a lot of money, and for a structure said to be erected in 2018 of such standards, such amount is enough to give us around three to four of such blocks of three classrooms of which there was no fencing and other sophisticated equipment needed,\u201d he said.\n\nA proprietor of one of the biggest secondary schools in Bauchi, who doesn\u2019t want her name mentioned, corroborates Dr Inuwa regarding the inflated cost of the Dogara\u2019s model schools.\n\nShe said N19 million will enable her erect another private school.\n\n\u201cIf given N19 million I can comfortably open another branch and erect like six to seven classrooms of a good standard because I already have the land.\n\n\u201cI may not be so particular to tell you the actual cost of my school and the maintenance, but it is my pleasure to let you know that N19 million will give me a new section and some change (additional money) to pay salaries of my staff for some months.\u201d\n\nShe said N19 million \u201cis a lot of money which can be used to build a standard school with ultra-modern science equipment that can be compared to some schools in some bigger schools.\u201d\n\nDogara, UBEC, Ignore Interview, FOI Request\n\nA freedom of information request sent to the official email address of the Universal Basic Education Commission, UBEC by WikkiTimes requesting the commission\u2019s response on its findings were not responded to days after it was sent.

          "text": "Africa\u2019s leading classified marketplace Jiji has acquired Cars45, Nigeria\u2019s leading automotive trading platform.\n\nIn a conversation with TechCrunch, Vladimir Mnogoletniy, Jiji\u2019s co-founder explained the thinking behind this move. It\u2019s looking for opportunities outside of the classifieds business.\n\n\u201cIn terms of classifieds, we\u2019re looking at opportunities,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut we are already a leader in Africa, so I think there\u2019s very limited space for whom to acquire. However, we\u2019re primarily interested in deals like Cars45, where we bring our leadership positions from classifieds and acquire very close business models that give us exposure to the transactional marketplace. So for us, a major interest will be to acquire adjacent business models.\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that vehicle listing is the second most popular category on Jiji behind real estate. The platform\u2019s total listing is worth over $10 billion, with real estate ($7 billion) and vehicles ($3 billion) making up the bulk of it.\n\n\u201cWe have leading positions in all markets we\u2019re present in and are definitely the classifieds leader in the region. Also, we are probably the largest e-commerce company in Africa by GMV,\u201d he continued.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThis acquisition will enable Cars45 to grow the vehicles category. Cars45 will merge its operations in its three African markets \u2013 Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya, to increase efficiency. It will also give Jiji an upper hand in consolidating its position as the classifieds marketplace leader.\n\nOver the years, Jiji has been plagued by trust and safety issues from users. The acquisition of Cars45 will help reduce this risk, as it offers a different car buying and selling experience via a transactional marketplace model.\n\nJiji will also leverage Cars45\u2019s network of inspection centres where cars are inspected by more than 200 parameters. Unlike a classifieds marketplace where checks are inadequately carried out, transactional models employed by platforms like Cars45 ensure quality checks and detailed reports on a car\u2019s condition with various databases.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nFor Cars45, it has come a long way from first being owned by Frontier Cars Group (FCG) and then was acquired by OLX Group and now Jiji. This poses questions around whether the integration with its new owner Jiji will work out fine.\n\n\n\nWith Jiji\u2019s new disposition towards looking outside of its normal classified business to expand its operations, I wonder whether another acquisition is around the corner?

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "With the coming on stream of Dangote Fertilizer Limited, global urea capacity is poised to see considerable growth over the coming years.\n\nThis could move from 222.96 million tons per annum (mtpa) in 2020 to 305.92 mtpa in 2030, registering a total growth of 37 percent, according to a Global Data report.\n\nDevakumar Edwin, group executive director (Strategy, Capital Projects & Portfolio Development) of Dangote Industries Limited had about a week ago, said that the $2.5 billion fertilizer plant, which recently commenced operations can produce enough for local demand as it looks towards exports. He said that the plant currently delivers 120 trucks locally.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Nigeria consumed around 20 kg of fertilizer per hectare of arable land in 2018, compared with 73 kg in South Africa and 393 kg in China. The Central Bank of Nigeria had banned the allocation of its foreign exchange for fertilizer imports as part of controls aimed at boosting local production.\n\nWhile speaking at a virtual economic forum hosted in Qatar on Tuesday, June 22, 2021, the billionaire chairman of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote stated that initial shipment from the new fertilizer plant, which has the capacity to produce 3 million tons of urea and ammonia per year, is expected to start in late June or early July.\n\nRaed also: NSIA implements restructuring of Presidential Fertilizer Initiative\n\nHe stated that the new fertilizer plant will export its first shipment in late June or early July, to Louisiana, while the majority of exports from the plant are expected to go to Brazil, adding that it will also be able to supply all the major markets in sub-Saharan Africa. He said, \u201cApart from meeting the domestic demand, we are going to be able to earn quite a lot of money exporting the goods to the South American countries.\u201d\n\nThe 3.0 million metric tons of Dangote Fertilizer plant and around 88 planned and announced plants are scheduled to come online, predominantly in Asia and Africa, over the next five years.\n\nGlobal Data, which made this announcement in its Global Urea Capacity Additions by 2030, released recently, hinted that the completion of Dangote Fertilizer has made Nigeria the third-highest country in terms of capacity additions, with a capacity of 11.58 million tons by 2030. \u201cMajor capacity additions will be from two planned plants Dangote Group Lekki Urea Plant 1 and Dangote Group Lekki Urea Plant 2 with a capacity of 1.50 million tons each by 2030,\u201d it added.\n\nDangote Fertilizer plant has however placed Nigeria in the third position among other countries, like Iran and India that will lead in global urea capacity growth by 2030.\n\nThe report classified Dangote Industries Limited, Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals Limited and Fertilizer Corporation of India Limited as the top three companies globally in terms of planned capacity addition to global urea production by 2030.\n\nDangote Industries Limited has completed the largest fertilizer plant in West Africa. The Dangote Fertilizer Project is the largest Granulated Urea Fertilizer complex in the entire fertilizer industry history in the world, with an investment of $2.5 Billion capacity of 3 Million Tons Per Annum TPA. The Dangote Fertilizer complex consists of Ammonia and Urea plants.\n\nThe Dangote Fertilizer plant, which has created thousands of direct and indirect jobs in construction and related fields will provide a major boost to the agricultural sector by significantly reducing the importation of fertilizer in Nigeria and ultimately removing the need for imports when the plant is in full production.\n\nSpeaking during the truck out of urea fertilizer recently, group executive director, (Strategy, Capital Projects & Portfolio Development) Dangote Industries Limited, Devakumar Edwin, revealed to the press over the weekend that the Plant, which has the capacity to turn out more than 4,500 tons of urea per day will conveniently meet the local demand and even produce for exports.\n\nHe stated that \u201cWe have the capacity to turn out 4,500 tons of urea every day. This is a bulk application fertilizer that each crop in Nigeria or globally requires because of the nitrogen content; this is a rich fertilizer having 46 percent nitrogen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company has the capacity to meet local demand and also export to African countries. Currently, the demand is less than one million tons and we alone can produce three million tones; so, we can easily meet local demand and also produce for export to other west African countries,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on this feat professor in the African- American Studies department at Hunter College United States, Ehiedu Iweriebor stated that the Dangote Fertilizer plant, which is a component of the refinery and petrochemical complex, has become national, continental and global game-changer.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria provides it with the first hard manufactured product on a large scale to the World, for the African, North and South American market.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt least for the first time in our lifetime, we will export petroleum products. We\u2019ll also see Nigeria for the first time exporting fertilizer rather than using the hard-earned foreign exchange to import fertilizer.\u201d\n\nHe described the Fertilizer plant as a pan-African global setting event. \u201cThe continent through the actions of the visionary and audacious son of African, Aliko Dangote industrial Nigeria-Africa is finally emergent\u201d, he added.",

Most of our young people don\u2019t want to travel, but would like to remain here in Benin. We can source businesses here and create value in our state, and our young people will be excited.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to train between 10,000 and 20,000 software engineers in the next five years, to make us competitive like other countries, as well as position us as an emerging market in the area of technology.\u201d\n\nThe governor urged for more collaboration with the United Kingdom in the area of skills acquisition, fight against human trafficking, oil palm cultivation, forestry, forest conservation and regeneration.\n\nHe noted: \u201cWe just finished the first phase of Edo State Oil Palm Programme (ESOPP) where we gave out about 50,000 hectares of land to about eight Investors and groups. None of them was from the UK. As we make further investments, we look forward to working with you.\n\n\u201cWe would like to work with you in the area of forestry and forest conservation and regeneration. Our goal is to plant a minimum of one million trees a year over the next several years. We would like to collaborate and partner with groups to give them parcels of forest to manage for us, to preserve nature.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who commended the British government on the role played in the fight against human trafficking in Edo State, said the collaboration has drastically reduced the scourge and discouraged the youths from embarking on dangerous journeys abroad.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for the assistance given to the state in tackling human trafficking, which has been a burden on us. We have made considerable progress that has led to taming the tide of human trafficking and discouraging our youths from taking dangerous journeys abroad.\n\n\u201cYour cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of offenders of human trafficking is encouraging, especially working with the state\u2019s task force. I also thank the British government for the encouragement given to this administration,\u201d Obaseki stated.\n\nEarlier, the deputy British high commissioner said, \u201cI am happy to be in Edo State. We are here and have been talking to the governor and his team on how to bring economic development into Edo State, as well as supporting British businesses in the state.\n\n\u201cWe are also in discussion on various issues and challenges facing the state, like the issue of economic development, unemployment and human trafficking; how to tackle, prevent and support victims of trafficking.\n\n\u201cAlso, we are looking at cultural issues and artifacts scattered around the world, and the on-going dialogue to try and address the return and presentations of those artifacts to Benin City,\u201d he noted.\n\n...",

We are very happy that EdoBEST has gained global and local recognition.\n\n\u201cWe want to replicate the successes and achievements that we have made in EdoBEST to EdoBEST 2.0, which is meant to capture our secondary schools and higher institutions in our dear state.\u201d\n\nCommending the Chairperson, Edo State Universal Basic Education Board (Edo-SUBEB), Dr. Joan Osa-Oviawe, for ensuring the success of the initiative, Obaseki noted: \u201cI don\u2019t see how EdoBEST would have been successful if not for the person of Dr. Joan Oviawe and her team.\n\n\u201cYou have helped us build these children to primary six level, now, what is next? So, today we are going to unveil the EdoBEST 2.0, as a way to ensure that the gains of learning at the basic education level is sustained after the first six years.\n\n\u201cWe have made progress; we are not where we want to be yet but we need to accelerate. Our kids are now learning better; their level is about 70 per cent of their colleagues in Europe and Asia. They are far from where their colleagues in Nigeria are; that\u2019s not the standard.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cWe want to be at 100 per cent: We want to extend this education transformation throughout the educational chain; basic education system, middle school, technical colleges and tertiary institutions.\n\n\u201cThe tertiary institutions are going to focus on producing certain kinds of manpower, particularly agriculture and healthcare, among others.\u201d\n\nObaseki further assured that his administration would make tertiary institutions in the state competitive globally, adding, \u201cour education system must deliberately work on our national values.\u201d\n\nOn her part, the Chairman of Edo-SUBEB said, \u201cTeachers attendance in Edo State today is 91 per cent, lessons completion rate as at today is 81 per cent and the focus is to achieve 100 per cent and perfection.\n\n\u201cWe also recorded 17 per cent increase in the enrollment into public schools in Edo State, which has amounted to 21,000 pupils coming into the system from the private schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic couldn\u2019t stop the progress of EdoBEST as teachers created over 7,000 visual classrooms to enable pupils continue with their learning, as contents were uploaded on our site to ensure continuity, despite global shutdown by COVID-19,\u201d she added.\n\nEarlier, in her welcome address, a pupil of Iguodala Primary School, Stephanie Osewengie, commended Governor Obaseki for improving the standard of education in Edo State, especially the basic education.\n\nShe said, \u201cEdoBEST has brought out the best in Edo children, putting them in the best position to compete with other children from well developed nations.

The other two are the governors of Ebonyi and Cross River.\n\nThe defection of governors and other elected officials from one party to the other is commonplace in Nigerian politics and no governor has previously lost his seat because he changed parties.\n\nRead the full text of the PDP\u2019s statement below.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is watching developments in Zamfara state as they concern reports of plans by the state governor, Bello Matawalle, to cross over to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe PDP categorically cautions Bello Matawalle to know that his plans amounts to a decision to vacate office as no law allows him to cross over to any other party with the governorship mandate statutorily given to the PDP through the ballot box, as already established by the provision of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and the standing judgment of the Supreme Court.\n\nA combined reading of Section 221 of the 1999 Constitution as the pronouncements of the Supreme Court in Faleke v. INEC (2016) is clear in holding that it is the political party that stands for election, that votes scored in election belong to the political party and that the candidate nominated to contest at an election by his party, acts only as the agent of his party.\n\nThe PDP also cautions members of the National Assembly as well as members of the Zamfara State House of Assembly, not to allow themselves to be pushed into losing their seats as the provisions of the constitution is very clear in barring lawmakers from cross carpeting, except in a situation of a division in the political party upon which platform they were elected.\n\nThere is no division in the PDP to warrant the defection of any of our lawmakers.\n\nThe PDP hopes that Bello Matawalle as well as members of the National and State Assembly from Zamfara state will take caution.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Working Committee (NWC) has approved the dissolution of the Zamfara State Executive of the party. The decision is in line with the provision of Section 29 (2)(b) of the PDP Constitution 2017 (as amended).\n\nAll party leaders, critical stakeholders and teeming members of our party in Zamfara state should, by this, be guided accordingly.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSigned:\n\nKola Ologbondiyan\n\nNational Publicity Secretary",

As a result, irregular payment of N38,219,919,530.32 by way of personnel cost was made to the staff of the Fund from 2012 to 2017.\n\n\u201cImplementation of an unapproved salary structure may result in wastage of public funds, as remuneration may be higher than the productivity level of staff.\n\n\u201cThe Managing Director is required to provide the approval of the National Salaries, Income and Wages Commission for the implementation of the Fund\u2019s salaries structure.\u201d\n\nBut the Managing Director of NSTIF, Dr. Michael Akabogu claimed that the amount was approved by the NSIWC through a letter dated 4th July, 2019.\n\nHowever, when the committee looked at the letter from the commission on the illegal, it was observed that the letter was written five years after the commission started paying the salaries.\n\nThe panel further discovered in the letter from the commission that an objection was raised about the payment of unapproved salaries by it.\n\nThe letter of National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission reads in part: \u201cHowever, the following anomalies are observed in the consolidated salary are General Manager and Deputy General Manager are both places on GL17 respectively and One GL17, (General Manager) salary grade has 8 steps while another GL (Deputy General Manager) and GL 16 salary grades have 5 steps each.\n\n\u201cThe (management of the) Fund is, therefore, advised to arrange a meeting of the fund, it\u2019s supervising ministry and this Commission to rectify these anomalies before the next promotion exercise.\u201d\n\nThe Senate panel, thereafter, sustained the AuGF\u2019s query of illegal payment of salaries by the NSTIF.",

Selection by merit has produced a mix of persons from different places and backgrounds within the Nigerian tapestry.\n\nThe fourth cohort is having 24 members, unlike the first three cohorts which had 16 fellows each. This is a deliberate attempt to widen access to the programme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMembers of the fourth cohort that has just been unveiled can be proud of themselves. This cohort with representation from 16 states and the FCT is the most diverse so far.\n\nThe distribution is 50:50 male and female. This is evidence that merit is not the enemy of diversity and gender equity. We look forward to welcoming you to Kaduna.\n\nI urge you to devote time in the weeks before resumption to prepare for the challenges and opportunities of the fellowship.\n\nYour first weekend as fellows will be dominated by a seminar, followed by immersion in the daily work of government agencies, along with other aspects of the rich and varied fellowship programme, including visits, speaker series and community service.\n\nThe Kaduna State Government believes in our young people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, we invest in creating platforms and opportunities for them. We have appointed many young persons and given them challenging responsibilities. We are particularly impressed with the commitment and competence of our young women in government. And we initiated the Kashim Ibrahim Fellowship to help widen the pool of young persons whose leadership ability we can help develop and nurture.\n\nJust as the appointees in this government come from across Nigeria, we opened up participation in the Kashim Ibrahim Fellowship to all Nigerian youths, with the hope to open to all Africans and the Diaspora.\n\nI wish to thank all the members of the Governing Board for an excellent job in running the Kashim Ibrahim Fellowship. Dele Olojede, Orode Doherty and Asue Ighodalo have been excellent cheerleaders for the fellowship.\n\nThe Steering Committee continues to do an excellent job of supporting the Governing Board, and I thank all the members for their efforts. We are also indebted to the many prominent citizens who have spared the precious time to share their life and professional experiences with our fellows during the Speaker Series. They have afforded these young persons incredible insights into life which they will long cherish.\n\nWith young people like our Kashim Ibrahim Fellows, the future of Nigeria is assured, and will, by the Grace of Almighty God, be better than today.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s military says its troops have killed 12 suspected Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province members during a gun duel in Borno State, the epicentre of insurgency in the West African country.\n\nThe military said the gunfight was in conjunction with the Air Component of Operation Hadin Kai.\n\nA statement by the Director of Army Public Relations, Onyema Nwachukwu noted that the suspected terrorists made an attempt to attack one of the military operational bases in Bula Yobe but fled following the resistance from the troops.\n\nMr Nwachukwu also noted that two soldiers were killed and five injured during the encounter. He said the injured troops were receiving medical attention.\n\nHe added that a Gun Truck, one Self Propelled Gun-9, one Dushika Gun and one mounted QJC Machine Gun, one Light Machine Gun and five AK 47 Rifles were recovered from the terrorists.\n\n\u201cTroops of 152 Task Force Battalion in conjunction with the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on Sunday, 27 June 2021 dealt a devastating blow on marauding Boko Haram (BHT) and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) while attempting to infiltrate the Forward Operational Base at Bula Yobe in Borno State,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists, who came mounted on Gun trucks and several motorcycles attacked the location via an unsuspected crossing point but were met with a heavy volume of fire from the vigilant troops. The Land troops, in their usual dexterity swiftly and decisively engaged the terrorists, subsequently forcing them to retreat, having lost initiative.\n\n\u201cThe troops sustained the firefight and successfully neutralised 12 terrorists, with several others fleeing with gunshot wounds. The troops gallantly captured one Gun Truck, one Self Propelled Gun-9, one Dushika Gun and one mounted QJC Machine Gun. Other items captured are one Light Machine Gun and five AK 47 Rifles.\n\n\u201cSadly, during the encounter, two soldiers paid the supreme sacrifice, while five others sustained varying degrees of injury and have been evacuated by the Air component of OPHK to a medical facility, where they are currently receiving medical attention.\n\n\u201cThe general area within FOB Bula Yobe is cool and calm under the control of troops of the battalion. Further exploitation by resilient troops is ongoing.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Army Staff, Major General Faruk Yahaya has lauded the Land troops and the Air Component for their synergy and quick response, which is in tandem with the ongoing rejigging of the counter-terrorism counter-insurgency operations in the North East. He charged the troops to maintain the tempo and vehemently hold their ground, to deny the terrorists freedom of action.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
