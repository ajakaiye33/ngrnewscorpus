Reliable and Multiple Sources have said.\n\nTamsu Kawu is just about 80km drive from Maiduguri and located north west, which has hitherto been razed down, before the former governor Kashim Shettima spent millions of naira, reconstructed and resettled it.\n\nSpeaking to one of the victims who was a retired Director in the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources in Borno State who did not want his name mentioned confirmed the incident to our Correspondent.\n\nHe said, \u201cit was when I was interrogated and the terrorists learnt that I was a diabetic patient, coupled with my old age that saved me, as the Commander of the terrorists told his members to allow me join those who were set free at about 7pm.\u201d\n\nHe revealed that the terrorists during interrogations told them that they were among those who participated in the bloody killing of leader of Boko Haram sect, late Abubakar Shekau, adding that, they are members of the ISWAP group who are determined to protect the rights of innocent civilians.\n\n\u201cI have to thank Allah (God) for saving us from the hands of terrorists today.\n\n\u201cOur vehicle came into road ambush where several passengers and motorists aboard 8 different vehicles were abducted and taken to a nearby river at about 3PM\n\n\u201cAfter series of interrogations, many of us were released accept three persons who were detained for reason not based known to us.\n\n\u201cThe terrorsists after interrogating us said that they were amongst those who killed Abubakar Shekau. They also said that they are out to protect all innocent civilians, accept those who chose to follow different faith or identified as infidels. \u201d he said.\n\nThe freed victim however told our Correspondent that he has since been reunited with his family, after the incident which lasted four about four hours.",

          "text": "By James Eze\n\nListening to Prof Chukwuma Soludo make mincemeat of his opponents at the Anambra governorship debate, I said to myself \u201cis this finally a chance for the Nigerian public intellectual?\u201d\n\nAlthough Nigeria\u2019s first President was a cerebral public intellectual whose oratory and grasp of nuance was phenomenal, the country has experienced a downward trend in the capacity of successive leaders who came barely prepared for office. The result is that political leadership at the national level in Nigeria has never carried any hint of charisma. Nigeria\u2019s political leaders hardly inspire the people. Not even their families!\n\nBut in Prof Chukwuma Soludo, Anambra is bucking the trend. First, it is not the practice among Nigerian politicians to anoint brilliant successors but governor Obiano did just that. He pulled all the stops to give Soludo a chance; a towering public intellectual whose ideas of what an ideal society should be may be given a chance to flower on November 6, 2021. Next, of all the candidates on the ballot, Soludo is the only one whose preparation goes beyond a huge stash of cash for vote buying. He has a compendium of his ideas packaged in a coffee table book which anyone can use as a guide to access and judge him when he assumes power. In fact, Soludo is adequately prepared for the office he is seeking. But will they let him?\n\nToday in Anambra, everyone knows that Chukwuma Soludo is the hope for a brighter future. To a people whose worldview is deeply rooted in the fluidity of life as captured in the saying that nwata kwoo aka, osolu okenye rie nri, it would be a travesty to deny Chukwuma Soludo the office he has so much prepared for. Indeed, for a state which prides itself as Light of the Nation, it would be inconceivable to settle for less. That would dim the light.\n\nSoludo\u2019s dominance of the gubernatorial debate organized by Arise Television has laid bare the stark differences between preparation and chance or providence. Soludo has gone through the mill, absorbing all the rigors of training and experience and applying himself to situations that made personal growth inevitable. On the other hand, his opponents appear to have taken the shortcut to their destinations at worst or are simply counting on providence at best. But the leadership of a state like Anambra is not a walk in the park. The governor of Anambra State has no \u201choliday,\u201d no breathing space and no time for long introspection. He has no liberty to leave Anambra in the hands of God for an hour. Events will force him to stand up! That is why Soludo is the man for the job!\n\nAnd so, we just might eventually have a serious public intellectual as the chief executive officer of a state. We just might have the chance we have been waiting for; a chance to test the hypothesis and the theories, to place assumptions on the fire grill of reality; a chance to restore dignity to scholars and workers whose only pride is their knowledge. Nigeria has a large tribe of public intellectuals. Brilliant men and women who give lectures and speeches across the world on how societies should organize for success. But back home, the crude politics we play discourages most of them from showing interest in political leadership. Kingsley Moghalu took his chances in the last presidential election only to realize that Nigerian elections do not care for knowledge or personal excellence.\n\nChukwuma Soludo offers Nigerian public intellectuals the first real chance. Will Anambra take it?\n\nMr. James Eze is Chief Press Secretary to Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State.",

It is worrisome, and a responsible government must know that its primary responsibility of governance is to ensure security of lives and property.\n\n\u201cIf the people that you are presiding over are no longer safe that means there is problem, and you must have to find a way of addressing them.\n\n\u201cThe same time we take the security agents task because often times they seem to seeing journalists as competitors. We are not competitors, rather collaborators because when we collaborate, the nation benefits but when we compete, the nation suffers.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to them let them begin to see journalists as partners in progress, especially at this critical time when insecurity has practically become the issue across the country, and rise to the occasion to deal with these competing issues so that we can map out a way forward for Nigeria and democracy.\n\nAccording to him, last year was 62, and between 2006 and 2020, 1,200, and Nigeria has an appreciable percentage of it, which also signpost the very harrowing terrible, unfriendly environment journalists operate.\n\n\u201cSomebody even said the present President of Nigeria as military leader was even much benevolent when you do a comparative analysis of then and now, and it simply means democracy itself is in danger if nothing is urgently done to check this rising wave.\n\n\u201cBy the time we bring these issues to the fore it will be an opportunity to challenge government because we cannot have democracy that thrives whose press is not guaranteed when journalists are every day being harassed, intimidated, kidnapped, killed, and incarcerated, there is no democracy.\u201d\n\nHe also expressed concern over the current environment journalists work in as it is no more conducive and a threat to democracy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs we speak for 20 days a journalist has gone missing and the government seems not worried. It is worrisome, and a responsible government must know that its primary responsibility of governance is to ensure security of lives and property.\n\n\u201cIf the people that you are presiding over are no longer safe that means there is problem, and you must have to find a way of addressing them\u201d, he pointed.\n\nHe also called on security agencies to collaborate with journalists and see them as partners in progress.\n\n\u201cThe same time we take the security agents task because often times they seem to seeing journalists as competitors.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said about 1.5 trillion dollars would be needed by Nigeria over a ten-year period, to achieve an appreciable level of the National Infrastructure Stock.\n\nPresident Buhari gave the figure on Tuesday in Glasgow at a COP 26 high-level side event on improving global infrastructure hosted by President Joe Biden of the United States, EU Commission President, Von Der Leyen and the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria is ready for your investments in infrastructural development in the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018My administration has established a clear legal and regulatory framework for private financing of infrastructure to establish a standard process, especially on the monitoring and evaluation process.\n\n\u2018\u2018We look forward to working with you in this regard,\u2019\u2019 he told world leaders at the high level meeting on the margins of the climate change conference.\n\nPresident Buhari also declared that his administration had taken infrastructure expansion in Nigeria seriously, conscious of the fact that new investments in critical sectors of the economy would aid lifting 100 million Nigerians from poverty by 2030.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is a nexus between infrastructural development and the overall economic development of a nation.\n\n\u2018\u2018My administration identified this early enough as a major enabler of sustainable economic development and the realization of other continental and global development aspirations particularly the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\u2018\u2018On my assumption of office in 2015, Nigeria faced a huge infrastructure deficit and the total National Infrastructure Stock was estimated at 35% of our Gross Domestic Product.\n\n\u2018\u2018In solving these problems, we embarked on a massive infrastructure expansion programme in the areas of Health care, Education, Transportation, Manufacturing, Energy, Housing, Agriculture, and Water Resources.\n\n\u2018\u2018We provided more financial resources for these policies, charted new international partnerships and pursued liberalization policies to allow private sector participation.\n\n\u2018\u2018We introduced the revised National Integrated Infrastructure Master Plan \u2013 a policy document that ensures our infrastructure expansion projects is cross-sectorally integrated and environmentally friendly, \u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President welcomed the G7 countries for its ground-breaking plan to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment for low \u2013 and middle-income countries.\n\nHe noted that the \u201cBuild Back Better World\u201d plan, an initiative of the G7 countries, is expected to be a values-driven, high-standard, and transparent infrastructure partnership.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is our fervent hope and expectations that this plan will be pursued to its logical conclusion in order to bridge the infrastructural gap between the North and South,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to outline the principles, values and standards Nigeria would like to see from infrastructure initiatives and the challenges the country has faced in partnering with donors on infrastructure development.\n\n\u2018\u2018The aim of pursuing quality infrastructure investment is to maximize the positive economic, environmental, social, and development impact of infrastructure and create a virtuous circle of economic activities, while ensuring sound public finances.\n\n\u2018\u2018This virtuous circle can take various forms in stimulating the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nigerian leader noted that infrastructure investment should, therefore, take into account economic, environmental and social, and governance aspects, guided by a sense of shared, long-term responsibility for the planet, consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nThe President added that the positive and negative impacts of infrastructure projects on ecosystems, biodiversity, climate, weather and the use of resources should be internalized by incorporating these environmental considerations over the entire process of infrastructure investment.\n\n\u2018\u2018Domestic resource mobilization is critical to addressing the infrastructure financing gap. Assistance for capacity building, including for project preparation, should be provided to developing countries with the participation of international organizations.\n\n\u2018\u2018Quality infrastructure investment also needs to be tailored to individual country conditions and consistent with local laws and regulations.\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, Infrastructure projects should align with national strategies and nationally determined contributions for those countries determined to implement them, and with transitioning to long-term low emissions strategies, while being mindful of country circumstances,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President also called for the environmental impact of infrastructure investment to be made transparent to all stakeholders, noting that this will enhance the appreciation of sustainable infrastructure projects and increase awareness of related risks.",

He said the way and manner his party conducted its internal affairs and particularly the recent National Convention in Abuja showed that there is unity within the main opposition party.\n\nWhile admitting that the PDP\u2019s convention was the beginning of the redemption process, he said Nigerians have seen that the PDP is more coordinated and ready to deliver the country from further collapse.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the first instance, I agree with you that our National Convention was the beginning. That has sent the right message to all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOkowa said Nigeria is currently bedeviled with many crises in many sectors of the economy, including security, finance, agriculture, job creation, poverty alleviation, health, infrastructures, to mention a few, adding that, this has made Nigerians uncomfortable and will lead them to make the right choice in the next general elections.\n\nThe governor added: \u201cThere are several crises and Nigerians are no longer comfortable and I believe that, Nigerians will make better choice of voting for the PDP come 2023.\n\n\u201cLooking at the totality of the challenges, you\u2019ll agree with me that something needs to be done; we need to recreate hope for a new Nigeria and make the country a safe haven. And for that reason, we are presenting ourselves to redeem Nigeria from the present state of dissatisfaction we find ourselves.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe governor also denied allegation of the PDP governors taking charge of the party structure, saying the party has always been conducting its affairs in a democratic way through intensive and extensive consultations.\n\nHe explained the absence of former President Gooluck Jonathan at the convention, saying nobody should read any meaning to that, as he (Jonathan) had earlier informed the party about his engagement outside the country during the period.\n\nThe governor said that with its convention, the PDP had once again demonstrated unity and respect for wishes of the people, saying the party has gone beyond imposition of officials over the people.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is very clear to all that PDP is a party to support. With our convention, we were able to send the right message of unity to the whole nation. This also shows that PDP is still very strong and I am not aware of any issue of disagreement within our party.\u201d\n\nOn the emergence of Senator Iyorchia Ayu as the next PDP chairman, Okowa said that was the choice of the North, saying he was confident that the region had made the right decision, expressing confidence on the chairman-designate.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe North made the choice and they chose him because of his pedigree.\u201d\n\nThough the governor denied allegations that the governors within the fold are wielding too much influence, he nevertheless admitted that since the party does not have a president, somebody will have to lead.\n\nOn why the PDP wants to take over the leadership of the country, Okowa said: \u201cWe are not competing with the APC anymore. The difference is clear between the PDP and the APC. The foundation laid by the PDP has been bastardised. The nation has gotten it all wrong by choosing the APC. It is quite clear that Nigeria is not moving in the right direction.\u201d",

          "text": "In this piece, Andy Ikpeazu urges participating political parties to concentrate on wooing voters ahead of the Anambra State governorship elections, instead of attacking the personality of Imo State Governor Hope Uzodimma\n\nBarring unforeseen circumstances, the governorship election in Anambra State will hold on Saturday. In itself, the election is making some wrong headlines especially with the palpable threat by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) to disrupt it. Of course, the authorities have moved to forestall the security threats to the election by deploying two Deputy Inspector-Generals, Five AIGs, 14 Police Commissioners to Anambra, but while Nigerians wait to see what happens; the message should not be lost on us. IPOB\u2019s influence in the Southeast can already be seen in the sit-at-home being enforced across the region every Monday; and the potential threat to a scheduled election by a group that has been dismissed as being inconsequential by the authorities. Were IPOB to be successful in keeping people away from the polling booths, that would further raise question marks over the ability of the Nigerian state to provide adequate security for most activities.\n\nThe threats to the election may have stolen all the headlines but equally important in the preparations for the election is the fears expressed by some of the contestants on the ability of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure that the election is free and fair. Eyebrows were raised when some of the contestants were seen campaigning in faraway Lagos and also when some of them suggested or hinted at plans by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to snatch Anambra by all means. In both instances, the message is the same; were the other parties to fail at the November 6 polls; that failure would automatically be blamed on security threat or power show by the APC. However, given the facts available, those who have said \u201cAnambra is not Imo\u2019 miss the point; elections are not won in the media but in the polling booths. Let\u2019s take a look at the last governorship election in Imo and how Senator Hope Uzodinma emerged governor of the state.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe last governorship election in Imo is a lesson in doing the basics when it comes to political contests. First, as any reasonable student of politics will agree, you have to move people to come out to vote for you, which in the circumstances is obvious. Then, you have to ensure that all the votes of your people count. Fail in any of these two basic assignments and you have no business contesting for political office. Now let\u2019s review what happened at the elections held on March 9, 2019. Fact \u2013 the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared the final scores as follows; Ihedioha (PDP) 273,404 (winner), Uche Nwosu (AA) 190,364, Ifeanyi Ararume (APGA) 114,676 and Uzodinma (APC) 96,458. However, for elections into the office of a governor, and as Nigeria\u2019s most recent history has shown, there is a an established grieviance redress process that begins at the electoral tribunal and ends at the Supreme Court. All the aspirants in Imo exercised their rights to contest Ihedioha\u2019s emergence by heading to the electoral tribunal. The present Imo State Governor, Sen. Hope Uzodimma hinged his own claim on the argument that the results from 388 polling units were not included in the final tally by INEC. He argued that the non-inclusion of results from these units denied him a total 213,695 votes due to him whereas Ihedioha scored only 1,903 votes in those units going by the results captured in Forms EC8A.\n\nThough he failed at the tribunal, Uzodinma took his petition to the Court of Appeal where four of the judges ruled against him but a minority ruling held among others, that (1) the Forms EC8A from the 388 units were wrongfully excluded and that (2) Ihedioha\u2019s lawyers did not prove that the results sheets were forged. Justice Frederick Oho of the Nigerian Court of Appeal, in his dissenting ruling wrote \u201cIt is also clear on the record that after the appellants had explicitly set out in the Petition a schedule of all the polling unit results, which were allegedly excluded from collation at ward level by the third respondent (INEC), they led evidence through several witnesses to prove their case as contained in the Petition\u201d. What the APC\u2019s candidate successfully achieved at the Appeal Court is to create the ground to doubt the election of Ihedioha and the questions are obvious: how did INEC omit results from 388 polling units from the total? Who is responsible for the error? Who stood to benefit from that error? Should the votes of people in those 388 polling units not have mattered? For those who believe that electoral cycles are important in deepening democracy, those questions are important and addressing them will clear the air about Imo and the last governorship election.\n\nIn this case, obviously the major beneficiary of the omission is ihedioha. A simple arithmetic shows that were those excluded votes from the 388 polling units to be added to the tally of both Ihedioha and Uzodinma; the total outcome would change drastically. Let\u2019s remember that the 1st Respondent (Ihedioha) was declared winner by the 3rd respondent (INEC) with a total of 258,259 votes while Uzodinma was said to have scored 96,458 votes. Adding the omitted votes from the 388 polling units will then have Uzodinma winning with a total of 310,153 votes while Ihedioha\u2019s total tally would be 260,162 votes.\n\nAs Hope Uzodimma himself has said: \u201cThere is a reason for the supreme court. In the doctrine and principle of democracy, the law expected that there would be grievances and malpractices in the electoral process. When this happens, the only legitimate right you have is to seek redress at the court. And of course, the court determines. Remember that this is not the first time so many elections have held where the candidates went to court and they got justice. So, why will mine be different?\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRead Also: Uzodimma weeps over destruction of Imo community\n\nIf the INEC failed to count peoples vote and an aggrieved contestant goes through the constitutionally established process to make those votes count, how come he is vilified? And how come some of the contestants in Anambra believe the constitutionally established means of settling electoral disputes will work against them. That there are suggestions that \u2018Anambra is not Imo\u2019 makes it look like a lack of faith in the same process they have signed up for by contesting for political office.\n\nPerhaps it is also important to remember that the statement that has angered Imolites is credited to Professor Charles Soludo who is contesting to be governor of Anambra State. Given the fact that he has been chasing this political dream since 2009 when he first announced his desire on the platform of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), many would question his moral right to question the legitimacy of the election in Imo. The PDP, the platform under which Soludo made his name as Chief Economic Adviser to former President Obasanjo; Chief Executive of the National Planning Commission of Nigeria and most memorably, as Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was notorious for upturning people\u2019s mandate by using state apparatus. The former CBN governor was himself a beneficiary of a discredited political process that threw him up as candidate on the ticket of the PDP in an election he lost to Peter Obi, the candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). After he announced his interest in becoming governor in Anambra, the PDP selected Soludo as their consensus candidate for the position from a field of 47 candidates; a decision that was contested by 23 of the 47 aspirants, citing lack of transparency in the process. His candidacy was affirmed by the then ruling party, which overruled the protests before he went on to lose in an election that was adjudged as free and fair by most observers. He did not fare any better in 2013 as his defection to APGA ahead of the elections of 2014 ended in failure. The APGA Screening Committee in mid-August 2013 disqualified Soludo along with five other candidates and with that decision ended his dream of being governor outside central banking. Soludo\u2019s paranoia about this weekend\u2019s election is understandable given those earlier failures, but attempting to preempt the process by discrediting it has all the makings of desperation on his part.\n\nEqually important is the new-found influence of Imo in both the Southeast and Abuja. The governor who cut his political tooth in the second republic with his sojourn in the National Party of Nigeria is no stranger to political battles. It was one of such battles that saw him being sworn in on May 29, 2011 as a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, representing Imo State (West Senatorial District). Earlier in January 2011, Uzodinma had defeated other candidates including Senator Osita Izunaso at the PDP senatorial primary for the Imo West, with 2,147 votes against the 891 votes recorded by his closes rival. Though he was disqualified by a federal high court judgment for not being properly cleared by the PDP electoral panel led by Nwafor-Orizu. However, he got reprieve via a court of appeal judgment which issued a stay of execution while the case was being decided. While the court of appeal upheld the federal high court judgement, Uzodimma\u2019s petition to the Supreme Court cleared his path to the election that was held on April 2011 elections, in which he polled 85,042 votes, ahead of former Governor Achike Udenwa then of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) who got 64,228; and Nonye Rajis-Okpara of APGA with 57,110 votes. In May 2011, the Supreme Court overturned the earlier decisions and declared that Uzodimma was the valid candidate and therefore had been elected. Needless to say that he went ahead to win re-election for a second term in the Senate during the 2015 election. So, unlike critics such as Soludo, the Imo governor is a battle-hardened political powerhouse who understands what it takes to win elections. It is interesting that for both the Senate election, which he contested on the platform of the ruling PDP and the gubernatorial election which he contested on the platform of the APC; Uzodimma did not depend on state power to rig as some are insinuating. He used the constitutionally recognised process of settling electoral disputes and came out victorious. If he were to be a rigger, there would have been no need for long court sessions as all state apparatus and the INEC would have ensured his victory at first attempt. It is obvious that the Imo State governor knows something that others don\u2019t. Uzodimma demonstrated faith in the constitutionally established process, a trait that all election contestants including Soludo would do well to emulate.\n\nIn the final analysis and provided the constitutionally established process of settling all grievances are allowed to run its due process; it is the people of Anambra who will have the last say. Dragging Uzodimma and the good people of Imo into the election in Anambra is unnecessary. Since it is their votes that count; the contestants should focus on canvassing for those votes rather than distracting the good people of Imo from the rebuilding process that is ongoing.",

          "title": "Echoes from PDP convention and 2023 calculus",
          "text": "The recently concluded national convention of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP) was conceived, midwifed and birthed by a 13-man team made up of the party\u2019s governors. In this piece, GBADE OGUNWALE reports that the outcome of the convention has sent a clear message as to who will swing the balance in determining the party\u2019s joint ticket for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nGovernors elected on the platform of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP) earlier in the year initiated moves to reposition the party ahead of the 2023 general elections. But critics, mainly chieftains of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), mocked the governors, dismissing them as \u201cjokers on a jamboree\u201d. Unfazed by criticisms, the governors embarked on several consultative shuttles to Abuja and across several PDP controlled states. They were coming up with informed criticisms of the APC-led administration in their media briefings each time they gathered. It didn\u2019t take long before they beamed the searchlight on the national leadership of the PDP itself.\n\nThey considered the present crop of party leaders too complacent and laid back to tackle the daunting challenges confronting the main opposition party. With little effort, the governors dismantled the Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) and thereby paved the way for a national convention that was tailored to suit their agenda. They left nothing to chance in ensuring that their preferred candidates got elected into key party positions at the convention; the outcome of which had been known to all ahead of time.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nKey elective positions were shared by the governors and given to their loyalists on a platter. Governor Samuel Ortom brought in Dr Iyorchia Ayu as National Chairman. Oyo State\u2019s Governor Seyi Makinde nominated the Deputy National Chairman (South), Taofeek Arapaja, while Rivers State\u2019s Governor Nyesom Wike picked Senator Samuel Anyanwu for the position of National Secretary. All the governors had kept vigil at the convention venue to ensure that everything proceeded as planned.\n\nThe governors had, days before the convention, bludgeoned other aspirants contesting against their anointed candidates into submission. The long list of intending contestants was pruned to ensure that \u201crecalcitrant\u201d aspirants were screened out of the race tactically. A few contestants had to withdraw from the race at the convention ground shortly before the commencement of voting. Former Osun State Governor Olagunsoye Oyinlola who dared the governors by going ahead to contest for the position of Deputy National Chairman (South) eventually lost to Arapaja with a very wide margin. Also, Mrs Inna Ciroma, who fought her battle to the end for the position of Deputy National Chairman (North), was roundly defeated by the governors\u2019 anointed candidate, Alhaji Umar Damagum.\n\nThrough their actions, the governors have made it clear that henceforth they are going to be calling the shots; using the power of the purse. With the convention over, the stage is now set for the next phase of the battle, which is the presidential nomination coming up in the months ahead. The new National Chairman, Ayu and his team will be taking office on December 9.\n\nBy implication, the process for the party\u2019s presidential nominations will start unfolding by the first quarter of 2022. And going by the governors\u2019 permutations, Ayu will be expected to \u201cvoluntarily\u201d relinquish his position if a candidate of northern extraction emerges after the primary. He would be replaced by Arapaja, in line with the governors\u2019 agenda. The party has alternated its presidential ticket and the chairmanship seat between the North and the South. And if the body language of the governors is anything to go by, then it\u2019s apparent the 2023 joint presidential ticket of the PDP will be picked by consensus. There are strong indications that the candidates would emerge from among the league of 13 governors. Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal and his Bauchi State counterpart, Bala Mohammed are speculated to be on the cards.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHowever, party sources have hinted that the governors may zero in on Tambuwal and mobilise for Mohammed\u2019s re-election as Bauchi governor. The argument is that while Tambuwal will have concluded his second and final tenure as governor in May 2023, his Bauchi State counterpart will still be eligible for re-election. And with the newfound unity among the governors, it might not be a difficult task persuading Mohammed to shift grounds for Tambuwal. Also, Governors Nyesom Wike (Rivers); Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta); and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu) are being speculated to be on the cards for the vice presidential ticket. All three governors are in their second and final term.\n\nThe permutations, if pushed through, will certainly put the presidential aspirations of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, former Senate President Bukola Saraki and former Kano State Governor Musa Kwankwaso in jeopardy. The trio had advertised their 2023 presidential aspirations during the just concluded convention as they stormed the convention arena with their teeming supporters in a carnival-like manner. Posters of varying sizes conveying their intentions were conspicuously displayed at strategic locations at the convention venue and the entire vicinity of Eagle Square where the event took place.\n\nBut, with the entire party structure now in the firm grip of the governors, the deal appears signed, sealed and delivered. The position of the governors and other party stakeholders on zoning is that the PDP had, in 2019, zoned its presidential ticket to the North for two election circles (2019 and 2023). As far as they are concerned, that arrangement is still subsisting and must be observed to the letter.\n\nHowever, it remains unclear if the governors believe that having Ayu preside over the next presidential primary is enough to guarantee that their permutation is cast in granite. Wike had, almost single-handedly, foisted Secondus on the party as national chairman during the 2017 convention. He did this with a mindset that the now-ousted party chairman owed him a debt of loyalty. The Rivers governor had, through what many considered subtle blackmail, insisted that the 2018 presidential primary be held in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. The governor had threatened to \u201cdeal with PDP\u201d if the party leaders failed to reverse an earlier decision by the National Executive Committee (NEC) to hold the primary in Abuja. The entire party leaders and stakeholders were forced to change the venue to Port Harcourt, as dictated by Wike. At the Port Harcourt primary, the Rivers governor backed Tambuwal against Atiku for the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nThe general perception at the time was that the governor was banking on Secondus to tilt the balance in favour of his preferred candidate (Tambuwal); which was the reason why he insisted on having the primary in his backyard. Those involved in the planning of the event also hinted that Wike had blown the whistle when it was time to play the \u201cgame\u201d but Secondus ignored it. Consequently, Atiku won; beating Wike to the game on the governor\u2019s home turf. That, many believe, was the genesis of the acrimonious relationship between the governor and the ousted chairman.\n\nEvent watchers posit that it was the ensuing cat and mouse game that finally culminated in the removal of Secondus from office. And if Secondus could \u201cbetray\u201d his benefactor in the 2018 primary, what is the guarantee that a new chairman will not toe the same line during the 2022 primary? Experience in Nigerian politics has shown that loyalty can shift where there is a clash of interests. Politics in Nigeria has come to be defined by interests, either latent or manifest.\n\nThus, while the governors are basking in the euphoria of their total victory at the convention, the stark reality of the dynamics of the politics of zoning may dim their glowing torch in the months ahead. They may have an uphill task convincing the voting public why they should vote for another president of northern extraction in 2023 after President Muhammadu Buhari must have served out his two terms of eight uninterrupted years. This is more so if the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) decides to field a formidable presidential candidate of southern extraction. The PDP governors seem to be banking on bloc votes from the North, with the usual sexed-up figures.\n\nHowever, analysts predict a replay of the electoral upset that saw the late Chief Moshood Abiola, a southern Muslim candidate, roundly defeating Alhaji Bashir Tofa in the June 12, 1993, presidential election. Like the PDP, the defunct National Republican Convention (NRC) had fielded Tofa in the belief that bloc votes from the North would swing the balance for the party. But it turned out to be a fiasco when Abiola, who ran on the platform of the defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP) took the NRC and its candidate to the cleaners. Abiola\u2019s victory, though annulled by the General Ibrahim Babangida military regime at the time, has come to be recognised in the annals of Nigeria\u2019s history, with June 12 now being observed as \u201cDemocracy Day\u201d.\n\nAre the PDP governors willing to learn any lesson from the SDP-NRC experience? Is their triumph at the convention a masterstroke, or a pyrrhic victory? Only time will tell.",

Justice Mary Peter Odili on Friday October 29, 2021 in a Gestapo manner .\n\n\u201cThe attack unfortunately depicted a gory picture of war by some armed persons suspected to be security operatives representing different agencies of government who seemed to have come to kill and maim their target under the guise of undertaking a search whose warrant was questionable and baseless.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened and taken aback by this uncivilized and shameful show of primitive force on an innocent judicial officer that has so far spent several years of her productive life serving the country she calls her own.\n\n\u201cThis incident brought back, rather painfully, the ugly memory of the October 2016 midnight invasion of the homes of our respected justices with no satisfactory explanations as to the true motive behind such brazen assault on our collective sensibility.\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it abundantly clear that the Nigerian Judiciary is the third arm of the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and should be respected and treated as such.\n\n\u201cWe have had a full dosage of this fusillade of unwarranted and unprovoked attacks on our judicial officers and even facilities across the country and we say it loudly now that enough is enough.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary should never be misconstrued by any individual or institution of government as the weeping child among the three arms of government that must always be chastised and ridiculed to silence because of our conservative disposition.\n\n\u201cThough there have emerged discordant tunes from the various security agencies that allegedly participated in the dastardly act, we are not lying low on this dehumanizing treatment meted out to one of our own\u201d.\n\nThe statement disclosed that the apex court has commenced a full-scale independent investigation to unravel the true masquerades behind the mystery as well as the real motives behind the whole imbroglio.\n\nThey call on the Inspector General of Police to rise up to the occasion by carrying out a discreet investigation and make his findings known to the Nigerian public with a view to bringing the perpetrators to justice as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Judiciary cannot only bark, but can also bite. We can no longer be treated with disdain and levity. The rule of law and constitutionality must govern our conduct so that we can tag along with the comity of nations and be taken seriously too\u201d, the statement added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "7 victims rescued, 6 bodies recovered\n\nBy Segun James and Rebecca Ejifoma\n\nAs the death toll in the collapsed high-rise building at Gerrald Road in Ikoyi, Lagos rises to six, two more survivors have been pulled out of the rubble, emergency responders have said.\n\nThis brings the number of survivors to seven while six deaths have been recorded so far, according to NEMA.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen as the state Deputy\u2019s Governor, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, visited the scene, a worker at the site at the time the building collapsed, Gabriel Bassey, disclosed that about 50 persons may still be trapped under the rubble.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis project, 360 Degree, was built by Fourscore Homes Limited. I was trying to plug my phone and not up to five seconds that I left the spot, I saw the building coming down and I ran to safety. We have a lot of people trapped in the rubble, who we need to bring out.\n\n\u201cWhen the incident happened, we brought out six dead bodies and we still have like 30 Togolese and Nigerian bricklayers and four engineers and other workers. My boss, Mr Femi, is still trapped in the building. He was on the 18th floor with some of his clients, who wanted to buy the building, when the incident happened.\u201d\n\nA resident, Morris Ashiobi, said the building did not show any sign before it caved in.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen the incident happened, I was the first person to climb the building to the last floor and I saw corpses. I started calling people to come and rescue others. We recovered six dead bodies, rescued one, while the rest are still under the rubble.\n\n\u201cThe building didn\u2019t give any sign, it just came down. We were still working on it. It took an hour before the emergency agencies came and we had brought out the dead bodies and rescued one person before they came. If I\u2019m not mistaken, about 40 persons were on site, because we were working at the time. Some people came from Abuja today (Monday) to work. I have many friends still trapped in the building.\n\n\u201cWhen the police came, they chased us out and didn\u2019t allow us to rescue anyone again; if they had allowed us, we would still have rescued more people.\u201d\n\nLagos State Police boss, Mr.Hakeem Odumosu, confirmed the death of five persons as at Monday while three others were rescued.\n\nHowever, the South-West Coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency, Ibrahim Farinloye, said four corpses were recovered from the building, adding that four were rescued.\n\nEmergency responders at the scene include the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, National Emergency Management Agency, Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, Lagos State Fire Service, Federal Road Safety Corps, police, army and paramedics.\n\nSee Photos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Chipper Cash valued at $2 billion after investment from world\u2019s most valuable crypto exchange",
          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "Facebook on Thursday, October 28 announced that it has changed its company name to Meta. This change of name was announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook\u2019s annual Connect augmented and virtual reality conference.\n\nThe company said it chose the name \u201cMeta\u201d to serve as a reminder that there is always more to build. The rebrand is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse \u2014 a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOver time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and identity on what we\u2019re building toward.\u201d\n\nPer The Verge, \u201cZuckerberg owns the Twitter handle @meta and meta.com, which now redirects to a welcome page on Facebook outlining the changes. The site previously redirected to meta.org, a biomedical research discovery tool that was a project of the Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. That\u2019s part of the philanthropic arm Zuckerberg co-founded with his physician wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2015. In a Medium post on Thursday, the group says it\u2019s sunsetting Meta.org on March 31st, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change?\n\nAs expected, the new name implies that some things about the way Facebook operates would change. Facebook said its corporate structure is not changing, however, how the company reports its financials will. Starting with results for the fourth quarter of 2021, Facebook plans to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The company also said that it will change its stock ticker from FB to MVRS, effective December 1. In addition, Facebook assured users that the announcement does not affect how the company uses or shares data.\n\nAt the Connect conference, Facebook also announced new tools to help people build for the metaverse, including Presence Platform, which will enable new mixed reality experiences on Quest 2, and a $150-million investment in immersive learning to train the next generation of creators.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a letter on Thursday.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica-focused eCommerce platform, MallforAfrica seems to have suspended operations in Nigeria. From our latest inquiries, the company might be shutting down, and a total rebranding could be on the horizon.\n\nAccording to some public sources, Nigerian-born brothers and experienced entrepreneurs, Chris and Tope Folayan, founded MallforAfrica in 2011 to help people shop online for groceries, electronics, and other items.\n\nIt received backing from notable investors, partnered with reputable US and UK stores, and in a few years, became one of Africa\u2019s most popular eCommerce platforms. In 2015, Fortune actually described its presence, alongside Jumia and Konga, as heralding an eCommerce boom in Africa.\n\nHowever, while Africa\u2019s online activity increased, Jumia and Konga had their fair share of struggles. But both companies, and MallforAfrica, continued to grow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2018, Chris told TechCrunch that the company was shipping to 17 African countries. With a DHL partnership, that number could have reached 34 countries. At a time when eCommerce companies were shutting down, MallforAfrica was striking partnerships to speed up growth.\n\nIn our chat with Chris in 2020, he revealed expansion plans to the Middle East and Latin America.\n\nHowever, MallforAfrica seems to have followed the likes of Dealdey and Gloo in shutting down its eCommerce operations. Even though it claims it\u2019s temporary, some signs suggest a rebranding and a relaunch could be on the way.\n\nThe facts as we know them\n\nFirst off, its app is no longer on the Google Play Store or Apple Store. Customers can no longer log in, and the company has stopped taking orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMallforAfrica is missing on the Android store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMallforAfrica is also absent on the Apple store\n\n\u201cI used them about five times in 2019. I didn\u2019t use them again until this month when I tried to order, but I found out that I could not check out,\u201d says Kelechi*, one of the customers we spoke to.\n\nThere have also been complaints from customers unable to withdraw their funds and have gotten no response from MallforAfrica. None of the aggrieved customers agreed to comment on the issue as of the time of publishing this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nA cursory glance at major social media platforms reveals that despite customer complaints as recent as two weeks ago, MallforAfrica has not posted on social media since September 30, 2021.\n\nIn Nigeria (@mallforafricanigeria), MallforAfrica stopped responding to people on Instagram on Wednesday, September 29, 2021. Though this shot below shows a customer complaining about losing $122, comments have been disabled for the post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nCustomers made similar comments on Facebook, but it stopped responding there on Tuesday, September 28, 2021. Its last tweet was on Tuesday, June 3, 2021, but it\u2019s plausible that it stopped posting on Twitter because of Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban, which took effect on Wednesday, June 4, 2021.\n\nThis, however, doesn\u2019t explain the silence on Facebook and Instagram since September.\n\nPosing as a customer, we tried reaching out to MallforAfrica Nigeria via email to understand why we couldn\u2019t log in. Here\u2019s the response we got:\n\n\u201cWe would like to inform you that we are temporarily not accepting orders at this time. This is as a result of the unstable forex rate in Nigeria and some CBN policies.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, Nigeria\u2019s currency has been fluctuating, and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has come up with some unpredictable policies. But, the company\u2019s issues do not seem limited to Nigeria.\n\nMallforAfrica East Africa last made an Instagram post on Thursday, September 30, 2021, and there\u2019s been total silence across all its major platforms since. Interestingly, there are still complaints about poor services from its East African users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, it appears that a customer in the region still received an order, even though he hasn\u2019t been able to place a new one since.\n\n\u201cI made two orders on Monday, September 13, 2021, and they were delivered on Friday, October 29, 2021. On their website, it says 14 days,\u201d says Neza.*\n\nNeza revealed that they brought only one item on September 29, but when they tried to contact customer service via email and WhatsApp, they did nothing to resolve the issue. Even though Neza eventually received the item, they swear they\u2019ll not be using the platform again.\n\nCiting similar reasons to those listed in the mail we received from the customer agent, a source close to the issue at MallforAfrica reveals that the company will most likely shut down completely.\n\n\u201cThe issue with forex and CBN policies affected the company, and investors pulled out. The site is currently down, and it is most likely that the MallforAfrica brand will shut down completely and come back with as a new brand,\u201d the source claims.\n\nOur source, however, maintains that all orders made before the website went down are being fulfilled, and customers could still get their items from pickup centres. But no new orders will be placed before the rebranding.\n\nDespite the complaints about losses, our source is optimistic that people will be able to place orders soon.\n\nWe reached out to Chris Folayan (CEO), Helios Investment Partners (MallforAfrica\u2019s major investor), and DHL (Its most recent publicly announced investor), for official statements to verify this claim, but only Chris and DHL have responded as of press time.\n\n\u201cMallforAfrica is temporarily closed, that is true, but we pray and trust in God to have it back up and running in the very near future, better than ever. No date as of yet to announce. But we will keep everyone posted,\u201d Chris confirms.\n\nAs for lost customer funds, Chris reveals that the company is working on refunding them, but it is taking longer than usual due to reduced staff size.\n\n\u201cMany (the customers) have been with us for 10 years, and we are not in the business of letting our customers down. Never have and never will. We would never turn our backs on our customers, and you don\u2019t build such a loyal customer base by letting them down.\u201d\n\nHowever, Chris firmly denies any claim that investors have pulled out, and he maintains that the company still has a great relationship with investors.\n\nA spokesperson for DHL declined to comment on Link Commerce\u2019s activities and told us to contact Folayan instead. They also didn\u2019t address the claim that DHL has pulled out.\n\nIt is important to note that, on Tuesday, October 26, 2021, DHL announced that Africa eShop, an online platform developed using MallforAfrica\u2019s technology, would be shutting down by the month\u2019s end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: DHL\n\nThat announcement was definitely a sign that something was wrong after our preliminary investigations.\n\nNonetheless, based on our independent findings, which you would see in due course, we\u2019ll lean towards Chris\u2019 assertion regarding investors.\n\nThough Chris and our source seem to provide both gloom and hope, we couldn\u2019t help but wonder where it went wrong for one of the shining gems of eCommerce in Africa.\n\nThe growth of an eCommerce giant\n\nSeveral Google searches from the previous years revealed many interesting and, sometimes confusing facts. Here we go.\n\nWhen was MallforAfrica founded?\n\nFirstly, the exact year MallforAfrica was founded is not clear. Most media houses like TechCrunch and the New York Times go with 2011, but LinkedIn claims it\u2019s 2010, a year earlier. Crunchbase, however, claims it\u2019s 2012, the date we used last year in our interview.\n\nThe earliest online record of incorporation we could find shows that MallforAfrica was registered on July 16, 2013, with the Corporate and Business Registration Department of Mauritius. The website lists Akinmade Ayodeji Ibrahim, Boyjonauth Vishma Dharshini, Folayan Oluwarotimi Christopher, and Folayan Temitope Ibiyemi-Olakunle as company directors.\n\nIt also names Intercontinental Trust Limited, a Mauritius-registered financial services provider, as the management company and secretary.\n\nPoole Simon Hilliard and Joomun Mohammad Ali, the other people mentioned, joined MallforAfrica as directors in 2016 and 2017, respectively. So far, we\u2019ve only introduced Christopher Folayan and Tope Folayan as co-founders, but the others are important to the story as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource; Corporate and Business Registration Department Mauritius\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the founders launched the company, it didn\u2019t seem to gain much traction. The earliest online record we could find was MallforAfrica\u2019s first tweet in June 2012, announcing a website called mallforafricaplus.com (disabled).\n\nThe series of Tweets it made received little engagement, but that all changed in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nPrivate equity firm, Helios Investment Partners reveals on its website that it provided growth capital for MallforAfrica in July 2013. This coincides with MallforAfrica\u2019s earliest online record of incorporation \u2014 July 16, 2013.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that Boyjonauth Vishma Dharshini is a non-executive Director at Helios Towers and a Director at Intercontinental Trust Limited. Simon Poole also held a similar title at Helios Towers and was an operating partner at Helios.\n\nFun fact: Helios Towers is a telecommunications company and is one of Helios\u2019 portfolio companies. Intercontinental Trust Limited has Helios as one of its clients.\n\nFrom then on, the company began to gain traction as it received coverage from the likes of CNN in 2014 (the earliest available record we found), the New York Times (2015), and Fortune in 2015.\n\nThe promise was simple. Build trust and connect African shoppers to some of the world\u2019s biggest online retail platforms. As a result of fraud, most of these platforms banned Africans, but MallforAfrica came as the middleman, taking on the risks of fraud on one end and handling shipping on the other.\n\nMallforAfrica\u2019s apparent boom\n\nFrom then on, MallforAfrica struck several partnerships with stores like BestBuy, eBay, Macy\u2019s, Barney\u2019s, and Bloomingdales. Fortune reports that the company racked up $17 million in sales in 2014.\n\nIn 2017, the company announced a partnership with logistics giant, DHL, to further cross-border deliveries, and in 2018, they partnered to launch marketplace.com, a fashion shopping platform that is now offline.\n\nIn 2019, DHL launched Africa eShop (now defunct) using MallforAfrica\u2019s technology. We\u2019re going to stop here because it gets a bit confusing going forward.\n\nYou see, as MallforAfrica\u2019s business began to blossom, it decided to add a new vertical to its operations, and that birthed a company now called Link Commerce.\n\nHow Link Commerce was formed\n\nDuring last years\u2019 interview, Chris explained the relationship between Link Commerce, MallforAfrica, and DHL\u2019s Africa eShop.\n\n\u201cLast year, DHL wanted to replicate MallforAfrica, brand it as theirs, and take it across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). So, what we did was to develop Africa eShop for them. And now, DHL is doing basically what MallforAfrica does, but the difference is that eShop is in 37 countries in SSA while MallforAfrica is in only 4 countries \u2014 Ghana, Kenya, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nConflicting info? \u2014 In 2018, TechCrunch quoted Folayan as saying that MallforAfrica shipped to 17 countries. We are not sure exactly why this happened, but Chris has confirmed to us once more that it\u2019s actually four.\n\nA look at Link Commerce\u2019s registration documents in the UK actually paints a clearer picture.\n\nOn September 30, 2016, Simon Poole, one of MallforAfrica\u2019s Directors, filed to register a company called Mall for the World LTD in the UK, in partnership with MallforAfrica Mauritius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource; Companies House, UK\n\nBoth parties had significant control over the company, with MallforAfrica Mauritius owning 75% of the company\u2019s shares. There was no mention of the brothers at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast-forward 10 months later to July 10, 2017, and the founder brothers, Chris and Tope Folayan were appointed as directors in the company. And on the same day, the company announced the termination of Poole\u2019s directorship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2018, the UK companies registrar sent a warning that Mall for the World would be dissolved. While the exact reason was not stated, the warning (a compulsory strike-off) is usually given due to non-compliance or failure to file accounts on time.\n\nA month later, the company published a notice that Simon Poole was no longer a person of significant control in Mall for the World. Two days later, the UK Company Registrar suspended the strike-off notice. Also, shortly after this, Mall for the World filed its accounts.\n\nOn March 8, 2019, the company announced that it was terminating Temitope Folayan\u2019s (co-founding brother) appointment as director. On the 22nd of the same month, the registrar announced that MallforAfrica Mauritius ceased to be an entity with significant control of the UK-based company \u2014 Mall for the World. Apparently, this actually happened on September 30, 2016. The day the Mall for the World was incorporated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn April 11, 2019, TechCrunch announced that DHL had launched Africa eShop, using MallforAfrica\u2019s white-label service, Link Commerce.\n\nA day later, Mall for the World filed for a change of name to Link Commerce with the UK registry.\n\nTo be clear, the board of directors at MallforAfrica Mauritius joined to form Mall for the World in the UK. Shortly after it announced the termination of one of the co-founder\u2019s appointments as director, it changed its name to Link Commerce.\n\nFrom then on, MallforAfrica positioned Link Commerce as a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, which it used to build eCommerce platforms for other businesses as it did with DHL.\n\n\u201cThink of MallforAfrica and Africa eShop but branded with some other name in different parts of the world. That\u2019s how we\u2019re expanding, and that\u2019s what eCommerce is about,\u201d Chris said last year.\n\nNote: The Africa eShop platform and MallforAfrica shared many similarities.}\n\nWeird fact: Link Commerce (Formerly Mall for the World) seems to change its official address every year. It has done so from 2016 to date. If you have any idea why a company might decide to do this, then we\u2019d love to chat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMallforAfrica\u2019s Nigerian addresses are mostly pickup locations. Google shows something different, its website shows a different address, and Crunchbase says the company\u2019s HQ is in Kano, Nigeria.\n\nOn February 13, 2020, the company announced Temitope Lawani, a Managing Partner at Helios Investment as a director. It welcomed Simon Poole back into the fold, and Hennie Heymans, Chief Executive of DHL Express Sub Saharan Africa, joined the company as a director.\n\nA month later, DHL publicly announced that it had acquired a stake in Link Commerce. Chris also hinted that this was part of the plan. Based on DHL\u2019s records, 255 shares gave it a 9% stake in the company.\n\nWhere did it go wrong?\n\nIt is not clear what actually happened at Link Commerce or MallforAfrica. While the latter seems to be having issues, DHL\u2019s eShop shutdown could indicate that there are problems at the top with Link Commerce.\n\nChris, however, completely denies this assertion.\n\n\u201cFalse 100%. Nothing more to add because there is no truth to that statement,\u201d he declares.\n\nWhile one would think this might be related to Healthplus story, Chris maintains that the investors have been amazing, and are not unhappy at all.\n\n\u201cWe have seen great growth year on year. But we all realized that the Nigerian economy has had an impact on expected growth and projections. So what do you do when that happens? You pause, regroup, rethink strategy, then hit the market with a revolutionary way to improve e-commerce for all despite economic challenges,\u201d he states with full optimism.\n\nThe company\u2019s exact financial situation is currently unclear. Between 2018 and 2019, its liabilities far outweighed its assets, and its financials were reading negatives. This was a poor showing compared to the positive numbers from previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the arrival of the global pandemic in 2020 and the disruptions to supply chains across the globe, there\u2019s no telling what the numbers would look like when (or if it ever) releases its 2020 financials.\n\nNote: Small companies are not required to declare profit and loss in the UK, so we have to make educated guesses with their asset and liability statements.\n\nWhile our source claimed that investors pulled out, up until this point (March 2021), it seems like Helios has simply taken even more control of the company, and DHL acquired more shares in Link Commerce.\n\nAccording to Link Commerce\u2019s shareholder filing, Helios now has 1,640 ordinary shares, the highest in the company. Its Class A1 shares also mean it has the most voting rights. By comparison, Chris Folayan has 374 Class A2 shares.\n\nFun note: Ayomide Akinmade Ibrahim, one of the first directors at MallforAfrica Mauritius and a shareholder at Link Commerce, does not seem to have much of an online presence. We simply haven\u2019t found anyone that fits his profile exactly, but the closest we got is linked to Hickam Ventures. Still not sure this is our person.\n\nInterestingly, Link Commerce announced Lawani\u2019s termination of appointment as a director in May 2021.\n\nFor now, what is really going on at Link Commerce is anyone\u2019s guess, but Chris promises a full-scale rebound in due time.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t count us out of the ring yet customers and all our amazing well-wishers. This is an intermission to something great that is coming soon. We have a great relationship with our investors, and we truly admire and appreciate them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe apologize for the pause but sometimes these things are needed to set a new higher bar for the future. We revolutionized how eCommerce was done in Nigeria 10 years ago. Watch what we do next.\u201d\n\nHowever, there are other details that need to add up, and we need to make sense of the information we just received. Chris has promised to fill in the blanks this week. Keep your eyes peeled.\n\nThis is a developing story. Shocking right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policy analysis is my daily bread. Looking to chat?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the first step you take when you want to launch a new business idea? Tell a mentor? Save up some capital? Find an investor?\n\nFor Affiong Williams, founder and CEO of ReelFruit, it was leaving her comfortable job in South Africa to start a (almost unheard of) dried fruits company in Nigeria, hawking prototype products around Lagos, and somewhat building the entire business model on the hope of winning a UN grant that never happened.\n\nWas that such a good approach? Well, on the one hand, her tech-enabled agribusiness recently raised a $3m Series A round to help accelerate global expansion. That\u2019s plenty validation. But then, it took her five years to build her first factory, and nine years in total to the Series A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams, founder and CEO, ReelFruit.\n\nBut how did someone who had dreams of becoming a medical doctor end up as an entrepreneur? And what would motivate them to leave their comfort zone, in a bid to singlehandedly pioneer a sub-industry that never existed?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese and many more I sought to find out during a recent interview with Affiong Williams at the ReelFruit HQ in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this inspiring interview, Affiong Williams shares her motivations, inspirations, ambitions, entrepreneurial lessons, and tips on how to achieve a work-life balance while running a global company.\n\nWatch full interview or continue below for summarised text version\n\nNB: Below is a paraphrased (for clarity) and summarised version of the interview. For the best experience, we recommend watching the video above.\n\nM\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2 of Techpoint Africa (MM): It took you nine years to raise $3m. Was that deliberate?\n\nAffiong Williams of ReelFruit (AW): No, it wasn\u2019t. Because we pioneered the dried fruits market in Nigeria, it took the first five years of our business to prove that this was not a flash-in-the-pan product. When you couple that with all the other challenges of raising funding in Nigeria, it\u2019s easy to see why it took so long. But I\u2019m delighted with the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMM: I read an interview you gave about how you resorted to raising capital in small amounts as a proof of concept. How did that work out?\n\nAW: Because we were so unsuccessful at raising a large round, it became apparent that people didn\u2019t believe the big picture. So when we claimed we were going to expand by x amount, they found it easier to believe that we could, say, double our sales, hire more people, open new locations, or launch more products. That story was a lot more relatable with investors.\n\nWe found that it was easier and quicker for us to raise smaller amounts tied to realisable milestones, as opposed to a broader unknown that may not yield immediate returns. That helped us get to the point where lead investors then felt confident about backing the big idea because we\u2019d proven ourselves in smaller milestones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI recommend that strategy because it helps entrepreneurs allocate capital.\n\nMM: Let\u2019s take a step back to your origins. Why dried fruit in the first place?\n\nAW: My initial idea was actually to produce juice. But I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to build a fruit juice factory. Dried fruit came about by the process of elimination along the value chain of fruit processing. I was living in South Africa at the time, and dried fruit was very popular there. I figured I could be the first to bring it to Nigeria and make it big.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMM: That was a bold move. What gave you the conviction to pursue such an untested market in Nigeria?\n\nAW: Yes, it was bold, but I didn\u2019t know much. If I had done just a bit more research, I probably would have shelved the idea.\n\nI was simply convinced that Nigerians were a lot more open to different tastes, judging by the variety of things that were being imported at the time. I believed all I needed to do was create awareness and demand.\n\nMM: I noticed that not long after completing your first degree, in Physiology and Psychology, in 2006, you proceeded to do a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration. I\u2019m guessing this is around the time you caught the entrepreneurial bug?\n\nAW: Not at all. Actually, the reason I did my undergrad in the Sciences was to get into medical school. But after my undergrad, which I found extremely difficult, I knew medical school wasn\u2019t for me. I switched to a diploma in business for an opportunity to work elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was actually my first job that unleashed my passion for entrepreneurship. I worked at Endeavour South Africa, which is an entrepreneurship support organisation. I loved working with entrepreneurs. I loved that they created jobs, the values they stood for, the idea that they took risks, and that the reward was outsized. So after four years, I decided to become an entrepreneur myself.\n\nMM: So you left South Africa and moved back to Nigeria, solely to start the business?\n\nAW: Yes. However, my entire immediate family expected me to move to the US, where most of them lived at the time. But I\u2019d be coming to Nigeria to every year and I still felt connected to home. It felt like a familiar domain to start a business.\n\nAnother major driver for my moving back was a \u20a610 million UN grant that was available at the time. I applied and got selected for the first round, which further motivated me to move back. But barely three days after moving back, I got a rejection letter. It was disappointing, but obviously, I had to restrategise.\n\nI had brought back a lot of dried fruits from South Africa, which I crudely packaged and started hawking around. This was basically my market research. It was an extremely challenging time because not only was I doing something new, I was also filled with a lot of self-doubt. I thought I had made the biggest mistake of my life, but, of course, I couldn\u2019t quit so early.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, the feedback was good and people, especially my family and friends, were beginning to appreciate my commitment. After I ran out of personal savings, they were the first set of people to invest in ReelFruit.\n\nWe were operating out of my apartment, so, of course, we eventually ran out of space and struggled to meet increasing demand. Thankfully my then friend \u2014 now husband \u2014 stepped in with an investment, which enabled us to rent an office space, buy a small van, and hire more people. That was my first angel check, and it really took us far.\n\nMM: Did you have a factory at the time?\n\nAW: We were doing a little bit of processing and packaging from our new location. But we didn\u2019t have enough capacity to scale up as quickly as demand required, and raising extra funds for more factory machinery was difficult.\n\nOur solution was to engage contract manufacturers, people who were processing locally and as far away as Ghana. So it was a mix of third-party producers and us doing small processing.\n\nI believe that in doing business in Nigeria, you should be deliberate about the battles you fight. We thought it was more productive, at the time, to focus more on growing the market and then, further down the line, backwards-integrating into real processing at scale. This is what our Series A is going to enable us to do now.\n\nI think that early decision was a key factor in unlocking our business and demonstrating demand in record time.\n\nMM: Speaking of early days, what were the hardest things you had to learn as a CEO?\n\nAW: I think in the early days, I struggled with sharing my vision with the team. I felt that if I kept sharing my vision about becoming an end-to-end business with huge manufacturing and global exports, while we were still working from a one-bedroom in Yaba, they would think I was out of touch with reality. So I usually kept a lot of that stuff to myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReelFruit\u2019s first office space\n\nBut I found that when I started sharing more, being open about my ambitions, the team rallied behind to help me reach them.\n\nI think the other thing I\u2019ve learnt is being more audacious. Of course, I\u2019m typically a bold person personally, but in business, I was very timid, always expecting the worst. And it sometimes showed in the way we did business. But I\u2019ve gotten bolder about what we can and can\u2019t do. I think that boldness has caught on with the team, so I\u2019m proud of myself.\n\nMM: Riding on that, what are some significant challenges you had to surmount, running a business like this in Nigeria?\n\nAW: Oh God, we could talk about challenges forever.\n\nFor example, we source our materials from as far as Burkina Faso and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, which can be challenging. I\u2019m in awe of what my production manager has had to do to get them sometimes. It all falls back to the infectious idea that we can do anything we set our minds to.\n\nWe had challenges with setting up 24-hour cold storage. It was expensive, but my team figured out a cost-effective solution online and built it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, we\u2019ve faced so many devaluations doing business in Nigeria over the last nine years. But we\u2019ve managed them, staying focused on growth and efficiency. Macroeconomic instability is a big challenge. I would say that\u2019s been one thing that we\u2019ve tried as much as possible to solve.\n\nMM: What lessons can you share with budding entrepreneurs?\n\nAW: One key advantage, which has played in our favour is knowledge; the sheer amount of time we\u2019ve spent, and how much we\u2019ve gone around the world to get information.\n\nI think that is the hallmark of a successful venture. You need to understand the intricacies of your sector more than the next person so that market trends, macroeconomic windfalls and gains, etc., don\u2019t take you by surprise.\n\nSo I would encourage people to be committed to learning. There are many ways to go about that \u2014 first working in the industry, talking to other entrepreneurs in the field, and researching to understand what has happened to companies in your sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second thing I would say is leverage networks because they run the world. In Nigeria, especially, you need to know people to get things. I think it\u2019s worthwhile to invest in creating very strong networks , especially around your industry. That\u2019s been very valuable for me, and it continues to be.\n\nI think it\u2019s also important to acknowledge the time it will take and be ready to commit that time. If someone told me in advance that it would take five years from ideation to having our first factory, I would have said, \u201cNo way.\u201d\n\nFinally, entrepreneurship can really consume your life and everything you do. Having things that I do outside of work, I think, has also helped me along the way. I\u2019m a runner, and I play recreational football. I\u2019ve been deliberate about doing things that are outside of my business just to give me that sense of separation and create different facets of my life. Because, otherwise, you can think about work 24 hours a day, and then your life becomes very one-dimensional.\n\nMM: Interestingly, you recommend working in an industry before building a business around it. That obviously wasn\u2019t your path; would you advise others to follow you?\n\nAW: No, I wouldn\u2019t. In hindsight, there are so many things I could have done differently. The first was not to be a first mover. That took me a lot of time.\n\nI started ReelFruit when I was pretty young. Yes, I had the advantage of time, but I was 26 and didn\u2019t have much liquidity or resource networks. Statistics show that the average entrepreneur is actually in their 40s; when they have somewhat more liquidity and better networks from the work they\u2019ve done. So you actually can move a venture much faster later in life. I know it sounds counterintuitive because people say, \u201cHustle now because you\u2019re young.\u201d\n\nBut then again, I like that I started early because I needed a lot of time to build the industry.\n\nMM: Finally, tell me about future plans on the backdrop of your fundraise.\n\nAW: This fundraise has unlocked a lot for us.\n\nWith our new factory, which we are setting up in Abeokuta, we will grow our monthly capacity 5x. That means that we will be working with a lot more farmers, procuring a lot more raw materials, helping them improve their yields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will also introduce new varieties of fruit into the Nigerian market. And that\u2019s exciting because we get to, again, pioneer innovation and positive change at the farmer level.\n\nAt the processing level, we\u2019re going to be adding new product lines for different customer segments. So we\u2019re very excited about being able to own that and do it very quickly. Not just selling branded products, but selling products as inputs to other customers, etc.\n\nAnd on the market side, one of my big goals was to create in Nigeria for the world. I wanted our Nigerian-made products to be good enough to sit on every shelf in the world. And we\u2019ve made some strides there. We just exported our products to the UK, and now we have our own direct to consumer e-commerce store in the US.\n\nWe want to further expand into those markets, selling larger volumes of different types of products to various customers around the world.\n\nWe want to dominate this space and take it as far as possible. In doing so, we hope to demonstrate a path for Nigerian-founded FMCG companies looking to be end-to-end while also serving customers around the world.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel Africa, a subsidiary of India\u2019s Bharti-Airtel, has continued to surpass its profit and revenue margins recorded in previous quarters.\n\nIn Q1 2021, it recorded revenue of $1.03 billion, a 21.7% increase from Q1 2020, when it generated $899 million.\n\nAccording to the Q3 financial report released on Thursday, October 28, 2021, it recorded yet another impressive increase from Q3 2020.\n\nThe telecom company\u2019s revenue in Q3 2021 stood at $1.160 billion, a 22.7% increase from Q3 2020\u2019s $965 million, this, without considering currency fluctuations (constant currency). When we consider currency fluctuations (reported currency), the increase is 20.1%, a 2.6% difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoice remains king, but data isn\u2019t doing too badly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel\u2019s Q3 2021 revenue breakdown. (in millions)\n\nAs usual, voice brought in the most revenue at $578 million, while data and mobile money brought in $377 and $135 million, respectively.\n\nAlthough voice remains king, it only rose by 11.6% \u2014 $60 million \u2014 (reported currency) from Q3 2020\u2019s $518 million. Data went from $283 million to $377 million within the same period, signifying a 33.0% \u2014 $94 million \u2014 increase.\n\nMobile money increased by 34.6%, going from $100 million to $135 million in the same period.\n\nThe same trend was recorded in Q2 2021. Voice trumped other revenue sources at $562 million, followed by data and mobile money with $356 and $124 million, respectively.\n\nHowever, voice isn\u2019t only king at Airtel. According to MTN Nigeria\u2019s financials for Q3 2021, voice also led with a revenue of $234.3 million; data came in second at $137.68 million. The telecom company also recorded a similar revenue trend in Q3 2020.\n\nAirtel says it is focusing on increasing smartphone ownership, thereby increasing data usage. It will do this via its Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partnerships and expanding its network of outlets selling smartphone devices.\n\nAccording to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), 4G connections in sub-Saharan Africa could reach 28% by 2025. This could increase data consumption, making data the new revenue king.\n\nAirtel\u2019s data subscribers increased to 43.9 million, a 10.9% jump from 39.6 million in Q3 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMobile money customer base experienced a 19% increase, rising from 20.1 million to 23.9 million when comparing Q3 2020 and Q3 2021.\n\nGenerally, Airtel has increased its customer base by 5.4% \u2014 116.4 million to 122.7 million \u2014 in the 14 African countries where it is present.\n\nFun fact: Data subscribers represent 35.8% of Airtel\u2019s customer base of 122.7 million\n\nProfits\n\nAirtel\u2019s profit before tax in the period in question was $308 million, an 81% increase from $170 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nProfit after tax, on the other hand, was $192 million, which is an impressive 118.6% increase from last year\u2019s $88 million.\n\nHowever, the year-on-year (YoY) growth rate falls short compared to Q2 2021\u2019s 148.7%. Its YoY revenue growth rate of 22.7% also pales in comparison to last quarter\u2019s 33.1%, figures it still attributes to the COVID-19 restrictions of 2020.\n\nIt says it is due to \u201ca weakened performance in the first quarter of the prior year during the peak period of Covid-19 related restrictions across the region.\u201d\n\nNigeria remains cash cow, and data revenues are rising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel\u2019s Q3 2021 revenue per region\n\nIn Nigeria, the telecom company recorded significant revenue growth compared to the preceding period. At constant currency, the revenue growth rate was 27.1%.\n\nHowever, the telecom giant recorded a 38.2% revenue growth rate in the previous quarter.\n\nAs always, Nigeria recorded the highest revenue of the 14 countries where Airtel is present. The country\u2019s Q3 2021 revenue stood at $450 million, a $73 million increase from $377 million in Q3 2020\n\nThe country\u2019s revenue surpassed the $428 million recorded in all the East African countries combined by $22 million.\n\nIn Francophone Africa, the company generated $285 million in revenue, $165 million behind Nigeria.\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria\u2019s data revenue growth rate was 41.5% \u2014 from $139 million to $179 million \u2014 in constant currency compared to the period before. However, in reported currency, the growth rate was 33.1%.\n\nWhile voice revenue had the lion\u2019s share, its growth rate was 14.6% at constant currency and 7.7% at reported currency. It rose from $216 million in Q3 2020 to $233 million in Q3 2021.\n\nAirtel attributes its data revenue growth to an increase in data usage per customer. It went from 2.7GB to 3.9GB per month.\n\nThe total customer base in Nigeria now stands at 40.4 million, unlike 44.1 million in Q3 2020. The customer base also dropped compared to the 40.9 million in Q2 2021. The discontinuation of customer acquisition led to the reduction in the country\u2019s total customer base.\n\nAirtel, however, maintained that the drop in customer base did not have a significant impact on its revenue.\n\nThe company says its Q3 2021 financials signify a well-executed and effective strategy. According to Airtel Africa CEO, Segun Ogunsanya, \u201cAll our service segments are ahead of our FY\u201921 revenue growth trends, and in reported terms, these are all in strong double digits.\u201d\n\n*Airtel\u2019s East African countries include Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.\n\n**Airtel\u2019s Francophone contingent includes Niger, Chad, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Seychelles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s food vendor industry shrinks 16% on pandemic impact",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s eatery industry shrinks 16 percent as COVID-19 lockdown brought activities in the sector to a near standstill in Africa\u2019s biggest economy, a new report by Euromonitor International, a London-based market research company, notes.\n\nThe report states that the industry declined to $12.3 million in 2020 from $14.6 million in 2019, as lockdown measures used to curb the spread of the virus halted eat-in food services.\n\n\u201cEven after it was eased, many consumers significantly reduced their discretionary spending as a result of the economic shock of the pandemic. Some remained reluctant to eat in restaurants due to the perceived risk of contagion,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe report also notes that the virus triggered a shift from eat-in consumer foodservice to takeaway, as \u201cthis was particularly the case for limited-service consumer foodservice, as many of these outlets are located in residential areas and thus more accessible to consumers.\u201d\n\nThe consumer food-service industry comprises caf\u00e9s/bars, full-service restaurants, limited-service restaurants, self-service cafeterias, and street stalls/kiosks.\n\nLast year, BusinessDay investigated how restaurants were faring from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results from the findings showed that for five months (March-July), the sector saw up to 60 percent drop in sales as they were not generating enough take-outs (prepared food packaged to be consumed away from its place of sale) and food deliveries services.\n\nAccording to Wale Abioye, a manager at Sweet Sensation, a Lagos-based fast food restaurant, operators generate more revenue from dine-in services than take-outs because the more people that stay in their restaurants, the more purchases they make, unlike one-time purchases from take-outs.\n\n\u201cGovernment regulations and the fear of COVID-19 are a challenge because there is no continuous purchase. A lot of people that do repeated purchases through deliveries, which cost money, don\u2019t get the full value of their money for what they are spending on because they pay that part of the value for deliveries,\u201d says Abioye.\n\nRead also: FG to launch Integrated Export Control Plan for food safety requirement\n\nSimilarly, Stephine Emeruwa, a manager at Ketchup, an Abuja-based restaurant, notes that it was a struggle for them as sales had dropped below 50 percent, and as a result they had to lay off half of their staff.\n\nIn March 2020, when the number of new cases of COVID-19 started to increase, restaurants limited dine-in table service to only 20 people, while others who were more than 20 were offered take-outs instead.\n\nWhen there was a full lockdown in April, some restaurants were not opened, while others that opened only offered limited menus. After the lockdown was partially eased on May 4, the government directed them to offer only take-out services.\n\nOn August 14, they were now allowed to operate dine-in services on the condition that they maintain 50 percent capacity.\n\n\u201cThere was a decline in the number of consumer food-service outlets in Nigeria during 2020 due to the economic shock of the pandemic. In general, there were more closures among independent restaurants than their chained counterparts in 2020,\u201d the report states.\n\nBy December, the foodservice outlets were allowed to fully open to the public and operate at full capacity.\n\nThe report further highlights that chained outlets were better able to weather the pandemic than their independent counterparts due to economies of scale.\n\nFor example, Eat \u2018n\u2019 Go Limited utilised the Jumia Food on-demand delivery app to offer discounted prices and promotions to consumers. Despite the pandemic, they continued to expand the number of restaurants it operated under the Domino\u2019s Pizza, Coldstone Creamery and Pinkberry banners, the report further highlights.\n\nAyorinde Akinloye, an analyst at United Capital plc, states that the year 2020 eroded consumers\u2019 income and purchasing power, making them switch from some premium outlets to cheaper ones.\n\n\u201cAnd it will be difficult for the consumer food service industry to get to the pre-COVID level until consumers\u2019 incomes improve and they have that confidence to spend more,\u201d he states.\n\nFor the industry to get to pre-COVID levels or exceed it, Uchenna Uzo, a consumer expert and the faculty director at Lagos Business School, says it will require thinking through their retail model again to ensure that they have a strong service capacity that is built based on technical analysis and training the staff to know what it means to deliver top-notch service to customers.",
          "summary": "\u201cEven after it was eased, many consumers significantly reduced their discretionary spending as a result of the economic shock of the pandemic.\nLast year, BusinessDay investigated how restaurants were faring from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u201cThere was a decline in the number of consumer food-service outlets in Nigeria during 2020 due to the economic shock of the pandemic.\nBy December, the foodservice outlets were allowed to fully open to the public and operate at full capacity.\n\u201cAnd it will be difficult for the consumer food service industry to get to the pre-COVID level until consumers\u2019 incomes improve and they have that confidence to spend more,\u201d he states.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLAGOS \u2013 A group of Journalists have called on the government to urgently re- examine the system of care given to vulnerable children by reviewing the Childs right law in the states.\n\nThis appeal was made during a two-day media engagement and capacity building workshop organized by the SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Lagos recently.\n\nAccording to the Journalists drawn from the print and electronic media from across the country, the government should ensure the best and suitable environment is created for the Nigerian child by reviewing the Childs right law in the states.\n\nWhile noting that it was not encouraging that In Nigeria ten out of the thirty six states have not domesticated the child rights act, the Journalists maintained that the conversation in Nigeria now should be around how alternative care services are being provided and how critical stakeholders are supported to provide these services to improve the way it is been provided.\n\n\u201cWhat is the plan for the Nigerian Child who is without parental care, what is the plan for that child who stops you on the road asking you for alms? If the child had a better option, he would never be on the road, what is the plan for the family that is about to get disintegrated because they do not have the capacity to stay together and provide care for their children, how do we create the enabling environment for families to thrive, for families to stay together because where families stay together that is where we are able to bring up the Nigerian child,\u201d were some of the issues raised during the workshop\n\nIn his opening remarks, the National Director, SOS Children\u2019s Villages, Mr. Eghosa Erhumwunse who was represented by the Regional Manager, South Mr. Ayodeji Adelopo disclosed that every help vulnerable children can get will be very important.\n\nAlso while delivering his lecture, \u201c Who we are\u201d Chuba Ezeigwe said that the objective of the media engagement was to foster a better working relationship with the media as critical stakeholders and more importantly to generate conversations that will lead to the improvement of the conditions of children without parental care and children at the verge of losing parental care.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe SOS Children\u2019s Villages have been active since 1973 and offers a number of services, alternative care for children, family strengthening and partnership for quality care. As part of the alternative care we offer direct care to children without parental care, using our family care option and we do this in Lagos, Ogun state, FCT and in Plateau state.\n\n\u201cBut away from offering alternative care services to children, we also strengthen families in as many as eight locations across the country and currently we have over sixteen thousand families that have been elevated from our family strengthening programme.\n\n\u201cOur strengthening programme support families on the verge of disintegration. We support these families to stay together so that their children can benefit from the care from their parents or wards. Usually, one of the reasons why families break away, it could be conflict, it could be poverty, it could be socio-economic issues, there are numbers of reasons.\n\n\u201cWe identify the reason peculiar to each family and support them to surmount their challenges to become reliant and to become able to take care of their children. That actually means that our priority is to strengthen families because it is best for a child to have a family around the world, including Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need to understand that every child has his or her unique needs and we need to design systems that allow us attend to these unique needs. Already, we are supporting the federal government of Nigeria to develop a National guideline on alternative care for children.\n\n\u201cWe are doing this as members of National Committee on alternative care which was inaugurated by the Minister for women affairs domiciled at the women affairs ministry in Abuja. The core mandate of this subcommittee is to develop National guideline on alternative care as one of the procedures that will help in the implementation of the child acts right.\n\n\u201cWe are also doing this in a number of states where we work. In Lagos state, the alternative care guideline has been developed and validated by the state government through the support of SOS children\u2019s Villages and other partners. The document is due for unveiling in a couple of weeks after which it will be pushed in for the approval of the state executive council and it will be put to use.\n\nThe two day workshop also featured panel discussions, lectures by the brand and Communications coordinator, Abasiama Ifeoma and tour of SOS Children\u2019s Village, Lagos.\n\n...",

We have started the process and are going to make it a culture.\n\n\u201cYou can only come into the service on merit basis. We must position the civil service to be the best employer of labour. For us to be able to deliver services in Edo, we must change our mindsets; we have to change the way we do things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to organize ourselves; we have to change our outlook to our work, and then ensure that everybody employed into the civil and public service is trained and given the tools to work. There will be no shortcut to capacity building; it has to be continuous training,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cIn Edo today, the average age is 35 years and the average age of our civil service is 48 years, so you can see that there is no correlation between the service and the people you are to serve; we have to bring that alignment to place.

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), has said the 650,000bpd Dangote Petroleum Refinery, as well as other modular refineries coming on stream, are expected to meet Nigeria\u2019s demand for petroleum products, which is projected to grow in the nearest future.\n\nMallam Mele Kyari, NNPC Group Managing Director, stated this while making his remarks at the 15th Oil Trading and Logistics (OTL) Africa Downstream Week in Lagos.\n\nHe said NNPC Refineries\u2019 445,000 barrels-per-day (BPD), Dangote Refinery\u2019s 650,000 BPD and the 250,000 BSD expected to come from the Condensate Refineries through the private sector partnership respectively would supply the requirement of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) needs in Nigeria.\n\nKyari, who was represented by the Group Executive Director, Downstream, NNPC, Adeyemi Adetunji, explained that the diversification of NNPC\u2019s portfolio through acquisition of 20 per cent equity valued at $2.6 billion in the 650,000 bpd Dangote Refinery located in the Lekki Free Trade Zone would ensure national energy security and guarantee market for Nigeria\u2019s 300,000 bpd.\n\n\u201cNNPC is adding 215,000 BPD of refining capacity through private sector driven co-location at the existing facilities in Warri Refining and Petrochemical Company (WRPC) and Port Harcourt Refining Company (PHRC) respectively. Modular refineries are also adding capacities such as the 5,000 BPD Waltersmith refinery, which will be upgraded to 50,000 BPD,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAdditional 250,000 BPD is expected to come from the Condensate Refineries through the private sector partnership. The co-location and Condensate refineries will close the PMS supply-demand gap and create positive returns to the investors,\u201d the NNPC helmsman added.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the Corporation has progressed with the Refineries Rehabilitation Programme to boost its participation in the oil & gas value chain by awarding the $1.5 billion Port Harcourt rehabilitation contract with the commitment to deliver on Warri and Kaduna Refineries.\n\nOn gas commercialisation effort, Kyari said the Federal Government has declared 2021-2030 as the decade of gas development in Nigeria.\n\nKyari said the demand for natural gas could grow about four times over the next decade, increasing from 4.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) in 2020 to between 10 \u2013 23 bcf/d in 2030.\n\nHe said currently, supply to the domestic market was about 8bcf/d to power, 0.77 bcf/d to industries, and about 54 bcf/d was flared, while 3.2 bcf/d was for export gas through the LNG and the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP).\n\nAccording to him, achieving this growth in demand would be occasioned by increasing the dispatchable capacity of existing power in line with the Presidential Power Initiative which is less than 1.4 bcf/d).\n\nHe added that the growth would be achieved through assuring delivery of major fertiliser projects (Dangote, Brass) 5 bcf/d), and enabling industrial demand for natural gas in the northern axis of the country (1.2 bcf/d).\n\nOn the global oil market outlook, Kyari said, \u201cSome $10.4 trillion global stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rebound in consumers\u2019 spending while incentives for long-term investments in hydro-carbon have waned.\u201d\n\nHe stated that hydrocarbon would continue to be relevant in the global energy mix for the next two decades, quoting the recent data by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nOn the issue of downstream in transition, the NNPC boss noted that the Nigerian oil and gas industry has been in transition prior to the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), in response to the global energy transition and decarbonisation initiatives.\n\nKyari maintained that it would be difficult to discuss the transition in the downstream sub-sector in isolation from the overall evolution that was happening in the industry.\n\nHe said NNPC had diversified its portfolio over the years, transiting to an energy company with new investments in gas, power, and renewables, pointing out that key pipeline projects are ongoing to assure delivery of gas to the demand nodes.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe OB3 project, which brings gas from East to West is nearing completion. The 614km Ajaokuta, Kaduna, Kano (AKK) project, which was launched by Mr. President in June 2020, is progressing very well. These could add up to $40 billion to annual GDP and create additional six million jobs.\n\n\u201cThe corporation has progressed with the Refineries Rehabilitation Programme to further boost its participation in the Oil and Gas value chain by awarding the $1.5 billion Port Harcourt rehabilitation contract with the commitment to deliver on Warri and Kaduna Refineries.\n\n\u201cThe rehabilitation of critical downstream infrastructure comprising of major pipelines, depots and terminals through the Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) financing model is on course,\u201d he added.\n\nKyari explained that the transition in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector was being driven by the global decarbonisation efforts to switch to renewables in response to environmental concerns.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

This is what we believe in at the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) and we are happy that global partners also buy into this vision.

Bishop Edward C. Williams, \u201cNow is the time to be assured that we are equal stakeholders and not second or third rate citizens in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOther members of the delegation were Bishop David Usman, Bishop Emmanuel Jayeola, Bishop Olufemi Babalola, Dr. Prophet Sina Abimbola, Bishop Jeremiah Otubor, Bishop Festus Happiness Onyemachi, Bishop Dr. Emeka Theodore Nwizugbo, Bishop Timothy Cheren and Bishop Adams Abel Kings.\n\nDescribing the call as an \u201cepiscopal mission with far reaching consequences for Nigeria and the middle belt of the country in particular\u201d, Arch.

We in the middle belt are tired of being mere passengers and on lookers in this vehicle called Nigeria. The impression is being created that political power at the highest echelon is a ping pong game between the far north and the south while the middle belt is a mere net to be used in scoring points.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe as spiritual fathers and watchers in the middle belt have therefore decided it is time for us to also stake our claims in this project called Nigeria.

After extensive prayers and a careful sifting of the galaxy of stars who have distinguished themselves in various fields, it is our considered conclusion that you are our best option and you tick all the boxes and possess all it takes to provide credible leadership to our great country Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have followed your trajectory in life rising from a very humble background in Ihugh, in Vandeikya Benue State to the world renowned industrialist and global entrepreneur that you are today.\n\n\u201cLike Moses in the bible we perceive the voice of God beckoning on you from the burning bush of service to answer the clarion call by throwing in your hat into the ring of the contest for the seat of president come 2023 by the grace of God.\n\n\u201cIn you, we have seen an embodiment of hope for the ordinary Nigerian child that with hard work and determination, there are no borders too wide to conquer.\n\n\u201cYour success in your personal endeavours is what we want to see replicated in the affairs of our country.

Your acceptance of this divinely inspired call will assuage the ill feelings in the country and heal the unnecessary rifts currently bedevilling our country.\n\n\u201cWe urge you to take this call seriously and immediately commence the processes of nationwide consultations to make this dream a reality. The people of the middle belt say with one voice Moses Ayom for president 2023.\u201d\n\nResponding to the call, Mr Ayom, assured his visitors that he would \u201cseek the face of God and also consult leaders nationwide before coming to a decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to however, assure you all that whatever the outcome of the consultations, I am prepared to give my utmost for the progress of Nigeria.

          "text": "A former Senior Special Assistant to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, on Public Affairs, Dr Doyin Okupe, has called on the Federal Government to release the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, if that would restore peace in the South-East geopolitical zone.\n\nThis is as Okupe, who decried the spate of violence in Anambra State, noted that the freedom and or life of the IPOB leader was more important than the November 6 governorship election in the state, which he observed risked flawed in the face of a militarised electoral process.\n\nThe former presidential aide stated this in an exclusive interview with our correspondent in Abuja on the sideline of the National Convention of the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nAccording to Okupe, the Jonathan administration treated the issue of Boko Haram with a wave of the hand when it was not full-blown, adding, however, that both the last and current administrations had spent billions of dollars to battle Boko Haram, all to no avail.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Anambra State election is no doubt a security nightmare and a major cause for concern for many Nigerians. Whether we like it or not, IPOB has become an established \u201cArmy of Resistance\u201d for self-determination in the South-East.\n\n\u201cAlso, we must come to accept that the Biafra ideology has come to stay. Although it is self-evident that the major stakeholders of these movements are predominantly youths, the adult themselves share the concerns of these fighting youths even though they may prefer a different approach to achieving the same goals.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately also, concurrent events in the nation make the counsels of the elders untenable and therefore unacceptable to the warring youths.\n\n\u201cThe police have deployed 34, 000 officers. We do not know the numbers for the military and civil defence institutions. To the average citizens in Anambra State, this militarisation and over-policing, though inevitable, can nevertheless, be comforting.\n\n\u201cFrom my own projections, no fewer than 50% of normally voting population, purely out of fear and apprehension, will stay in their houses and avoid voting. If this happens, the election itself becomes substantially flawed. This is because a major ingredient of democratic suffrage, \u2018free and fair\u2019, will be absent.\n\n\u201cWhile one must of necessity concede to the Federal Government that it should not normally tolerate or succumb to internal threats to peace and good order, perhaps, it\u2019s now time to seek the seemingly elusive peace in the South-East.\n\n\u201cI hereby call on the Federal Government to release Nnamdi Kanu, if that will bring peace in the South-East zone, especially Anambra State. Nnamdi Kanu should be released for the sake of peace and order in that region. Nigerians are in pain. Nigerians are suffering and we can\u2019t afford war whether local, regional or national. We don\u2019t need it. We need peace.\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu is more important than the Anambra State governorship election. We need peace in all parts of this country, and if the release of Kanu will bring peace in Anambra State and the entire South-East zone, please the Federal Government should release him now.\n\nHe added, \u201cI call on the Federal Government at this point of our national history to invite the leadership of IPOB to a peace meeting. The Government should listen to the complaints of the youths from the South-East region and see how a true solution can be negotiated.\n\n\u201cI say this as someone who was part of government when Boko Haram was in its wake or infancy. The presumed might of the Federal Government made it look preposterous for the government to call a rag-tag group to a negotiating table.\n\n\u201cNow after more than 10 years, thousands of deaths, human tragedies and millions of internal human displacements, and with billions of dollars down the drain, I am convinced that it was indeed an error not to have negotiated for peace ab initio.\n\n\u201cHistorically, since the mid-1900s, no insurgency, once fully established, lasts less than 15 years on the average.

Justice Mary Peter Odili, on Friday 29\u201d October, 2021, in a Gestapo manner.\n\nThe apex court said the attack unfortunately depicted a gory picture of war by some armed persons suspected to be security operatives representing different agencies of government who seemed to have come to kill and maim their target under the guise of undertaking a search whose warrant was questionable and baseless.\n\nThe court said it was deeply saddened and taken aback by this uncivilised and shameful show of force on an innocent judicial officer that had spent several years of her productive life serving the country she called her own.\n\nIt stated that this incident brought back, rather painfully, the ugly memory of the October 2016 midnight invasion of the homes of its respected justices with no satisfactory explanations as to the true motive behind such brazen assault on their collective sensibility.\n\nThe court made it abundantly clear that the Nigerian Judiciary is the third arm of the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and should be respected and treated as such.\n\nIt lamented that it had a full dosage of this fusillade of unwarranted and unprovoked attacks on its judicial officers, and even its facilities across the country, and \u201cwe say, enough is enough.\u201d\n\nThe apex court said the judiciary should never be construed by any individual or institution of government as the arm of government that must always be chastised and ridiculed into silence because of its conservative disposition.\n\nThe Supreme Court said though there had emerged discordant tunes from the various security agencies that allegedly participated in the dastardly act, \u201cwe are not lying low on this dehumanizing treatment meted out to one of our own.\u201d\n\nThe court said it had begun a full-scale independent investigation to unravel the true masquerades behind the mystery as well as the real motives behind the whole incident.",

The victims were taken to Lagos Island General Hospital in Marina for treatment.\n\nThe deputy governor said: \u201cOur search and rescue operation is ongoing to remove those possibly still trapped under the rubbles. Our focus right now is to get people out alive. This morning, we took out two people alive and they are responding well to treatment in the hospital.\n\n\u201cTotally, we have evacuated nine people alive and three of them have been discharged.

The operation is ongoing and we hope we will be able to rescue more. We will not leave the site until we are able to account for everyone in the building,\u201d Hamzat said.\n\nHe disclosed that the collapsed structure had been sealed off by the State Government last June because of low structural integrity test and demanded the anomaly be corrected before the construction could be allowed to go on.\n\nHamzat said the project manager was being expected to report back to the Government on details of the correction before the incident.\n\nHe assured the public that the full investigation ordered by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, would yield an outcome that would lead to the next line of action.",

          "text": "The House of Representatives Committee on Steel Development has commenced investigation into the alleged fraudulent sale of the Delta Steel Company.\n\nTo this end, it invited the managing director of the new owner-Premium Steel-to appear before it Wednesday and explain the company\u2019s role in the alleged mismanagement of the assets worth $1.9 billion.\n\nThe company, located at Aladja, Delta state, was reportedly approved for sale by the Bureau of Public Enterprises in 2005 to Global Steel, through privatisation at 80% equity holding of the company to the new buyer.\n\n\n\nChairman of the committee, Hon. Abdullahi Halims gave the directive following a walkout staged by Premium Steel and Mine Company Limited\u2019s representatives, leading to a rowdy session at a public hearing Monday in Abuja.\n\nHe said the investigation was being carried out in accordance with the provisions of sections 88, 89 and 62 of the 1999 Constitution, which empowered the parliament to conduct inquest into any matter of public interest.\n\nConfusion\n\nBut confusion started when the committee sought the view of Premium Steel and Mine Company Limited.\n\nThis followed the outcry by the host community over alleged mismanagement of the steel firm by the supposed new owner, after it was handed over to it by Assets Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nWhile the committee asked for some clarifications from the company\u2019s representative, its counsel, Essien Andrew (SAN) rose on its feet to speak, but was shut down by the committee.\n\nThis was based on the rule of the committee that only the managing director or a person in similar capacity would be allowed to speak at such events.\n\nHost community\n\nEarlier in a submission, chairman, Udu local government area of Delta state, Jite Brown, had told the committee that the present management had run down the outfit, alleging that officials were also selling off items belonging to the company.\n\nSimilarly, a representative of chiefs from the area, Bernard Okiete Nafaga, also testified that the company had failed to live up to expectations, and that the government should take over and resuscitate it.\n\n\u201cI want FG to resuscitate the plant by revoking the agreement given to Premium Steel to run the plant,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the firm representatives walked out on the committee, the host community warned that if they were not called to order, they would shut down the facility.\n\nBPE\n\nIn his presentation, Director General Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) Alex Okoh, who was represented by Acting Director, Industries, Laila Bode, said the company was sold due to unresolved issues.\n\nBut the Corporate Affairs Commission disclosed that the company was registered March 2, 2004, and had undergone several changes in terms of ownership structure and assets.\n\nThe BPE representative said the outfit was privatised in 2005.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government privatised 80 percent of DSC equity to Global Infrastructure. It was privatised in 2005 to Global Infrastructure. Before the privatization process, it underwent two processes. The first advertisement did not yield much desired results, then it was advertised a second time where BUA emerged as the preferred bidder, but due to unresolved issues with BUA, the FG resolved to engage the willing-seller-willing-buyer strategy\u201d, she told the committee.\n\nIn a related development, Speaker House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila had assured stakeholders in the iron and steel sector of the lawmakers\u2019 commitment to reposition the Metallurgical Training Institute, Onitsha to serve as the hub for training and retraining of needed manpower to drive steel sector in Nigeria.\n\nThe speaker spoke at a public hearing on Bill seeking the reconstitution of the institute in Abuja.\n\n\n\nRepresented by Chief Whip, Hon. Tahir Monguno, the Speaker said the proposed law would reposition the institute, adding that the motion to investigate the sale of the steel company was timely, coming at a point when the nation was the quest to find solution to many of its challenges.\n\n\n\nHe further said the needed low and middle level manpower for national development could be found if the institute was made functional.",

          "text": "The initial firm handling the collapsed 21-storey building along Gerrard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos state, has said it pulled out of site when its clients insisted on going beyond 4-storey building.\n\nThe building, it was gathered, was under construction as at the time of the tragedy some few minutes past 2.00 pm Monday.\n\nIt was gathered that about 50 persons, including the building owner and site workers, were trapped.\n\nThe company, which had earlier constructed two buildings on the site, the letter said, clearly told its clients it could not guarantee the integrity of the third building (which ultimately collapsed).\n\nThe firm \u2013 Prowess Engineering Limited \u2013 withdrew its services February 2020.\n\nThis, it said, was because it no longer shared the same vision with its client- Fourscore Heights Limited as contained in the letter.\n\nTitled, \u2018Re: Proposed Gerrard Terraces For Fourscore Limited,\u2019 the letter was signed by the company\u2019s managing director, Muritala Olawale.\n\n\u201cThis letter is to formally inform you of the withdraw (sic) of our structural consultancy service from the above named project. We arrived at this decision due to the fact that we no longer share the same vision with you as our client in terms of how the project is being executed.\n\n\u201cWe can guarantee the integrity of the first two buildings and also work done up to the fourth floor of the third building supervised by us provided specifications have been met in terms of the required concrete strength. This we do not have control over as we do not have the concrete cube test results of each stage of the building till date. Also, note that we are not taking responsibility for any other construction errors that may have occurred overtime on the project.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we request that our company\u2019s name and logo be removed from the project board and also kindly notify all necessary approving authorities of our withdrawal from the project,\u201d the company said in the letter.\n\n4 dead, 4 rescued \u2015 NEMA\n\nMeanwhile, indications emerged last night that no fewer than four persons had so far been rescued while four others were brought out dead from the rubbles of the collapsed building.\n\nSouth West Zonal Coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) Ibrahim Farinloye disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos Monday.\n\nNAN reports that many were feared trapped as the storey building under construction collapsed in Ikoyi.\n\nNEMA team and that of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) were still on ground trying to rescue trapped workers as at the time of this report.\n\nBlueprint gathered that despite the rescue efforts, many were still trapped in the rubbles.\n\nThis latest building collapse is coming barely a month after three persons were reportedly trapped and another killed when a building collapsed in Ikorodu area of Lagos state last month.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the possible cause for collapse and number of persons feared trapped in the latest incident, could not be ascertained as at the time of this report.\n\nHowever, unconfirmed report indicates that aside the destruction to cars and other properties and construction materials, about 50 persons were said to have been trapped.\n\nLASEMA spokesman, Nosa Okunbo, confirmed the incident in a terse electronic statement which said: \u201cA 25-storey building collapsed by Musliu Junction, Ikoyi, Lagos. LASEMA is on top of the situation.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the agency\u2019s Director-General, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, in a brief response said LASEMA\u2019s heavy-duty equipment and life detection equipment were already mobilised and deployed to the accident scene.\n\nOsanyintolu said: \u201cCollapsed Building at Gerard Road, Ikoyi: The agency has activated its emergency response plan to the above incident.\n\n\u201cAll first responders are en route to secure the scene while the heavy-duty equipment and life detection equipment have been dispatched.\u201d\n\nThe state deputy governor, Femi Hamza, Commissioner for Special Duties & Intergovernmental Relations, Seye Oladejo, his physical planning counterpart, Dr Idris Salako and LASEMA boss were all at the site of the incident.\n\nAn eyewitnesses in the neighbourhood said, \u201cat least about 50 people are reportedly trapped under the rubble, including construction workers and other people who provided ancillary services for the workers.\u201d\n\nTimeline on Lagos building collapse\n\nBuilding collapses are common sights in Lagos.

Isaac David, have commended a 25-year northern youth Hon Mohammed Kadade Suleiman that emerged as national youth leader of the People Democratic Party PDP.\n\nThe Coordinator who made this commendation during an interaction with journalists on Monday in Abuja said, the emergence of Suleiman as a party youths leader has become a plus to all the Arewa youth and also a motivating factor to the youths of this country, \u201cthat there\u2019s still hope that a day will come when a youth will take over the affairs of the nation at the highest level\u201d,.\n\nAmb. David also called on other political parties and institutions to emulate the PDP in terms of trusting the youth with sensitive positions capable of changing the narrative of the country.\n\n\u201cIt a clear fact that the energy and brightness of the minds of youths act as torchbearer for national development. The countries which utilize their youth in a positive direction are more developed. The youth of the nation is the trustees of posterity. Good education prepares one to impact positively on self and society.\n\n\u201cYouths in the Nigeria Constitution refer to persons between ages 18 and 35. So, how come the youth leader of the most political party in Africa is above 50 years? This question and many more are part of the problems facing the youth that has incapacitated him to fully partake in issues of nation-building. But now that the case has started changing starting from the PDP\u2019s decision we be believe that others will follow suit\u201d,.\n\n\u201cWe also hope that one day a youth will become the president of this country and while we equally advice the youth that have been given an opportunity as a leader, not to disappoint the the Northern youths and the Nigeria youths at large.\n\n\u201cRemember that youth are refers to people who have energy, vigour and enthusiasm to get things done. It is a state of mind not a function of Age, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity and an insatiable appetite for progressive reasoning.\n\n\u201cThe youths are agents of change and the change we desire in others must start from us.

The Justice Haroon-led committee recommended the regulation of Arabic and Islamic schools in the state and the reconstitution of the Arabic Education Board\n\n\u201cMURIC commends the committee for treating the matter with military dispatch and for addressing the core issues involved. Inaugurated on the 15th day of October, 2021, the committee commenced sitting immediately up till the 24th day of October, 2021 and submitted its report the next day. This is record time.\n\n\u201cWe implore the state government to speedily and steadily implement the committee\u2019s recommendations. The state government should also note that the success of its implementation depends on its sincerity and commitment to the cause of Arabic education.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important to point out the immense benefits which the state government stands to reap from paying adequate attention to Arabic and Islamic education. In the kitty are a steady fall in crime rate, reduction of corrupt practices in both public and private sectors and stability in family affairs as a result of the infusion of moral guidelines in young Muslims in the Arabic schools.\n\n\u201cArabic and Islamic studies as a twin discipline is the bedrock of morality in any society and any government that undermines any of the two does so at the risk of moral degeneration, unbridled chaos and criminality ad infinitum.\n\n\u201cWe invite the Kwara State government to ponder over the cassu belli for the preponderance of high moral value in scholars of Islam and other Muslims who passed through Arabic schools.\n\n\u201cWe glow with pride that President Muhammadu Buhari who sits on Nigeria\u2019s humongous wealth but who refuses to steal one kobo is a product of the Arabic school and he is Qur\u2019an-literate. The secret behind the uncommon, unequalled and jet-age performance of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Pantami, can be traced to the fact that he is a Shaykh and a cerebral Islamic scholar.\n\n\u201cThere is also no gainsaying the fact that Professor Ishaq Oloyede, a professor of Islamic studies who is making waves at the Joint Admissions Matriculation Board, JAMB, has proved beyond reasonable doubt the stuff Islamic scholars are made of as ambassadors of integrity, credibility, probity and accountability.\n\n\u201cIndeed, in those three Muslim public officials alone the Kwara State Government stands a good chance of setting up stainless models for young Muslims in Kwara State.\u201d",

We are in a mess because if we have done what we are supposed to do, either on the private or government side, we wouldn\u2019t be having this kind of incident.\n\n\u201cLike it\u2019s said by (Femi) Falana, the renowned lawyer, about six or seven weeks precisely where we have all the allied professionals in the construction industry together, he said \u2018we should stop talking about building collapse; go and search yourselves, what is your regulatory building doing? Your regulatory body is supposed to regulate things like this,\u201d said Majekodunmi.\n\nHe added, \u201cLooking at this, you can\u2019t determine what is actually the cause of the collapse. In a nutshell, we are standing in front of the signage which is supposed to be a prerequisite at a site.\n\n\u201cYou cannot see the name of the architect, the structural engineer, and other consultants. But there is so much going on on the platform where the number written on all these consultants happens to be the developer.\n\n\u201cI will tell you just a little history because the government has a big fault for this. In 1986, a National Building Code was drafted by all the professional bodies in the construction industry \u2013 seven of them. This National Building Code was not signed until 20 years after it was drafted.\u201d",

Nigeria is committed to net zero by 2060.\u2019\u2019\n\nMaking a case for gas-based energy transition in Nigeria, President Buhari requested international partners to finance projects using transition fuels such as gas in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018Parties to the Paris Agreement are expected to transit from fossil fuel to clean energy and reach a Net Zero ambition for greenhouse gases emission.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria is actually more of a gas than an oil producing country.\n\n\u2018\u2018Consequently, I am requesting for financing of projects using transition fuels, such as gas.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria has energy challenges for which, we believe, gas can be used to balance a renewable energy-based system, be it wind or sun.\n\n\u2018\u2018This would enable us launch the long-term renewable energy infrastructure procurements and investments needed to have a sustainable energy supply.\u2019\u2019\n\nAcknowledging that net zero ambition can lead to economic transformation across all sectors, the Nigerian leader said it would require critical infrastructure to be in place.\n\nPresident Buhari also told the COP26 Leaders\u2019 Summit that Nigeria has developed a detailed energy transition plan and roadmap based on data and evidence.\n\nHe explained that the plan has highlighted some key facts that forces the difficult conversations.\n\n\u2018\u2018Our transition plan also highlights the key role that gas will play in transitioning our economy across sectors, and the data and evidence show that Nigeria can continue to use gas until 2040 without detracting from the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\n\u2018\u2018Gas will be key for addressing the clean cooking challenge, which is also a challenge of deforestation, and for giving our electric grid the stability and flexibility to integrate renewables at scale. Nigeria will need to integrate an unprecedented 7GW additional renewable capacity each year to achieve net-zero,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn energy access, President Buhari declared that Nigeria\u2019s commitment to a just transition is reflected in \u2018\u2018our ambitious Energy Compact, which includes the Government\u2019s flagship project to electrify 5million households and 25 million people using decentralized solar energy solutions.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe described the project as a major first step towards closing energy access deficit in the country by 2030.\n\nOn green projects in the county, the President declared that Federal Government agencies have been directed to ensure the inclusion of projects with Climate Change credentials in the budget.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am happy to state that the 2022 budget, which I recently submitted to our National Assembly, is the first cross-sectoral, gender and climate-responsive budget ever prepared in the annals of our history.\u201d\n\nThe President announced that the National Assembly has also passed the Climate Change Bill, which provides a framework for achieving low greenhouse gas emissions, inclusive green growth and sustainable economic development.\n\nPresident Buhari concluded his address with a note of caution, saying:\n\n\u2018\u2018The outcome of this Conference must result in quick resolution of all outstanding issues pertaining to the finalization of the Paris Agreement Rulebook, Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Article 6 and Loss and Damage.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "Ethiopia has tried to limit a UN human rights investigation into atrocities committed in the blockaded Tigray region, people with knowledge of the probe say.\n\nThe joint investigation by the UN human rights office and the government-created Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) may be the world\u2019s only official source of information on atrocities in the war against the Tigray forces that began in November 2020.\n\nThe national government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has barred human rights watchdogs, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, as well as foreign media from entering the embattled region.\n\nThe UN human rights office in Geneva said the government\u2019s severing of flights and communications from Tigray during the planned investigation period made it difficult to access key locations both \u201clogistically and from a security point of view\u201d.\n\nAccess to Tigray had been granted provided the UN accepted to work with EHRC. The presence of the government agency raised concerns in Tigray, including among the interim Tigray authorities hand-picked by Ethiopia\u2019s government to run the region.\n\nThe Tigray administration\u2019s former chief of staff, Gebremeskel Kassa, rejected the investigation under these premises. \u201cWe believe this is a tool of the government,\u201d he said of the EHRC.\n\nPeople close to the investigation who spoke to The Associated Press news agency on condition of anonymity said the head of the EHRC, Daniel Bekele, had underplayed some allegations that fighters from the country\u2019s Amhara region were responsible for abuses in Tigray, and pressed instead to highlight abuses by Tigray forces.\n\nThis version of events was in contrast with witness reports that pointed to soldiers from neighbouring Eritrea, Ethiopian forces, and fighters from the Amhara region as the perpetrators of most abuses.\n\nBekele rejected the accusations saying attempts to influence the investigation came from \u201dmany directions\u201d in such a polarised environment. He added the commission pointed out \u201cserious indications that all parties involved in the conflict have committed atrocities\u201d.\n\nThe probe has been lacking the support of the Tigray authorities administering the region since Tigray forces retook much of the area in June.\n\nIn September, Ethiopia\u2019s government expelled UN human rights officer Sonny Onyegbula. It has yet to provide legal grounds for the decision.\n\n\u201cWe cannot accept the allegation that our staff member \u2026 was \u2018meddling in the internal affairs of Ethiopia,\u201d the UN said.\n\nSix other UN officials were declared \u201cpersona non grata\u201d alongside Onyegbula and given 72 hours to leave the country.\n\nThe conflict has been marked by atrocities including gang rapes, mass expulsions, deliberate starvation and thousands of killings.\n\nInvestigators have been unable to visit the scene of many alleged massacres in Tigray, including the deadliest known one in the city of Axum, where witnesses say several hundred people have been killed.",

          "text": "At least 19 people were killed and 43 wounded when two explosions followed by gunfire hit Afghanistan\u2019s biggest military hospital in the capital Kabul, interior ministry sources told Al Jazeera on Tuesday.\n\nThe sound of gunfire was also heard near the Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan military hospital in the Afghan capital, according to witnesses and a government spokesperson.\n\nBilal Karimi, deputy spokesman of the Islamic Emirate, told reporters that at least two blasts took place at the entrance of the 400-bed hospital in Kabul\u2019s 10th district. Witnesses told Al Jazeera it was a car bomb.\n\n\u201cSecurity forces are deployed to the area, there is no information about casualties,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nEarlier, Saeed Khosty, interior ministry spokesman said that there were casualties in the blasts, but did not confirm the toll.\n\nPhotographs shared by residents showed a plume of smoke after the blasts in the former diplomatic zone in the Wazir Akbar Khan area in central Kabul.\n\nISIL affiliate\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility. But the official Bakhtar news agency quoted witnesses saying a number of fighters from ISIL (ISIS) affiliate, entered the hospital and clashed with security forces. Al Jazeera however, could not independently verify the report.\n\nThe blasts add to a growing list of attacks and killings since the Taliban completed their victory over the previous Western-backed government in August [Sayed Khodaiberdi Sadat/Anadolu Agency])\n\nThe blasts add to a growing list of attacks and killings since the Taliban completed their victory over the previous Western-backed government in August, undermining their claim to have restored security to Afghanistan after decades of war.\n\nISIL affiliate Islamic State in Khorasan Province, ISKP (ISIS-K), which has carried out a series of attacks on mosques and other targets since the Taliban\u2019s seizure of Kabul in August, mounted a complex attack on the 400-bed hospital in 2017, killing more than 30 people.\n\nA health worker at the hospital, who managed to escape the site, said he heard a large explosion followed by a couple of minutes of gunfire. About ten minutes later, there was a second, larger explosion, he said.\n\nHe said it was unclear whether the blasts and the gunfire were inside the sprawling hospital complex, the largest military hospital in Afghanistan.\n\nTaliban Special Forces have since been sent to the scene, according to the interior ministry.",

          "text": "More than 100 countries promised to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by the end of 2030, underpinned by $19bn in public and private funds to invest in protecting and restoring forests.\n\nThe joint statement issued at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow late on Monday was backed by the leaders of countries including Brazil, Russia, Indonesia and Democratic Republic of the Congo, which collectively account for 85 percent of the world\u2019s forests.\n\nThe Glasgow Leaders\u2019 Declaration on Forest and Land Use will cover forests totalling more than 33 million square kilometres (13 million square miles), according to a statement from the British prime minister\u2019s office on behalf of the leaders.\n\n\u201cWe will have a chance to end humanity\u2019s long history as nature\u2019s conqueror, and instead become its custodian,\u201d said Boris Johnson, calling it an unprecedented agreement.\n\nA slew of additional government and private initiatives were launched on Tuesday to help reach that goal, including billions in pledges for Indigenous guardians of the forest and sustainable agriculture.\n\nForests absorb roughly 30 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the nonprofit World Resources Institute (WRI). The forests take the emissions out of the atmosphere and prevent them from warming the climate.\n\nYet, this natural climate buffer is rapidly disappearing. The world lost 258,000 square kilometres (99,600 square miles) of forest in 2020, according to WRI\u2019s deforestation tracking initiative Global Forest Watch.\n\nThat is an area larger than the United Kingdom.\n\nMichelle Passero, director of The Nature Conservancy\u2019s climate change programme in California, called the agreement a \u201cterrific start\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need pledges like this to kick off COP26,\u201d she told Al Jazeera from San Francisco in the United States. \u201cThis is a really good start. We also need to connect all the dots all the way to the ground, to engage communities and Indigenous communities in solutions.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s agreement vastly expands a similar commitment made by 40 countries as part of the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests and goes further than ever before in laying out the resources to reach that goal.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo of resource-rich Indonesia said his own archipelago\u2019s rainforests, mangroves, seas and peatlands were key to restricting disastrous climate change.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to protecting these critical carbon sinks and our natural capital for future generations,\u201d he said\n\nUnder the agreement, 12 countries, including the UK, have pledged to provide 8.75 billion pounds ($12bn) of public funding between 2021 and 2025 to help developing countries, including in efforts to restore degraded land and tackle wildfires.\n\nAt least a further 5.3 billion pounds ($7.2bn) would be provided by more than 30 private sector investors, including Aviva, Schroders and AXA.\n\nThe investors, representing $8.7 trillion in assets under management, also pledged to stop investing in activities linked to deforestation by 2025.\n\nFive countries, including the UK and US, and a group of global charities on Tuesday also pledged to provide $1.7bn in financing to support Indigenous people\u2019s conservation of forests and strengthen their land rights.\n\nEnvironmentalists say that Indigenous communities are the best protectors of the forest, often against violent encroachment of loggers and land grabbers.\n\nMore than 30 financial institutions with more than $8.7 trillion in assets under management also said they would make \u201cbest efforts\u201d to eliminate deforestation related to cattle, palm oil, soy and pulp production by 2025.\n\nCOP26 aims to keep alive a target of capping global warming at 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial levels \u2013 a level needed to prevent the most catastrophic effects of global warming. Scientists say forests and so-called nature-based solutions will be vital to reaching that goal.\n\nWoodlands have removed about 760 million tonnes of carbon every year since 2011, offsetting about 8 percent of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and cement, according to the Biomass Carbon Monitor project backed by data analytics firm Kayrros and French research institutions.\n\n\u201cOur biosphere is really helping bail us out for the time being, but there is no guarantee those processes will continue,\u201d said Oliver Phillips, an ecologist at the University of Leeds in the UK.\n\nTrees continue to be cut down on an industrial scale, not least in the Amazon under the far-right government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nGreenpeace criticised the Glasgow initiative for effectively giving the green light to \u201canother decade of deforestation\u201d.\n\n\u201cIndigenous peoples are calling for 80 percent of the Amazon to be protected by 2025, and they\u2019re right, that\u2019s what\u2019s needed,\u201d said Greenpeace Brazil Executive Director Carolina Pasquali.\n\n\u201cThe climate and the natural world can\u2019t afford this deal,\u201d she said.",
