          "title": "Reps recommend N390m compensation for Customs killings in Oyo, Katsina",
          "text": "The House of Representatives has asked the Nigeria Customs Service to compensate victims of extrajudicial killings and injuries caused by its officers and men across the country with a total of N390m.\n\nThis is based on the recommendations in the reports by the House Committee on Customs and Excise after investigating two incidents in Oyo State and one incident in Katsina State.\n\nThe Chairman of the committee, Leke Abejide, had last week laid the reports, which the House considered and adopted in plenary on Tuesday.\n\nThe committee had investigated \u201cthe unrest in Iseyin Local Government Area of Oyo State due to the killing of indigenes by men of the Nigeria Customs Service.\u201d\n\nThe House upheld the committee\u2019s recommendation that \u201clife has no duplicate and cannot be replaced once lost, as such, the families of the deceased should be compensated in monetary terms, each soul lost at the Iseyin incident be compensated by the Nigeria Customs Service with the sum of N20m. The number of souls lost being four; the value of total compensation for the four deceased is N80m only.\u201d\n\nThe recommendation read, \u201cFor the person, who sustained a gunshot injury in the Iseyin incident, the sum of N2m only be paid as compensation for the treatment of the injury sustained.\n\n\u201cThe grand total for compensation for both the deceased and the injured is the sum of N82m only.\n\n\u201cThe officers involved in the acts of killings of innocent Nigerians should be brought to book, prosecuted and punished accordingly to serve as a deterrent to others.\u201d\n\nOn what it called the \u201cmurder of innocent people\u201d in Jibia, Katsina State, by men of the NCS on August 9, 2021, the committee recommended that \u201ceach soul lost to the Jibia LGA incident should be compensated with the sum of N20m by the Nigeria Customs Service. The number of souls lost being 10 persons, the value of total compensation for the deceased is N200m only.\u201d\n\nThe committee further recommended, \u201cThe 13 persons, who sustained gunshot injuries in the Jibia incident, should be paid the sum of N2m each as compensation by the Nigeria Customs Service for the treatment of the injuries sustained.\n\n\u201cThe value of total compensation is N26m only. The grand total payable by the Nigeria Customs Service as compensation for both the deceased and the injured should be the sum of N226m only.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the committee investigated \u201cthe brutal murder at Igangan, Igboora, Ayete and Tapa in the Ibarapa Local Government Area of Oyo State by men of the Nigeria Customs Service.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the panel recommended that each soul lost to the Iseyin incident be compensated by the NCS with the sum of N20m each, adding, \u201cThe number of souls lost being four; the value of total compensation for the four deceased is N80m only.\n\n\u201cFor the person, who sustained a gunshot injury in the Iseyin incident, the sum of N2m only be paid as compensation for the treatment of the injury sustained.\n\n\u201cThe grand total of compensation for both the deceased and the injured is the sum of N82m only.\n\n\u201cThe officers involved in the acts of killings of innocent Nigerians should be brought to book, prosecuted and punished accordingly to serve as a deterrent to others.\u201d\n\nThe committee further recommended that \u201cprovision should be made for the procurement of ballistic vehicles (bulletproof), bulletproof vests and helmets urgently for the Nigeria Customs Service to confront the daredevil smugglers attacking their officers at border stations whenever the smugglers opened fire on them. This will encourage the Nigeria Customs Service to be able to curtail smuggling with fewer casualties on their side.\n\n\u201cThat as constant conflict with communities is counterproductive and unsustainable; the Nigeria Customs Service should aggressively deepen its engagement with traditional rulers, community stakeholders, host communities, relevant trade associations, local police networks and local security outfits to prevent future loss of lives and property on all sides.\u201d",
          "summary": "The House of Representatives has asked the Nigeria Customs Service to compensate victims of extrajudicial killings and injuries caused by its officers and men across the country with a total of N390m.\nThis is based on the recommendations in the reports by the House Committee on Customs and Excise after investigating two incidents in Oyo State and one incident in Katsina State.\n\u201cThe grand total for compensation for both the deceased and the injured is the sum of N82m only.\n\u201cThe value of total compensation is N26m only.\nThis will encourage the Nigeria Customs Service to be able to curtail smuggling with fewer casualties on their side.",

Ibikunle Amosun (APC-Ogun) said that until the sectors proposed for diversification were funded, \u201cwe will still be operating on a monolithic economy in the country.\n\n\u201cUntil when we do the right thing, there is no way we will develop the mining sector.\n\n\u201cWe need to fund the sector adequately. If we do not fund, we will not get the best of technology that can develop this sector.\u201d\n\nAmosun further said that setting up a bank that would support the mining sector would check the challenges bedevilling the sector.\n\nAlso contributing, Sen. Yusuf Yusuf (APC-Taraba) said \u201cIn the nature that we must diversify our economy, it has become apparent and absolutely necessary that we have a special bank that should and must finance solid mineral development in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNone of the commercial banks or at least very minimal that are in the process of financing solid mineral development in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need to develop the sector to its maximum potential and this is through a very solid and good position of funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege who presided over plenary thereafter referred the bill to the Senate Committee on Solid Minerals, Mines, Steel Development and Metallurgy and report in four weeks at plenary.",

For school children to be rendered unsafe, innocent souls subject to being kidnapped and killed is disgraceful and worrisome\u201d.\n\nAdopting the motion, the House commended the State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and the security agencies for doing due diligence in the operation and dispensation of justice.\n\nThe House was also urged by the mover of the motion to constitute a delegation to visit and condole with the family of the deceased and the entire people of Kano state.\n\nIt mandated its committees on Justice, Human Rights, Civil Societies & Development Partners to ensure compliance to the resolution.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt, Vincent Ikuomola, Emmanuel Badejo and Yetunde Afolabi\n\nThe seeming unity among Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leaders before and after its convention last October may hit the rock with the tense struggle for the 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike yesterday insisted that it was the turn of the South to provide the party\u2019s standard-bearer in the election.\n\nLast week, Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed said the party would field a candidate from the North in 2023 because the president produced by the PDP \u2013 Goodluck Jonathan \u2013 was a Southerner.\n\nGovernor Mohammed noted that rotation of presidential office is for the All Progressives Congress (APC) because President Muhammadu Buhari is a northerner.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBesides Governor Mohammed, Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, all from the North, have indicated interest to contest for President on PDP platform.\n\nWike, speaking to PDP stakeholders at the Government House in Port Harcourt yesterday, warned against undermining the interest of the South whenever the opposition party decides the choice of its presidential standard-bearer.\n\nAlso, Ijaw Leader Chief Edwin Clark said zoning was required for peace and national unity.\n\nThe elder statesman wrote an open letter to Atiku, Saraki and other aspirants from the North, warning that the retention of the ticket in the region may be a recipe for chaos.\n\nSouthern governors, last year, voted for rotation of the presidential seat to the South.\n\nWike said: \u201cPlease, discountenance anything you\u2019re seeing and hearing; all those social media posts. The South will make a statement very soon. It is not about you\u2019ll be vice president to this or that.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNigerians will know that we are not joking. People take the South for granted, saying that they are not together. No problems. If we didn\u2019t know yesterday, today, we know.\n\n\u201cWe are assets. We are not a liability. When we say we are going to support the party, we support the party with everything we have. We are not in America where you do television campaigns.\n\n\u201cWhen we come out, we will choke them. They know it. So, everybody should relax, let the south do their homework and then they\u2019ll make a proper statement.\u201d\n\nHe said those planning to use money to overwhelm the internal democracy and buy off the ticket would be disappointed.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat is necessary is how the party must be cohesive, to make sure that the party gets it right.\u201d\n\nHe criticised PDP Chieftain Dr. Raymond Dokpesi who is rooting for Atiku, saying: \u201cWith all due respect. If we follow the kind of statement that Dokpesi is making every day, by now, the party would have been destroyed. But, we say no.\u201d\n\nThe governor said those calling for the PDP to jettison zoning of elective offices were doing that for selfish and personal interests that do not reflect the true spirit of federalism.\n\nHe added: \u201cI stand on Southern Governors Forum decision on zoning. I was at the meeting where it was decided that zoning should come to the South and we took that decision together. I cannot go against that stand.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, it will be unfair for the presidential ticket to go to the North as the zone had produced the party chairman in the person of Senator Iyorcha Ayu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe people in the South are of the view that power should come to the zone in 2023.\u201d\n\nClark maintained that zoning remained the best antidote to breakup.\n\nThe former National Commissioner went down memory lane to remind them that the principle of rotation dates back to the pre-independence era.\n\nHe therefore appealed to the PDP chieftains from the North who had indicated interest to run for the coveted seat to allow the principle of justice to reign\n\nClark said: \u201cIt will be disastrous to suppress the rights of other Nigerians without regard for justice, equity and fair play.\u201d\n\nHe added that any attempt to use the force of power, population, religion and ethnicity will not do the nation unity any good.\n\n\u201cIn 1999, the zoning pattern was also observed, more so, the country wanted to compensate the Yorubas because of the June 12 incident.\n\n\u201cThat was how Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, from the South, contested the elections with Alhaji Atiku Abubakar from the north as his running mate under the PDP.\n\n\u201cChief Olu Falae, also from Southern Nigeria, also contested with Alhaji Umaru Shinkafi from the north, as his running mate under the Alliance for Democracy (AD).\n\n\u201cZoning was sustained at the end of Chief Obasanjo\u2019s tenure of eight years, giving the Presidency to the North in 2007, whereby Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, Governor of Katsina State, Northern Nigeria, became the presidential candidate of the PDP and Dr. Goodluck Jonathan from Bayelsa State, Southern Nigeria, became his running mate.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive that the nation\u2019s two main parties, the APC and the PDP, have been religiously following the zoning and rotation system between the north and the South. By 2023, the North would have ruled for another eight years.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, rational and right, to insist that the Presidency should rotate to the south. It does not matter whether the presidency has been produced from the APC or the PDP since 2015.\n\n\u201cTo which sub-region the presidency should be further zoned to in the south, is a different matter entirely. At the appropriate time, we will decide as to which area, section or region of the three regions of Southeast, Southsouth and Southwest, should have it.\u201d\n\nHe further argued that when it comes to which region has had the most opportunity, the North \u201chas had the Presidency for about 45 years of our nation\u2019s history as an independent country, including both civilian and military regimes.\n\n\u201cThe 17 Governors of southern Nigeria both of the APC and the PDP, under the leadership of Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, Governor of Ondo State, resolved at a meeting in Asaba, Delta State, that the Presidency should rotate to the South in 2023, in keeping with the tradition of zoning.\n\n\u201cThe South and Middle Belt Leaders Forum, under my leadership, has held two important meetings to support the resolution of the 17 Governors of the Southern Nigeria, that presidency of the country, should rotate to the south.\u201d",

The people we put in uniform must never be placed in avoidable danger, outgunned or outnumbered by non-state actors.\n\n\u201cIt is when the terrorists are decimated that \u2018soft\u2019, non-kinetic peacebuilding will gain traction,\u201d El-Rufai said.\n\nHe restated his position that bandits do not repent.\n\n\u201cWe continue to emphasise that as a state government, we do not believe that there is any phenomenon like \u2018repentant bandits\u2019.\n\n\u201cAny person that makes a conscious decision to secure arms, challenge the authority of the Nigerian state and threatens the lives and property of Nigerians does not deserve to live or be granted any concession by the society.\n\n\u201cThere are no immediate or remote causes to justify terrorist conduct.\n\n\u201cThose that hide behind these are either ethnic jingoists, religious apologists or fail to recognise that no legitimate government can survive by tolerating terrorists or negotiating with those that menace law-abiding citizens.\n\n\u201cWhile acknowledging their efforts and sacrifices of lives and limb, we, therefore, urge our military, police and other security agencies to ensure coordinated actions and intensify simultaneous kinetic operations against these terrorists until they are decimated to the point of surrender,\u201d the governor said.\n\nIn the Niger attacks, terrorists were said to have ambushed and killed three soldiers who were on patrol, as well as four vigilantes in the Kwanan Dutse community in Mariga.\n\nIn Paikoro Local Government Area, four people, including a 20-year-old boy, were killed and several others injured when the terrorists attacked Ishau, Kuna, Amale, Adunu, Kudami communities.\n\nOur correspondent learnt that the insurgents, who came in numbers, were armed with sophisticated weapons, but were forced to retreat by the vigilantes.\n\nNiger Police Command spokesman, Abiodun Wasiu and the Chairman of Paikoro LGA, Mallam Yohana Yakubu, could not be reached to confirm the attacks as their phones rang out.\n\nOver 18 people were killed and 40 injured when terrorists invaded the Galadima Kogo community in Shiroro Local Government Area in Niger at the weekend.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Sani Bello, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mary Berje, said the state government had secured clearance to carry out intensive military operations in Shiroro, Munya and Rafi areas.\n\n\u201cWe have run out of patience with the terrorists and we\u2019ll use every means possible to bring an end to these incessant bloody attacks on innocent people.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything to stop the killings and return normalcy to the affected communities,\u201d he vowed.",

          "text": "\u2022Emefiele: New FX policy underway\n\n\u2022FG, stakeholders laud apex bank\u2019s drive to boost economy\n\nJames Emejo\n\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has disbursed a total of N23.20 billion to 28 companies whose projects were selected for funding in the maiden batch of its newly introduced \u201c100 for 100 Policy for Production and Productivity (PPP)\u201d initiative.\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who disclosed this yesterday in Abuja, also said the apex bank would soon introduce a new foreign exchange (FX) bidding regime.\n\nEmefiele spoke at the formal launch of the 100 for 100 PPP scheme. He explained that the primary objective of the CBN in introducing the initiative was to ensure that priority was accorded to companies that displayed verifiable progress in the bank\u2019s import substitution and job creation drive.\n\nEmefiele said the funds disbursed to beneficiaries of the 100 for 100 policy, which he stressed were loans, followed due screening of the applications received. He said the projects, valued at N23.20 billion, comprised 14 in the manufacturing sector, 12 in the agricultural sector, and two in the healthcare sector.\n\nHe assured all current and prospective operators in the industrial sector that the CBN was ready to continue to provide the needed support, financial and otherwise, to fast-track the development of the sector.\n\nEmefiele said the central bank would continue to provide all the needed support for the importation of plants and equipment to actualise investments in new greenfield or existing brownfield projects.\n\nHe said for this first cycle of the 100 for 100 policy, which ended yesterday, 243 applications valued at N321.06 billion, spread over key sectors, including agriculture, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and services sectors, were submitted on the portal.\n\nEmefiele said after much engagement, 79 applications valued at N121.87 billion, were received from banks for projects in six sectors, namely agriculture, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, mining, and services sectors. He said the requests were carefully screened and scrutinised against a set-out selection criteria, and were categorised into production efficiency and scalability; local content capacity; job creation and human capital development; operating sector relevance; and potential contribution to economic growth.\n\nBut only 28 companies with projects that clearly articulated their proposals were selected for funding, he said, adding that the CBN intended to revisit the applications that were declined with a view to understanding areas of their shortcomings and enabling more companies to benefit from the initiative meant to stimulate manufacturing output in the country.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cWith the significant opportunities in the real sector, there remained sufficient room for additional investments in the various sub-sectors and I would like to urge potential investors to take advantage of the various CBN intervention programmes and schemes, as well as other financing options out there, to invest in key sectors of our economy given the potential gains that could be generated from them.\u201d\n\nStakeholders, including Deposit Money Banks (DMBs), Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) and the beneficiary companies, all commended the apex bank and expressed confidence in the ability of its initiatives to boost domestic production as well as diversify the economy.\n\nEmefiele also said the initiative was designed to stimulate investments in Nigeria\u2019s priority sectors with the core objective of boosting production and productivity, which will aid efforts to stimulate greater growth of the economy and create employment opportunities.\n\nHe said, \u201cUnder this initiative, every 100 days, manufacturers in critical sectors that seek to engage in greenfield projects or in expanding their existing facilities will have access to cheaper forms of credit at single digit rates, as well as foreign exchange to procure plants and machineries.\u201d\n\nHe said the programme had the potential to significantly accelerate manufacturing output, promote further diversification of the economy, and facilitate faster growth of non-oil exports.\n\nEssentially, he said the PPP would help to reduce the country\u2019s over-reliance on imports, and stimulate productivity in agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, extractive industries, logistics services, trade-related infrastructure, and renewable energy.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis launch also fulfils the commitment we made during the unveiling of the first central bank digital currency (CBDC), the eNaira, by His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, on the 25th of October, 2021, when we announced that the CBN will introduce a 100 for 100 \u2013 Policy on Production and Productivity (PPP), under which eligible companies in priority sectors will be screened and 100 companies will be selected to receive funding from the CBN every 100 days, beginning from 1st November 2021.\n\n\u201cThe selection of subsequent beneficiaries will be rolled over every 100 days with new sets of 100 companies and details of these companies will be published in the major national dailies.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s launch of the 100 for 100 Policy for Production and Productivity (PPP) initiative and cheque presentation to selected companies, is a culmination of our engagements with critical stakeholders in the manufacturing sector and financial institutions, as we have here today pioneer beneficiaries of the initiative and the participating financial institutions.\u201d\n\nHe said over the past seven years, the Buhari government had made significant effort to reduce over-reliance on imports for food and industrial raw materials, towards one that was self-sufficient and self-reliant, with strong commitment towards ensuring that Nigerians produce what they eat and eat what they produce.\n\nThe CBN governor added that in line with the administration\u2019s policy focus to stimulate domestic production and productivity, the central bank had continued to introduce various policy measures, in the form of interventions, to stimulate low-cost and sustainable financing to priority sectors and segments of the economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe 100 for 100 Policy for Production and Productivity (PPP) is one of such interventions designed to fast track productive activities in priority sectors. Under this programme, eligible applicants will be required to submit their applications to their banks, after which, a notification is submitted on a dedicated portal \u2013 https://100for100ppp.ng, which has been created to ensure transparency and allow applicants track the status of their applications.\u201d\n\nCommenting further on the new FX policy being worked on, he said, \u201cIt is being worked on and I can tell. But what we are saying in essence is that you would find a situation where those who will benefit from FX or who would be accorded priority \u2013 everybody will benefit \u2013 but those who would be accorded priority in FX allocation will be those who will embrace our interventions that will help to grow the economy; intervention that will create jobs for our people, not just people who just want to import and export everything- anything they do is import.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe want to see to it that you are conducting business activities that reduce our imports and reduce your level of import, reduces your reliance on raw materials imports. But rather, there would be plants, equipment, spares priority and also ensure that by the time you are in business, the level of import you need will be very minimal, if not entirely zero.\n\n\u201cThose will be the kinds of companies we will accord priority in FX allocation going forward.\u201d\n\nHe said the new framework being fine-tuned would be market-driven and would support companies that accord utmost priority for local production and job creation drive.\n\nThe central bank also said it was working to stimulate non-oil export to boost foreign exchange earnings in the country.\n\nThe CBN governor said though details of the proposed FX policy were still being worked on, FX supply would be mostly allotted for the importation of spares, plants and equipment needed to increase production capacities of local companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the CBN\u2019s real sector intervention drive continued to receive accolades from the federal government.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, while commending Emefiele, described the policy initiative as well thought out, adding that it would significantly impact the economy if well implemented.\n\nMinister for Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, lauded the CBN for spurring economic activities through its various intervention programmes. Ngige noted that while productivity remained crucial for economic growth, the apex bank\u2019s interventions had been key in achieving Buhari\u2019s aspiration to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty.\n\nNgige said the country must take advantage of its growing population to boost the economy. He warned that the country might be sitting on a keg of gunpowder if nothing was done to address youth restiveness through employment generation.\n\nStressing that the Nigerian economy was still not properly diversified, he said without the various CBN interventions, the economy might collapse.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Nigeria facing historic transition, says Obaigbena\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday disclosed that by the time he leaves office on May 29, 2023, he would have bequeathed a home-grown economy, stable democracy as well as revamped security forces to Nigeria.\n\nThis was just as the Chairman of THISDAY/ARISE Media Group, Prince Nduka Obaigbena, said the nation was currently facing unrivalled transition towards the 2023 general polls.\n\nThe president, who spoke at a dinner in honour of the 2022 Committee of Business, Political, Media and Civil Society Leaders, held at the State House, Abuja, pledged his commitment to hand over a strong, repositioned, agriculture-led, diversified, home-grown economy, a stable democracy and revamped armed and security forces to the next administration.\n\nThe president, according to a statement by his Media Adviser, Femi Adesina, said he was looking forward to completing his tenure in 2023, leaving a legacy for a united, peaceful, and prosperous Nigeria with 24 years of uninterrupted democracy.\n\nWhile assuring Nigerians that his administration would finish strong in the last lap of his tenure, the president said: \u201dI am gradually entering my final year in office. It is a period I intend to spend not only on consolidating on the achievements of the past seven years but also to leave a legacy for a united, peaceful, and prosperous Nigeria.\n\n\u201dI take this initiative to mean that you all intend to collaborate with this administration in that direction.\n\n\u201dFor those among you who are politicians, you must look beyond gaining power to how you can leverage public positions in the process of societal change. To the businessmen and women among you, there is great glory in public service.\n\n\u201dThe question that should be uppermost always is: How do we leverage our business endowment for the greater good of our country?\n\n\u201dI am delighted that members of the Nigerian elite have woken up to the fact that the task of changing this society is a task for all of us, whether we are in the private or public sector. Knowing that, we have enormous challenges as a nation, but they are not beyond our capacity to overcome if we embrace a new approach.\n\n\u201dWe cannot retreat to our ethnic cocoons, nor can we continue to seek solace in our past. We must champion the idea of a Nigeria where every citizen would be proud to call their own. That is the charge before you.\u201d\n\nExpressing delight on the new consciousness by the Nigerian elites to work together with the political class and civil society in order to build a better Nigeria, Buhari noted that building consensus around issues of the economy, national security, governance, and such other critical areas of national life is a sure path to the future we seek to build.\n\n\u201dAs we all know, I have been very critical of the Nigerian elites, essentially because some of us have not always demonstrated that we can rise above personal gain, political partisanship as well as ethnic and religious differences when the situation demands that we all speak and or act as one in the interest of our country.\n\n\u201dThere are also many among our elites for whom profit remains the only motivation for any and every enterprise.\n\n\u201dBut now, I feel heartened that a more collaborative social enterprise model for resolving our common challenges is being forged.\n\n\u201dI must commend this initiative and its conveners. This is the kind of spirit I have always advocated because it is what we need at this time as we seek to build our society for peace, security and prosperity through dialogue while narrowing the gap between rich and poor,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the activities of the Committee, the president acknowledged that he was aware that attendance at their inaugural meeting on Sunday cut across a broad section of the society in the public, private sectors, civil society, and the youth.\n\nBuhari, therefore, lauded the group for rising above all ethnic and religious divides for the common good, describing the feat as \u2018\u2018fantastic\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe president, who said he had wished the group had convened earlier, advised them to try and accommodate a few more interests in their next meeting as they take a, \u201ddeeper dive into our national challenges and proffer workable and sustainable solutions for the near, medium, and long term.\u201d\n\n\u201dIt is our desire to finish strong in the next 16 months and ensure all hands are on deck for the last lap. We are doubling our efforts against all forms of insecurity, equipping our armed forces and strengthening the police.\n\n\u201dWe are determined to continue the war against corruption and fight poverty, we remain focused on building an all-inclusive economic opportunity for all citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president told the meeting that despite the enormous problems inherited when he assumed office almost seven years ago, he could look back with satisfaction that this administration has kept faith with the people and has done well even amid dwindling resources for reasons that are well beyond our control.\n\n\u201dBut we probably would have fared even better if we secured the support of most of you that are here today, know that while government comes and goes, the country must remain and thrive.\u201d\n\nBuhari used the occasion to wish politicians, at the dinner, interested in elective positions in the 2023 polls the best, advising that, \u201dthere is nothing better than experience in leadership.\u201d\n\nResponding to concerns raised by Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State on the resurgence of military takeovers in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso in August 2020, September 2021 and January 2022, respectively, the president said he strongly believed that, \u201cNigeria has passed through that stage for good.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the political situation in some West African countries, Fayemi said: \u201dWe believe Nigeria has a manifest destiny to protect democracy not just in Nigeria but also in our region. But in doing that we must ensure that our politicians adhere strictly to constitutional principles and I am happy that our President\u2019s position on leaders seeking third term is well known.\u201d\n\nGiving further insight on the workings of the Committee, Fayemi said Nigerians who benefitted from the country in good time, serving in different capacities, have a duty to support the country.\n\n\u201cWhat the Committee has tried to do is to develop an elite consensus on security and economy, \u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the Committee would take advantage of the president\u2019s consistent leadership, relentless passion and patriotism to ensure a seamless transition, while ensuring that the achievements of this administration are sustained and followed through for the benefit of the country.\n\n\u201cHere we have PDP and APC chieftains and we hope by the time we finish this work, what we will present to the President is void of partisan colorations. It is from people who want Nigerians to succeed,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking, Convener of the Group, Obaigbena said with Nigeria facing a \u201dhistoric transition like no other\u201d, and with crisis across Africa and at home, the 2022 Committee emerged to \u201ddefend the national interest.\u201d\n\nAccording to him: \u201dThe 2022 Committee was put together to defend Nigeria in a time of crisis and in a time of transition, we must defend the national interest,\u2019\u2019 he said, noting that membership of the group were carefully selected from the business community, investors, governors, security sector and elder statesmen.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The people we put in uniform must never be placed in avoidable danger, outgunned or outnumbered by non-state actors.\n\n\u201cIt is when the terrorists are decimated that \u2018soft\u2019, non-kinetic peace building will gain traction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile the security agencies keep trying their best, the peacemakers on the ground should not be discouraged. Peace is worth every effort, despite the setbacks encountered.\n\n\u201cWe continue to emphasise that as a state government, we do not believe that there is any phenomenon like \u2018repentant bandits\u2019.\n\n\u201cAny person that makes a conscious decision to secure arms, challenge the authority of the Nigerian state, and threatens the lives and property of Nigerians does not deserve to live, or be granted any concession by the society.\n\n\u201cThere are no immediate or remote causes to justify terrorist conduct. Those that hide behind these are either ethnic jingoists, religious apologists or fail to recognise that no legitimate government can survive by tolerating terrorists or negotiating with those that menace law-abiding citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs we digest these sad statistics, we pray for the repose of the souls of those killed, pay tribute to the victims of various crimes, reiterate our solidarity with them, and reaffirm our resolve to continue to protect our people, and stop the criminals.\u201d\n\nThe governor also condemned the recent attacks in Zangon-Kataf chiefdom, which he said \u201cappears to be rapidly spilling into the Chawai part of Kauru LGA\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe condemn the disregard for human life and the violations of law that are fuelling the crisis. We sympathise with the affected communities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis outbreak of violence is a serious challenge to the community level peace process initiated by his highness, the Agwam of Zangon Kataf, and community leaders in the area.\u201d",

          "text": "Nasir el-Rufai, governor of Kaduna, has asked the federal government to consider establishing a theatre command for the north-west region.\n\nEl-Rufai spoke on Tuesday at the presentation of the state\u2019s 2021 security report compiled by the ministry of internal security and home affairs.\n\nThe report, presented by Samuel Aruwan, commissioner for internal security and home affairs, showed that 1,192 people were killed, while 3,348 others were kidnapped across the state in 2021.\n\nThe governor, who condemned the attacks recorded in the state, maintained that he doesn\u2019t believe in the idea of \u201crepentant bandits\u201d, adding that anyone who deliberately takes up arms to attack citizens \u201cdoesn\u2019t deserve to live\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe creation of such a theatre command will enable holistic approach to counter insurgent operations across the six affected states and the enhanced coordination of the resources of the armed forces, the police, the SSS, our respective state vigilance services, hunters and other local volunteers to fight the insurgents,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe prerogatives of the state need to be asserted, not merely proclaimed. The people we put in uniform must never be placed in avoidable danger, outgunned or outnumbered by non-state actors.\n\n\u201cIt is when the terrorists are decimated that \u2018soft\u2019, non-kinetic peace building will gain traction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhile the security agencies keep trying their best, the peacemakers on the ground should not be discouraged. Peace is worth every effort, despite the setbacks encountered.\n\n\u201cWe continue to emphasise that as a state government, we do not believe that there is any phenomenon like \u2018repentant bandits\u2019.\n\n\u201cAny person that makes a conscious decision to secure arms, challenge the authority of the Nigerian state, and threatens the lives and property of Nigerians does not deserve to live, or be granted any concession by the society.\n\n\u201cThere are no immediate or remote causes to justify terrorist conduct. Those that hide behind these are either ethnic jingoists, religious apologists or fail to recognise that no legitimate government can survive by tolerating terrorists or negotiating with those that menace law-abiding citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs we digest these sad statistics, we pray for the repose of the souls of those killed, pay tribute to the victims of various crimes, reiterate our solidarity with them, and reaffirm our resolve to continue to protect our people, and stop the criminals.\u201d\n\nThe governor also condemned the recent attacks in Zangon-Kataf chiefdom, which he said \u201cappears to be rapidly spilling into the Chawai part of Kauru LGA\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe condemn the disregard for human life and the violations of law that are fuelling the crisis. We sympathise with the affected communities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis outbreak of violence is a serious challenge to the community level peace process initiated by his highness, the Agwam of Zangon Kataf, and community leaders in the area.\u201d",

          "text": "Globally, cryptocurrency industry funding has been growing increasingly fast in the past couple of years. Last year alone, crypto startups raised over $27 billion in venture capital in 2021 \u2014slightly higher than the past 10 years combined. And just last month, despite a dip in the price of cryptocurrencies, American VC, Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s crypto arm launched a $2.2 billion fund, one of its biggest efforts to fund crypto startups. The firm is reaffirming its commitment to crypto with its third and largest industry specific fund, after investing $850 million last year between 2 rounds of investments. This shows that institutional investors are getting more comfortable in putting their money in crypto\u2014an entirely different experience 4 or 5 years ago.\n\nIn Africa, Web3\u2014powered by crypto, is becoming a large industry, and it is not surprising because Africa is the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world, consequently, investors are pumping money into the industry on the continent.\n\nOn a mission to further deepen crypto adoption in Africa is Nigerian crypto startup Nestcoin which is building out Web3 products. Today, Nestcoin announced that it raised a $6.5 million pre-seed round. Since launching last year, in November, with a promise to \u201chelp Nigerians first, then other Africans, exit the status quo by offering them access to wealth using crypto technology or elements of web 3.0 like NFT, DAOs and DeFi,\u201d Nestcoin has made tremendous progress.\n\nFounded by former Binance director Yele Bademosi and former Bundle Africa CTO, Taiwo Orilogbon, Nestcoin has made good on its promise to create crypto-native products beyond trading and investments, with a focus on driving the adoption of crypto in Africa.\n\nLast year, it launched Breach, a media arm to simplify complex crypto topics to a global audience. It later launched one of Africa\u2019s earliest play-to-earn crypto games, Metaverse Magna (MVM), which it says will allow members of its gaming community to earn as much as $1,000 monthly. It has invested in Lazerpay, a crypto startup that allows businesses to accept payment in crypto, and collaborated with fintech, Bitsika and its music superstar partner Davido to launch the Echoke social token. Nescoin has hinted that it is developing several other products to \u201cprovide compelling use cases for crypto\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are excited that our investors are backing this ambitious plan to create a future where billions of people in frontier markets have access to the opportunities that crypto brings. With this financing, we will continue to grow our diverse team, which already spans 9 countries, expand our product offerings, and invest in more ventures aligned with our vision,\u201d says Nestcoin\u2019s CEO, Yele Bademosi, in a statement.\n\nThe company, which boasts of a global network of investors, had its round led by Distributed Global, Alter Global, Serena Ventures, Alameda Research, and A&T Capital. Other institutional investors include MSA Capital, 4DX Ventures, Raba Capital, Goat.vc, Old Fashion Research, CMT Digital, Electric Capital, Social Capital, CoinFund, gumi Cryptos Capital, DeFi Alliance, among others.\n\nNestcoin, in a statement, says that the new funding will enable it to expand its global operations and invest in building products that will help accelerate crypto adoption and financial freedom for people in frontier markets.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Why did Binance block over 200 accounts in Nigeria?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, a Nigerian Twitter user Joshua Nwogo tweeted that Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange that processes 76 billion worth of transactions daily, had permanently blocked his account for 6 months. Accompanying the tweet were screenshots of his account balance, conversations he\u2019d had with a Binance customer representative, and four hashtags\u2014#boycottbinance #binancestopstealingcrypto #binancestopscamming #stoptradingonbinance\u2014calling the exchange giant a scam and urging other customers to stop using the platform.\n\nThe tweet picked up momentum due to how the supposed Binance representative handled the situation\u2014with cluelessness and threats. Within a few minutes, other disgruntled users had started reporting their own similar experiences with the platform. By Thursday, the matter had escalated and two of the hashtags were sitting on top of the Nigerian Twitter trends table.\n\nSince there was no response yet from Binance throughout Wednesday, people began to conjure different reasons as to why accounts are getting blocked. Some people said the platform is anti-African and is trying to shut the continent out of the cryptocurrency economy; others said the platform is stealing coins from Nigerians because it\u2019s aware the users are helpless as their government won\u2019t intervene.\n\nOn Thursday, Binance, through its Africa operation, made a Twitter thread apologising for inconveniences, assuring users of their commitment, and asking them to fill out a form that would help in tracking and resolving the issues quickly. A few hours later, they announced a YouTube ask-me-anything (AMA) session for the Nigerian community to address the concerns of users regarding account restrictions, user safety, and Binance peer-to-peer (P2P).\n\nAt 11 a.m. on Friday, the session, hosted by Dami Odufuwa, head of public relations at Binance Africa, alongside the Binance Africa community manager Nsikan Benjamin and the company\u2019s Africa Director Emmanuel Babalola, started and lasted for about an hour.\n\nAccording to Babalola, there are 2 reasons an account can be blocked: uncompleted know-your-customer (KYC) registration and detection of fraudulent activities, which he referred to as \u201claw enforcement agencies related issues\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have recorded over 200 cases of blocked accounts and counting, and 30% of them are fraud-related while the rest are a case of [incomplete] KYC,\u201d said Babalola. \u201cWe have started resolving these issues and also sent notifications to those whose cases are law enforcement-related.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKYC means users have to provide some means of identification before they can access some Binance products; their account could be blocked if they continue or try to access these products without completing their KYC.\n\nBut what exactly is a fraudulent activity? How can Binance tell if a transaction is fraudulent after coins have been exchanged across different addresses? And why are they allowing law enforcers into their backend? After all, it\u2019s the big ole crypto, popularly known as a means to escape the inconsistency and prying eyes of centralised financial institutions and their regulator buddies.\n\nThe backstory\n\nTo answer these questions, a little context will suffice. Throughout last year, Binance faced its biggest test: the platform came under aggressive scrutiny from an increasing number of regulators worldwide\u2014from the UK to the US, the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Germany, Cayman Islands, Lithuania, and Hong Kong.\n\nThis was a result of countless concerns over the use of crypto to launder money and how Binance is an unchecked instrument of this activity. While several countries have started investigations into Binance and reduced its activities, others have banned anything that has to do with crypto completely.\n\nNot just countries, banks are also restricting access for crypto exchange as well. In June and July, several banks or payment processors in Europe and the UK, including Barclays, Nationwide, HSBC, and Santander, have subsequently cut off Binance\u2019s access or announced reviews of their approach to crypto at large. Same happened in Nigeria after the central bank ordered banks and financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions in February.\n\nEven though Binance has been making moves to incorporate anti-money laundering (AML) systems into its product since 2019, it seems little success has been achieved. As of today, there are still bad actors scamming and laundering money on the platform.\n\nFor instance, in December last year, Turkey\u2019s financial regulator fined Binance\u2019s Turkish arm $750,000 for non-compliance with AML requirements. Two weeks ago, Pakistan\u2019s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) opened an investigation into a scam that defrauded investors out of over $100 million after hackers redirected the stolen money into 26 wallets registered on Binance.\n\nAll of these and more were reported to be the reason why Binance has chosen to double down its AML compliance and champion the cause of crypto regulation across the world full frontally. Last year it published Why Crypto Needs Regulation: Knowing Your 10 Fundamental Rights and followed it up with an opinion piece by Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder and CEO of Binance, to further explain why regulation is important at this stage of crypto adoption. This is the first time the exchange is openly seeking regulation rather than running away from it or accepting it.\n\nTo answer the question of how Binance can tell if a transaction is fraudulent after coins have been exchanged across different addresses: Binance, like many other big exchanges, now works with different regulators and law enforcement agencies globally to protect users and curb money laundering. Any account trading stolen coins will be instantly flagged for either review or outright blocking. And this explains what happened with the 30% of African users\u2019 accounts\u2014especially Nigerians\u2019\u2014that were blocked. It shows the platform is not only publishing articles but also taking action.\n\n\u201cCentralised exchanges have AML built-in to identify bad coins. Transaction monitoring tools are used and there are a number of companies that provide these tools including CipherTrace, Chainanalysis, and QLUE. Transactions can also be tracked on the blockchain by collaborating and discussing with other centralised exchanges,\u201d Binance Africa told TechCabal.\n\nIt\u2019s now regulatory compliance for centralised exchange to integrate blockchain analytics and monitoring tools that visually track, trace, and monitor illicit crypto activities on their platform. For example, following Binance 2019\u2019s partnership deal with Ciphertrace, the world\u2019s leading provider of cryptocurrency intelligence and blockchain security, to enhance the exchange\u2019s robust AML compliance program, Binance became the first exchange to deploy Traveler, the first commercial product created to help Virtual Asset Services Providers comply with global \u201ctravel rule\u201d regulations, in July 2021.\n\nGlobally, what makes a set of people love the blockchain and crypto concept is exactly what scares and creates distrust in a larger population who haven\u2019t adopted crypto yet: decentralisation and untraceability. Now that centralised exchanges are changing the narrative of the core concept of crypto, will this eliminate distrust, create some level of assurance, and then accelerate adoption or will this push more people away into full-on decentralised wallets and exchanges like MetaMask or a total rejection of crypto?\n\nWe don\u2019t know, as of the time of publication, the exact reason for blocking Joshua Nwogo\u2014one of the persons who started the campaign against the crypto giant and jolted others from their slumber\u2014but, according to the Binance Africa team, it can\u2019t be outside the 2 reasons which are incomplete KYC and detection of fraudulent transaction. But we are monitoring the story closely and will be reporting any new developments.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tiger Global and Greycroft lead $15m Series A round in Nigeria\u2019s Bamboo",
          "text": "Bamboo, an investment platform that allows Nigerians buy and trade US stocks in real-time from their mobile phones or computers, has raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by American venture capital firms Greycroft and Tiger Global. Motley Fool Ventures, Saison Capital, Chrysalis Capital, and Y-Combinator\u2019s Michael Seibel also participated in the round, the company said.\n\nLaunched in January 2020 by CEO Richmond Bassey and COO Yanmo Omorogbe, Bamboo has rapidly grown in popularity with retail investors, claiming over 300,000 accounts in Nigeria. Its users can access all equities available on the US stock exchanges, that is, the stocks of roughly 6,000 companies.\n\n\u201cOur goal is simple: we want to give Africans and their asset managers easy, fast and secure access to global investment options that will allow them to earn real returns,\u201d Bassey said in a statement released Monday.\n\nWith the new funding, Bamboo plans to further accelerate its growth, doubling down on unlocking new markets and launching more products, it said while Bassey told TechCabal in an emailed response that Bamboo will be providing more asset classes and investment opportunities for its users.\n\n\u201cBamboo is enabling Africans to build wealth by creating an investing platform that is helpful to both experienced investors and to those new to the stock market. We are thrilled to support the innovative, user-first approach the Bamboo team is bringing to market,\u201d Greycroft Partner Alison Lange Engel said on the investment.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLast year, the company launched Powered by Bamboo, its API solution that allows asset managers, fintech companies, and other financial institutions to plug into Bamboo\u2019s API to provide their customers access to global securities. The company has been testing the product with a small group of companies and expects to onboard more this year.\n\n\u201cEveryone building for African investors is welcome. We plan to add other products and tools that offer greater access and make global investing simpler from Africa,\u201d Bassey said. \u201cWe\u2019re building the technology infrastructure powering financial services in Africa.\u201d\n\nIn April 2021, Bamboo announced plans to launch in Ghana and has since seen more than 50,000 Ghanaians join the waitlist, according to the company. In the near future, Bamboo plans to expand into more markets such as Kenya and South Africa, Bassey said.\n\nCompared to developed markets such as the United States, investing in stocks is relatively new in Nigeria, and Africa at large. For instance, nearly 75% of Bamboo users have never traded stocks before.\n\nThus, the company has had to put significant effort into educating its users on how to invest and become better investors, using a mix of regular educational content published on its social media, a stock market course, an investment bootcamp, newsletters with investing tips and exclusive value-added services from top investment advisors like The Motley Fool and MyWallSt.\n\nThese efforts appear to pay off, going by Bamboo\u2019s figures. In 2021, repeat depositors made up 85% of deposits on the platform, an indication that Bamboo users are rapidly gaining confidence in trading US stocks.\n\nBut with the US equities market experiencing its worst January in well over a decade\u2014since 2009\u2014how are Bamboo users reacting to the downturn?\n\n\u201cEven though they are new to stock investing, Bamboo users tend to handle their emotions like more seasoned investors,\u201d Bassey said. \u201cWe saw this during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic crash and we\u2019re seeing it again now.\u201d\n\nBamboo allows Nigerians buy and trade US stocks in real-time from their mobile phones or computers.\n\nAfrica\u2019s wealth management market remains largely underdeveloped but holds high potential. According to data cited by Bamboo, Africans account for over 16% of the world\u2019s population, yet they own less than 1% of global wealth.\n\nBut that is expected to change over the next decade, with private wealth in the continent expected to increase by 30% to reach $2.6 trillion by 2030, according to AfrAsia Bank.\n\nBassey is upbeat platforms like Bamboo will play a major role in realising the projected growth, by helping to develop an investing culture among Africans.\n\n\u201cWe think investing in stocks has a bright future in Nigeria. Nigerians are hungry to earn a return on their investments and build wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bullish on platforms such as ours in bringing more Nigerians into the world of investing.\u201d\n\nWithout revealing many details, Bamboo says in the statement it plans to make it seamless for African investors in the diaspora to discover the best investment opportunities on the continent.\n\nIn August, Nigeria\u2019s central bank received court approval to freeze the bank accounts of Bamboo and other similar Nigerian fintech platforms for a six-month period. However, Bassey confirmed the company received a court order unfreezing its accounts. \u201cAll have been unfrozen now,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?",
          "text": "Do you need a guide for all the big tech terms people are throwing about on the internet? What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?\n\nOver the past couple of years, there\u2019s been an influx of words that explain certain tech concepts. Some of them like crypto, or even NFTs, have been around for a while. In fact, NFT\u2014as a word\u2014was first used in 2014 and now, 7 years later, it\u2019s still a concept that escapes a lot of us. Others like DeFi or DAOs are fairly new, but they\u2019re still getting thrown around a lot.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new or old to tech, reading about concepts can feel like learning a new language. So TechCabal is creating a guide\u2014short explainers\u2014for common tech terms. In this, you\u2019re sure to find simple short explanations that can help you understand NiFTy concepts.\n\n1. Blockchain\n\nA few of the concepts we\u2019ll explain here are based on blockchain so it\u2019s important this goes first.\n\nBlockchain is a record-keeping tech that\u2019s designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it.\n\nHow it works: Standard databases store data in rows, columns and files, but blockchain stores data in blocks that are chained together. The data on the blocks are continuously updated, encrypted, and stored on several computers so there\u2019s no single computer to hack or control the data from.\n\nIn explaining blockchain, Buchi Okoro\u2014CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax\u2014said: \u201cImagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain. With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. The software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.\u201d\n\n2. Cryptocurrency\n\nImage source: Aceris Law\n\nWe all know what currencies are\u2014dollars, pounds, shillings. Well, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. You can\u2019t hold it the way you\u2019d hold fiat currencies like CFA coins or naira notes, but you can still spend it on things you love.\n\nHow it works: Cryptos are digital currencies created on blockchain technology. If you got a sense of what blockchains are, then you\u2019ll understand what we mean when we say that cryptocurrencies are decentralised; no one person or government controls them. They are created by algorithms and used to award engineers\u2014called miners\u2014who carry out maintenance on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies which derive their value and validity from states, cryptocurrencies derive their value and validity from the blockchain.\n\n3. Non-fungible token (NFT)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its mushroom-sounding title, NFTs are in fact inedible, even the NFT flavours. NFTs are unique digital assets created on a blockchain.\n\nHow it works: To put it simply, NFTs are digital works that exist on blockchain. They can be images, sounds, game skins, or even clothes for your digital avatars. These digital works are impossible to duplicate or forge; they\u2019re one of a kind and that makes them valuable. If you\u2019re asking yourself why a screenshot of an NFT isn\u2019t as valuable, it\u2019s because NFTs have been embedded with code which is what makes them exist on the blockchain.\n\nThink of it this way, when you go to a museum and take photos of artefacts, what you have is just a photo which isn\u2019t quite valuable. The museum still has the original valuable artefact.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with NFTs. We can take screenshots of Niyi Okeowo\u2019s $2,800 Indigo Child (below) but it doesn\u2019t mean we own the asset. The original copy\u2014the property rights and certificate of authenticity\u2014belong to the buyer.\n\nNiyi Okeowo\u2019s \u201cIndigo Child\u201d\n\n4. Web3\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen tech bros throw the word \u201cWeb3\u201d around a lot. It\u2019s the answer experts give to questions from \u201cWhat is the future of the internet?\u201d to \u201cWhat does Spiderman navigate the internet with?\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is Web3? To put it simply, Web3 is taking democracy to the internet.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Web3\u2019s ancestors, Web1 and Web2, so we can understand what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWeb1 was the earliest version of the internet, which existed between the 1900s and the early 2000s. In this version, content was delivered via texts and graphics to users who could only consume the content but not interact with it.\n\nWeb2 is what we have now, an interactive and social web where companies can build revolutionary apps that allow users to become creators. It\u2019s centralised, i.e. controlled by companies or governments who can decide when websites, apps or content can be taken down with little input from users.\n\nOn Web2, apps are only available for as long as the company that owns them decides. Streaming sites can shut down, online games can upload patches users don\u2019t like (yes, I\u2019m looking at you Riot Games), and traditional banks can freeze bank accounts when the government demands it.\n\nHow Web3 works: Web3 will be built on the blockchain working independently from different parts of the world.\n\nOn Web3, decisions regarding the design and operation of products and funds\u2014including crypto\u2014will be made by communities of people called Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and not governments or companies. So if you find an app or product you like, you can join the DAO of that product, buy shares and vote on which changes should be made.\n\nFor example, if you joined TechCabal\u2019s DAO, you\u2019ll get to decide how we upgrade or downgrade depending on how much shares you have in the DAO.\n\n5. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are social communities that will create rules and regulations which will be embedded in programming codes.\n\nHow it works: Unlike conventional organisations like TechCabal, which have managers and boards of directors that govern it, DAOs are governed by communities\u2014who don\u2019t have to be developers of the product. DAOs are created by developers who decide on a set of rules and embed it in\u2014digital contracts on blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe communities decide what happens to the products attached to that DAO, what upgrades to make and when to make it. Each DAO will have its own token which will be sold to its community members, and the more tokens you have, the heavier your stake and voting rights.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2017, Nigeria\u2019s Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbanjo, signed two bills into law: the Secured Transactions in Movable Assets Acts (Collateral Registry Act), 2017 and the Credit Reporting Act, 2017.\n\nFor Bayode*, a struggling painter in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State, this meant that he could register his movable assets \u2014 like his Toyota Lexus 2009 or his secondhand Syinix Single Door Fridge \u2014 on the National Collateral Registry as collateral to secure loans from banks and other financial institutions.\n\nIt also meant that because of the Credit Reporting Act, if he had previously taken a loan from any lending institution, his information would be available to serve as credit history for him in subsequent loan applications.\n\nA year later, in 2018, Techpoint Africa found that the Credit Reporting Act was already being implemented, although not in real-time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssentially, like so many laws before them, the two laws were not solving the problem they were meant to \u2014 helping to provide credit history information for banks and lending institutions while improving the credit score of the average Nigerian.\n\nWith its data-driven lending management platform, Nigerian fintech, Indicina is trying to solve this problem.\n\nEnter Indicina\n\nAfter her stint at First Bank leading the strategy department, Yvonne Johnson, Indicina Co-founder and CEO, thought it was time to step back and solve the consumer lending gap challenge in Nigeria.\n\nWith a degree in computer science and mathematics from the University of Toronto and a belief that technology is a powerful tool to solve this market\u2019s biggest financial challenges, she founded Indicina in 2018 with her Co-founder, Yemi Ajao.\n\nIndicina uses a data-driven approach to help lending institutions provide credit underwriting at scale. Using artificial intelligence, the company gives insights on future customers and de-risking unsecured loans. This also empowers lenders to drive new uses of data beyond predicting default, for example, managing churn, and marketing campaigns, among others.\n\nAccording to Johnson, \u201cIndicina does not have a balance sheet or compete on lending. We offer API-driven software to digitise the lending business. Our flagship product, Originate, is an analytics-driven approach to lending. It empowers clients to unpack the credit value chain and digitise each step, including identity verification, credit decisioning/analytics, and disbursements and collections.\u201d\n\nEmploying a Software as a service (SaaS) model, the company makes its money by providing B2B2C solutions to lending institutions \u2014 bank and non-bank. From what Johnson tells us, this enables wider distribution by allowing for a more cost-effective adoption of their technology.\n\nBut what separates Indicina from competitors?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIndicina\u2019s competitive advantage is a deep understanding of the financial services industry across key emerging markets \u2013 LatAm, Africa, and Asia. We understand the business of credit and how technology \u2013 specifically end-to-end credit journeys \u2013 can drive the profitability of consumer loan portfolios.\n\n\u201cInnovation has placed demands on traditional lending business models. How do you expand consumer credit to under-/unbanked populations in a prudent manner while shortening time-to-decision? Taking a cue from FinTechs, leading banks have embraced the digital-lending revolution, bringing \u201ctime to yes\u201d down to five minutes, and time to cash to less than 24 hours.\u201d\n\nWith Indicina\u2019s API that gives lending institutions access to this essential data, Johnson believes their business model is quite solid. According to her, for most of the company\u2019s customers, this is the first time they are integrating machine learning tools in their stack.\n\nSticking through the thorns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYvonne Johnson, CEO and Co-founder, Indicina. Source: Supplied\n\nThe flip side of having newbie customers is client education.\n\n\u201cClient education (on the development and proper use of AI within banking) is a hurdle we have to cross.\n\n\u201cThis includes the readiness of their technology infrastructure to deploy our solution. Fortunately, executives in this particular industry have shown to be very conscious about these problems, and we are seeing stronger commitment toward improvements. It\u2019s the only way to become a data-driven business.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the critical factor of a solid and vision-oriented team.\n\n\u201cThe founding team worked very closely on product strategy and execution in the initial phase of our journey. This was very important in confirming our theory around market demand. It helped that each of us had a strong product mind. Once we achieved a certain level of traction, we then expanded the engineering and data science teams.\u201d\n\nSo far, all of this has paid off, with the company serving over 50 different customers, covering banks, non-bank lenders, and startups.\n\nWhat the future looks like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tumisu on Pixabay\n\nAt the heart of Indicina\u2019s vision is equipping anyone building a digital financial services product with cutting-edge infrastructure so that they can reach a broader set of customers.\n\n\u201cEffective economic inclusion goes beyond customer onboarding. Identifying the right product at the point of need means end customers get real value.\n\n\u201cA thriving consumer credit industry is a powerful catalyst for economic inclusion on the continent. Indicina wants to provide the analytics infrastructure that will enable consumer credit at scale.\u201d\n\nWith teams in the US, UK, Nigeria, and Kenya, Indicina plans to expand into East African countries, Uganda and Kenya in the third quarter of 2022.\n\n*Fictional person\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture capital activity in the global Web3, crypto, and blockchain space last year was massive. While interest in the space has increased steadily since 2012, 2021 holds the record for biggest investments to date.\n\nAccording to a Galaxy Digital Report, VCs invested more in crypto startups in 2021 than in the last seven years combined. Investments were estimated to be $33 billion, 67% of which were in rounds larger than $100 million.\n\nThe largest portion of the funding \u2014 41.83% \u2014 went to crypto startups offering trading, investing, and exchange services. Web3, NFT, and metaverse-related startups were a distant second with 17% of the funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Investments in crypto-related startups in 2021. Source: Galaxy Digital\n\nThis year could be a big year for Web3 startups, especially in Africa, with the announcement of Nestcoin\u2019s $6.45 million pre-seed round. The startup, focused on creating and investing in Web3 and crypto-focused products, announced the raise today, February 1, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPan African venture capital firm 4DX Ventures backed the funding round with participation from Serena Ventures, launched by world-renowned American athlete, Serena Williams, among other investors.\n\nThere was also an array of crypto and blockchain-focused VCs such as New York-headquartered CoinFund, which has investments in the popular NFT marketplace, Rarible, and Polkadot, one of the biggest blockchain networks. Blockchain and cryptographic asset fund, gumi Cryptos Capital, also invested in Nestcoin\u2019s pre-seed.\n\nThis pre-seed funding comes three months after Nestcoin\u2019s official launch in November 2021. The investment will be used to accelerate its mission of driving adoption and helping Africans create wealth through crypto.\n\nFounded by Yele Bademosi (CEO) and Taiwo Orilogbon (CTO), Nestcoin is the duo\u2019s latest venture after they exited crypto and cash payments startup, Bundle Africa, in July 2021.\n\nBademosi wrote in a blog post that he was taking a step back to \u201cexplore other areas that need more support in the African crypto community beyond traditional buy-and-sell currency trading.\u201d\n\nBademosi told Techpoint Africa that the idea for Nestcoin had been brewing as far back as 2017, even before the launch of Bundle. He had always been fascinated by blockchain and wanted more Africans to understand the tech and the several ways they could benefit from it.\n\nBreach and Metaverse Magna record growth\n\nNestcoin launched Breach \u2014 its first product \u2014 in November 2021. Breach is a media platform focusing on simplifying crypto and blockchain concepts for a global audience. According to Bademosi, almost 6,000 people have subscribed to Breach\u2019s newsletter since November.\n\nThe launch of Breach was followed by Metaverse Magna (MVM), a platform that provides anyone with the right skill set to make money with play-to-earn games on the metaverse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt provides assets for Axie Infinity, one of the most popular metaverse gaming platforms. Players on the platform can earn over $1,000 monthly. However, the assets required to play on the platform are expensive.\n\nMVM provides these assets for free while a percentage of the players\u2019 earnings is deducted. It currently has 400 active players and a community of almost 10,000 people.\n\nIn the time Nestcoin has been operational, it has been fulfilling its mission to improve lives with crypto and Web3.\n\nBedemosi told Techpoint Africa that apart from the growing number of users and participants, an \u201cimportant measure of the impact of Breach and MVM is the comments we get from our community every day. People tell us all the time that they wish they\u2019d encountered our products earlier in their crypto journey.\u201d\n\nThe argument about Web3\n\nWhile Nestcoin plans to improve lives with Web3, some people like Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, believe the idea of a third-generation Internet is just another marketing buzzword that helps VCs make money.\n\nWeb3, which means the third generation of the Internet, promises a decentralised system of ownership on the Internet. Instead of big corporations like Meta and Google owning a large percentage of data (and money), ownership will be shared with everyone on Web3. However, Jack Dorsey, ex-Twitter CEO, and Musk believe it\u2019s just a concept created by VCs to own more of the Internet.\n\nYou don\u2019t own \u201cweb3.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe VCs and their LPs do. It will never escape their incentives. It\u2019s ultimately a centralized entity with a different label.\n\n\n\nKnow what you\u2019re getting into\u2026 \u2014 jack\u26a1\ufe0f (@jack) December 21, 2021\n\nVCs such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) have invested up to $3 billion in the space, including NFT marketplace OpenSea, where inside trading activities by some executives were uncovered last year.\n\nBademosi, however, maintains that Web3 has the potential to create a more equitable world.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Web3 technology will create access to more economic opportunities for people in frontier markets.\u201d\n\nHe added that the challenge Nestcoin has faced so far with Web3 is deciding which opportunities to explore as there are so many within the space. Aside from creating Breach and MVM, Nestcoin has also invested in crypto payments startups, Lazerpay, and, recently, AltSchool.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done all these in such a short time. Imagine how much more we\u2019ll do in the coming months and years,\u201d Bademosi says.\n\nDecentralised finance (DeFi) and a digital art platform could be the next products for Nestcoin. But Bademosi hints that crypto-native solutions in the payments and social spaces are in the works while they improve on current products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "Techpoint Pitchstorm alumnus, AltSchool Africa raises $1m pre-seed to plug Africa\u2019s shortage of entry-level talent",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past few years, the focus on tech talent development in Africa has shifted from training entry-level talent to training senior talent. Also, the inability of the local education system to provide competent engineering talent has led to a gap in the market for entry-level talent. AltSchool Africa understands this and has raised $1 million in pre-seed funding for this purpose.\n\nThe round has Nigerian entertainer, Folarin Falana (Falz); Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga GB Agboola; Paystack Founder Shola Akinlade; Nigerian musician and rapper, Akitoye Balogun (Ajebutter); Pledges, Nestcoin, and ODBA VC, as investors.\n\nAltSchool launched in October 2021 with a simple mission to provide an education that equips students with skills and a certificate, all within a year. This led to a partnership with the Michael and Cecilia Ibru University. Under this partnership, graduates of the programme get a diploma certificate at the end. To achieve this, AltSchool tutors participants for nine months, followed by a three-month internship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian entertainer, Folarin Falana (Falz) (middle) was one of the startup\u2019s investors\n\nIts launch was met with significant support and excitement from the local tech ecosystem, with several individuals paying the application fee for interested participants. That support has resulted in over 8,000 enrollments from over 20 countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, and Botswana.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike most startups focused on providing tech skills, it adopts an income-sharing model where students do not have to pay for the tuition until they get a job. However, they have to pay an application fee of \u20a610,000 ($20).\n\nFollowing this fresh injection of capital, the Techpoint Pitchstorm alumnus will focus on content, growth, and building its technology, starting with its learning management system (LMS). Adewale Yusuf (CEO) discloses that the startup will launch its Schools of Product, Data, and Blockchain in Q2 2022.\n\nWhen these schools launch, they will offer courses in product design, product management, and product marketing, amongst others. AltSchool\u2019s School of Engineering currently runs three courses: frontend engineering, backend engineering, and cloud engineering.\n\nGraduates will need to work on real-world projects to gain practical experience, and AltSchool offers an internship to its students. Yusuf reveals that AltSchool already has startups willing to take on AltSchool graduates as interns, although he declined to mention them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve signed up some of the best startups on the market, and that\u2019s one of the most exciting things about what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian musician and rapper Ajebutter (seated) with CEO Adewale Yusuf\n\nAs African startups have witnessed massive growth in the past few years, the demand for competent software engineers has risen. However, from an initial focus on building a pipeline of technical talents, much of the conversation now borders on how to get more senior talents.\n\nA side effect of this is that less attention is paid to entry-level talent. Consequently, startups on the continent have a hard time finding entry-level talent. Fortunately, startups like AltSchool, Gebeya, and Decagon ensure a somewhat steady supply of talent for the ecosystem.\n\nIn 2014, Andela, arguably the pioneer for software engineering training, was launched. In addition to training participants, it also placed them in jobs with partner companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe model looked to be paying off, but a demand for more senior engineering talents caused the company to re-evaluate its business model. In the process, it gradually laid off junior developers on its payroll before transitioning to a talent outsourcing company.\n\nSo, why is AltSchool working on training entry-level talent when more established players are focusing on senior engineers? As Yusuf rightly points out, you can\u2019t have senior engineers without junior engineers.\n\nAs more companies are founded in Africa, and the competition for talent increasingly gets global, more engineering talent will be needed. However, to keep up with demand, more startups like AltSchool will be needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

That is why I personally appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari when it became clear that he was in the process of creating six more colleges of education. For us, we were very specific that we wanted a college of education that will train teachers in technical subjects because that aligns with our plans as a government.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to retool the educational system of this country and Edo State. Today, we can proudly say that we have started an educational revolution in Edo. The children being produced from our basic educational system today, in terms of literacy, almost peer with their mates globally and the records are there.\u201d\n\nAssuring the NCCE delegation on the government\u2019s commitment to ensure the school kicks off academic activities despite the antics of some detractors, Obaseki noted, \u201cThat school was shut down five years ago; it was shut down for us to start a university. The same trouble that led to the shutdown of that school is what they are trying to make with this new one. They frustrated the school for making progress and they want to frustrate this school too from making progress.\n\n\u201cThey are claiming what they didn\u2019t work for because we have set up our own state college of education. When we built our own school, they said we should absorb them into our new school.\n\n\u201cDuring my reelection, they were acting as active politicians, but we cannot sacrifice the future of our children for their selfish gains. They claimed that we owe them, but it is not true. Till tomorrow, they cannot give you the evidence of the school fees they have collected, but we can show you the evidence of subversions we have put in the school.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThey have tried to go to court; they\u2019ve done a lot of publications, and now it\u2019s just blackmailing and as a government, we won\u2019t subject ourselves to blackmails. Even yesterday, they wrote me a letter of apology. But they\u2019ve gone back, front, left, right, and centre. But as a government, we remain focused. We know where we are going and if they have legitimate claims by now they would have gone to court to get court orders.\n\n\u201cWhy have they not opted for that option? Why are they going to barricade the road and embarrass people who want to inspect the facilities? For us, I think this is a politically-motivated action and I don\u2019t think it has a legal basis to stop what we want to do.\n\n\u201cIf they feel they\u2019ve been disenfranchised; they should go to court. We, as a government, will always obey court orders. So, whatever cooperation you need from me, we will give you. We\u2019ve fought tough political battles; hence, this one is a joke. We\u2019ve brought godfathers down and if the godfathers have gone back to mobilize them, they are just joking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t stop the education and future of our children. We will provide whatever support and cooperation that the federal government needs to ensure that this school can be opened to enable us to begin to train our teachers,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the Secretary of NCCE, Prof. Paulinus Okwelle, expressed appreciation to the governor for providing infrastructure for the take-off of the school.\n\nHe added: \u201cOnce again, we congratulate you for attracting this new federal institution to Edo. In 2019, President Buhari approved six colleges of education in each zone and the one in Ekiadolor to serve the South-South. We\u2019ve gone round the site of the college and discovered a lot of good things and we must appreciate your efforts.\u201d.\n\n...",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday in Abuja launched a N62billion Trust Fund to help Nigeria end AIDS as a public health threat and place more people living with HIV on treatment annually.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria (HTFN), the President in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, pledged that his administration would continue to prioritise health interventions to address killer diseases and public health emergencies.\n\n\u201dAt the last United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS, I made a call for a renewed global action to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.\n\n\u201dEnding AIDS as a public health threat in Nigeria will require increased domestic funding. We have continued to make good our commitment of placing more people living with HIV on treatment annually using national resources.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201dHowever, strong domestic resource mobilization with an enduring partnership and shared responsibility is required to sustain the response to HIV and other emerging public health emergencies,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari noted that Nigeria\u2019s purposeful partnership with the private sector in the response to COVID-19 pandemic had provided a readily available financing solution to leverage on to sustain the HIV response.\n\nHe commended the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) and the Nigeria Business Coalition Against AIDS for their efforts in establishing the HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria to secure a generation of babies free of HIV.\n\nHe also expressed delight with the attendance in person of notable global key players in HIV response and from the private sector at the event and the pledges made.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201dGoing forward, I hope The HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria will galvanize more of the private sector and other partners to surpass the target of Sixty-Two Billion Naira in the next five years,\u201d the President added.\n\nIn his remarks, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, announced that since 2005, about $6.2 billion has been spent on HIV response in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dAbout 80 per cent of the funds were contributed by external donors, mainly the US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Private Sector contributed 0.1 per cent to 2 per cent of total funds with the rest of funds provided by the Nigerian government,\u201d Mustapha said.\n\nAcknowledging NACA\u2019s efforts to promote resource mobilisation to complement existing external support, Mustapha said the Federal Government has sustained the treatment and financing of 50,000 PLHIV annually.\n\nHe said the launch of the HTFN will guarantee funding from the private sector-led resources for HIV interventions especially for the elimination of the Mother-to-Child transmission of the virus.\n\n\u201dSince 2005, about 6.2 billion dollars has been spent on HIV response in Nigeria about 80 per cent of the funds were contributed by external donors mainly the US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Private Sector contributed 0.1 per cent to 2 per cent of total funds with the rest of funds provided by the Nigerian government,\u201d SGF added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChief launcher and chairman/CEO of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, said the mission of the private sector-led fund proposed by NACA alongside the Nigeria Business Coalition Against AIDS (NiBUCAA) was to ensure mobilisation of resources towards eradication of AIDS in Nigeria, starting with the prevention of Mother-to-Child transmission of the virus.\n\n\u201dI am reminded that we have 2 million of our compatriots living with HIV/AIDS and it is our collective responsibility to bring this number down to zero,\u201d the business mogul said.\n\nDangote, who is Africa\u2019s richest man, appealed to individuals and corporate organisations in the country to donate generously toward the Fund, currently chaired by Dr Herbert Wigwe, the Group Managing Director of Access Bank Plc.\n\n\u201dWe would like the private sector to work in partnership with the Federal Government on a 50-50 basis which we believe will help us eliminate Mother-to-Child transmission of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the Director-General of NACA. Dr Gambo Aliyu, thanked the President for his commitment and support for the HIV response in the country, noting that as a direct result of his intervention, NACA now procures HIV commodities at manufacturers\u2019 rate, as a result of which more Nigerians living with HIV have been placed on treatment from domestic resources.\n\nHe said within the last 3 years, the agency has identified and placed on treatment an additional 900,000 persons living with HIV, bringing the total number of Nigerians on HIV treatment to 1.7 million.\n\n\u201dThis unprecedented feat puts Nigeria on a fast-track lane to control HIV spread by 2023.\n\n\u201dHowever, despite these achievements, our national coverage of prevention of mother to child transmission is less than 50%, leading to about 22,000 cases of mother-to-child transmission of HIV every year in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nJustifying the need for the Fund, the Director-General said providing life-long treatment to all PLHIV even after successfully stopping new HIV infections would require a domestically sustainable financing mechanism",

As you are well aware, Senator George Akume served two terms (eight years) as elected Governor of Benue State, three terms (12 years) as Senator representing Benue North-West Senatorial District, during which he served as Senate Minority Leader. Since the second term of President Muhammadu Buhari, Senator George Akume has been the Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, a position for which he was screened and cleared by the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, before assuming office.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOver the span of more than 23 years, Senator George Akume has never been invited for questioning by any corruption agency. In any case, the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria allows even an accused person to be presumed innocent until found guilty, how much more of Senator George Akume who has not even been accused of any offense.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that since our principal started the race for National Chairmanship of APC, everything has been done by his opponents to find faults with him, but to no avail. This is because it has become very clear that Senator George Akume is the candidate to beat in the race for the National Chairmanship of our great party, APC.\n\n\u201cIf elected the next National Chairman of APC, Senator George Akume commits to respecting the Nigerian and APC Constitutions as well as all party organs and officials.\n\n\u201cSenator George Akume is very passionate about taking the APC to the next sustainable level of progress.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, the Contact Committee has also welcomed what it called growing nationwide consensus steadily building up in favour of its principal.\n\nIn a statement signed by the chairman of SGACC Tuesday in Abuja, Chief Shango urged the party members and leaders across Nigeria to embrace the aspiration of Senator Akume by supporting him to become the APC national chairmanship.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThere is the endorsement of Senator George Akume by the Northern APC National Front as signed by its Convener and spokesperson, Mallam Ayuba Hassan. Other vital endorsements are by the Igbo Youth Assembly signed by its National Chairman, Mr Nwaudunna; the Igbo Youth Assembly Worldwide, signed by its National Secretary Casmir Irekanba and the National Publicity Secretary, Comrade Chidi Chilo. Other endorsements came from General Lawrence Anebi Onoja (rtd) former Military Governor of Katsina and Plateau States and the Benue Amazon Prime, a women group of the All Progressives Congress in Benue State.\n\n\u201cAkume Contact Committee which is made up of former APC Governors, Ministers, Senators, Academicians and top Journalists, believes that Akume stands tall among other aspirants in the race for APC National Chairmanship, based on his credentials and support amongst all interest groups in the party.\n\n\u201cWe wish to emphasise that when elected APC National Chairman, Senator George Akume will uphold the party\u2019s constitution as well as respect its organs and officials.\u201d",

          "text": "Guinea-Bissau\u2019s President Umaro Sissoco Embalo survived an attempted coup on Tuesday and suggested that the plotters may have been linked to drug trafficking.\n\nEarlier, heavy gunfire rang out near a government compound where Embalo had been chairing a cabinet meeting.\n\nThe situation was unclear for several hours, during which the African Union and West African bloc ECOWAS condemned what they called \u201can attempted coup\u201d.\n\nEmbalo said many members of the security forces had been killed repelling the attack on democracy.\n\nThe fast-moving events in the former Portuguese colony came just over a week after the military in Burkina Faso, another country in the region, deposed the president there.\n\nAppearing in the evening in a video posted on the Guinea-Bissau presidency\u2019s Facebook page, Embalo said attackers had tried to enter the compound just after the cabinet meeting but had been repelled.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a coup. It was an attempt to kill the president, the prime minister and all the cabinet,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the attack \u201cwas well prepared and organised and could also be related to people involved in drug trafficking\u201d, giving no further details.\n\nPoverty-stricken Guinea-Bissau is viewed by the United Nations as a major waypoint for Latin American cocaine headed for Europe.\n\nU.S. and European authorities have long suspected that some in the country\u2019s military are involved in the drug trade.\n\nEmbalo, who had enjoyed strong support from the military during a previous political crisis, suggested in his video that the army was not involved in Tuesday\u2019s attack.\n\n\u201cI can assure you that no camp joined this attempted coup. It was isolated. It is linked to people we have fought against,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\n\nHe said arrests had begun of people involved, but he did not know how many.\n\n\u2018COUP CONTAGION\u2019\n\nPortugal\u2019s President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said on his official website he had spoken to Embalo by telephone and had \u201cconveyed his vehement condemnation \u2026 of these attacks against the constitutional order of Guinea-Bissau\u201d.\n\nPrior to Embalo\u2019s video, the African Union had said some government members were being detained and had called on the military to release them, without giving details.\n\nPolitical instability has blighted Guinea-Bissau for decades, with nine previous coups or attempted coups since independence in 1974.\n\nDuring the hours of confusion on Tuesday, the Portuguese embassy had urged its citizens in Guinea-Bissau to stay at home while U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by what was going on in the capital Bissau.\n\nEmbalo had begun chairing an extraordinary cabinet meeting at around 10 a.m., entering the government palace with a heavy security detail, a diplomatic source said. While he was present in the building, gunfire began outside.\n\nThe cabinet meeting was being held to prepare for a forthcoming ECOWAS summit in response to last week\u2019s military takeover in Burkina Faso, the latest in a rash of coups across the region in the last 18 months.\n\n\u201cIt looks increasingly hard to argue against the idea of coup contagion,\u201d said Eric Humphrey-Smith, an analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft.\n\n\u201cWhen added to successful coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Chad in the past year, there is no doubt that West African leaders are nervously looking over their shoulders.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\nA bill seeking to make the annual payment of rent illegal in the Federal Capital Territory has scaled second reading in the Senate.\n\nTagged: \u201cA Bill for the Regulation of Advanced Rent on Residential Apartments, Office Space\u201d was sponsored by Senator Smart Adeyemi (Kogi West).\n\nThe lawmaker, in his lead debate on the general principles, said the bill seeks to regulate the mode of payment of rent on residential apartments, office space, rooms and accommodation in the FCT.\n\nAccording to him, the move by the chamber to regulate the payment of rents in the FCT stemmed from the obligation of its constitutional responsibilities, aimed at impacting the lives of residents.\n\n\u201cIf passed, this Bill will improve the well- being and standard of living of residents and minimize corruption and immorality emanating from the oppressive tenancy system in the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cThis Bill will make life less stressful and less painful for majority of the down-trodden and low income earners in the Federal Territory\u201d, Adeyemi said.\n\nHe explained further that due to global economic recession, life has become very challenging and almost unbearable for the low income earners despite the huge palliative measures by the Federal Government through the N-POWER traders money.\n\nHe noted that in the FCT, Landlords demand between one to three years advanced rent, a situation which he pointed, \u201cautomatically adds a huge burden on the masses, subsequently giving rise to desperation and corruption.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that the \u201ctenancy system has continuously impoverished Nigerians who are salaried employees that can only pay rent after haven received their first remuneration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis tenancy system is unafrican, unislamic and indeed unbiblical\u201d, the lawmaker added.\n\nAdeyemi expressed concern that many residents of the FCT are finding it difficult to cope with huge rent payment, adding that, \u201cmany houses built within the city center for such purposes are empty.\u201d\n\nHe said that yearly tenancy has continued to breed corruption, moral decadence and huge inequality as low income earners who cannot afford to continually pay their rent.\n\nAccording to him, some tenants now engage in corrupt practices, immorality, and even criminal acts to meet the pressing need of shelter.\n\nHe underscored the need for Legislation aimed towards justice, fairness, equity and improved standard of living.\n\nHe noted that in the FCT, a single one room apartment ranges from one million (N1,000,000) Naira to two million (N2,000,000) Naira within the city.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, in the satellite towns such as Kubwa, Nyanya, Kuje, Lugbe, rents are still not affordable for the common man as it ranges from Three hundred and fifty thousand naira (N350,000.00) to Five Hundred thousand naira (N500,000.00).\n\nHe stated that the bill, therefore, seeks to reduce advance payment for new tenants to three months and, thereafter, proceed with the monthly payment scheme.\n\n\u201cIt also seeks to protect low income earners from any form of oppression by homeowners.\n\n\u201cThe bill also seeks to provide a window for legal action for any form of oppression.\n\n\u201cImportantly, it will also serve as a safety net for Landlords against erring tenants\u201d, he added.\n\nContributing to the debate, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, while supporting the bill, described the piece of legislation as \u201cpeople-centered.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe truth is out there, many residents in the FCT are groaning under this very difficult system where people are expected to pay house rent in advance.\n\n\u201cWith the policy where government has withdrawn participation in providing official quarters with demonetization, we are all aware, young Nigerians who are gaining employment within the precinct of the FCT for example, majority of them are actually in the outskirts.\n\n\u201cThis is because it is extremely difficult for most of these young Nigerians to get the quantum of money that represent two years rent\u201d\n\nThe Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, who presided over plenary, described the bill as \u201cpopular\u201d owing to the number of Nigerians who have showed interest in it.\n\nHowever, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani (Enugu East), a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Senator and the only lawmaker in the chamber who spoke against the bill, argued the issue of rent payment should be driven by market forces.\n\n\u201cThe issue of rental payment, either in advance or installments is purely economical and should be driven by market forces.\n\n\u201cSuch market forces as availability of land, cost of

Nevertheless, we remain committed to honoring our promises,\u201d Buhari was quoted as saying in a statement issued by his spokesman, Femi Adesina.\n\n\u201cFor their part, I would like to encourage ASUU to continue to work with us towards finding resolutions to the challenges that confront us.\n\n\u201cMy administration is committed to this engagement and dialogue, and I urge them to stay the course towards a joint resolution in the best interest of our children and nation.\u201d\n\nBuhari also responded to the issued raised by NIREC on finding sustainable solutions to the perennial and disruptive strikes that threaten the sanctity and integrity of the nation\u2019s university system.\n\nAccording to him, he had directed his Chief of Staff, the Honourable Ministers of Labour and Employment and Education to make resolving this issue a priority.\n\nThe President said he had received briefing from the Minister of Labour, detailing where we are today given the various interested parties, and he apprised the meeting as follows:\n\nHe added, \u201c\u2019To show our commitment, several payments have been made over the last 6 months, addressing several of the issues you raised \u2013 details of which the Minister of Labour and Employment can make available to you.\n\n\u201c\u2019Funding has also been provided for infrastructure development across several public universities and several of them have begun drawing down on this facility to improve their level of infrastructure.\n\n\u201cFinally, and perhaps the most contentious of issues regarding the decision to use either the Integrated Payroll and Personal Information System (IPPIS) or the University Transparency Accountability Solutions (UTAS).\n\n\u201cAs you may be aware, IPPIS was introduced as a means of blocking leakages.

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has insisted that the administration of his predecessor, Rotimi Amaechi, abandoned a jet belonging to the state in Germany.\n\nHe also rejected claims by officials of the Amaechi administration that handover notes were left for his government and that he had pushed the state into debt.\n\nThe governor spoke about the state-owned aircraft and other issues at a stakeholders\u2019 meeting in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital on Tuesday.\n\nHe was reacting to comments attributed to a former Transport Commissioner in Rivers State, Tolofari George.\n\nThe former transport commissioner in the state was quoted to have accused Governor Wike of lying when he said Amaechi, who is now Transport Minister, abandoned the state\u2019s aircraft in Germany for 10 years.\n\nAccording to reports, George accused Governor Wike of trying to malign and attack Amaechi with his comments about the aircraft.\n\nREAD ALSO: Wike Debunks Rumours Of Being Atiku\u2019s Running Mate\n\nBut Governor Wike dismissed the comments, explaining that contrary to claims by George that there was a handover containing details about the plane, that did not happen\n\n\u201cAll of us are aware that there was no handover to this government,\u201d he said.\n\nGeorge had been quoted as saying the information concerning the plane was in the handover notes of the Ministry of Transport. Governor Wike also dismissed that, explaining that when former President Goodluck Jonathan handed over to President Muhammadu Buhari, it was clear.\n\n\u201cIf we had had a handover, we would have known what to do,\u201d he said. He challenged the former transport commissioner to tell the people where the handover note is.\n\nAccording to Governor Wike, it was in 2016 that his administration started getting intelligence that the legacy jet was in Germany.\n\nHe explained that after following up with the situation regarding the plane through 2017 and 2018, he decided to go to Germany himself to observe the work being done on the plane.\n\n\u201cLet me just tell you people the whole essence of why they took the plane to that area (Germany). The former governor felt that he was going to install a governor in 2015. If Dakuku had become governor, that was just the end of the plane.\u201d\n\nHe said it was because that did not happen that the state is getting the plane back. He put the expected return date as March. Governor Wike also rejected claims that he had indebted the state by N300 billion.\n\nHe said those behind the allegations were the ones with cases to answer.\n\n\u201cAs I speak to you, authoritatively, if there is any money we borrowed from the bank, we must pay all before the end of our tenure,\u201d he said to applause from those present at the meeting.\n\n\u201cThe last loan we took from Zenith Bank was N25 billion, and the loan will be terminated in April 2023 because it is a monthly deduction paid. So, it is tenured.\n\n\u201cAnother bank we bank with is Access Bank. We took N10 billion from Access Bank; we pay N900 million every month. So, before the end of this year, we are done with that N10 billion.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike added that the only other money that can be talked about is the funds that the Central Bank of Nigeria gives to states such as infrastructure funds. He explained that the funds have to be paid over 20 years.\n\n\u201cThere will be a moratorium of three years. Then you start paying after three years and they are collecting N50 million every month. What is N50 million every month?\u201d the governor questioned.\n\nIllegal Bunkering\n\nGovernor Wike commended the various council chairman in the state for their efforts in helping the government fight against illegal bunkering.\n\nHe said the illegal activities had had so much negative impact on the state.\n\n\u201cI am sure that our people will appreciate that most council chairman are living up to their responsibilities in supporting the state,\u201d the governor said. \u201cSo, we plead that everybody should as a matter of concern continue to give them support.\n\n\u201cIt is not a fight against any ethnic group. It is a fight against crime, it is a fight against sabotage of the national economy, it is a fight against inflicting health injuries on all of us.\u201d\n\nAs a result, he said every right-thinking person living in Rivers or who is from the state should not hesitate in supporting the fight against illegal bunkering.\n\n\u201cThe fight against illegal bunkering has started. It will not end until we completely win the war. Yes, we are winning but we have not completely won.\u201d\n\nHe vowed that anyone in the state with tacit support for those behind the bunkering, when identified, would be made to face the law.",
