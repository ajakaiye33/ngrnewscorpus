How many times was he told of the actions of the Accountant-General?\n\n\u201cIt was because the pot was almost overflowing and there was nothing he could do that he was forced to pick him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time.

We are no Terrorists; we are no criminals as our oppressor Nigeria wished to tag us. Every country and Nation of the world Police, Immigration Foreign Affairs, and Competent Courts can attest to our good conduct, which is contrary to deliberate character assassination of a race by the Nigerian government police, armed forces, and their media disinformation.\n\n\u201cTo those in Biafraland who in all selflessness, tenacity and in submission observed a total lockdown of the entire Biafra space, it is evident that we need Biafra now and that we are not terrorists and criminals and would never be; we are rather professionals in all human endeavour.

Such leadership is required so that the party remains strong and united. It is also needed to improve our electoral fortunes by ensuring that it retains power at the centre, hold the great majority in various legislative chambers and also gain additional number of states.\n\n\u201cIn a few days, the party will be holding its convention during which primaries would take place to pick the presidential flag bearer for the 2023 general elections.

Anyim came fifth with 14 votes. Wike had said that those around Atiku had no election value, in what some people see implying that a running mate should be someone who would win votes, as he did in the presidential primary.\n\nSources revealed that apart from Wike, Emmanuel, Okowa and Anyim, the search for the running mate has widened in the South East, with fresh names being mentioned.\n\nBreaking!!!

Saraki worked with Ekweremadu in the 8th Senate, against stiff opposition by senators elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as him.\n\nThe Saraki elements, it was gathered, believe that Ekweremadu is trustworthy and stands for whatever cause he believes in.\n\nThe snag about Elweremadu, however, is the feelings that he may defect to the APC to pursue his governorship ambition. The former Deputy Senate president, who lost out in the Enugu PDP, is believed to be holding talks with APC leadership on the possibility of him getting the governorship ticket in state if he joins the party.\n\nIt was gathered that those who mentioned the name of Nnamani reckoned that the senator is popular in South East, as a two-time governor and serving senator. The popularity and potency of Nnamani\u2019s Ebeano group, which has produced the majority of the elected leaders in Enugu State till date, including the current governorship candidate of the PDP in the state, Mr. Peter Mbah, was counted as what stands Nnamani out.\n\nIhedioha, it was gathered, is being mentioned by those working with Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal. With Tambuwal stepping down for Atiku during the presidential primary, it was gathered that his supporters want him to nominate a running mate to Atiku. Ihedioha, who was Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives when Tambuwal was Speaker, is their choice, even as the former governor supporter Tambuwal in his quest for PDP presidential ticket.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that Atiku is only receiving nominations and engaging in broad consultation, so that he would make a choice that would be acceptable to stakeholders in South East and South South.\n\nSources revealed that the PDP candidate does not want a repeat of the controversy when he picked former Anambra State governor and now presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi, as running mate in 2019.\n\nWhen Obi was announced as running mate to Atiku in 2019, there was initial misgiving as governors of the South East and PDP leaders in the zone said they were not taken into confidence, in accordance with agreement with Atiku before supporting him at the presidential primary, which took place in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\n\n*Judge orders substituted service\n\n\n\nSunday Aborisade, Abuja\n\n\n\nThe Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered that the Labour Party and some of its officials be served with a fresh suit pertaining to its leadership crisis through a substituted means.\n\nThe judge, Inyang Ekwo, made the order on Monday after hearing an ex parte application filed by a former Deputy national chairman of the party, Calistus Okafor.\n\nIn the court order seen by our reporter on Wednesday, the judge ordered that the defendants be served through the pasting of the court documents filed by the plaintiff at the Labour Party\u2019s secretariat in Abuja within seven days.\n\nOkafor, a factional leader of the party, is by his suit, challenging the legality of the leadership of Akingbade Oyelakin, whom he said \u201crepresents persons wrongfully and unlawfully parading themselves as members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of Labour Party\u201d.\n\nHe also joined the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as a co-defendant.\n\nOthers sued by Okafor include Julius Abure and Umar Farouq who emerged as the national chairman and the secretary of the party, respectively, at a national executive committee meeting of the party held in Benin, Edo State, in March 2021.\n\nThe rest of the defendants sued by the defendants are members of the committee set up by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to take over the affairs of the party.\n\nThe committee members are Salisu Mohammed, Lawson Osagie, Isa Aremu, Baba Aye, Ikpe Ektokudo, Sylvester Ejiofor, and Lucy Offiong. Sued along with them are one Salamatu Aliyu and the NLC.\n\nThe court in its order issued on Monday ordered a \u201csubstituted service of the originating summons, interlocutory injunction, and all other processes in this suit on the 1st to 3rd, 6th to 12th and 14th defendants by pasting the said processes at their political party\u2019s office, which is the 5th defendant\u2019s office, located at No 2, Oke Agbe Street, Off Ladoke Akintoal Boulevard, Garki 11, Abuja.\u201d\n\nThe 1st to 3rd defendants are Abure, Farouq and Oyelakin. The 6th to the 12th defendants are the members of the NLC committee and the 14th defendant is Aliyu.\n\nThe court ordered that the service must be effected \u201cwithin seven days of this order.\u201d\n\nThe judge then adjourned the case until June 30 \u201cfor further mention\u201d.\n\nTHISDAY had reported how Okafor threatened to file the suit and how the legal action might threaten the presidential ambition of a former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, who left the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) last week and emerged as the presidential candidate of the LP faction led by Abure.\n\nHowever, Okafor told THISDAY that Obi decided to defect to LP without proper information on the fact that the party\u2019s leadership had been a subject of litigation since 2018.\n\nOkafor claimed that he remained the authentic national chairman of the party. He explained that he got the post by virtue of his position as Deputy National Chairman of the party when the late national chairman, Abdulsalam, was in office. He added that Abure, who is currently leading a faction of the party, was Acting National Secretary, when Abdulsalam, died in 2020.\n\nOkafor further claimed that Abure announced himself as National Chairman without recourse to the provisions of the party\u2019s constitution, following Abdulsalam\u2019s demise. He said the LP constitution stipulated that the deputy national chairman should act and/or replace the chairman in the event of death or resignation.\n\nOkafor explained, \u201cThe decision of Abure to make himself chairman, with the active collaboration of some members, actually led to the current leadership crisis in the LP.\n\n\u201cI, Calistus Okafor, approached the court to get a pronouncement to force Abure out and the case has been pending.\n\n\u201cThe matter will come up tomorrow (today) at the Federal High Court. There is no way we would allow an Acting National Secretary to forcefully take over the party and replace the late national chairman against the provisions of the constitution of the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe NLC and the TUC actually registered the Labour Party in 2006, but they were not the ones administering it.\n\n\u201cPeter Obi, at the moment, has been deceived and he is sitting on a keg of gunpowder and it is a pity. He went to wolves in sheep clothing thinking he was discussing with the right people. Staying in the PDP would have been better for him.\n\n\u201cThe LP has not done any convention since 2014, after the last one it did in Akure, the Ondo State capital.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Urges them to vote for leader with \u201cno-baggage\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\n\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has canvassed for votes from delegates to the presidential primary of the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) scheduled for next week in Abuja.In a letter personally signed by him, Lawan, an APC presidential aspirant, with humility, asked for the delegates\u2019 votes so that he could emerge as the APC Presidential flag bearer for the 2023 Nigerian Presidential election.\n\nHe also urged them to choose a person that would lead and not rule Nigerians and \u201ca leader with absolutely no-baggage.\u201d\n\nThe letter reads:\n\n\u201cMy Dear APC Party Delegates,\n\n\u201cCompliments of the season. Permit me to write to you through this medium. As we converge at this great time, in this great party to begin the journey of determining the future of this great nation, we must be cognizant of the fact that the fate of Nigeria fluctuates.\n\nWhile democracy asserts that the Nigerian voting public determines the person to emerge as President, however in advance of that, the party delegates are saddled with the task of nominating the flag bearers. This communication is an appeal to all APC delegates as the party prepares for its presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cI am reaching out to every single one of you APC delegates to plead with you to put \u2018Nigeria First\u2019 and give thought to the future of 215,763,437 (million) Nigerians, a lot of whom will appreciate the sagacious determination you will make during this process. I am reaching out to you, with humility, to ask for your votes so that I can emerge as the APC Presidential flag bearer for the 2023 Nigerian Presidential election.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it is not lost on me that we must come together as one party and as one nation, for we have a great deal to mend, to rehabilitate, to reinstall and so much more to achieve. We have a unique chance to measure up to every expectation and show Nigeria and the world that Democracy triumphs. And that journey shall start during the APC Presidential Primary Election process. \u201cTo all delegates across Nigeria, I beseech you to put pecuniary and monetary incentives aside and seriously consider what is \u2018in the greater good.\u2019 As you make your decision in picking the flag bearer of our party, I urge you to seek for a leader and not a politician. I ask you to choose a person that will lead and not rule Nigerians; one that will be understanding, tolerant, fair, honest, and progressive. A leader that comes with absolutely \u2018No-Baggage.\u2019 A vital component of any logical, efficient and authentic evaluation of a person involves assessing past behavior. The key here is that one\u2019s best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. If one has always done something a certain way, they are likely to do that same thing in the same manner in the future. The same goes for how one navigates or pillages in leadership. Thus, as you, the delegates, are determining the APC party presidential flag bearer, it is important to look at past behavior to elicit what behaviors, avarice and rapacity candidates have exhibited in the past. It is important for you to access all candidates along this parameter.\n\n\u201cDear delegates, look for a leader that will not buy your votes but one that is prepared to sell and deliver your dreams. I promise you that I will be that leader. I am prepared to offer you myself and my heart; my integrity, my dedication and my might. I want to offer you a dream of justice for all, a dream of uniting to fight the foes we face, a dream of unity under one single ideal, common purpose, common endeavor and resolve; a dream to right the wrongs of our past, a dream of work, employment, functioning safe schools, security, electricity, infrastructure, stable economy, compassion for citizenry, technology, opportunity and so much more that Nigerians desire.\n\n\u201cI will give you my all, thinking not of power, but of possibility and the public good. I want you to take my hand so that together, we can show the Nigerian story of hope, unity, tolerance, healing, principle, greatness and goodness. I want you to take my hand so that together we can learn from history, embrace faith and find a way to unify Nigeria and take her into the future. We are at an extraordinary historic moment both in APC and in Nigeria and our unity is the path forward.\n\n\u201cDear delegates, I give you my word, I will defend the constitution. I\u2019ll defend our democracy. I will defend Nigeria. I will defend every single Nigerian from every nook and cranny, across the length and breath of the nation and from every corner. I commit to defend all 371 spectacular tribes existing in this brilliant, colorful, diverse and beautiful nation.\n\n\u201cThis and nothing more than this is what we owe to our forefathers, this is what we owe to each other and this is what we owe to the generations that will follow behind us; to our children and our children\u2019s children.\n\nDear APC delegates, you have the sacred mission at this hour of history, during this hour of decision of taking this country to a plain beyond. I urge you to assist me in uniting Nigeria in our common desire to move forward together.\n\n\u201cWe shall meet on the voting field as members of Africa\u2019s largest party and as Nigerians united in our resolve to remain the most vibrant party in Africa and one of the greatest nations on earth. We shall meet on the voting field to tell the positive tale of Nigeria. While this is expected of every Nigerian, it starts with you, the APC delegates.\n\n\u201cI give you my word that I shall not fail you. To this end, I ask for your precious votes and your dedication to our party, APC, and to our motherland. I give you my word that, given the privilege of carrying the APC Presidential ticket, I will represent you with pride, courage, equity, endurance, faith, conviction, devotin to you all and the country we love with all our hearts. I give you my word that I will strive to take the APC presidential ticket nomination you will hopefully give to me and turn it into a landslide win in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cAl-Haji Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Al-Haji Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Herbert Macaulay, Professor Eyo Ita, Alvan Ikoku, Chief Anthony Enahoro, Sir Egbert Udo Udoma, Al-Haji Aminu Kano, Chief S.

          "text": "\u2022Declares Tambuwal\u2019s decision arranged, dishonourable, tragic betrayal\n\n\u2022Says Peter Obi\u2019s position now vindicated\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\n\n\nElder statesman and leader of the Ijaw nation, Chief Edwin Clark, has described the National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, as a thoughtless and partial leader and therefore, asked him to resign his position as a matter of urgency.\n\nClark, who claimed Ayu could not hide his biases, when he paid the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal a \u201cthank you\u201d visit during which he described him as the \u201chero of the convention\u201d, also contended that the decision by the Sokoto governor to step down for the winner of the presidential primaries, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, was arranged and as such, dishonourable and a tragic betrayal.\n\nTo that extent, Clark, who is the leader of Southern, Middle Belt Leaders Forum and Pan Niger Delta Forum, said the decision by a former governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi to quit the PDP and withdraw from the presidential primaries was well-thought out and vindicated the presidential hopeful.\n\nClark, in a statement he personally signed yesterday, in Abuja, said with the outcome of PDP\u2019s primary election, it had become imperative for Ayu to resign, saying he could no longer head the National Working Committee of the PDP.\n\nTaking a swipe at the action of Tambuwal, Clark insisted that, what Tambuwal did was not only dishonorable, but also a serious electoral abnormality and a tragic betrayal of national patriotism for hidebound interests.\n\nThe former Federal Information Minister condemned the reported outrageous financial inducements of delegates and the alleged dollarisation of the electoral process, saying it was an indication of more likely, deleterious outcomes of the 2023 general election, mainly the presidential and their aftermaths.\n\nClark, however, hailed efforts of the Convention Committee that was chaired by former President of the Senate, Senator David Mark, and his assistants, particularly, the Governor of Bayelsa State, Senator Douye Diri.\n\n\u201cMost disturbing is what happened at the Special National Convention of the PDP, in Abuja, on Saturday, 28th May 2022. I followed the live broadcasts of the proceedings, keenly, until about 12.30 am on Sunday, 29th of May.\n\n\u201cI was alarmed by the outrageous and Machiavellian manner in which Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, Governor of Sokoto State, was so apparently \u201carranged\u201d to announce his withdrawal from the contest at the last minute; his speech changed the mood of the event.\n\n\u201cThat was done in order to foist another northerner as the party\u2019s flag bearer, having regard to the fact that Governor Aminu Tambuwal was the only aspirant from the whole of the north-west, which had about 192 delegates at the convention.\n\n\u201cWhat Tambuwal did was not only dishonourable but also a serious electoral abnormality and a tragic betrayal of national patriotism for hidebound interests.\n\n\u201cIt is now widespread understanding that there were pressures mounted on Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, and former Senate President, Senator Bukola Saraki, to also withdraw, while Tambuwal deliberately delayed his action till the last minute. By so doing, unduly swept his north west votes to Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\u201cOne can now appreciate the reasons given by Mr. Peter Obi for his withdrawal from the PDP, both as a member and as an aspirant, few days before the party\u2019s primary. And I would think that what he did was, without doubt, in respect, or obedience, to the position of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some aspirants from the south believed that, with the resources and facilities at their disposal, their Elders no longer matter, and disregarded, with impunity, the patriotic advice on the need to be steadfast on the position of the zoning of the presidency to the south.\n\n\u201cThey never minded that what we have been advocating was in their interest. They proved themselves to be selfish and arrogant, and thought they could win on their own steam. They failed; I can only hope that they have, now, learned their lessons.\n\n\u201cEven much worse, in the extreme, was the action of the National Chairman of the PDP, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, in his open visit to Governor Tambuwal to congratulate and hail him, in his words, as \u2018the hero of the Convention.\u2019\n\n\u201cThis clearly reveals his partiality and predilection in the processes leading to the baffling conclusion of the PDP Presidential Primary. Senator Ayu has failed to realise that what we are fighting for affects all minorities in Nigeria. Senator Iyorchia Ayu\u2019s appalling, thoughtless and unpatriotic public conduct bears grave negative consequences.\n\n\u201cHe should, therefore, no longer consider himself fit and proper to retain his position as the National Chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), and should resign now.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says his candidate will give Nigerians sense of victory, confidence ahead of poll\n\n\u2022Governors meeting deadlocked\n\n\u2022NWC members accuse Adamu of rendering body redundant, taking unilateral decisions\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja, Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia and Okon Bassey in Uyo\n\n\n\nWith his words carefully chosen and intention unmistaken, President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, pleaded with the 22 governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to allow him choose his successor in reciprocity, ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primaries next week. Buhari made the appeal at a meeting in Abuja with the governors, which was also attended by other stakeholders.\n\nThe president said the governors should reciprocate the party\u2019s good gesture of allowing outgoing governors choose their successors in their respective states. He assured that his choice presidential candidate would give Nigerians a sense of triumph and confidence ahead of the general election, and promised to sustain ongoing consultations ahead of the primary election.\n\nBut a meeting of the governors immediately after the one with the president was deadlocked as they could not agree amongst themselves, whether the president\u2019s choice should come from the north or the south of the country.\n\nThe governors, who had met to see if they could resolve and agree amongst them, where the candidate should come from and if actually, they could recommend from amongst them, were still at their meeting in their early hours of today, when this report was being filed.\n\nBuhari\u2019s request, however, came as the simmering crisis in APC appeared to take another dimension, with members of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) accusing the APC national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, of rendering the NWC redundant.\n\nIn a related development, Nasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule cautioned members and supporters of APC against unguarded utterances about the party\u2019s primary elections in the state.\n\nAddressing APC governors, under the aegis of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), at a closed-door meeting at the State House, Abuja, also attended by Adamu and other stakeholders, the president said his desire to determine his successor was in line with established internal policies of the party, especially, as it approached the convention in a few days.\n\n\u201cI wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d Buhari said in the two-page address.\n\nHe said the party had successfully established internal policies that promoted continuity and smooth succession plans, even at the state and local government levels.\n\nThe president, who is also the national leader of the party, emphasised that first-term governors, who had served credibly, had been encouraged to stand for re-election, while \u201csecond term governors have been accorded the privilege of promoting successors that are capable of driving their visions as well as the ideals of the party.\u201d\n\nHe declared that APC\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2023 polls would be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence ahead of the general election.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOur objective must be the victory of our party and our choice of candidate must be someone, who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence even before the elections.\u201d\n\nThe president further appealed to the governors \u201cto allow our interests to converge, our focus to remain on the changing dynamics of our environment, the expectations of our citizens and the global community.\u201d\n\nHe assured them that consultation would continue to ensure that all aspirants and stakeholders were brought on board right through to the convention, and anxieties were effectively brought under control.\n\nBuhari charged APC governors to ensure that the forthcoming convention to pick a presidential candidate reflected all the values and virtues of the party.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe processes for the 2023 general election have commenced in earnest and I note that the most successful political parties globally have always relied on their internal cohesion and a strong leadership brand to achieve bigger electoral fortunes. Our party, the APC, shall not be any different, more so as we are still implementing the blueprint for a more prosperous nation.\n\n\u201cAs I begin the final year of my second term as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and leader of the party, I recognise the compelling need for me to provide stronger leadership to the party under this transition process and to ensure that it happens in an orderly manner.\n\n\u201cSuch leadership is required so that the party remains strong and united. It is also needed to improve our electoral fortunes by ensuring that it retains power at the centre, hold the great majority in various legislative chambers, and also gain additional number of states.\n\n\u201cIn a few days, the party will be holding its convention during which primaries would take place to pick the presidential flag bearer for the 2023 general election. This is a very significant process and its outcome should prove to the world, the positive quality of the APC regarding democratic principles, culture as well as leadership.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the governors, the Kebbi State governor, and Chairman of PGF, Atiku Bagudu, said the party must build on the success of its recent elective convention, and the primaries conducted so far, \u201cand come up with a candidate, who will walk in the footsteps of patriotism and love for the country, which Mr President has shown. We will support Mr President to have a very successful convention.\u201d\n\nAdamu Has Rendered NWC Redundant, Taken Unilateral Decisions, Say Members\n\nMembers of the APC National Working Committee (NWC), yesterday, accused the party\u2019s national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, of rendering the NWC redundant and taking unilateral decisions. They warned that henceforth, any unilateral decision taken by Adamu or any other party functionary, which required the approval of the NWC, as enshrined in the APC constitution, would be considered as illegitimate and an infringement on the jurisdictional scope of the NWC, unless otherwise confirmed as validly approved decisions of the NWC or any other legitimate organ of the party.\n\nThe NWC members said no one was elected at the March 26, 2022 national convention to warm seats or offices at the national secretariat.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u201cAPC and the Need for Vigilance: Urgent Call for Intervention\u201d, and jointly signed by National Vice Chairman, North-west, Dr. Salihu Lukman, and National Vice Chairman, South-west, Mr. Isaacs Kekemeke, the NWC members lamented that within two months in the life of the Adamu-led leadership, critical decisions about the affairs of the party were being taken unilaterally by the chairman.\n\nThey expressed worry that all efforts to get the national chairman to respect the authority of the NWC had proved unsuccessful, adding that they are compelled to issue the statement following postponement of the scheduled NWC meetings twice within 48 hours. The party chieftains noted that they were convinced that the rescheduling was a deliberate attempt to foist a fait accompli on the NWC on fundamental issues that affect the party.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWithin just two months in the lifespan of the new leadership of our great party, APC, led by His Excellency, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the NWC, organ of the party vested with the power of managing the day-to-day affairs, including implementing decisions of the National Executive Committee (NEC), as provided in Article 13.4 of the APC Constitution, has been rendered redundant.\n\n\u201cThe national chairman takes decisions unilaterally. When it suits him, he invokes the name of our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, to blackmail NWC members into accepting his decisions.\n\n\u201cEvery effort to get the chairman to respect the authority of the NWC, as elected by the March 26, 2022 APC National Convention, is proving very difficult, if not impossible. Note that NEC\u2019s donation of its powers was to NWC and not to the national chairman or any individual.\n\n\u201cThe national chairman must be properly reminded to recognise that the business of managing the day-to-day affairs of the party is the responsibility of the NWC, as provided in provisions of the APC constitution.\n\n\u201cHe is free to consult any party leader(s). Such consultations will not represent decisions of the NWC or any organ of the party unless and until it is adopted by a properly constituted meeting of the NWC or organ in question according to the letters and spirit of the APC constitution.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we have suffered enough judicial embarrassments arising from clearly avoidable leadership breach of our party\u2019s constitution and spelt out rules. No NWC member is elected at the March 26, 2022 national convention to warm seats or offices in the national secretariat.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on all our colleagues in the NWC to rise to these challenging situations by joining hands with us to save our great party and return it to its founding mission of moving Nigeria forward based on honest, fair, just, and selfless commitment to party building. God bless our party!\u201d\n\nSule to APC Members: Stop Unguarded Utterances on Primaries\n\nNasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule, yesterday, cautioned APC members and supporters in the state against making unguarded utterances regarding the party\u2019s primary elections in the state. Sule said this against the backdrop of a negative impression being created in the media by party members who had expressed dissatisfaction with certain sections of the delegates list used for the primaries.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ibrahim Addra, Sule said, \u201cIt is important to state that the list of delegates used for the governorship primaries was not tampered with at all and the party\u2019s complaint was not in reference to the state\u2019s delegate list.\n\n\u201cThe noticeable changes of concern to the party leadership were only in respect of some wards in seven out of the 13 local government areas of the state. The party leadership at all levels will work together to find an amicable resolution of all issues of concern.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the insinuations and propaganda by some individuals that there was a dispute with the national secretariat of the party was unfortunate and far from the truth.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is worthy of reiterating that the primaries in most of the constituencies in the state were adjudged as transparent and peaceful. As a united APC family, we are confident that these minor internal issues will be resolved in no time.\n\n\u201cParty members should, irrespective of the results of the primaries, endeavour to close ranks and work for the unity and success of the party.\u201d\n\n\u2018APC Convention Shouldn\u2019t Be Another Dollar Rain\u2019\n\nA chieftain of the ruling APC, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, warned that the party had a high responsibility not to allow its presidential primaries and convention to become \u201canother dollar rain and a trading platform for the highest bidder.\u201d\n\nIn a statement from his media office in Abuja, yesterday, Olawepo-Hashim explained \u201cthat our country is neither a commodity to be traded, nor a property to be auctioned and sold to the highest bidder,\u201d adding, \u201cNigerian presidency has never been for sale and should not be for sale now.\n\n\u201cThe PDP has demonstrated that it has learnt nothing, but as a party, the APC cannot follow her inglorious example. The next president of Nigeria must not be a Mafioso leader. Our president must not be a gangster. As a party in government, the APC has a sacred and patriotic duty to guide a disciplined transfer of power not one left in the hands of the god of mammon.\u201d\n\nAs the party of the sitting president, Olawepo-Hashim argued that a lot was expected from APC in terms of direction and leadership, adding that the government still has a lot of leverage and political enforcement mechanisms beyond money.\n\nThe former presidential candidate noted, \u201cNational interest is what should guide the choice of the APC and some of the urgent national imperative should include shortlisting a candidate that will heal the wounds of division in the country and finding also a vice that will complement him/her in this national objective.\u201d\n\nDowells: Any Attempt to Zone APC Ticket to North Suicidal\n\nAn APC chieftain in Akwa Ibom State and Coordinator, Movement for Better Nigeria (MBN), Dr Paul Dowells, warned against any attempt by the ruling party to zone its presidential ticket to the north. Dowells, at a press conference in Uyo, yesterday, said such decision would seriously imperil the party\u2019s chances at the polls next year.\n\nSpeaking against the background of speculations that the leadership of APC was considering a northern presidential candidate for the 2023 presidential race, Dowells stressed that giving the ticket to a northerner was not a yardstick for winning elections. Rather, he said, it was the pedigree and charisma of the person carrying the party\u2019s flag that would determine his acceptance.\n\nDowells argued that if APC wanted to win the 2023 elections, the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, should be considered.\n\nHe said, \u201cZoning the presidential ticket to the north because PDP has a northerner as a presidential candidate does not make sense. If APC wants to win the 2023 elections, Professor Yemi Osinbajo should be given the ticket either by consensus or nomination, otherwise, retaining the Aso rock may be an illusion.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Our Fulani Kidnappers Told Us After Buying Enough Weapons, They Will Bombard Igboland, Take Over Nigeria\u2014 Methodist Prelate, Uche Recounts Ordeal",
          "text": "The Prelate of Methodist Church Nigeria, His Eminence Samuel Uche, has revealed that the Fulani herdsmen who kidnapped him and others tortured him such that he nearly lost his sight after hitting his right eye on a tree.\n\nThe cleric who narrated his near-death experience in the hands of kidnappers said they were eight in number, all Fulani herders, with one who claimed to have been born in Abia State.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that the Prelate, his chaplain, Very Rev. Abidemi Shittu, and the Bishop of Owerri, Rt. Rev. Dennis Mark were abducted on Sunday along the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway in the Umunneochi Local Government Area of Abia State.\n\nUche, who recounted his experience at a press conference held at Methodist Church, Yaba, Lagos State, on Tuesday, alleged that some military personnel from the North were aiding the kidnappers in their activities in the region.\n\nThe Prelate said, \u201cThese people came out from the bush; they divided themselves into 3 places; some people fired at us and there was another group in front to make sure that we didn\u2019t run away; they fired shots at our vehicle and eventually, they abducted 3 of us.\n\n\u201cThe communication man of the church was able to escape, the driver was able to escape; they abducted me, the bishop of Owerri and my chaplain and they took us to the bush and were torturing us. It was in the process of that torture that I hit my right eye on a tree. Even when blood was flowing and I was soaking my eyes with a handkerchief, they didn\u2019t feel like anything happened.\n\n\u201cAll they said was that we should follow them; that they were not actually against Nigerian citizens but against the government, that the government is a bad government.\n\n\u201cThey are Fulani boys; all the 8 are Fulanis; they said the day they will see the president or any of his representatives they will chew him raw; that he is their brother but he has disappointed them and has disappointed Nigeria.\n\n\"I said even though I'm part of the government, I'm a churchman, I'm not a government official; they said okay, that is what has saved you, we would have killed you outright without asking for any ransom but now that you are a churchman, let's go inside the bush.\n\n\u201cI trekked up for to 15 kilometres but I knew that we were rigmaroling, going up, going down and eventually at 11 pm they said okay now we can negotiate; each of us will pay N50 million and we are going to pay N150 million. I thought it was a joke; I said we were going to pay N10 million and they said what? Don\u2019t say that; they lifted their knife to cut me, I said please hold on.\u201d\n\nAccording to the cleric, the leader of the group is about 35 years old while the others are about 18.\n\nHe said they had taken his rings, chain, and the money they had on them and insisted on N150 million ransom.\n\nThe clergyman said the abductors later reduced the ransom to N100 million, warning that if they negotiate, they would be killed.\n\n\u201cI said okay. We will pay you N100 million. After some time, they said where is the money and I said this is Sunday night, how can we get money this night and you know that there is this sit-at-home in Igbo land. We can't afford the money now, be patient till morning, we will make contacts.\"\n\nUche said the kidnappers lost patience, laid Bishop Dennis Mark down, raised a knife to cut him, while another pointed a gun at him (prelate) to show that they were serious,\n\n\u201cI told them we will raise the money for you. But the irony of it, where they were situated, the soldiers, all of Fulani extraction, Nigerian soldiers, they were there at Lomara junction and these boys were going behind them. Meanwhile, they kept their cows somewhere, numbering about 200.\n\nHe said some people were taking care of the cows while the abductors were parading them around the bush until they settled at a place,\n\n\u201cThey said 'when are you bringing the money?' I said by 12 noon, I will call the people I\u2019ve contacted whether the money had been raised and I called them, they said that they were gathering the money and they heard it because they said I will use my phone to talk, they can't use their phone, they don\u2019t want to be tracked.\n\n\u201cTheir leader was born in Igbo land but his parents have died. He said he was born around Umuahia Amuzukwu and his father was a cow dealer, the boy understood Igbo,\" he said.\n\nHe said the leader threatened to kill them if they informed security operatives when they had raised the ransom of N100 million.\n\nThe leader asked them to buy 5 'Ghana must go' bags and put N20 million in each bag. They left to pick the ransom while four others stayed behind with guns.\n\nHe said, \u201cAround 5. 30pm, the youngest boy who I think is a younger brother to their commander said 'Oga, congratulations, you are free, you can go now. We have got our money, you can go. Let me show you the road'.\n\n\u201cThey took us to Old road, where they wrote 'welcome to Imo\u2019 and \u2018goodbye from Abia'.\n\n\u201cThey told us that after buying enough weapons, they were going to bring all those people that were driven away from Zamfara, Katsina, Sambisa Forest, that they are all coming to locate themselves in Igbo land and deal with us.\n\n\u201cHe said do you know Ibadan expressway? We are in all the bush there, we are also in the South-South, we are waiting for the slightest signal, we will finish you people and take over this land. They claimed that Nigeria belongs to Fulani.\"\n\nThe priest maintained that military personnel of Fulani extraction were aiding the kidnappers who disguise as herders in the daytime but are kidnappers at night.\n\nHe called on the government to take a decisive action \"otherwise what is happening in the north will be a child\u2019s play\u201d.\n\nHe said it was the Methodist Church Nigeria and members of the church that made efforts to secure his release and not security agencies of the government.",

          "text": "The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has appealed to All Progressives Congress delegates to consider aspirants\u2019 history and public records before voting at the party\u2019s upcoming presidential primary.\n\nLawan, who is all seeking for the office of the president in 2023 on the platform of APC, charged delegates to choose a person that would lead and not rule Nigerians and \u201ca leader with absolutely no-baggage\u201d, even as he asked them to consider him.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan\n\nThis contained in a letter to All the APC Delegates on Wednesday.\n\nLawan wrote, \u201cTo all delegates across Nigeria, I beseech you to put pecuniary and monetary incentives aside and seriously consider what is \u2018in the greater good.\u2019 As you make your decision in picking the flag bearer of our party, I urge you to seek for a leader and not a politician.\n\n\u201cI ask you to choose a person that will lead and not rule Nigerians; one that will be understanding, tolerant, fair, honest, and progressive; a leader that comes with absolutely \u2018No-Baggage.\u2019\n\n\u201cA vital component of any logical, efficient and authentic evaluation of a person involves assessing past behaviour. The key here is that one\u2019s best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. If one has always done something a certain way, they are likely to do that same thing in the same manner in the future.\n\n\u201cThe same goes for how one navigates or pillages in leadership. Thus, as you, the delegates, are determining the APC party presidential flag bearer, it is important to look at past behavior to elicit what behaviors, avarice and rapacity candidates have exhibited in the past. It is important for you to access all candidates along this parameter.\n\n\u201cDear delegates, look for a leader that will not buy your votes but one that is prepared to sell and deliver your dreams. I promise you that I will be that leader.\u201d\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s the full text of the letter;\n\n\n\nMy Dear APC Party Delegates,\n\n\n\nCompliments of the season. Permit me to write to you through this medium. As we converge at this great time, in this great party to begin the journey of determining the future of this great nation, we must be cognizant of the fact that the fate of Nigeria fluctuates.\n\n\n\nWhile democracy asserts that the Nigerian voting public determines the person to emerge as President, however in advance of that, the party delegates are saddled with the task of nominating the flag bearers. This communication is an appeal to all APC delegates as the party prepares for its presidential primaries.\n\n\n\nI am reaching out to every single one of you APC delegates to plead with you to put \u2018Nigeria First\u2019 and give thought to the future of 215,763,437 (million) Nigerians, a lot of whom will appreciate the sagacious determination you will make during this process. I am reaching out to you, with humility, to ask for your votes so that I can emerge as the APC Presidential flag bearer for the 2023 Nigerian Presidential election.\n\n\n\nAt this point, it is not lost on me that we must come together as one party and as one nation, for we have a great deal to mend, to rehabilitate, to reinstall and so much more to achieve. We have a unique chance to measure up to every expectation and show Nigeria and the world that Democracy triumphs. And that journey shall start during the APC Presidential Primary Election process.\n\n\n\nTo all delegates across Nigeria, I beseech you to put pecuniary and monetary incentives aside and seriously consider what is \u2018in the greater good.\u2019 As you make your decision in picking the flag bearer of our party, I urge you to seek for a leader and not a politician. I ask you to choose a person that will lead and not rule Nigerians; one that will be understanding, tolerant, fair, honest, and progressive. A leader that comes with absolutely \u2018No-Baggage.\u2019\n\n\n\nA vital component of any logical, efficient and authentic evaluation of a person involves assessing past behavior. The key here is that one\u2019s best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. If one has always done something a certain way, they are likely to do that same thing in the same manner in the future. The same goes for how one navigates or pillages in leadership. Thus, as you, the delegates, are determining the APC party presidential flag bearer, it is important to look at past behavior to elicit what behaviors, avarice and rapacity candidates have exhibited in the past. It is important for you to access all candidates along this parameter.\n\n\n\nDear delegates, look for a leader that will not buy your votes but one that is prepared to sell and deliver your dreams. I promise you that I will be that leader. I am prepared to offer you myself and my heart; my integrity, my dedication and my might. I want to offer you a dream of justice for all, a dream of uniting to fight the foes we face, a dream of unity under one single ideal, common purpose, common endeavor and resolve; a dream to right the wrongs of our past, a dream of work, employment, functioning safe schools, security, electricity, infrastructure, stable economy, compassion for citizenry, technology, opportunity and so much more that Nigerians desire.\n\n\n\nI will give you my all, thinking not of power, but of possibility and the public good. I want you to take my hand so that together, we can show the Nigerian story of hope, unity, tolerance, healing, principle, greatness and goodness. I want you to take my hand so that together we can learn from history, embrace faith and find a way to unify Nigeria and take her into the future. We are at an extraordinary historic moment both in APC and in Nigeria and our unity is the path forward.\n\n\n\nDear delegates, I give you my word, I will defend the constitution. I\u2019ll defend our democracy. I will defend Nigeria. I will defend every single Nigerian from every nook and cranny, across the length and breath of the nation and from every corner. I commit to defend all 371 spectacular tribes existing in this brilliant, colorful, diverse and beautiful nation.\n\n\n\nThis and nothing more than this is what we owe to our forefathers, this is what we owe to each other and this is what we owe to the generations that will follow behind us; to our children and our children\u2019s children.\n\n\n\nDear APC delegates, you have the sacred mission at this hour of history, during this hour of decision of taking this country to a plain beyond. I urge you to assist me in uniting Nigeria in our common desire to move forward together.\n\n\n\nWe shall meet on the voting field as members of Africa\u2019s largest party and as Nigerians united in our resolve to remain the most vibrant party in Africa and one of the greatest nations on earth. We shall meet on the voting field to tell the positive tale of Nigeria. While this is expected of every Nigerian, it starts with you, the APC delegates.\n\n\n\n\n\nI give you my word that I shall not fail you. To this end, I ask for your precious votes and your dedication to our party, APC, and to our motherland. I give you my word that, given the privilege of carrying the APC Presidential ticket, I will represent you with pride, courage, equity, endurance, faith, conviction, devotin to you all and the country we love with all our hearts. I give you my word that I will strive to take the APC presidential ticket nomination you will hopefully give to me and turn it into a landslide win in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\n\nAl-Haji Sir Ahmadu Bello, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Al-Haji Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Herbert Macaulay, Professor Eyo Ita, Alvan Ikoku, Chief Anthony Enahoro, Sir Egbert Udo Udoma, Al-Haji Aminu Kano, Chief S. A. Ajayi, Joseph Tarka, Chief Sunday Awoniyi, Dennis Osadebay and all the other great men that founded, made and preserved this great Republic are looking down and smiling fondly at every single one of you as you take your place in history in duty and service of your great party and ultimately, your nation.\n\n\n\nMay you all be protected and directed through wisdom as you journey to the presidential primary election to speak for yourself, your family, your generation, your future, your state and for Nigeria.\n\n\n\nMay the Almighty be with you as you make the best decision for the future of Nigeria.",

          "title": "LOWDOWN: Who is Buhari's preferred candidate? Enter the probables and the possibles",
          "text": "In January 2022, President Muhammadu Buhari sparked off a frenzy in an interview with Channels TV when asked about his preferred candidate in the presidential race.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any favourite for 2023 and if I do, I won\u2019t reveal his identity because if I do, he may be eliminated before the election. I\u2019d better keep it secret,\u201d he famously said.\n\nAt his meeting with APC governors on Tuesday in Abuja, he said a number of things that were quite loaded and gave much away without revealing everything.\n\nOne, he solicited the reciprocity and support of the governors and other stakeholders \u201cin picking my successor\u201d, appealing to all of them to allow \u201cour interests to converge\u201d. This is the clearest indication that he wants to determine who the candidate would be and reach a consensus with the governors, who effectively control the delegates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo, the president said \u201cour choice of candidate must be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence even before the elections\u201d. That suggests that the candidate must be popular and electable. Featherweight politicians are automatically ruled out.\n\nThree, he said focus should remain on the \u201cchanging dynamics of our environment\u201d. A straight-forward interpretation would be that he wants a counterweight to Atiku Abubakar, who has just been elected as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Does that mean a northern candidate or a heavyweight flag bearer?\n\nFour, he spoke about the need for continuity, saying \u201cthe party has successfully established internal policies that promote continuity and smooth succession plans even at the state and local government levels\u201d. He is hinting at a member of his government, apparently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo single contestant ticks all these boxes and many of them will still fancy their chances of falling into one category or another as Buhari continues to speak in parables.\n\nIn this lowdown on the APC presidential conventional slated for June 6-8, TheCable projects that Buhari\u2019s choice out of the 23 contestants will be one of these hopefuls.\n\nOLUYEMI OLULEKE OSINBAJO\n\nWHY? Having been Buhari\u2019s No 2 since 2015, Osinbajo would consider himself the best bet for the job and has been campaigning on the basis of consolidating the legacy (\u201ccontinuity\u201d). He was acting president on a number of occasions and many believe he did commendably well in taking key decisions that got the government machine moving. He cuts the picture of a modern, forward-looking and confident leader. Reported attempts to get Buhari to drop him before the 2019 elections failed \u2014 somewhat an indication of the president\u2019s trust in him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWHY NOT? While acting as president in 2017 when Buhari was seriously ill, Osinbajo took a number of decisions that appeared to question his loyalty to his boss, especially by replacing the president\u2019s nominees with his own. The final straw, some insist, was the removal of Lawal Daura as the DG of the Department of State Services (DSS) in August 2018 while Buhari was abroad. That was the last time Buhari officially transferred power to him before travelling abroad.\n\nANOINTING RATING\n\nConvergence between Buhari and governors: **\n\nConnection with masses/victory chances: ***\n\nCounterweight to Atiku: **\n\nContinuity factor: ****\n\nBOLA AHMED TINUBU\n\nWHY? It is rumoured loudly in the APC that when the party was about to be formed ahead of the 2015 elections, promises were made to Tinubu that he would be first in line of succession after Buhari\u2019s tenure. Tinubu was the strongest politician from the south-west. His coming on board the Buhari train helped change the voting pattern: in all previous elections, Buhari did not score 25 percent in any south-west state. In 2015, if the south-west had voted the same way they voted in 2011, Buhari would not have defeated Jonathan. In fact, Jonathan would have been re-elected by about a margin of about 500,000 votes. Tinubu\u2019s supporters believe that Buhari owes him one.\n\nWHY NOT? Having failed to pick him as his running in 2015 because he did not want a Muslim-Muslim ticket given the religious sensitivity in parts of Nigeria, Buhari is unlikely to push for a Tinubu candidate because it would still be politically delicate. There is no strong northern Christian to balance the ticket and a Muslim-Muslim ticket is a risky venture at the moment, especially as the PDP is not likely to go the same way. Moreover, some people are uncomfortable with Tinubu\u2019s perceived baggage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nANOINTING RATING\n\nConvergence between Buhari and governors: **\n\nConnection with masses/victory chances: ***\n\nCounterweight to Atiku: ****\n\nContinuity factor: **\n\nAHMAD IBRAHIM LAWAN\n\nWHY? On August 18, 2021, Senate President Ahmad Lawan was pictured pulling out a chair for Buhari at the Council Chambers. Many Nigerians raised an eyebrow about the No. 3 citizen turning himself into an ADC. What they did not know was that Lawan was playing the loyalty game. Lawan, who holds a doctorate in remote sensing/GIS from Cranfield University, the UK, is a Buhari loyalist. He, it was, that Buhari wanted as senate president in 2015 but Bukola Saraki upstaged him. Buhari\u2019s love for the north-east, where Lawan comes from, is well documented. If Buhari decides to back a northern contender \u2014 with PDP also fielding a northerner \u2014 watch out for Lawan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWHY NOT? Governors are said to be uncomfortable with Lawan becoming the presidential candidate and would rather negotiate with Buhari to back one of them.\n\nANOINTING RATING\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConvergence between Buhari and governors: *\n\nConnection with masses/victory chances: *\n\nCounterweight to Atiku: ***\n\nContinuity factor: **\n\nCHIBUIKE ROTIMI AMAECHI\n\nWHY? Amaechi was one of the closest ministers to Buhari and one of the very few with unfettered access to him since 2015. Even when Abba Kyari was chief of staff, Buhari exempted Amaechi from the list of ministers who needed to pass through Kyari\u2019s office to see him. The word in the presidential villa was that there was nothing Amaechi wanted that Buhari did not do and there was no memo he presented that Buhari did not sign. While APC leaders were still scouting for who would be Buhari\u2019s campaign DG in 2019, Amaechi presented a letter signed by the president appointing him into the position.\n\nWHY NOT? Buhari is said to privately worry about Amaechi\u2019s temperament, a trait that would be vital in managing Nigeria\u2019s complexity after a particularly testing period.\n\nANOINTING RATING\n\nConvergence between Buhari and governors: **\n\nConnection with masses/victory chances: **\n\nCounterweight to Atiku: **\n\nContinuity factor: ***\n\nOGBONNAYA CHRISTOPHER ONU\n\nWHY? Onu was a member of the All Peoples Party (APP), later renamed All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), from the very beginning in 1998 and remained their until ANPP joined the coalition that formed APC in 2013. Buhari was a member of ANPP before founding the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in 2009. Essentially, Onu is well known to Buhari and they had been political associates for a long while. If Buhari had chosen a running mate from the south-east in 2015, he most probably would have picked Onu, a first-class product of chemical engineering.\n\nWHY NOT? The former governor of the old Abia state was not one of the ministers with unrestricted access to Buhari, and this says a lot. He has also not been pulling his weight politically despite his sterling credentials.\n\nANOINTING RATING\n\nConvergence between Buhari and governors: *\n\nConnection with masses/victory chances: *\n\nCounterweight to Atiku: *\n\nContinuity factor: ***\n\nKAYODE JOHN FAYEMI\n\nWHY? Fayemi has enjoyed a very warm relationship with the president since the formation of APC and it was not surprising when he was picked as the minister from Ekiti state in 2015, even though Tinubu and Osinbajo had different candidates in mind. Buhari, it is said, is very impressed with Fayemi\u2019s intellectual capacity and was happy with his work on the policy team of APC. Fayemi has always had direct access to Buhari. His election as governor of Ekiti state in 2018 reportedly had Buhari\u2019s blessing. He is chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and enjoys a good relationship with his governor colleagues.\n\nWHY NOT? Buhari was reportedly not comfortable with Fayemi\u2019s position on the creation of the Amotekun security outfit in the south-west in the heat of the herders/farmers clashes.\n\nANOINTING RATING\n\nConvergence between Buhari and governors: ****\n\nConnection with masses/victory chances: ***\n\nCounterweight to Atiku: **\n\nContinuity factor: **\n\nCHUKWUEMEKA UWAEZUOKE NWAJIUBA\n\nWHY? Cool and calm, the former minister of state for education has for long been in the good books of Buhari but this was not publicly known. Their relationship dates back to the days of the Sani Abacha government. Both were close to Abacha. Against all odds, Nwajiuba was elected a member of the house of reps on the platform of APP in 1999 \u2014 even though the south-east was overwhelmingly PDP. The 54-year-old lawyer who holds a PhD was chairman of the board of TETFund during Buhari\u2019s first term. He is often referred to as Buhari\u2019s \u201cson\u201d because of their closeness. Buhari, sources said, was impressed with his principled stand of resigning his appointment as minister to pursue his presidential bid. He immediately asked other ministers who want to contest elections to resign.\n\nWHY NOT? There are no signs yet that Buhari would support someone from the south-east, partly because the APC is not that strong in the zone. He may also consider Nwajiuba as not experienced enough.\n\nANOINTING RATING\n\nConvergence between Buhari and governors: *\n\nConnection with masses/victory chances: *\n\nCounterweight to Atiku: *\n\nContinuity factor: ***\n\nBABATUNDE GBOLAHAN BAKARE\n\nWHY? The pentecostal pastor was running mate to Buhari in the 2011 presidential election. Buhari did not benefit much in terms of votes but it made a statement to those who classified him as a religious extremist who would not want to accommodate people of other faiths. Buhari eventually picked another pastor in 2015 and won. Bakare and Buhari have maintained a healthy relationship and the radical pastor has called himself the 16th president of Nigeria after Buhari, No 15. Since he sees Buhari on a regular basis, there is a feeling that the lawyer got some encouragement from him to buy the nomination form as well. Bakare also enjoys a good relationship with Tinubu and could be a compromise candidate.\n\nWHY NOT? Although he has always been a member of APC and was present at the national convention in April, Bakare still comes across more as a pastor than a politician.\n\nANOINTING RATING",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Egypt-born and Dubai-headquartered mobility startup Swvl, has announced plans to lay off a third of its workforce. The cut will affect 400 people, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Youssef Salem told Bloomberg.\n\nThis announcement was revealed in a letter sent to Swvl employees by CEO Mostafa Kandil on May 30. In the letter, Kandil explained that the effects of the recent global economic downturn have influenced the company\u2019s decision to be Cash Flow positive by 2023.\n\nSwvl, whose merger with Queen\u2019s Gambit Growth Capital in April landed it a valuation of $1.5 billion, became the first African startup to go public via a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Since the merger, however, Swvl has lost more than half of that number and is now valued at $581 million.\n\n\u201cNo matter how big, resources are not infinite; cash is meant to be responsibly utilized,\u201d CEO Kandil wrote.\n\nIn addition to this layoff, Kandil added that the company has taken other measures such as the voluntary salary deductions from the top management team; reduction of current office spaces; freezing its current hiring program, as well as travel and accommodation expenses.\n\nSwvl is present in 115 cities and 13 markets globally: the UAE, Egypt, Kenya, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Pakistan. A source disclosed to TechCrunch, that the majority of the layoffs will come from the company\u2019s Dubai and Pakistan offices. The layoffs will focus on roles automated by investments in the Company\u2019s engineering and product and support functions, according to a statement from SWVl.\n\nThe startup has been on an acquisitions spree in the last year, acquiring 4 international startups: UK\u2019s Zeelo, Germany\u2019s door2door, Turkey\u2019s Voltlines, Spain\u2019s Shotl and Argentina\u2019s Viapool.\n\nOver the past 2 months, the economic downturn has forced tech companies across the globe to lay off significant numbers of their workforce.\n\nThis month, Meta and Uber have announced that they\u2019re freezing hiring plans while Netflix laid off 2% of its workforce\u2014about 150 employees and Swedish buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna cut its workforce by 10%.\n\nOver 15,000 tech workers were laid off in May, as startups heed advice from tech investors including Y Combinator and Sequoia Capital to buckle up for hard times and plan for the worst.\n\nShare this article",

Tomorrow is never guaranteed. Don\u2019t put things off. Do it right away! Well, not immediately; you still have to finish reading this newsletter, of course.\n\nHere\u2019s today\u2019s outline:\n\nJoram Mwinamo\u2019s journey in tech\n\nCutting edge innovations in Africa\n\nMobility in Lagos\n\nJoram Mwinamo\u2019s journey in tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nDear reader, I\u2019m about to tell you a secret; can you keep one? Well, I\u2019ll let you know anyways. Techpoint Africa\u2018s editorial team is cooking! \ud83d\ude04\n\nThis Monday, I talked about the return of the How I Work series. Did you read Samuel\u2019s article on how Peace Itimi, a digital marketing professional and trainer, works?\n\nThere\u2019s more where that came from. And this week, there\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t want to miss.\n\nLet me give you a sneak peek. Nifemi, our Senior Reporter, recently added something new to her series, The Experts. A podcast!! While I was listening, I couldn\u2019t help but smile.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, we are widening your horizons options. If you don\u2019t want to read, you can listen. Although we won\u2019t stop you if you\u2019d like to listen and read. \ud83d\ude09\n\nDid you know she has a newsletter? If you didn\u2019t, then you definitely want to sign up.\n\nShare the link with your friends, family, and haters curious about how techies progress from novice to expert and everything in between. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll appreciate it.\n\nBack to the podcast: I won\u2019t say I was surprised to see it because you must have heard her speak on the Techpoint Africa Podcast.\n\nI mean, the voice, the sound, the story, and the emotions are fantastic. Good Lord, I felt like crying. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 You just need to listen! And if you disagree after listening, of course, please let me know by leaving a comment in the comments section. \ud83d\ude01\n\nBy the way, do you know anyone so passionate about what they do that no matter how unrelated a topic of discussion is, they always circle back to it? Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know anyone like this. Nifemi has brought such a person to your screen. \ud83d\ude05\n\nPlease, meet Joram Mwinamo, a Kenyan expert who always talks about the potential of technology and how he\u2019s been helping businesses tap into it by enabling them to make sense of the problem from a human perspective.\n\nInterestingly, he was exposed to computers as a child and has a degree in computer science. One would think he\u2019d become a computer scientist or a web developer, but it appears \u201cfate had another path for him.\u201d Hello, those are my words. \ud83d\ude01\n\nHis involvement in AIESEC, an organisation that promotes cultural exchange and professional and leadership development, as an undergraduate paved the way.\n\nAnd now, Joram is a seasoned entrepreneur who believes that if a founder is only good at building a product and terrible at everything else, the startup\u2019s overall success suffers.\n\nDo you believe that\u2019s correct? Why not read his story to learn more about his philosophy and journey into tech? Here you go: How Joram Mwinamo has helped Kenyans make sense of their businesses since 2007\n\nCutting edge innovations in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nRecently, most big tech companies seem to be enamoured with investing in Africa. While this should not be a cause for concern because it is business, it slightly worries me.\n\nI mean, is the African market that profitable or are we lacking that we require someone to rescue us from poverty, a lack of job opportunities, or low Internet penetration? \ud83d\ude02 Okay, that\u2019s all in my head, though. Still, these companies are helping.\n\nFor example, Microsoft opened its first Africa Development Centre to attract top-tier African technical talent to create cutting-edge solutions.\n\nAlso, Google announced plans to open its first Product Development Center in Kenya to create more job opportunities on the continent.\n\nKeep in mind that Google intends to change our Internet experience by launching Equiano, a cutting-edge subsea cable. Yes, the one promised by Google to have 112Mbps Internet speed.\n\nWhile these developments appear to be interesting, Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, believes that Google should be doing more for Africa. Interesting, innit?\n\nGoogle has been developing initiatives in Africa for quite some time. For context, Emmanuel, our Senior Reporter, provided examples of the company\u2019s innovations on the continent since 2019 in his most recent story yesterday, May 31, 2022.\n\nIn his conversation with Pichai, he also revealed Google\u2019s plan for innovation in Africa and why its Pixel smartphones might still remain expensive for users on the continent for a while.\n\nWell, I\u2019m not giving you any more sneak peeks. For more information, please read: Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, on cutting edge innovation in Africa\n\nMobility in Lagos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, May 23, 2022, the Lagos State government warned residents to be cautious of unlicensed e-hailing cab operators operating within the state because they pose a security risk to people and property.\n\nWhy? According to Dr Fredrick Oladeinde, Commissioner for Transportation, unlicensed operators lack a traceable operational base in the event of an emergency or safety concern.\n\nBesides, the Commissioner said that \u201cthe only lawful operators recognised by the state government and licensed to operate in Lagos are Lagos Ride, Uber, Bolt, Let Me Run, Global Taxi, Zoom Run, Treepz (PlentyWaka), and Shuttlers.\u201d\n\nConsequently, any other e-hailing cab operators are not approved by the Lagos State government.\n\nFurther, Oladeinde said that the government would soon begin a crackdown on illegal e-hailing cab operators in its efforts to make Lagos a safe place for all.\n\nStill on safety in Lagos State, the state government has established an Anti-Okada Squad to enforce the ban on okada riders, which is set to begin today, Wednesday, June 1, 2022.\n\nWhy this squad? Oladeinde stated yesterday, May 31, 2022, that the goal of establishing the squad is to ensure effective enforcement of the ban.\n\nAlso, the Lagos State Police Command stated that the motorcycle ban in the six Local Government Areas \u2014 Ikeja, Surulere, Eti-Osa, Lagos Mainland, Lagos Island, and Apapa \u2014 will be strictly enforced, adding that any resistance will be met with force in accordance with the law.\n\nRecall that on May 18, 2022, the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, declared a total and indefinite ban on okadas in those areas. This is similar to the state\u2019s ban in 2020 on all okada and tricycles (keke), including platforms like Max, ORide, and Gokada, on major highways.\n\nWhile a policy expert answered some of our burning questions about the 2020 ban, isn\u2019t it time we started having discussions that can help to shape the narrative of tech-enabled mobility in Lagos, Nigeria and Africa at large?\n\nIf you agree, then join the inaugural Africa Mobility Conference taking place tomorrow, June 2, 2022, by 9 a.m. To be a part of the conversation, register here. It\u2019s free! \ud83d\ude09\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nBinance has open roles in Communication, Business Development, Customer Support, Engineering, Marketing, Product, Customer support, and other departments. Check out the details and how to apply here.\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer.

          "title": "Exclusive: Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, on cutting edge innovation in Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA familiar trend in recent years has seen big tech companies announce cutting edge innovations in key markets. For years Africa has barely featured in the conversation, but all that is changing, and Google is playing a big part.\n\nIn 2021, Google announced a $1 billion fund for Africa, an investment that would involve the launch of Equiano, a state of the art subsea cable that promises to change how Africans experience the Internet. It also included a fund for African startups and SMEs among other things.\n\nAt the 2022 Google I/O conference, the tech giant made some exciting announcements that seemingly made all its previous announcements come full circle. In an unprecedented move, Google invited Techpoint Africa for a chat with its CEO to address issues on Google\u2019s innovative efforts in Africa.\n\nIf you just started following tech stories in 2021, it would probably surprise you to know that Google has been launching a number of initiatives across Africa with a majority of them geared toward connectivity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ve had the defunct Google free WiFi initiative and Project Loon. One involved installing stations to access the Internet for free, while the other sought to make use of the air balloons to beam Internet signals to remote locations in Kenya.\n\nIn 2019, Google opened its first African artificial intelligence lab in Accra, Ghana to solve basic everyday problems for Africans. Some of these solutions were AI models deployed on phones to diagnose crop diseases.\n\nThe following year, Google launched plus codes, a unique identifier that was basically a street address for people who don\u2019t have one. For a continent like Africa with a fragmented addressing system, this had numerous benefits for different sectors like logistics, health, and governance (read census and elections).\n\nDespite all these initiatives, Sundar Pichai still believes that Google should be doing more for Africa.\n\n\u201cWe have a renewed focus on Africa. In some ways, we\u2019re using a template which has worked well in other countries. For instance, in other parts of the world, we\u2019ve announced a focused development fund, over a period of time. And which works on many pillars like small businesses, digital skilling, AI centres and talent.\u201d\n\nRecall that in January 2022, Google announced a $1 billion fund in India to provide affordable access to smartphones and speed up the uptake of cloud computing. This is eerily similar to the $1 billion Africa development fund which Pichai says has been a big focus for the company.\n\nWhile the Indian fund saw the company partner with Bharti Airtel, its recent launch of Equiano has seen partnerships with up to 10 major African telcos. The focus on networking and the launch of a product development centre in Kenya also hints at a major cloud computing future.\n\nBeyond connectivity, Google\u2019s efforts are seemingly geared toward plugging infrastructure gaps in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Google maps have ever left you stranded before, that\u2019s mainly a symptom of Africa\u2019s informal housing system which we referenced above. According to the World Bank, African cities face a major housing challenge with the increase in urban slums. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 20% of the people living in slums.\n\nIn 2021, the tech behemoth used Artificial Intelligence to map up to 300 million buildings in Africa, five times more than the 60 million recorded in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re opening up the datasets for the World Bank and the United Nations so they can use this data for their programs,\u201d Google\u2019s CEO reveals, adding that, \u201c the moment is right for Africa and increasing Internet penetration, the entrepreneurship we\u2019re seeing, and access to technology and training will position it well.\u201d\n\nOn Google\u2019s platforms in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Google\n\nBesides infrastructure plays, one of Google\u2019s iconic platforms, the Android OS is incredibly popular in Africa. Stats counter states that more than half of African smartphone users use the Android platform.\n\nHowever, Google\u2019s flagship Android phone, Google Pixel, has struggled to make inroads in Africa.\n\nAt the Google I/O conference, the company announced the addition of several initiatives including the Pixel 6a which officially costs just a little more than \u20a6200,000 ($499). But if the pricing of the Pixel 6 gives us any indication, then it would be significantly more expensive in Nigeria. For context, the Pixel 6 officially cost \u20a6250,000 ($599) at launch, but Nigerian retailers typically sold the pixel between \u20a6400,000 \u2013 \u20a6500,000 ($1,000 \u2013 $1,200).\n\nPichai revealed that supply constraints have prevented the Pixel from fully launching in Africa and several other countries.\n\n\u201cWhen you do hardware, it\u2019s not enough, if you launch in a country. You have to invest in a supporting cast of things. You need to have retail partnerships, you have to have deep carrier partnerships, you have to make sure some localized content is available, and you have to make sure you have a marketing program that works in that country.\u201d\n\nPichai says the focus has been on scaling it country by country. Spreading Pixel to Europe, India, and Japan. However, Africa might need a very different strategy.\n\n\u201cPixel is at a higher price point for Africa, so the work we\u2019re doing with original equipment manufacturers is very very important, and that has become a big, big focus for us as well.\u201d\n\nAt $499 The Pixel 6a is the cheapest in Google\u2019s latest phone lineup. By comparison, the global behemoth, Samsung, retails the Galaxy AO3 at \u20a645,000 ($108). Pichai\u2019s statement foreshadows more affordable pixel phones that would be targeted at the African market.\n\nHowever, Africa still has a long way to go regarding innovation, and Google appears to be playing the long game for now. Its fledgeling YouTube creator program, and its privacy policies which have allowed loan sharks to run amok present positive and negative aspects of using Google\u2019s products in Africa. From all indications, Africa is about to hit a new era with big tech.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and narrator of technology, business and policies in Africa . Looking to chat?

          "title": "How Joram Mwinamo has helped Kenyans make sense of their businesses since 2007",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn California, it\u2019s Silicon Valley. In Kenya, it\u2019s Silicon Savannah. There are many Silicon Savannahs in Africa. Just think of major African cities with tech hubs, and you\u2019re there. Interestingly, this article is about Joram Mwinamo, someone who is actively participating in the evolution of tech businesses in Kenya and has been part of the entrepreneurship ecosystem since 2007.\n\nIf you spend ten minutes with Joram, he\u2019ll spend eight talking about tech\u2019s potential and how he\u2019s been helping businesses tap into it by helping them make sense of the problem from a human angle.\n\n\u201cHaving that good understanding of human problems and being able to break them down, and then create solutions, and walk backwards to create technology to address the problems, based on the technology that you build, you find that now you\u2019re able to extract data, speed up certain processes, [and] have objective information.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nJoram is a seasoned Kenyan entrepreneur who runs with a school of thought that if a founder is only good at building a product and terrible at everything else, it will affect the startup\u2019s overall success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably one of those people, who, even when we have an extended technology discussion, I discuss more of the non-technology than the technology itself because I find that a lot of technologists look at the tools and solutions a bit too much. I come from a philosophy of looking at the real problems first and then seeing what kind of technology will be helpful in solving it.\u201d\n\nIt was around this that he created his lofty plan \u2014 building 5,000 consortiums across the world. Now, we have to answer a few questions: What drives Joram? What\u2019s unique about his approach? What\u2019s his background? How far has he come?\n\nSetting the ball rolling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nIf you ask Joram about himself, 80% of the time, he\u2019s instinctively talking about how he has played and is still playing his part to support the Kenyan entrepreneurship ecosystem. But that is not all there is to know about him.\n\nDuring our chat, he fondly remembered the small beginnings; however, he is proud of how far he has come. In a little over a decade, Kenya has become a hotspot for the big guns. The country\u2019s capital, Nairobi, houses Microsoft\u2019s first Africa Development Centre, Google\u2019s proposed first Product Development Centre on the continent, and Amazon\u2019s planned AWS Local Zone launch.\n\nGrowing up in a middle-class family in Nairobi, Joram studied computer science at Egerton university. This leaves one wondering why anyone would make such a decision in 2002 when the potential of tech and the importance of the Internet were not appreciated in Africa yet.\n\n\u201cI realise I was introduced to technology a bit early. Because of that experience, I did have some exposure to coding quite early and gotten comfortable with technology. Where my dad, in the work that he used to do, was a civil servant, but somehow he linked up with some South African consultancy, and as a result, we ended up with one or two computers at home, and one was like a mini-computer, and the other one was like one of those really early laptops. I remember tinkering around with it. This was maybe 1995/96.\u201d\n\nAs an undergraduate, his involvement with AIESEC paved the way. The organisation, which focuses on cultural exchange and professional and leadership development, allowed him to work outside his country for two years as a graduate: first in Uganda as a project manager and then in Norway.\n\n\u201cAnd then, when I came back to Kenya, I was still not clear whether I would continue being employed or run a business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before he knew what he wasn\u2019t interested in doing \u2014 being employed for a hardcore tech role. Together with a friend who had a similar tech background, Joram registered a management consulting company called WYLDE International in 2007 after discovering that businesses face challenges primarily because of their owners\u2019 mindsets.\n\nOf drive and eccentricity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nInstead of focusing on hardcore tech requiring coding and building products with his computer science degree, Joram and his friend chose to solve human problems differently by helping businesses make sense of their solutions and unique value propositions. Today he is chasing his passion full steam ahead, with everything he has done to date in pursuit of this dream.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious about Joram\u2019s drive, it is majorly about serving others.\n\n\u201cI kept seeing a gap on the human side of interaction with technology. I have always seen that people could be excellent at the technology aspect of building up the codes but terrible at understanding the problems that that code is supposed to go and solve. I\u2019ve been very passionate about promoting individual local solutions to the challenges that businesses face and helping them access the kind of solutions that would help them to grow.\u201d\n\nWith more clients coming in for management consulting, Joram discovered the problem runs deeper than that; it was only a matter of time before Joram decided to do something bigger. And in 2020, Joram co-founded SNDBX, an entrepreneur support hub \u2014 an upgrade from WYLDE. Being ambitious, he needed to create something that would help similarly ambitious entrepreneurs avoid mistakes while building and scaling their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe have a bit of a unique setup. What would traditionally be looked at as an incubator/accelerator? What we have in addition is that we also bring together about 33 different professional services under one roof so that as people build their businesses, they also look for access to things like legal services, governance, HR, marketing, branding, literally everything. We\u2019re able to avail those services as well, and so people can build holistic services that can grow and scale. And of course, this being Nairobi, a lot of these businesses are in the tech space, but we also deal with quite a number of businesses outside of that as well.\u201d\n\nJoram calls it a consortium. Think of it this way, you have an idea for a soon-to-launch business in Kenya, and you need professional advice. When you arrange a meeting with Joram or any of his nine team members and have a discussion, you can access recommended professional services immediately because they are all under the same roof.\n\nA quick reminder that even before SNDBX, Joram was always all about entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch.\n\nAnd this is where his story gets a bit interesting; Joram is not always excited about new technologies because he\u2019s all for the useful tech elements that have a return on investment. However, he has remained relevant by keeping up with the latest trends, especially how they key into the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cEven though I couldn\u2019t code to save my life today, I would be very comfortable in a technology solution conversation, and probably being able to then make the best decision around, for example, which language or which platform or which hardware or software would be best to tackle a specific type of solution.\n\n\u201cI read local and international magazines about just what\u2019s happening out there. I\u2019m subscribed to quite a number of forums online that talk about the trends of what\u2019s happening almost on a daily basis. The podcasts that I listen to, of different authorities around the world or YouTube videos that I watch keep me sufficiently updated.\u201d\n\nSomewhere down the line, Joram picked up and developed human-centred design skills, which he considers very important to what he does.\n\n\u201cCertain human behaviours look simple but understanding them makes [them] more valuable\u2026 and I find out that a lot of people take such thing[s] for granted.\u201d\n\nOf gains and keeping it together\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoram Mwinamo. CEO/Co-founder SNDBX. Source: Supplied\n\nHe\u2019s excited about the prospects that Africa\u2019s local challenges present. In a breath, he mentioned different ideas he\u2019s been playing around with for Africa\u2019s informal sector: something to make payment seamless for the hawker in traffic, an inventory system for a second-hand clothing vendor, or a solution to fund Africa\u2019s communal life.\n\nUnsurprisingly, stories about how he has helped different businesses steer themselves towards success are at the top of Joram\u2019s success list. He is proud to be helping the continent create more entrepreneurs building multinationals and startups that have gone beyond the continent\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cFor me, one of the most fulfilling things is to see an entrepreneur translate the knowledge that they are learning into actions within the business and then begin to see the growth and hire more business people.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he\u2019s sometimes limited by the challenges facing businesses on the continent.\n\nJoram agrees that being a husband and father of four while being stretched at work can be challenging, but he seems to be managing alright. On a regular day, he drops his kids at school before heading to work, where he meets with his team and customers, responds to emails, and does work-related reading.\n\nDoing most of his work on his phone definitely helps, so he\u2019s available to respond to work in real-time and get things out of the way by delegating while on the move. Evenings are for spending time with his family, exercising, listening to podcasts, and reading; he\u2019s currently writing a book about entrepreneurship which he plans to launch this year.\n\nBy the way, there\u2019s something interesting about how he can maintain a work-life balance. He is calendar-driven, but while calendar scheduling is highly recommended for time management, Joram optimises it to prioritise his family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had to have that philosophy of building in the rocks first. If you look at my digital calendar, I have built in all I do with my family first; those are already built into my calendar, and a lot of people find it surprising that I keep it in my calendar. After building all the family stuff, then I\u2019ll now come back and build in the important work meetings that are recurring. Then after that is when I plan everything else. I also try to have a one-week holiday every quarter.\u201d\n\nWhatsApp and notepad also come in handy to keep communication going and log ideas. Meanwhile, he dreams of a time when there would be 5,000 SNDBXs across major cities worldwide.\n\n\u201cIf I live long enough, we plan to have a SNDBX in every continent, in every country possible. So, the number I have in my head is 5,000 SNDBXs across the world. All the way in the different cities in China, in South America, in the US, in Europe.\u201d\n\nBut he fears not being able to implement the ideas in his head before time runs out. He agrees that this makes him uncomfortable with slow execution.\n\nTalking of his philosophy, Joram says, \u201cAs I\u2019ve grown older, I\u2019ve realised that a lot of what we\u2019re unable to achieve is maybe because of pride or ego, not being able to ask for help. So, I find myself nowadays asking for help a lot and very quickly and very early rather than trying to struggle at something that I\u2019m not very good [at] doing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain-based company, Vault Hill, has launched its NFT marketplace with the public sale of land in its human-centric metaverse, Vault Hill City (VHC). The ongoing sale is being held auction style using its native token, $VHC.\n\nAs part of the land sale, a free HTC VIVE Flow VR glasses will be given per parcel of land bought. However, to ensure scarcity and value, a limited number of virtual land (VLAND) parcels have been made available for purchase due to the high number already sold during the private sale round.\n\nLand parcels are currently being sold in the Vitality and Play districts of the metaverse, and using Vault Hill\u2019s interactive map, prospective land buyers and those who already participated in the private land sale can view which districts still have available VLAND. The map can also be used to explore the brands and creators that have already purchased land in the metaverse.\n\nThe VHC land parcels are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) built on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC-721) which are unique and distinct. The land has been grouped into four categories\u2013 standard, premium, deluxe and exclusive \u2013 each with their own unique offering.\n\nThe exclusive land type for instance can be merged to form a cluster of up to 8 land parcels, and it also has a courtyard in its center. Not only will Exclusive landowners benefit from a prime location, but owners of all 8 parcels that form a cluster have a unique advantage of monetising the courtyard to the limits of their imagination. Owners could erect a billboard in the courtyard, or even stadiums, conference centers, art installation, etc.\n\nOne of the many benefits of being a virtual land owner in VHC is that VHC is the first virtual world that combines all aspects of users\u2019 reality leveraging seven basic human instincts to enhance experiences in the metaverse. It is also the first virtual world with urban planning and development benefits to ensure users build on their virtual land respectfully.\n\nAdditionally, land owners will be given a \u2018NO CODE\u2019 builder tool which gives them total creative freedom to build their desired edifice without having to learn a single line of code. These edifices could range from cinemas, fitness studios, museums, libraries, event centers, etc. There are limitless opportunities for land owners in VHC be it individual investors or brands seeking to establish their presence in web3.\n\nVisit Vault Hill\u2019s marketplace now for your chance to own a piece of the world\u2019s first human-centric metaverse. Further information regarding the land sale can be found here and the metaverse development timeline can be viewed in the whitepaper. Updates can be gotten in real-time via the social pages \u2013 Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, Discord\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaverse, a Cardano ecosystem accelerator established to foster the growth of crypto-native projects in Africa, today announced its investment into a seed funding round for Cassava Network, a blockchain infrastructure that empowers African content creators, developers, and end-users through mutually aligned tasks and incentives. Over 40 investors, including Dragonfly, CMT Digital, YGG, Mirana, etc., participated in the recently closed investment round to implement the next phase of Cassava platform development.\n\nAdaverse was launched in September 2021 as a joint venture partnership between EMURGO Africa and Everest Ventures, to identify and provide valuable support resources to promising African founders building the next wave of Web3 dApps in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and metaverse tools on Cardano\u2019s third-generation and environmentally-sustainable blockchain.\n\nWhat is Cassava Network?\n\nCassava is a blockchain infrastructure that connects developers and users to the Web3 ecosystem. Through its native token CSV, Cassava transforms any web application into a crypto-enabled app suitable to reward contributors and end-users for their dedication. Their product offering consists of token rewards networks, digital identification systems, user-controlled data profiles, and a crypto and NFT wallet specifically designed to empower content creators.\n\nAs such, Cassava is a new incentives platform for Africans and the regional market, as CSV will enable projects, content creators including NFT artists, video creators, and content consumers to earn rewards in innovative ways through play-to-earn, create-to-earn, and engage-to-earn models. Additionally, it will offer CSV holders a portfolio of incentives, including lending, staking, AMM, and voting rights for platform governance.\n\nWhy Cassava Network?\n\nCassava offers a unique opportunity for African creatives to build digital economies, protect their intellectual properties and connect with the global market at large, through an easy-to-use multifunctional wallet that can be integrated with apps for user incentivization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cassava Network\u2019s PR Director, Kelin said \u201cCassava Network will use the investment capital to expand and improve its technological capabilities in order to leverage the Web3 economy to drive crypto mass adoption across Africa and beyond. The next phase of Cassava development will include a multi-chain wallet that incentivizes users, an African-focused NFT Marketplace, and a rewards system that pays users for transacting and using apps in Cassava\u2019s ecosystem. \u201d\n\nThe market opportunity in the African creative space is enormous. Africa has one of the youngest and fastest-growing populations, as well as the highest proportion of entrepreneurs among its working-class adults. Cassava is designed for the innovative youth seeking pan-African connectivity, and a global reach that will translate into sustainable, income-generating opportunities.\n\nWith regards to the global blockchain market, Africa alone is expected to possess a 30% market share and grow from a $1.1 billion market in 2020 to a $134.9 billion market by 2028.\n\n\u201cEMURGO Africa is excited to support the development of Cassava Network\u2019s innovative content rewards ecosystem. We firmly believe Africa is a huge market full of bright potential that can lead the way to spur large user growth and demonstrate the real benefits of a flourishing Web3 economy,\u201d said Shogo Ishida, Executive Director for the Middle East & Africa at EMURGO Africa.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about this partnership, which will help fund the revolutionary DeFi tool, which enables mobile applications to migrate to web 3.0 functionality that rewards content creation and user engagement. We are inspired and driven by projects with a strong use case, a resilient founder, and a long term vision to bring change to socio-economic challenges in Africa\u201d said Vincent Li Founding Partner at Adaverse.\n\nAbout Adaverse\n\nAdaverse is a Cardano-focused joint accelerator initiative \u2014 set up with the collaboration of EMURGO Africa, a subsidiary of EMURGO, the official commercial arm of the Cardano protocol, and Everest Ventures Group, a leading blockchain industry accelerator \u2014 looking to build the infrastructure of the projected $139.4 billion African blockchain market by 2028.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called for doctors\u2019 collaboration to sustain reforms in the healthcare sector, ensuring a resilient and equitable system to deliver efficient, quality and affordable healthcare services to Edo people.\n\nObaseki gave the charge when he received the new executives of the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) at the Hospital Management Agency, who were on a courtesy visit at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nThe governor, who noted that he is pursuing a holistic reform in the sector and putting in place mechanisms to discourage manpower for healthcare delivery from leaving the country, urged the doctors to support the government\u2019s effort at strengthening the system and curbing the brain drain in the health sector.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe need more doctors, particularly with the way the doctors are traveling out for greener pastures. What we need is to strengthen the institutions that produce doctors. We are strengthening our educational system to produce more doctors.\u201d\n\nNoting that his administration is tackling the age-old challenges in the health sector such as dearth of modern medical equipment, decaying healthcare infrastructure, inadequate personnel and poor funding, Obaseki stated, \u201cThe system we inherited and structure put in place at that time was meant for that time but today the society has changed, leading to the reforms in our medical sector. We must rethink the sector we inherited.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cMedical healthcare is global and standardized and as such, we need to measure up. We need to restructure our healthcare system in the state. The COVID-19 pandemic is an eye-opener for us as everyone was restricted from moving around. The lesson is that we must fix our healthcare system.\n\n\u201cWe have insisted on healthcare reforms. This is why I brought down the central hospital to decentralize the healthcare system in the state, ensuring that there is at least one healthcare facility in every community to ensure healthcare is closer to the people.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on how to produce more doctors by strengthening the basic education system and giving quality education to produce more doctors for the state. We need more than 200 new doctors in the system, who will be in the community to take charge of the PHCs across the state and must be motivated and encouraged to stay here.\u201d\n\nReacting to the doctor\u2019s request to be included in the N40,000 new minimum wage, the governor said, \u201cDoctors are special breeds of civil servants and earn more and should not be asking for minimum wage. You are civil servants but the only set of civil servants who earn more than the governor. A consultant in your system earns twice what I earn as a governor. Why should you be asking for minimum wage? What the government did is to help those at the bottom because people go through a lot every day.\n\n\u201cThe wage is to help those at the bottom to pass the poverty threshold. Certainly, there are allowances due to you but subject to negotiation. We don\u2019t like making promises we cannot fulfill as a government. This is one of the quarrels we have with the federal government. You can\u2019t go and negotiate a labour contract and impose it on us.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Edo, we respect labour which is why we have not had any strike regarding allowances or wages in the state as the welfare of our workers is important to us,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the leader of the delegation and president of the association, Dr. Uaboi Ovbiagele commended the governor for the holistic reforms in the healthcare sector, pledging their support to sustain reforms in the sector.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We are a democratic party and the fact that some governors have in the past imposed candidates can not be a justification for us to continue to perpetuate anti-democratic (acts).\n\n\u201cThey should not bamboozle people, they should not intimidate, they should not do anything that will compromise the right to fairness in bringing in new candidates.\u201d\n\nShittu said the 2023 election would be different from the previous ones as there are stronger candidates on parade now.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, it was essentially a two-party affair but this year, with what we have seen with the NNPP coming up, with Labour Party coming up with a very strong candidate in Peter Obi. We must appreciate that actions will naturally have consequences.\n\n\u201cWe must learn from our circumstances, we must learn from our environment and know that it may not be as easy as we think.\n\n\u201cWe must also be warned now that the youths are coming up, stronger and more agitated for change.\n\n\u201cWe must be able to give the impression to the general public, particularly the youths, that we are being fair to all aspirants and that as democrats, as progressives, we are not giving the impression that some people are being overpampered above others.\u201d",

He lost a lucrative sponsorship deal and selection for France, AFP reported.\n\nThe Premier League player arrived at court surrounded by burly minders to face a scrum of waiting media and a person dressed up as a cat.\n\nAs he went inside, the lone demonstrator gave him a thumbs down.\n\nDistrict judge Susan Holdham told Zouma and his younger brother Yoan, who filmed the incident, that their actions were \u201cdisgraceful and reprehensible\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou must be aware that others look up to you and many young people aspire to emulate you,\u201d she said but accepted that both expressed \u201cgenuine remorse\u201d.\n\nKurt Zouma pleaded guilty last month to two counts under the Animal Welfare Act of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.\n\nAs well as the community penalty and ban on keeping cats, he was told to pay court costs of nearly \u00a39,000.\n\nYoan Zouma, 24, admitted one count of aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring his older brother to commit an offence.\n\nHe was sentenced to 180 hours of community service.\n\nYoan, a lower-league footballer, sent the video to a woman he was due to go on a date with but she called off the meeting after seeing the footage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think hitting a cat like that is OK \u2014 don\u2019t bother coming today,\u201d she told him.\n\nThe Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which brought the prosecution, has called the brothers\u2019 actions \u201cshocking\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe hope this case will serve as a reminder that all animals deserve to be treated with kindness, compassion and respect, and that we will not tolerate cruelty by anybody,\u201d said RSPCA chief inspectorate officer Dermot Murphy.\n\nWest Ham said after the case that it condemned \u201cin the strongest terms any form of animal abuse or cruelty\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis type of behaviour is unacceptable and is not in line with the values of the football club,\u201d it added in a statement.\n\n\u201cWithin 48 hours of the footage emerging, we fined Kurt the maximum available to the club,\u201d it said. The money had been donated to animal welfare groups, according to AFP report.",

For instance, the minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said Nigerians spend between $1.2 and $1.6 billion on medical tourism, adding that it is a huge drain on the country\u2018s foreign reserves.\n\nTo add to this is the huge brain drain that is rocking the health sector, especially in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMember of the Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria (SOGON), Dr. Abayomi Ajayi tells LEADERSHIP that the near total collapse of the health sector is imminent in the face of the need for medical professionals all over the world in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAjayi said nations of the world have been adversely affected by the pandemic, adding that Nigeria and a few other countries are providing the manpower to keep their population alive at the expense of our own citizenry.\n\nWhen asked why they are leaving in troops, Ajayi said, \u201eMany of them want a better life for themselves; Better salaries and allowances\n\nBetter opportunities for research; Better opportunities in career advancement and adoption of modern techniques and technologies; Opportunities for family relocation to greener pastures; Living a better life; No power failure, better transportation lower incidence of crime, kidnapping, herdsmen attack the list is endless.\u201c\n\nAs effort to reverse medical tourism and brain drain in the health sector, Lai Mohammed, said the federal government is revamping the sector, to make it appealing for health professionals in Nigeria and abroad to work.\n\nMohammed recalled that, in the wake of COVID-19, the CBN set up the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, now expanded to N200 billion, to provide credit support for the healthcare sector through long-term, low-cost financing.\n\n\u201eYou are also aware of the Federal Government\u2019s Intervention in the Healthcare Sector through the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).

          "title": "Revealed! Why Bala failed to back Atiku at PDP primaries",
          "text": "Reasons have emerged on why Bauchi state Governor Abdulkadir Bala Mohammed did not step down for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar during the recently concluded presidential primaries of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAtiku emerged the party\u2019s candidate for the 2023 general elections scoring 371 votes ahead of his closest challenger, Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike who polled 237 votes and former Senate President Bukola Saraki got 70 votes.\n\nAkwa Ibom state Governor Emmanuel Udom scored 38 votes, Governor Bala had 20 votes while another former Senate President and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) garnered 14 votes.\n\nThe media has been awash with stories of how Governor Bala and Saraki allegedly defied top northern leaders who tried prevailing on them to dump their ambition and support Atiku.\n\nThe duo were however said to have refused and chose to press on with their ambition, while Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal heeded the call and declared his support for the former vice president at the last minute.\n\nAlthough the former vice president had visited Wike after the contest, the Rivers has expressed his angst over his loss.\n\nFor instance, he was reported to have said during a reception welcoming him back home after the primaries, that \u201cIf I wanted to scuttle the convention, I would have done that and I told them. There are people you think are human beings but they are not human beings,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have never seen how people can violate procedures and guidelines. Somebody had spoken, it is only at that point he was speaking that he can say I have withdrawn. You don\u2019t call him back.\u201d\n\nBala\u2019s action explained\n\nBut three days after the exercise, an insight has been provided into reasons Governor Bala chose to carry on with his ambition as against the call by some northern leaders.\n\nTracing the development to the consensus trip which took the quartet of Bala, Saraki, Tambuwal and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen-all presidential aspirants- round the country, the source said: \u201cIn line with the agreement by those who participated in the search for a consensus candidate: Hayatu-Deen, Tambuwal, Bala Mohammed and Bukola Saraki, each aspirant had his own agenda driving him.\n\n\u201cStepping down would presuppose that the various agenda would have been discussed and aligned before such a decision. That was not done. To simply step down peremptorily would mean accepting wholesale, the agenda of the beneficiary of such a decision.\n\n\u201cApart from representing a vision, no aspirant comes to an election alone. It would amount to disrespecting members of one\u2019s team and indeed betraying them, to mount the podium, as Tambuwal did, to announce stepping down, without any discussion with key stakeholders of one\u2019s team. Bala Mohammed is a team player who genuinely carries members of his team along. If anyone expected him to act like Tambuwal who has a history of betraying political opponents, such a person would be very wrong.\u201d\n\nWhile also faulting the timing, the top party source said: \u201cWith pressure on the aspirants from a certain section of the country, in the full glare of the public, to step down for Atiku, Bala saw it as offending everything he has stood for, as a nationalist and constitutionalist. Though no section of the Constitution was breached, to him, such a public show would further polarize the country as it has indeed done.\n\n\u201c A review of Bala Mohammed\u2019s celebrated nationalist role in the ascension of President Goodluck Jonathan to the presidency will explain why, under the circumstance of Wike\u2019s push, it would have been very difficult for him to step down in a manner that could be interpreted as checkmating an aspirant because of his origin.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Bala Mohammed had moved against opposition to Jonathan\u2019s ascension to the presidency by moving the historic Doctrine of Necessity Motion that gave Jonathan the legitimacy to step into the office of President, first in acting capacity and subsequently, in substantive capacity.\u201d\n\nDamage to party unity\n\n\u201cOne only needs to see the protests of Wike, to appreciate the damage done to party unity and the unity of the country by such a brazen display of parochial political strategy.\n\n\u201cBala also loathed the possibility of going into the election fractionalized, a development that will give the ruling APC a roller coaster to retain the presidency.\n\n\u201cObviously, Atiku understands the implications and has quickly swung into action to douse the tension and restore a semblance of unity, going forward,\u201d it was further gathered.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari to APC governors, stakeholders: Allow me pick my successor",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has charged governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to ensure the forthcoming convention to pick a presidential candidate reflects all the values and virtues of the party.\n\nThe president also told the governors that like they did in determining who succeeds them, they should also give him the honour of allowing him pick his successor.\n\nHe spoke Tuesday at a meeting with the 22 APC governors and National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, held at the State House in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am delighted to address this gathering of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum as part of the consultative processes that have always strengthened the internal dynamics of our Party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cYou will all recall that APC came to power at the centre in 2015 through cohesive machinery, notwithstanding its status as the opposition party. Similarly, in 2019, it was returned to power under my leadership, because of the dividends of democracy delivered to Nigerians irrespective of their political leanings.\n\n\u201cThe Party has since grown in strength and capacity to govern. The key to both electoral successes is the ability of the party to hold consultations and for its members to put the nation above other interests.\n\n\u201cThe transition processes for the 2023 General Elections have commenced in earnest and I note that the most successful Political Parties globally have always relied on their internal cohesion and a strong leadership brand to achieve bigger electoral fortunes. Our party, the APC, shall not be any different, more so as we are still implementing the blueprint for a more prosperous nation.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with the established internal policies of the Party and as we approach the Convention in a few days, therefore, I wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the Governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cAs I begin the final year of my second term as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and leader of the Party, I recognise the compelling need for me to provide stronger leadership to the Party under this transition process and to ensure that it happens in an orderly manner.\n\n\u201cSuch leadership is required so that the Party remains strong and united. It is also needed to improve our electoral fortunes by ensuring that it retains power at the centre, hold the great majority in various legislative chambers and also gain additional number of states at state levels.\n\n\u201cIn pursuit of the foregoing objectives, the Party has successfully established internal policies that promote continuity and smooth succession plans even at the state and local government levels. For example, first term Governors who have served credibly well have been encouraged to stand for re-election. Similarly, second term Governors have been accorded the privilege of promoting successors that are capable of driving their visions as well as the ideals of the party.\n\n\u201cIn a few days, the Party will be holding its Convention during which primaries would take place to pick the Presidential Flag Bearer for the 2023 General Elections. This is a very significant process and its outcome should prove to the world, the positive quality of the APC regarding democratic principles, culture as well as leadership.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the Convention, I appeal to all of you to allow our interests to converge, our focus to remain on the changing dynamics of our environment, the expectations of our citizens and the global community. Our objective must be the victory of our party and our choice of candidate must be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence even before the elections.\n\n\u201cOur objective must be the victory of our party and our choice of candidate must be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence even before the elections.\n\n\u201cIn keeping with the established internal policies of the Party and as we approach the Convention in a few days, therefore, I wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the Governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cI wish to assure you that the consultation process shall continue to ensure that all aspirants and stakeholders would be brought on board right through to the convention. This would also ensure that any anxiety occasioned by different factors are effectively brought under control and that our party emerges stronger.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo, others screened\n\nMeanwhile, the screening of APC presidential aspirants resumed Tuesday with former President Goodluck Jonathan and former Imo state Governor Rochas Okorocha conspicuously missing at the Transcorp Hilton venue of the screening exercise.\n\nBoth Jonathan and Okorocha indirectly and directly obtained the N100 million nomination forms to contest the ticket of the ruling party.\n\nWhile Okorocha is facing the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) battle, Blueprint, however learnt that the former President Jonathan travelled abroad for an international function.\n\nThe John Oyegun-led screening committee had attended to 12 aspirants Monday.\n\nThey include Jigawa state Governor Abubakar Badaru, former governor of Ogun state, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Pastor Tunde Bakare, former governor of Zamfara state, Senator Sani Yerima, APC national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; and former Rivers state Governor Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nOthers are former Minister of State for Education Emeka Nwajiuba; Mr Nicholas Felix; a female aspirant, Uju Ken-Ohanenye; Senator Ajayi Boroffice; a former Senate President Ken Nnamani; Governor David Umahi Ebonyi state.\n\nDay 2\n\nAmong the presidential aspirants screened on the second day are Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan; former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs Senator Godswill Akpabio and former Speaker House of Representatives Dimeji Bankole, and an oil magnate, Mr Tein Jack Rich.\n\nOthers include former Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation Dr Ogbonnaya Onu; Cross River state Governor Ben Ayade, Kogi state Governor Yahaya Bello, former Minister of Information under the late General Sani Abacha regime, Ikeobasi Mokelu.\n\nWhile the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr Akinwumi Adesina, publicly rejected the nomination forms bought for him, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, was not listed for the screening.\n\nGaya on Osinbajo\n\nSpeaking to newsmen after the screening, Director General Vice President Yemi Osinbajo Campaign Organisation, Senator Kabiru Gaya, said Osinbajo is the best among all the aspirants and the only one with capacity to defeat the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar.\n\nGaya said: \u201cWe are impressed by his qualifications and experience. He has been in the system for so many years as the vice president and he has acted also as a president. So, he\u2019s the most experienced aspirant in this race. We believe that he will be a candidate for the APC general elections and he is the only candidate that can beat Atiku Abubakar. That I\u2019m sure of.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Senator Akpabio told journalists that the exercise was rigorous.\n\n\u201cI think it is quite rigorous and the checklist is very good. At least, they will be able to know the aspirants in totality and also get their idea of how they are going to run the affairs of the country and take the country from the present level to the next level. The array of politicians I have seen there are people who are grassroots based,\u201d said the former Akwa Ibom state governor.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m ready to do Buhari\u2019s bidding\u2019\n\nAlso addressing journalists after taking his turn at the screening exercise, Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan declared that he was ready to step down for the preferred candidate of President Buhari.\n\nHe said all the presidential aspirants are members of the same political family, hence no controversy over whoever the president settles for.\n\nHowever, the lawmaker expressed optimism that he would emerge the choice candidate of the party.\n\n\u201cWe are sons and daughters of the same father and mother, those of us in APC, all of us who took the forms and to run for the highest office of the president believing in the same philosophy and ideology of our party. Therefore, we are one and the same thing. I will support anybody who the party and who the president thinks can do better for us. I have no problem with that. I want to also believe that at the end of the day, I will emerge,\u201d Lawal said.\n\nOn his impression of the screening, the lawmaker said: \u201cThe screening was very successful. I was asked very fundamental questions about our party\u2019s stands for, about what I believe that I can bring to the presidency of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOf course, our party stands for progress, national stability and what we have done in the last seven years as an administration, we have recorded so much successes across the country but we also have some challenges we have to deal with. As someone who is aspiring to be the candidate for APC and by the grace of God the president in 2023, I have gone through the nails.\n\n\u201cI have worked before I came into the National Assembly in 1999 and I am still in the National Assembly having served for eight years in the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cI chaired the two strategic, critical and very important committees of education and agriculture in the House and served as chairman of public account for eight years, served as chairman of Defence Committee in the Senate, served as Senate leader and served as presiding officer and Senate president today.\n\n\u201cI have worked very closely with Mr President Muhammadu Buhari in my capacity as Senate Leader. I know the issue of developments, where we have recorded so much successes, I know where we have to rework the tool and re-kit our system, strategy and operations. And by The Grace of God, if I am given the opportunity, Nigeria will experience improved education, security, economy and I want to reform the educational sector that will serve the sons and daughter of nobody so that we are able to take away from the street the 15 or so million out-of-school children.\n\n\u201cI want to see a situation where I will come as the elected party candidate and, of course, go ahead to defeat the PDP and other political parties to win the presidency for APC and for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nFresh crisis hits party\n\nIn the midst of all this, two members of the APC National Working Committee (NWC) have accused the party\u2019s national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu of taking unilateral decisions and using President Buhari\u2019s name to blackmail other NWC members.\n\nA statement signed Tuesday in Abuja, by the National Vice Chairman North-west, Malam Saliu Mohammed Lukman and the National Vice Chairman South-west, Isaac Kekemeke, called on all the APC leaders to call Adamu to order.\n\nThey said: \u201cWe are compelled to make this statement following serial postponement of the scheduled National Working Committee (NWC) meetings, twice within 48 hours. We are convinced beyond doubt that this is a deliberate attempt to foist a fait accompli on the NWC on fundamental issues that affect our great party.\n\n\u201cWithin just two months in the lifespan of the new leadership of our great party, APC, led by His Excellency, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the NWC, organ of the party vested with the power of managing the day-to-day affairs, including implementing decisions of the National Executive Committee (NEC), as provided in Article 13.4 of the APC Constitution, has been rendered redundant.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman takes decisions unilaterally. When it suits him, he invokes the name of our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari to blackmail NWC members into accepting his decisions. Every effort to get the Chairman to respect the authority of the NWC as elected by the March 26, 2022 APC National Convention is proving very difficult, if not impossible. Note that NEC\u2019s donation of its powers was to NWC and not to the National Chairman or any individual.\n\n\u201cWe therefore have no option but to make this public appeal to all APC leaders to intervene please urgently to call our National Chairman, His Excellency, Abdullahi Adamu to order, immediately.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman must be properly reminded to recognise that the business of managing the day-to-day affairs of the party is the responsibility of the NWC as provided in provisions of the APC Constitution. He is free to consult any party leader(s). Such consultations will not represent decisions of the NWC or any organ of the party unless and until it is adopted by a properly constituted meeting of the NWC or organ in question according to the letters and spirit of the APC constitution.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we have suffered enough judicial embarrassments arising from clearly avoidable leadership breach of our party\u2019s constitution and spelt out rules. As members of the NWC who have the mandate of our members, we hereby serve notice to His Excellency, Abdullahi Adamu, and through him to all APC leaders that henceforth, any decision taken by the National Chairman or any other party functionary, which require the approval of the NWC as enshrined in the APC constitution, will be considered as illegitimate and an infringement on the jurisdictional scope of the NWC, unless otherwise confirmed as validly approved decisions of the NWC or any other legitimate organ of the party.\n\n\u201cNo NWC member is elected at the March 26, 2022 National Convention to warm seats or offices in the National Secretariat. We therefore call on all our colleagues in the NWC to rise to these challenging situations by joining hands with us to save our great party and return it to its founding mission of moving Nigeria forward based on honest, fair, just and selfless commitment to party building. God bless our party.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Ahead of the June 18 governorship election in Ekiti state, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Tuesday assured that every vote of Ekiti electorate will count during the poll.\n\nThe commission also assured it would be neutral and stand by the obligatory mission of ensuring that no extraneous interferences were allowed to affect the credibility of the poll negatively.\n\nINEC Chairman Professor Mahmood Yakubu gave the assurance in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital during an interface with the Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers.\n\nAddressing the traditional rulers, Yakubu disclosed that a total of 989,202 voters had been registered in Ekiti by INEC, out of which over 740,000 had procured their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), in readiness for the electoral duel.\n\nThe INEC helmsman revealed that the commission would conduct the governorship poll alongside the botched Ekiti State Assembly bye election in Ekiti East Constituency 1.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal to all voters in Ekiti that their votes will count. We would still return to interact with other critical stakeholders on how to have peaceful election in Ekiti. The atmosphere now for the conduct of the 2022 election is so calm, unlike what we had in 2018.\n\n\u201cI asked myself what has changed, I was told the royal fathers had been working hard to ensure that the situation is calm and I could see it is really very calm.\n\n\u201cIn this election, there will be two ballot boxes in Ekiti East constituency 1, because they will elect their assembly representative together with the governor. There will be 16 political parties for the governorship election, but only two for the bye election in Ekiti East,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nSpeaking further, the INEC boss said: \u201cThe number of registered voters in Ekiti is 989,202. We expect the stake to go higher because people are still collecting their PVCs. Let me say that we are ready for the election. Our staff are being trained.\u201d\n\nYakubu added that the Bimodal Voters Authentication System (BVAS) invention had phased out the use of Incidence Forms and the malfunctioning Smart Card readers, for the conduct of elections.\n\n\u201cThe BVAS had been introduced and with this, smart card readers had been fully retired. As far as technology is concerned, there will be seamless and fantastic election in Ekiti. There was a mock election here on Monday across the state and the machine worked 100 percent.\n\n\u201cWhere the machine is unable to get the fingerprints, we will get the facial appearance of the voter. There won\u2019t be incidence form; we have abolished incidence form as well. INEC is not the political party. We don\u2019t have a candidate and all we want is leaving who leads Ekiti in the hands of the citizens and that we shall achieve.\n\n\u201cSo, we appeal to our traditional rulers to ensure peace. The atmosphere is peaceful and we want it to remain until the election is concluded. I assure you that the election will be credible, don\u2019t doubt the neutrality of INEC,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding, Chairman Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers, Oba Gabriel Adejumo, praised INEC for the voting registration exercise it had undertaken in the state, saying this would help in widening citizens\u2019 participations in the exercise.\n\nThe Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti, Oba Adebanji Alabi, tasked the INEC on the need to tackle the excessive monetisation of the electoral process.\n\nOba Alabi said: \u201cOur system must grow to allow those who are young, but competent, and who can pilot the affairs of the country very well to be allowed to exercise their rights.\n\n\u201cBut with the way things are going, I see that only the moneybags will be having their ways.

Our Human Resource Manager is Nigerian; our Office Manager is a Nigerian and our Shift Leader also is a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThese are top management positions. We train Nigerians to run the company; we are transferring technology to those who are brilliant. Today you may see some Chinese but next time you come you won\u2019t see Chinese, you will only see Nigerians here.\n\n\u201cWe want to share. Not like other foreign companies where all the top management staff are foreigners and Nigerians left to do the labour work. We have moved beyond that.\n\n\u201cWe have to treat Nigerians who have the desire to work with our company well and encourage them to build a career. We have administrators, we have technicians, we have general labour, we have managers and we have shift leaders.\n\n\u201cThis is just the beginning, later we will give them more platforms, maybe one day when we have branches in Kano, ECOWAS countries like Cameroun; we can send Nigerians there to be Directors. This is what we do. We grow together for a shared future. Right now, we have up to 150 staff but less than 20 are Chinese, the others are Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo for this factory, we are not only like a factory or company, we are also like a university. We sum it as a work chance or skill platform for local persons. We can train people. In a year, we can train a number of people that would contribute to the building of this great country.\n\n\u201cWe can increase our company\u2019s presence in Nigeria because we can source all our raw materials in Nigeria. And also we can make analysis for Nigeria building material markets. So, this product is new material but it has more advantages and so we have confidence. At the end of this year I am sure we will see good results.\n\n\u201cLet me add that the first person to come to Nigeria from our company didn\u2019t know what Fiber Cement Board was, but now we all know and we all love the product. I have confidence in Nigeria. As Eric, the Deputy Managing Director said, we want to work with universities to do some research about our product. We can share the platform for people to learn more in Universities and Polytechnics; we can share knowledge\u201d, Mr. Jackie added.\n\nOn Corporate Social Responsibility, he said the company has built roads for the host communities, built boreholes to help them have access to clean water; and rehabilitated some schools and roofing sheets for some of their buildings.",

The truth remains that people will throw up everything and anything. I am not particularly accepting that the process was monetized excessively, safe for those that can be proven. If you are looking for Political parties that dollarises and criminalises the process, it\u2019s APC. Nobody should try to blackmail or take anything from our primary that is adjudged to be best.\u201d\n\nMr Sowunmi who also spoke on the allegation that emergency of Atiku Abubakar as the candidate of the party is against the clamour for power shift to the South, said \u201cthe whole concept of zoning is a party affairs and must not be seen as constitutional. The country is divided into six zones and we must not just think it is three zones of the South against the north. The emergence of Atiku has not affected Nigeria\u2019s unity, rather the burden of unity lies with APC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the strengthen of its candidate, Mr Sowunmi stated that Atiku Abubakar is a pan-Nigerian who will represent the interest of all Nigerians irrespective of their tribe or religion.\n\nThe governorship candidate, however cautioned cultural groups like PANDEF, Arewa Consultative Forum, Afenifere and others to steer clear of political matters and allow political parties manage its affairs. \u201d I have advised that PANDEF, Arewa, Afenifere and others need to be told not to jump into political matters as if they are political parties. They should not be seen usurping the powers of political parties.\u201d\n\nOn whether the party has the capacity to manage the fallout of the presidential primary, Mr Sowunmi noted that PDP will reach out to everybody and reconcile all groups, while nothing that there are no dissenting voices.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the party to present a candidate. If there is an equity challenge, nobody should address that to PDP rather the APC, because it has only produced its president from the northwest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am telling Nigerians that politics is not for the lily-livered. What happened at the primary is that delegates voted for a unifier.\n\nOn zoning, Mr Sowunmi said \u201cI have maintained consistently that the place of birth is just an accident of history that no one can repair. The only equity challenge that we have is the Southeast because the region has not been able to produce president.\n\n\u201cSometimes, the political gladiators from the other side will always wish that only crises will exits from the camp of their rivals, but hello, you can go to the bank with this, the political process from \u2018tomorrow\u2019 will show that PDP is a big party. We\u2019ll hug ourselves and unite one another\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am telling Nigerians that your darling party is back, we have given you a darling candidate that you know well, Even with the congratulatory message from Asiwaju, it shows that he knows the worth of Atiku.

He\u2019s unlike many other aspirants who have been in and out of power. They are practically parts of the problems Nigeria is facing now. We can\u2019t continue with these set of people.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, women leader of the group, Mr Ngozi Chinonzo, thanked Dr Nicolas Felix for his commitment to the wellness and wellbeing of Nigerians irrespective of their tribe and religion. Mr Chinonzo promised to mobilise more support for the actualisation of the Dr Nicolas Felix\u2019s Presidential ambition. \u201cWe work till victory is achieved. We can\u2019t continue to recycle the same set of politicians who brought us to this present situation. Your excellency sir, you are young, vibrant and energetic, more importantly, you have the fear of God and we believe you will change the narrative for better.\u201d\n\nResponding, Dr Felix thanked the groups for their support and commitment towards a just society. He promised not to disappoint anyone if given the opportunity to fly the ticket of the party.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Nicolas Felix Felix on Monday was screened by the APC Presidential Screening Committee where he excellently responded to questions raised by the panel.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress will on 6th to 8th June hold its its special convention to elect the its flagbearer ahead of the 2023 presidential elections.",

          "text": "Rafael Nadal demonstrated once again why he is the greatest player in French Open history by beating long-time rival Novak Djokovic in a late-night thriller to reach the men\u2019s singles semi-finals.\n\nNadal, going for a 14th title, started superbly and fought off resistance from defending champion Djokovic to win 6-2 4-6 6-2 7-6 (7-4) at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal secured victory at 1:15am local time after over four hours on court.\n\nThe 21-time Grand Slam winner now faces third seed Alexander Zverev on Friday.\n\nGermany\u2019s Zverev, 25, reached the semi-finals for the second successive year after surviving teenage sensation Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s fightback earlier on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cTo win against Novak there is only one way: to play your best from the first point to the last,\u201d said 35-year-old Nadal, who thanked the Paris crowd for showing their \u201clove\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is one of those magic nights for me.\u201d\n\nVictory for fifth seed Nadal avenged his semi-final defeat by Djokovic last year and extended his all-time record on the Roland Garros clay to 110 wins in 113 matches.\n\nThe rivalry between the pair is the most enduring in men\u2019s tennis, with Nadal winning their 59th meeting seeing him narrow the gap to 30-29 in the head-to-head.\n\n\u201cNadal showed why he is a great champion and stayed mentally tough. No doubt he deserves it,\u201d said Djokovic.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller\n\nThis was a gripping, captivating match with some ferocious hitting and also human frailty on display.\n\nThe plot twists were numerous and startling: especially Djokovic fading in a fourth set he had led 5-2.\n\nPerhaps a lack of intense matches cost him. He did after all miss the Australian Open, Indian Wells and Miami and had not played a match longer than three sets since September\u2019s US Open semi-final.\n\nNadal\u2019s 29th win over Djokovic will only be truly significant if he goes on to win a 22nd Grand Slam title. And don\u2019t for one moment consider that a formality now even with Djokovic and Alcaraz are out of the draw.\n\nThe 35-year-old has spent eight and a half hours on court in his past two matches, and will be grateful for an extra day of rest before Friday\u2019s semi-final.\n\nShort presentational grey line\n\nFast start pays dividends for Nadal\n\nIn front of an adoring crowd, Nadal earned another memorable win on the court where he has enjoyed the greatest successes of his career.\n\nAt the end of last year the Spaniard thought he would have to retire because of a chronic foot problem and was hampered by the issue at the Italian Open earlier this month.\n\nA stress fracture of the rib also caused him to miss two months of the season shortly after his record-breaking 21st major win at the Australian Open.\n\nDespite turning 36 later this week, and needing five sets to beat Canada\u2019s Felix Auger-Aliassime on Sunday, he dug deep into his physical and mental reserves to beat top seed Djokovic.\n\nNadal blew Djokovic away in fast starts in both of the pair\u2019s matches at Roland Garros in 2020 and 2021 and, although those matches ended in different conclusions, he set out to do the same this time.\n\nThe left-hander played superbly in the first set, pinning Djokovic back in the court and punishing him with fizzing forehand winners.\n\nNadal took two of his four break opportunities, while saving both of Djokovic\u2019s two, to win a 50-minute opening set.\n\nHitting 12 winners compared to six unforced errors was a complete contrast to his slow start in the previous round against Auger-Aliassime.\n\nThat laid the platform for Nadal to eventually go on to reach a record 15th semi-final at Roland Garros.\n\n\u201cIt was an emotional night and I still play for nights like tonight,\u201d said Nadal, who won seven of 17 break points and saved eight of 12 for Djokovic.\n\n\u201cBut it is just a quarter-final and I still have a semi-final to come. I will stay emotionally stable and get ready for the semi-final.\u201d\n\nDjokovic unable to take chances\n\nWhile Nadal has had fitness issues, Djokovic\u2019s season has been disrupted by not being allowed to play in the Australian Open and tournaments in the United States because he was not vaccinated against Covid-19.\n\nThe 20-time Grand Slam champion looked to be heading towards peak form, winning the title in Rome and then not dropping a set at Roland Garros going into the quarter-finals.\n\nMany had thought playing the match in the colder night-time conditions would also favour the Serb.\n\nHowever, two-time champion Djokovic was far from his best after being overwhelmed by Nadal in the early stages.\n\nMaintaining his sky-high level proved to be the issue for Nadal in last year\u2019s semi-final, but the Spaniard broke again and moved into a 3-0 lead in the second set.\n\nWhile temperatures started to drop, Djokovic began to warm up and fought back to level at 3-3 after a sixth game lasting almost 19 minutes.\n\nLengthy games with few routine holds continued and the set eventually tipped in the favour of Djokovic when Nadal cracked a forehand long on the second set point.\n\n\u201cHe was the better player in the important moments, he started well and I didn\u2019t start so well,\u201d said Djokovic.\n\n\u201cI gained momentum in the second set and I thought I was back in the game. But he was able to take his tennis to another level.\u201d\n\nNadal broke to love at the start of the third set and moved into a 4-1 lead when a double fault from Djokovic was followed by the Serb dragging a crosscourt backhand wide.\n\nNadal served out for a two-sets-to-one advantage with few problems as time passed midnight in Paris and a chill whipped around the stands.\n\nYet few fans decided to leave and many of those who stayed were wrapped up in blankets.\n\nDjokovic broke for a 2-0 lead early in the fourth but missed two set points when serving at 5-3 and was punished when Nadal nailed a crosscourt forehand winner to put the set back on serve.\n\nMost of the 15,000-capacity crowd was supporting Nadal and their patience was rewarded when he dominated the tie-break to earn a stunning victory.\n\nNadal led 6-1 in the breaker and took his fourth match point with a driving backhand down the line before soaking up the acclaim of a jubilant Chatrier.\n\nBBC",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Tuesday revealed that it was collaborating with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United States Centre for Disease Control to see how Nigeria would access the global stockpile of Monkeypox vaccination to arrest the outbreak of the disease.\n\nThe government\u2019s move came just as the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Tuesday dismissed the allegations that it was operating biological laboratories with monkey pox virus in Nigeria.\n\nThe National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) which revealed the collaboration with the WHO, also disclosed that it has vaccinated 30,327,550 persons with the first dose.\n\nIt said that the figure of first dose vaccination represented 23.9 per cent of the country\u2019s eligible population, adding that 14,629,451 persons had also received their second dose.\n\nAccording to the agency, 18,291,072 had been fully vaccinated which represented 16.4 per cent of the country\u2019s eligible population, while 1,229,909 persons were said to have received their booster doses.\n\nThe Executive Director of NPHCDA, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, who spoke to journalists at the flag-off of COVID-19 vaccination at Community Pharmacies in Abuja, said the federal government is presently emphasising strict observation of public health safety measures to limit the spread of Monkeypox disease across the country.\n\nThe NPHCDA boss said the agency was working with the NCDC to make sure that all of the strategies to limit its spread were put in place.\n\n\u201cWe are also engaging the WHO and the United States Centre for Control to see how Nigeria can also access the global stockpile of Monkeypox vaccination.\n\n\u201d Until the vaccines are available, the government is emphasising the use of basic measures to limit the spread of Monkeypox disease,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe solicited the support of the media to sensitise Nigerians on ways to avoid being infected.\n\nWhile speaking on the rollout of vaccination in community pharmacies, Shuaib said the whole essence of collaboration with community pharmacists was to ensure that vaccination and immunisation activities are brought down to the grassroots levels for 24 hours per day.\n\nShuaib said the Federal Ministry of Health and the Presidential Steering Committee had launched the S.C.A.L.E.S 2.0 as one of the national strategies for COVID-19 vaccine rollout.\n\nHe explained that S.C.A.L.E.S. strategy entailed the expansion of vaccination sites beyond government health facilities to include private health facilities and community pharmacies in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cIt is as part of this laudable initiative that we are here today to officially launch this exciting collaboration between the Association of community pharmacists of Nigeria and the NPHCDA.\n\n\u201cCommunity pharmacies are one of the most easily accessible and frequently consulted points of care for healthcare service delivery by the public sector especially in underserved population due to their interconnectedness with the communities.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, for example, community pharmacies involvement in differentiated care and administration of antiretroviral medicines for HIV care have been shown to improve retention on treatment, adherence to medication, and overall better treatment outcomes,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib noted that community pharmacists contributed greatly during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic through ensuring the availability and distribution of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and hand sanitisers.\n\nHe said the synergy would enhance, \u201cour COVID-19 vaccination programme and help the country achieve herd immunity while strengthening the health care system and contributing to health security.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith over 6000 community pharmacies spread across the country, coupled with the ease of access and long operating hours, I believe this will contribute to rapidly increasing vaccination coverage.\n\n\u201d I am excited about this collaboration and I believe it will add zest to the country\u2019s effort to attain the national target of 70 per cent vaccination coverage that is necessary to achieve herd immunity,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Director of the Primary Healthcare Board in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Dr. Yakubu Mohammed charged members of the Association of Community Pharmacies of Nigeria to see the programme as an opportunity to help spread the message of vaccination to the rural populace and improve on the immunisation coverage in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, the NCDC has dismissed the allegations of operating biological laboratories with monkey pox virus in Nigeria.\n\nIt stated: \u201cA recent report on social media has come to our attention, said to have been released by the Chief of Russian Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Force, containing allegations.\u201d\n\nIt pointed out that the Russian had alleged that: \u201cthere are four US-controlled biological laboratories operating in Nigeria. That WHO reports that the Monkeypox (MPX) virus responsible for outbreaks in Europe and elsewhere was imported from Nigeria where the United States of America deployed its biological infrastructure. In order words, MPX virus is generated in these laboratories.\u201d\n\nReacting to the allegation, the NCDC said the statement was not backed by any evidence.\n\nIt also stated that, \u201cthe designation and activities of Nigerian public health laboratories are known to the supervising authorities, most of the laboratories having been procured and set up by the federal government in all 36 States and FCT for diagnostic purposes, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases.\n\n\u201cSome other laboratories are dedicated to the very successful HIV control program, managed by the federal government and her Partners, based on larger and longstanding bilateral and multilateral cooperation in public health, including prevention, diagnosis, surveillance, and control of diseases.\n\n\u201cAs a rule, Nigeria welcomes scientific cooperation with all foreign countries, and has received material support from the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan etc, and also discussed vaccine production with Russia. Collaboration between Nigeria and the United States has provided opportunities for technical assistance, capacity building, provision of equipment and field hospitals at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and funds to support health programmes, like HIV/AIDS, malaria elimination.\u201d",

Buhari made the appeal at a meeting in Abuja with the governors, which was also attended by other stakeholders.\n\nThe president said the governors should reciprocate the party\u2019s good gesture of allowing outgoing governors choose their successors in their respective states. He assured that his choice presidential candidate would give Nigerians a sense of triumph and confidence ahead of the general election, and promised to sustain ongoing consultations ahead of the primary election.\n\nBut a meeting of the governors immediately after the one with the president was deadlocked as they could not agree amongst themselves, whether the president\u2019s choice should come from the north or the south of the country.\n\nThe governors, who had met to see if they could resolve and agree amongst them, where the candidate should come from and if actually, they could recommend from amongst them, were still at their meeting in their early hours of Wednesday.\n\nBuhari\u2019s request, however, came as the simmering crisis in APC appeared to take another dimension, with members of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) accusing the APC national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, of rendering the NWC redundant.\n\nIn a related development, Nasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule cautioned members and supporters of APC against unguarded utterances about the party\u2019s primary elections in the state.\n\nAddressing APC governors, under the aegis of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), at a closed-door meeting at the State House, Abuja, also attended by Adamu and other stakeholders, the president said his desire to determine his successor was in line with established internal policies of the party, especially, as it approached the convention in a few days.\n\n\u201cI wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d Buhari said in the two-page address.\n\nHe said the party had successfully established internal policies that promoted continuity and smooth succession plans, even at the state and local government levels.\n\nThe president, who is also the national leader of the party, emphasised that first-term governors, who had served credibly, had been encouraged to stand for re-election, while \u201csecond term governors have been accorded the privilege of promoting successors that are capable of driving their visions as well as the ideals of the party.\u201d\n\nHe declared that APC\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2023 polls would be someone who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence ahead of the general election.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOur objective must be the victory of our party and our choice of candidate must be someone, who would give the Nigerian masses a sense of victory and confidence even before the elections.\u201d\n\nThe president further appealed to the governors \u201cto allow our interests to converge, our focus to remain on the changing dynamics of our environment, the expectations of our citizens and the global community.\u201d\n\nHe assured them that consultation would continue to ensure that all aspirants and stakeholders were brought on board right through to the convention, and anxieties were effectively brought under control.\n\nBuhari charged APC governors to ensure that the forthcoming convention to pick a presidential candidate reflected all the values and virtues of the party.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe processes for the 2023 general election have commenced in earnest and I note that the most successful political parties globally have always relied on their internal cohesion and a strong leadership brand to achieve bigger electoral fortunes. Our party, the APC, shall not be any different, more so as we are still implementing the blueprint for a more prosperous nation.\n\n\u201cAs I begin the final year of my second term as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and leader of the party, I recognise the compelling need for me to provide stronger leadership to the party under this transition process and to ensure that it happens in an orderly manner.\n\n\u201cSuch leadership is required so that the party remains strong and united. It is also needed to improve our electoral fortunes by ensuring that it retains power at the centre, hold the great majority in various legislative chambers, and also gain additional number of states.\n\n\u201cIn a few days, the party will be holding its convention during which primaries would take place to pick the presidential flag bearer for the 2023 general election. This is a very significant process and its outcome should prove to the world, the positive quality of the APC regarding democratic principles, culture as well as leadership.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the governors, the Kebbi State governor, and Chairman of PGF, Atiku Bagudu, said the party must build on the success of its recent elective convention, and the primaries conducted so far, \u201cand come up with a candidate, who will walk in the footsteps of patriotism and love for the country, which Mr President has shown. We will support Mr President to have a very successful convention.\u201d\n\nAdamu Has Rendered NWC Redundant, Taken Unilateral Decisions, Say Members\n\nMembers of the APC National Working Committee (NWC), on Tuesday, accused the party\u2019s national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, of rendering the NWC redundant and taking unilateral decisions. They warned that henceforth, any unilateral decision taken by Adamu or any other party functionary, which required the approval of the NWC, as enshrined in the APC constitution, would be considered as illegitimate and an infringement on the jurisdictional scope of the NWC, unless otherwise confirmed as validly approved decisions of the NWC or any other legitimate organ of the party.\n\nThe NWC members said no one was elected at the March 26, 2022 national convention to warm seats or offices at the national secretariat.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u201cAPC and the Need for Vigilance: Urgent Call for Intervention\u201d, and jointly signed by National Vice Chairman, North-west, Dr. Salihu Lukman, and National Vice Chairman, South-west, Mr. Isaacs Kekemeke, the NWC members lamented that within two months in the life of the Adamu-led leadership, critical decisions about the affairs of the party were being taken unilaterally by the chairman.\n\nThey expressed worry that all efforts to get the national chairman to respect the authority of the NWC had proved unsuccessful, adding that they are compelled to issue the statement following postponement of the scheduled NWC meetings twice within 48 hours. The party chieftains noted that they were convinced that the rescheduling was a deliberate attempt to foist a fait accompli on the NWC on fundamental issues that affect the party.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWithin just two months in the lifespan of the new leadership of our great party, APC, led by His Excellency, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the NWC, organ of the party vested with the power of managing the day-to-day affairs, including implementing decisions of the National Executive Committee (NEC), as provided in Article 13.4 of the APC Constitution, has been rendered redundant.\n\n\u201cThe national chairman takes decisions unilaterally. When it suits him, he invokes the name of our leader, President Muhammadu Buhari, to blackmail NWC members into accepting his decisions.\n\n\u201cEvery effort to get the chairman to respect the authority of the NWC, as elected by the March 26, 2022 APC National Convention, is proving very difficult, if not impossible. Note that NEC\u2019s donation of its powers was to NWC and not to the national chairman or any individual.\n\n\u201cThe national chairman must be properly reminded to recognise that the business of managing the day-to-day affairs of the party is the responsibility of the NWC, as provided in provisions of the APC constitution.\n\n\u201cHe is free to consult any party leader(s). Such consultations will not represent decisions of the NWC or any organ of the party unless and until it is adopted by a properly constituted meeting of the NWC or organ in question according to the letters and spirit of the APC constitution.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we have suffered enough judicial embarrassments arising from clearly avoidable leadership breach of our party\u2019s constitution and spelt out rules. No NWC member is elected at the March 26, 2022 national convention to warm seats or offices in the national secretariat.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on all our colleagues in the NWC to rise to these challenging situations by joining hands with us to save our great party and return it to its founding mission of moving Nigeria forward based on honest, fair, just, and selfless commitment to party building. God bless our party!\u201d\n\nSule to APC Members: Stop Unguarded Utterances on Primaries\n\nNasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule, ob Tuesday, cautioned APC members and supporters in the state against making unguarded utterances regarding the party\u2019s primary elections in the state. Sule said this against the backdrop of a negative impression being created in the media by party members who had expressed dissatisfaction with certain sections of the delegates list used for the primaries.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ibrahim Addra, Sule said, \u201cIt is important to state that the list of delegates used for the governorship primaries was not tampered with at all and the party\u2019s complaint was not in reference to the state\u2019s delegate list.\n\n\u201cThe noticeable changes of concern to the party leadership were only in respect of some wards in seven out of the 13 local government areas of the state. The party leadership at all levels will work together to find an amicable resolution of all issues of concern.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the insinuations and propaganda by some individuals that there was a dispute with the national secretariat of the party was unfortunate and far from the truth.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is worthy of reiterating that the primaries in most of the constituencies in the state were adjudged as transparent and peaceful. As a united APC family, we are confident that these minor internal issues will be resolved in no time.\n\n\u201cParty members should, irrespective of the results of the primaries, endeavour to close ranks and work for the unity and success of the party.\u201d\n\n\u2018APC Convention Shouldn\u2019t Be Another Dollar Rain\u2019\n\nA chieftain of the ruling APC, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, warned that the party had a high responsibility not to allow its presidential primaries and convention to become \u201canother dollar rain and a trading platform for the highest bidder.\u201d\n\nIn a statement from his media office in Abuja, Tuesday, Olawepo-Hashim explained \u201cthat our country is neither a commodity to be traded, nor a property to be auctioned and sold to the highest bidder,\u201d adding, \u201cNigerian presidency has never been for sale and should not be for sale now.\n\n\u201cThe PDP has demonstrated that it has learnt nothing, but as a party, the APC cannot follow her inglorious example. The next president of Nigeria must not be a Mafioso leader. Our president must not be a gangster. As a party in government, the APC has a sacred and patriotic duty to guide a disciplined transfer of power not one left in the hands of the god of mammon.\u201d\n\nAs the party of the sitting president, Olawepo-Hashim argued that a lot was expected from APC in terms of direction and leadership, adding that the government still has a lot of leverage and political enforcement mechanisms beyond money.\n\nThe former presidential candidate noted, \u201cNational interest is what should guide the choice of the APC and some of the urgent national imperative should include shortlisting a candidate that will heal the wounds of division in the country and finding also a vice that will complement him/her in this national objective.\u201d\n\nDowells: Any Attempt to Zone APC Ticket to North Suicidal\n\nAn APC chieftain in Akwa Ibom State and Coordinator, Movement for Better Nigeria (MBN), Dr Paul Dowells, warned against any attempt by the ruling party to zone its presidential ticket to the north. Dowells, at a press conference in Uyo, Tuesday, said such decision would seriously imperil the party\u2019s chances at the polls next year.\n\nSpeaking against the background of speculations that the leadership of APC was considering a northern presidential candidate for the 2023 presidential race, Dowells stressed that giving the ticket to a northerner was not a yardstick for winning elections. Rather, he said, it was the pedigree and charisma of the person carrying the party\u2019s flag that would determine his acceptance.\n\nDowells argued that if APC wanted to win the 2023 elections, the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, should be considered.\n\nHe said, \u201cZoning the presidential ticket to the north because PDP has a northerner as a presidential candidate does not make sense. If APC wants to win the 2023 elections, Professor Yemi Osinbajo should be given the ticket either by consensus or nomination, otherwise, retaining the Aso rock may be an illusion.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja, Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia and Okon Bassey in Uyo",
