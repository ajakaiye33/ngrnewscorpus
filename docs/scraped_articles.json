          "text": "\u2022As national leadership suspends minister\u2019s allies\n\nBy Demola Akinyemi & Omeiza Ajayi\n\nThe opposition groups within the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State have not stopped attacking their governor, Mallam Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq since late last month when the governor at a book launch on \u201cO to ge\u201d movement revealed what he went through during his governorship campaign in 2019.\n\nAt the book launch, the governor complained of being sidelined in the activities of the party which was then led by the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhai Lai Mohammed before his eventual victory at the polls. The governor further raised questions on the funds that ran into hundreds of millions of naira which were raised for his campaign but was hidden from him.\n\nHowever, speaking on the crisis, a faction of the party, which branded itself,\u201dIntegrity Group\u201d said there was no contest that Governor AbdulRazaq was the leader of the party in the state and not the minister.\n\nThe group however expressed disappointment that the governor raised questions about the hundreds of millions of naira allegedly sourced for his governorship campaign which he claimed was hidden from him. The group argued that having won the election for which the money was raised, the governor should have forgotten about the whole matter.\n\nSpokesman of the group, Comrade Abdul-Rahoof Bello, at a press conference last Saturday said,\u201dthe position of the party that the Governor is the leader is never in dispute and it is so recognised by the rank and file of our party in this state. The governor today is sitting on monthly allocations running into billions of naira, same for local and international grants among others. Of what relevance is the hundreds of millions of naira he\u2019s talking about two years after since he had won the election he needed the money for. The elders made it clear to the governor that even if he was handed all the monies and materials as he demanded, he could not have achieved more than the victory already achieved.\u201d\n\nThe group which requested for the materials of the forthcoming party registration to be given to them also opted for direct congress immediately after the registration exercise,saying that they would not be part of the consensus arrangement being proposed by the governor.\n\nThe State Chairman of the Caretaker Committee, Alh Abdullahi Samari however dismissed the request saying,\u201dAPC is an organised and structured party, so the request of giving any group registration materials is not in anybody\u2019s interest because we will give everyone opportunity to revalidate and register including those who are willing to join the party \u201c\n\nHe also cautioned the aggrieved APC youths for asking the national leadership of the party to sanction the governor for allegedly instigating crisis in his state party.\n\nSpokesman of the youths Comrade Mustapha Mohammed from Edu local government at a press conference in Ilorin on Tuesday said \u201cGovernor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq is guilty of causing division and crisis within our party and the de-registration of members by his chosen agents during the last registration and revalidation exercise of our party.\n\nSamari however cautioned the youths, who he said were being sponsored, to beware of their utterances at crisis period saying that they didn\u2019t have the right to demand the governor\u2019s removal from the panel set up to settle Anambra state political crisis because those who appointed him knew his competence.\n\nMeanwhile two first class monarchs in Kwara South, the Olofa of Offa, Oba Mufutau Gbadamosi and Olomu of Omu-Aran Oba AbdulRaheem Oladele Adeoti have commended the governor on his performance. They both endorsed the second term of the governor.\n\nRecently when the governor went to inspect one of the ongoing projects in Offa and paid the Olofa of Offa a courtesy visit, the monarch told him that he had performed exceptionally well in the last two years,and that no governor in the history of Kwara State had beaten his record within the period.\n\nHe asked the governor to ignore the few people who were not supporting him, describing it as human nature because if Almighty God had come in person, people would still find fault with Him.\n\nOlofa also said that several residents in Offa loved the governor\u2019s style of administration and his performance and that such people were many and would vote for him for his second term\n\nThe monarch said,\u201dI\u2019m bold and confident to say that you have done very well and I want you to contest for another four years. Don\u2019t mind the few ones, even here who are not supporting you for selfish reasons, they are noise makers. It\u2019s human nature. So, please remain focused, almighty God will continue to be with you.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, another first class monarch, the Olomu of Omu-Aran, Oba AbdulRaheem Oladele Adeoti who described the governor\u2019s administration as a \u201cparadigm shift in all ramifications\u201d said: \u201cI am not a politician, I\u2019ve never been, facts are however sacrosanct. We\u2019ve had several governments in this state, I can say without fear of contradiction that what we have today is a paradigm shift clearly different from the past. We have a governor who is neither extravagant nor ostentatious in all ramifications, he\u2019s arguably the only governor not living luxurious and flamboyant lifestyle in the country today. If Kwara can continue with him for the next six years, then the future generations will be proud of us all\u201d.\n\nMeantime, in what appeared a major political triumph for Governor AbdulRazaq, the national Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC of his ruling All Progressives Congress APC has suspended 11 chieftains said to be loyal to the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed.\n\nThe Minister\u2019s group had opposed the removal of Bashir Bolarinwa as the caretaker chairman of the party in Kwara state and approached the court to demand the removal of the approved State Caretaker Committee Chairman, Abdullahi Samari Abubakar.\n\nSince then, the governor and the minister have been struggling for the control of the state chapter of the party, with the altercation reaching a crescendo few days ago when the minister commissioned a parallel party secretariat in Ilorin, the state capital.\n\nThe Gov Mai Mala Buni-led CECPC in a response to an earlier letter written by the Kwara state Caretaker Committee Chairman, Abdullahi Samari Abubakar approved the suspension of the party men.\n\nBuni in the letter signed by the National Secretary of the CECPC, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe said the national leadership \u201cconsidered the decision of the Kwara State Caretaker Committee dated 5th February 2021 on the resolution of the Kwara State Disciplinary Committee to suspend erring members who instituted SUIT NO: CV/241/2021 BETWEEN JOSEPH TSADO AND 10 ORS VS ALL PROGRESSIVES CONGRESS & 2 ORS against the party\u201d.\n\nHe said after due consideration of the decision, the members of the Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee found the decision meritorious on the grounds that the members who instituted the suit against the Party had flouted the directive of the National Executive Committee, NEC, of 25th June 2020. NEC had resolved that no member of the Party should institute any action in court while those already in court before that day were asked to withdraw all pending cases in order to explore the internal conflict resolution mechanisms of the Party.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Caretaker Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee ratifies the decision of the Kwara State Caretaker Committee and upholds suspension of the following Party members: Joseph Tsado, Bamidele Ogunbayo, Issa Fulani, Imam Abdulkadir, Morufu Olaniyi Yusuf, Saludeen Lukman, Kerebu Fatai, Bola Ajani, Nurudeen Fasasi, Salman Shehu Babatunde and Abdullateef Ahmed Kolawole\u201d, the committee said adding that, \u201cthe suspension constitutes a bar on the above-named persons from participating in the on-going registration and revalidation of membership exercise\u201d.\n\nSamari and the caretaker secretary, Mohammed Mustapha Salman had in February written the CECPC alerting it of the court case instituted against the party by the now suspended members.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cthe Plaintiffs instituted the suit against the Party and flouted the resolution of the National Executive Committee NEC wherein all members were directed not to institute any action and withdraw their cases in Court in order to explore the internal conflict resolution mechanisms of the Party.\n\n\u201cThe Kwara State Caretaker Committee has received and adopted the report of the disciplinary Committee in respect of Joseph Tsado & 10 Others. This is pursuant to Article 21 (B) (i) & (iii) of our Party\u2019s Constitution (October 2014 as amended). The Disciplinary committee set up by the State Caretaker Committee as directed concluded its proceedings and resolved to suspend the erring members from the Party. The above mentioned members failed to appear before the Disciplinary Committee despite being invited to attend the proceedings\u201d.\n\nA faction of the crisis ridden party in the state, which branded itself,\u201dIntegrity Group\u201d has however affirmed that there was no contest that Governor AbdulRazaq was the leader of the party in the state.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Being able to drive the story home through the music was a pleasure and I\u2019m ready for similar results from a global perspective.\u201d\n\nThe Houston, Texas-born artist recently released his debut music video for his song \u201c30\u201d which has received positive reviews across press outlets in the states.\n\nThe movie, \u2018Clash\u2019 has a star-studded cast drawn from Nigeria\u2019s Nollywood to Hollywood, and beyond. Among the cast were Stephanie Okereke-Linus, Omoni Oboli, Brian Hooks, Merlisa Langellier, Vivian Williams, Pascal Atuma and others.\n\nThe \u2018Clash\u2019 explores the identity crisis of a young Nigerian who for many years lived a life with a misconception that his uncle was his biological father. He had also to grapple with the complexities of multi-racial relationships.\n\nThe movie captures the journey of the young man who discovers his biological father in the midst of love and multicultural society.

          "text": "The Atyap Community Development Association (ACDA), in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State said that suspected Fulani militia attacked 12 of its villages, killing 42 persons, burning 338 houses with seven persons wounded.\n\nThe Atyap people said eight cars, 13 motorcycles, generators, food and domestic items were either looted or consumed by fire and seven churches have been razed down.\n\nAddressing newsmen in Kaduna on Saturday, the President ACDA, Samuel T. Achie said, \u201cIn all the attacks in the 12 different villages as at today 15th July 2021, a total of 42 people were killed and 338 houses burnt with seven people wounded. Several other valuables were not left out as eight cars, 13 motorcycles, generators, food and domestic items were either looted or consumed by fire.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the attacks by the suspected Fulani militia spanned across the Atyap dominated districts in the Chiefdom, as if it was a deliberate act, stressing that these attacks are not mere herders or banditry, but a premeditated attempt to wipe out the Atyap race.\n\nSouthern Kaduna: Herdsmen kill 100 people in six days, houses, valuables destroyed\n\nHe added that they have made efforts to be at peace with all the people in the chiefdom thus the importance of this briefing.\n\nHe said the Atyap people were defenseless for the whole time the carnage took place with no protection, saying that there is no any place in all the areas attacked that has a distance of more than 10 to 15 minutes\u2019 drive from one security checkpoint to the other, not only lives and houses that were destroyed, but crops and places of worship inclusive.\n\nHe stated that their people are known to be purely peasant farmers, but at this season of farming have to abandon their farms for fear of being killed, all schools in the area are closed down hence their children can no longer go to school therefore creating a humanitarian crisis for all the displaced people in the land, which in turns create an urgent need for Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Camp to cater for those that have been left at the mercy of the weather both in rain and sunshine without any roof on their heads since the renewed persistent attacks.\n\nHe observed that the whole situation looks like the Fulani Militia wants to grab and occupy their land, stressing that the Atyap people are law abiding citizens that have been loyal to all successive governments to date and wonder why they should be left alone to carry their cross now.\n\nBased on these, the Atyap people asked that the government provide more troops, humanitarian relief materials and a peaceful atmosphere for all, else they would be left with no other option than to protect themselves using all legal means.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis dastardly act of unimaginable magnitude of cowardice assault perpetrated by agents of darkness who are bent on destroying already established pathway to sustainable peaceful coexistence between all category of persons and tribes resident in Atyap Land as being championed by the paramount ruler of Atyap Land the Agwatyap Sir. Dominic Yahaya must be stopped by all well-meaning citizens.\n\nThese agents of darkness have been identified by our people as Fulani herdsmen due to the language they speak and some of them well known by our people in the affected communities.\u201d\n\nThe President noted that initially they had the belief that the peace effort championed by their paramount ruler will yield the desired results as it was done in good faith, pointing out that little did they know that overtime the Fulani Militia have seemingly ceased fire just to go and reinforce.\n\nSamuel Achie stated that in a continuation of their (Fulanis) onslaught on their land, the Fulani militia have unbelievably stormed and unleashed terror, bloodshed and destruction in the following communities just within the span of two weeks.\n\nHe added that what is most surprising is the ability of these militias to successfully continue to test the powers of the military by carrying out their well-orchestrated evil acts of killing, maiming and burning hundreds of houses for several hours with little or no intervention by the security forces, since the security personnel\u2019s find it difficult to engage these heartless murderers when they arrive at the scene of the attack, saying that it left us to wonder whether they are under oath or instruction not to confront and shoot the assailants.\n\nHe cited a typical example is Matyei, Magamiya and Abuyab Communities which are all only about 3 Kilometres from the Military checkpoint in Zango and Samaru Kataf.\n\nThe President said another surprising thing they want the world to know is that in some of the attacked villages, Hilux Vans were cited with food items and other valuables loaded on these vehicles before other properties and houses were set ablaze.\n\nHe lamented that all these happenings no arrest has been made and none of the Fulani militias have been killed by the military forces but instead some of their leaders were arrested and taken to police custody here in Kaduna to produce alleged killers of Cows, showing a cow is worth more than human life.\n\nHe lamented that these leaders, whose ages ranged from 43 to 85 years, spent three months in the hands of Police before being taken to court and granted bail, after 92 days in detention.\n\nSince last year, he explained that they have made frantic efforts to meet and discuss with the Hausa and the Fulani community to reach a compromise on how to live in peace with each other and are still on that course, saying that they have always toured the path of peace not that they are cowards, but because it is what their parents bequeathed to them, by and large their religion taught them so but in spite of that, they (Fulanis) will not fold their hands to be annihilated and their lands taken over.\n\nHe lamented that the absolute silence of the government on all these happenings in Atyap land makes them to begin to wonder whether the Atyap people are still citizens of the state because they are yet to see any proactive step by the government to end these killings in their soil, neither has there being any comforting statement in reference to their situation.\n\nKaduna Government confirms killing of one in Zangon Kataf LGA\n\nHe called on the government of Kaduna State to without fear or favour come alive to it\u2019s responsibility to put an end to the dastard and condemnable killings of its citizens, saying that the government should ensure that the perpetrators are fished out and brought to face the wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cOur revered places of Worship were not spared as 7 churches and their pastoriums razed down by fire in various locations.\n\nAmong the Houses razed down by the activities of these Fulani Militia are the family compound of our paramount Ruler, His Royal Highness Sir Dominic Yahaya in Magamiya and also the Family Compound of Retired Major General Shekari Biliyock in Abuyab a former commandant of the Nigeria-African Peace Keeping Arm, the ECOMOG,\u201d he explained.\n\nSamuel Achie explained that the entire Atyap Nation seems to be at loss to these senseless killings by the Fulani Militia, as they have bent over to implement the decisions of the peace accord reached with the parties involved.\n\n\u201cThe question is what else were we supposed to do that was not done? It seems apparent that these attacks are being sponsored with larger motives that meet the eye,\u201d he asked.",

          "text": "Prince Emmanuel Kanu is the younger brother of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. In this exclusive telephone interview with our Abia State Correspondent, SUNNY NWANKWO , he spoke about the recent repatriation of his elder brother from Kenya by the Nigerian government among other issues concerning IPOB and the agitation for Biafra. Excerpts:\n\nWhat was the immediate reaction of your family upon learning that IPOB\u2019s leader, Nnamdi Kanu, had been repatriated from Kenya to Nigeria?\n\nIt was not funny. Because when the news was broken to us, we had to ask a couple of questions which, up till now, nobody has provided answers to. Even the federal government has not.\n\nThe question is what has he done to be abducted from Kenya? Did he commit any crime in Kenya? Was there any crime against him in the UK? If there were, there are processes to be met before taking somebody away from a particular country, which were obviously not followed.\n\nIt is a pure case of kidnapping and a repeat of what happened in 1984 when the same president attempted abducting Umaru Dikko. The question that we are asking is what has he (Nnamdi) done? Who arrested him, because the Keyan government has apparently denied arresting him?\n\nThe question now is who and who in Nigeria organised the extraordinary rendition against Mazi Nnamdi Kanu? These are the things that we need to know. Was he taken to court? Which court was he taken to?\n\nI understand that it takes a while for you to bring someone down to Nigeria. There are due processes to be met. How come he was abducted and taken to a private place where he was tortured for about eight days before bringing him back to Nigeria? Up until this moment, the federal government has not given clarifications on his arrest. That is what we are waiting for, and for this reason, the family will not attend any court, because we need to know the circumstances surrounding his extraordinary rendition. We need to know who authorised it. It is a slap on the international community.\n\nHas the family made any attempt to see him since he was brought back to Nigeria?\n\nWe have been denied access to him. We have made several efforts through our lawyer to see him, all to no avail. My brother should be given access to his own private doctor. It is our stand and position.\n\nWhat are your fears now that the DSS has refused to grant your family access to your brother?\n\nMaybe they intend to kill him, because I don\u2019t know why they would not allow us access to see him. As we speak, some legal steps are being taken inasmuch as we don\u2019t believe in the judicial process here, but we will do what we can.\n\nDo you have the confidence that your brother will get fair hearing in court?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the history of this country, there has never been a time anybody was ever given a fair hearing except you are coming from the Fulani extraction. It is only the Fulani that get fair hearing. It is as simple as that. Until there are calcifications concerning his extraordinary rendition, we (immediate family members) are not prepared to come to court. We should be talking about releasing him and not coming to court. You don\u2019t expect to see us in court when it was clear that our son, father and brother was abducted.\n\nDo you or any member of your family fear for your own safety?\n\nWe are not afraid because Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is fighting for a just cause. If you need to know, I have not been happy because what they have done to my brother is unjust. It is evil and unheard of anywhere in the world. How can you go to another man\u2019s country to abduct a man who has committed no crime? He is simply a freedom fighter and you and I know that.\n\nDon\u2019t you think the call by IPOB Australia for the ban on Kenyan products and airline was extreme?\n\nWe support any protest anywhere in the world in solidarity with our brother, Nnamdi Kanu. We are fully in support of it. We are equally in support of the call by the IPOB Australia banning IPOB members from patronising any made-in-Keya product, including boarding their airline. I have been wondering why Kenya would play a role in this dirty business.\n\nMany said the arrest of your brother has weakened you and IPOB members\u2026\n\nLet me sound it clear that we are stronger than ever before. That is what people should understand. We have more supporters now than we ever had before. Whatever Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is going through, believe me, it is the same thing every Christian is going through in this country. Biafra must come. There is something that he (Nnamdi Kanu) will always say; that they will try to kill us, but in the end, Biafra will come. And we believe in that.\n\nIf called upon, will you accept standing in the gap until your brother returns considering the seeming vacuum his absence may have created in IPOB?\n\nLet me set the record straight: Mazi Nnamdi Kanu remains the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra and there is no vacuum. After him comes Mazi Chika Edoziem, the Head of Directorate for States. It is as simple as that. IPOB is a very big structure. There are chains and commands, so I shouldn\u2019t come into picture",

          "title": "How we smuggled stolen cars from Nigeria to Benin Republic, returned them as Tokunbo \u2013Trans-border robbery suspects",
          "text": "By Ebele Boniface\n\nOperatives of the FIB Intelligence Response Team (FIB-IRT) of the Nigeria Police Force have smashed a five-man trans-border robbery syndicate who specialised in snatching cars from Nigeria, refurbishing them in the neighbouring Benin Republic and bringing them back as tokunbo (fairly used) vehicles.\n\nThe breakthrough recorded by the security agents followed the arrest of a 23-year-old suspected member of the gang Abdulrafiu Olamilekan, following which two other members, namely Idris Adesina (26) and Suleiman Aliu (35) were also arrested. The remaining two members of the syndicate, Wandoko and Tunde Jonny a.k.a Elija, remained at large.\n\nA police source said the gang was so organised that each member had a specific role to play during the robbery operations they usually carried out between the odd hours of 8 pm and 12 am.\n\nFor instance, the source said, the role of one of the members during attacks on victims\u2019 homes and room to room operations in hotels or private buildings was to kick the door open.\n\nAnd during car snatching operations, a member of the gang was saddled with the task of pointing a gun at the owner\u2019s forehead and ordering him or her to vacate the driver\u2019s seat so that their own driver would take over.\n\nOnce the operation was complete, they would drive the stolen vehicle to Cotonou in neighbouring Benin Republic.\n\nThe three members of the gang in police net were said to have been arrested after a robbery operation they carried out around 8 pm on June 14. After the operation, one of the members was said to have taken a snatched car to the receiver in Cotonou identified as Suleiman.\n\nThe gang\u2019s nefarious activities was said to have come to the knowledge of the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, who directed the commander of FIB-IRT, Abba Kyari, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, to fish out the suspects and prosecute them so that the people they were terrorising, particularly in the Sango-Ota and Agege axis in Ogun and Lagos states would sleep with their two eyes closed.\n\nIRT operatives swung into action, posing as buyers and calling Olamilekan, who was in possession of two of the gang\u2019s stolen vehicles, and pretending to be interested in them. The moment he surfaced, they picked him up and later used him to arrest Idris Adesina and Suleiman Aliu while two other members of the gang remained at large.\n\nNarrating their experiences at the Oba correctional centre in Ogun State where they were detained, the suspects complained about poor feeding, lack of medical care and other inhuman conditions. But by far the most worrisome, they said, is the attitude of homosexual inmates who are in the habits of luring their victims to the toilet.\n\nOlamilekan, who described himself as an indigene of Iseyin Local Government Area, Oyo State, said: \u201cI dropped out of school at JSS3. My father is a soldier, and when he was posted to Kaduna State, he separated from my mother and life became hard for us.\n\n\u201cI learnt panel beating and later joined somebody who was already established. But I later met a friend named Odunayo. He asked me what took me to prison because I am an ex-convict, and I told him that it was a car snatching offence and that I spent six months in prison.\n\n\u201cI told him that I could open any vehicle without the key and could drive any kind of vehicle. He then promised to get me a job with a big car-snatching gang.\n\n\u201cIn my first operation, we saw a man at Ojuore in Ota, Ogun State on May 5, 2021. We were five in number. He came down to open the gate to his house and we rushed towards him. The one who held the gun among us arrested him and collected his money and phone. One of our gang members also led him to the toilet and locked him there to avoid him raising the alarm before we left.\n\n\u201cIn another incident, we attacked the owner of a Lexus car and told him to hand over the key to Adesina. We then dragged the owner back into the car, dropped him along the way and zoomed off. The vehicle was then taken to Cotonou.\n\n\u201cAnother car we snatched was kept with me in Nigeria, but the buyer I got for it happened to be a police officer. I sold the car for N500,000, but the police officer paid N100,000 and told me to come back for the balance.\n\n\u201cHe arrested me when I went back to collect the balance, saying that the vehicle had an issue and somebody would come to interrogate me. That was on 14th June, 2021. That was how I was arrested.\u201d On his part, Adesina, who hails from Owode Local Government Area, Ogun State, said he trained as a vulcanizer.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen my father died, I became a bus conductor in order to get daily money to feed. But the Lagos task force and LASTMA (Lagos State Transport Management Agency) frustrated us by asking us to pay for a ticket in the sum of N100,000.\n\n\u201cSeeing that we could not raise the money, we sold the bus. I then returned to Agege and started stealing phones. I was arrested and sent to prison in September, 2019 until I was discharged in April, 2021.\n\n\u201cWhen I joined the gang they asked me to be the gang\u2019s driver. We operated with one gun. When we snatched a Toyota Avensis car, someone sent us the receiver\u2019s phone number and the receiver came and took the vehicle to Cotonou at about 12 midnight, because that was the hour you would not see any police officer on the road.\n\n\u201cThe Avensis was sold for N250,000 and they gave me N40,000. For the car I took to the receiver in Cotonou, they paid #250,000. When I was coming back, the receiver, Baba Ibeji, gave me four guns to give to the gang. I gave them three and kept one. I later snatched a (Toyota) Highlander and took it to Cotonou and Baba Ibeji paid #200,000.\n\n\u201cI was in my house when they called me to come and collect an Acura jeep. But when I showed up, they arrested me.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdesina recalled that five of them, namely Wandoko, Enife, Sadoko, Tunde Jonny a.k.a Elija and himself participated in the robbery of a hotel.\n\nHe said: \u201cI monitored from outside but later joined them, because it was only the money and phone you got by yourself that belonged to you.\n\n\u201cAs we entered the six-room hotel, we used our legs to pull down the doors. Unfortunately, we did not cover our faces because we did not know that there was CCTV camera there.\u201d\n\nIn his own confession, Suleiman Aliu said: \u201cI am from Porto Novo in Benin Republic and I am married with a child.\n\n\u201cIt was Idris (Adesina) who called me to come and collect a vehicle and I came and waited for him at Owode in Ogun State. I had collected four vehicles from him, and I used to take them to my master in Cotonou named Baba Ibeji.\n\n\u201cI was a farmer, but when I got some money from armed robbery, I bought a cab for use in Porto Novo. There was a time they gave me four guns to give to the gang in Nigeria but I refused because I did not have the courage to carry such exhibits.\n\n\u201cI used to take tokunbo vehicles to Nigeria for Baba Ibeji. Initially I did not know that the tokunbo cars were vehicles stolen from Nigeria and brought to Cotonou where they are refurbished and sent back to Nigeria as tokunbo cars.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I could not talk because of the money I was making from taking tokunbo cars from Benin Republic to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf I am released, I will not take stolen vehicles into Nigeria again. I have repented.\u201d",
          "summary": "Once the operation was complete, they would drive the stolen vehicle to Cotonou in neighbouring Benin Republic.\nOne of our gang members also led him to the toilet and locked him there to avoid him raising the alarm before we left.\nInitially I did not know that the tokunbo cars were vehicles stolen from Nigeria and brought to Cotonou where they are refurbished and sent back to Nigeria as tokunbo cars.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I could not talk because of the money I was making from taking tokunbo cars from Benin Republic to Nigeria.\n\u201cIf I am released, I will not take stolen vehicles into Nigeria again.",

          "text": "By Justina Asishana \u2013 Minna\n\nAccuses him of taking food from her pot without permission\n\nSays she did it to make him stop stealing\n\nA stepmother has deployed a hot knife to inflict serious injuries on her stepson\u2019s eyes and other parts of his body for daring to take food from the pot in her absence.\n\nEight years old Ahmad Shehu Amir, who is said to be suffering from sickle cell anaemia, said he had returned from his Islamic school very hungry but met the absence of his stepmother, Mariam Danjuma.\n\nAnd since there was food in the pot, he felt that it would not be of any harm if he helped himself to some. That, however, turned out the tonic his stepmother needed to unleash horror on him.\n\nIn a fit of anger, she put a knife in the fire and waited until it was red hot before she cruelly landed it on his eyes and some other parts of his body.\n\nThereafter, she threatened to kill Ahmad if he continued to stay in the house.\n\nMaryam was not alone in the act as the father, Shehu Musa Danjuma, was said to have stood by and idly watched as his wife inflicted the serious injuries on Ahmad.\n\nMaryam, however, said she did not set out to be cruel but did what she did in order to punish Ahmad for taking food from her pot on his own, which she said amounted to stealing.\n\nIn a statement she made upon her invitation by a child rights agency, she said: \u201cWhat happened was that I cooked three cups of rice and spaghetti. I did not leave any for their father but I gave all of them. The remaining food in the pot was for his brother.\n\n\u201cWhen the brother returned from Islamiyya, he could not find the food so I asked all of them if they took the food. They all denied, but since I knew him with such acts, I insisted until he finally confessed.\n\n\u201cThis was not the first time he would take such things, and I always preached to him. I usually scared him with fire whenever he did such things.\n\n\u201cOn that day, I held a small phone in my hand. As I was taking the knife towards his hand, he hit it with his head.\n\n\u201cI was not even aware of the burn until the next morning when his father complained. I called the boy and made him know that my target was not his head but his hand.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEverything I did to him to stop him from stealing had proved abortive so I decided that he should be returned to his mother since everyone was watching to see how I would treat a child who is not mine.\u201d\n\nMaryam said she was the one that was taking care of the family\u2019s feeding and did not understand why Ahmad would keep stealing from her.\n\nShe said: \u201cI have been the one taking care of them since their father is no longer financially stable. I can also decide to stop doing that since it is my money, and I could sell the foodstuffs I receive in exchange for teaching at the place where I work.\u201d\n\nAhmad\u2019s father, Shehu Musa Danjuma, explained that he said nothing when Maryam was punishing Ahmad because he did not want to complain about her actions in the presence of the children.\n\nHe described the eight-year-old boy as a spoilt child and blamed his mother for making things worse.\n\nShe said,: \u201cIt is the mother that spoilt him. Because we live in the same area, she would come to our area and give him money.\n\n\u201cShe even gives our neighbours money to keep for them in case they would need it. She would give a boy as small as Ahmad N20 or N50 to spend.\u201d\n\nAhmad\u2019s mother, Aisha Baba Zagunu, who reported the incident to the Niger State Child Rights Agency, said she was informed about the incident by her eldest son, Musa Shehu, who is 15 years old and also lives with their father and his wife.\n\nAisha said: \u201cMusa said they went to an Islamic school and returned and Ahmad was hungry. Since the stepmother was not at home, he took food from the pot and ate.\n\n\u201cHe said that when she returned and asked about the rice, he admitted to having eaten it because he was hungry.\n\n\u201cMusa then said she took a knife, put it in the gas fire, and when it was hot, she used it on him and said she did not want to see him in the house again or she would kill him.\n\n\u201cThat was why he called me to come and take Ahmad away before she would kill him.\u201d\n\nAisha, who said she had separated from her husband for three years, said she was prevented from taking custody of her children, adding that she would be glad to do so.\n\nShe said: \u201cI did not report the incident in order to fight her. I just want the law to take its course.\n\n\u201d I want the law to fight for me and give me custody of my children. This shows that they are not safe in their father\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nThe Director-General of the Niger State Child Rights Agency, Barrister Mariam Kolo, after listening to all sides, directed that the case be taken to the state CID for proper investigation and prosecution.\n\nKolo said it was a case of serious act of cruelty to a child, adding that the father should also be punished for watching while his son, who he knows is a sickler, was being punished cruelly.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe Agency will not take it easy on this issue because the report we just heard is very harrowing. This is how it begins before it becomes a mega crime meted out to a child.\n\n\u201cOnce a mother or stepmother begins to show signs of cruelty to a child, the child has to be removed immediately from that environment because the life of the child is in danger.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for such cruelty. There is no reason for one to put a knife in the fire and saying you want to scare a child by inflicting injury on him: that is not punishment but cruelty. Is there no other punishment?\n\n\u201cAs a stepmother to a sickler, she should have understood his nature by now. Sicklers get hungry multiple times a day and need special treatment, and they are always under crisis.\n\n\u201cWhat if he had a crisis when she was inflicting him with the hot knife?\n\n\u201cThe matter will be properly investigated by the CID, and if need be, she will be prosecuted by a court of law alongside the father for standing there while injury was being inflicted on his child. He should not have allowed it.\n\n\u201cThe mother will also be investigated for leaving a child that needs special attention for the father and the wife.\u201d\n\nThe case has been referred to the Criminal Investigation Department of the Niger State Police Command for further investigation.",

          "title": "Are you a landlord or tenant in Lagos? These are things you should know",
          "text": "By Romanus Okoye\n\nTo live peacefully in Lagos, it is vital that tenants and landlords understand the law regulating their rights and obligations. For such purpose, the tenancy laws of Lagos State were enacted on August 5, 2011 at the Lagos State House of Assembly and signed by the then governor, Babatunde Fashola on August 24, same year. It is now the main law regulating housing in Lagos State. Lawyers speak on its provisions.\n\nSaid PGC Achigasim, a lawyer: \u201cThe tenancy law of Lagos is unique. It is found in its attempt to remove the perceived bottlenecks in the old law. One of such provisions is the removal of the hitherto provision that says that \u201ca notice to quit\u201d must expire on the anniversary of the tenancy. With the landlords and tenants law, the notice to quit could be given at any time and expire at any time. Even after the anniversary of tenancy provided, it complies with the law.\n\n\u201cAnother uniqueness of the law is the provision of the law on monthly and quarterly tenancy. Once a tenant is in arrears of rent for a month in the case of a monthly tenancy or three months in the case of a quarterly tenancy, then the need for notice to quit is dispensed with. In other words, one does not need to issue and serve such tenants in arrears, notice to quit.\n\n\u201cThe law criminalizes non-issuance of receipt of payment after receiving payment by the landlord. The penalty or fine is N250, 000.00. There is also the provision for an order to open a property, which was locked up by a tenant. This provision takes care of a situation where a tenant locks up the property of the landlord and relocates to another place before the landlord would need to go through the route of proving his case before the property can be opened. But this law allows such landlord to file a motion on notice to force open the said property.\n\n\u201cIt is largely credited with the new ways landlord\u2019s request for rents now. Before now, landlords required two years\u2019 rent from tenants but landlords now collect one year\u2019s rent. To this extent, the law has succeeded. The only drawback is that it is discriminatory. Its provisions are inapplicable in the highbrow areas of the state like the Ikeja G.R.A, Apapa GRA, Ikoyi, Victoria Island etc.\u201d\n\nJide Ogundimu, a lawyer and housing specialist, also stated: \u201cSection 1 of the law which deals with its application, stipulates as follows; (1) This law shall apply to all premises within Lagos State, including business and residential premises unless otherwise specified. The following areas: (i) Apapa; (ii) Ikeja GRA (iii) Ikoyi; and (iv) Victoria Island are exempted from the application of this law. The Governor may, however, from time to time, by order published in the State Official Gazette, exempt the application of this law to any other area or premises in the state.\n\n\u201cThe Rent Control and Recovery of Residential Premises Law Vol. 7 Laws of Lagos State 2003 and the newly enacted Tenancy Laws of Lagos State 2011 are the current laws regulating tenancies in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cSection 4 of the Act covers advance rent, and it provides as follows: It is unlawful for a landlord or his agent to demand or receive from a sitting tenant rent in excess of six months for a monthly tenant and one year for a yearly tenant in respect of any premises without prejudice to the nature of tenancy held at the commencement.\n\n\u201cIt is unlawful for a sitting tenant to offer or pay rent in excess of one year for a yearly tenant and six months for a monthly tenant in respect of any. It is unlawful for a landlord or his agent to demand or receive from a would-be tenant rent in excess of one year in respect of any. It is unlawful for a new or would-be tenant to offer or pay rent in excess of one year in respect of any. Any person who receives or pays rent in excess of what is prescribed in this section will be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to a fine of N100, 000.00 or to three months imprisonment.\n\n\u201cSection 1(2) provides as follows: \u201cThis law will not apply to: residential premises owned or operated by an educational institution for its staff and students; residential premises provided for emergency shelter; residential premises in a care or hospice facility, in a public or private hospital or a mental health facility, and that is made available in the course of providing rehabilitative or therapeutic treatment.\u201d\n\nFunmi Adeogun, MCIArb ( UK), Vice Chairman, NBA Epe Branch and treasurer, NBA SPIDEL added: \u201cTenants in Lagos have to know that once a quit notice is served on them, it doesn\u2019t mean they are excused from paying rents. They must know that there must be an agreement between the landlord and tenant on rent increment as opposed to just informing the tenant. They must also know that once they sign the tenancy agreement, they would be bound by it.\u201d\n\nOther key matters\n\nUnder the Lagos State Tenancy Law of 2011, which is similar to the tenancy laws of other states in Nigeria, it is an offence to try to forcefully evict a tenant. It is also illegal for a landlord or his agent to disrupt the peaceful enjoyment of the demised property in a bid to frustrate the tenant and force him to move out.\n\nEviction of a tenant\n\nThe first step to evict a tenant in Lagos State is to issue what is referred to as the statutory notices. There are two statutory notices that should be issued and they are the \u201cNotice to Quit\u201d and the \u201cNotice of Owner\u2019s Intention to Recover Premises.\u201d\n\nThe notices are called statutory notices because there is a specific format. Statutory notices are not mere letters you write to a tenant asking him to surrender possession of your property. There is a special format which must be used and the format is contained in the tenancy law.\n\nNotice to Quit\n\nA notice to quit is the first statutory notice a property owner ought to give his tenant. The rules guiding the issuance of notice to quit provide that the notice to quit is to be issued in accordance with the tenancy agreement. What this means is that if there was a written tenancy agreement and the agreement states the length of notice to be given, then the notice to quit should comply with the tenancy agreement in order for it to be valid.\n\nHowever, where there is no tenancy agreement, or if the tenancy agreement does not state the length of the notice, then the following rules shall apply:\n\nFor a yearly tenancy, the length of notice should be a minimum of six months. For a half-yearly tenancy the length of notice should be a minimum of three months. And for a monthly tenancy, the length of notice should be a minimum of one month.\n\nNotice of Owner\u2019s Intention to Recover Premises\n\nAfter the expiration of the notice to quit, the tenant is expected to vacate the premises and surrender possession. However, in reality, some tenants remain on the property either due to the needed resources to move elsewhere or due to being adamant. At this point, you are expected to issue the seven days notice of the owner\u2019s intention to recover premises. The seven days notice, just like the notice to quit, also has a specific format, which must be strictly adhered to.\n\nThe rationale behind issuing the seven days notice is to inform the tenant that you intend to approach the court for an eviction order. If the tenant still refuses to vacate after the seven days notice, then you are expected to approach the court for an order of eviction.\n\nInstitute a recovery of premises action in court\n\nIf a tenant refuses to vacate the premises and deliver up possession, then the proper thing to do next will be to file a court action. In Lagos State, the recovery of premises action can either be filed in the magistrates\u2019 court or the high court.\n\nIf the rental value of the premises occupied by the tenant is above N10 million, then the high court would be the proper venue for the matter. If on the other hand, the rental value is below N10 million, then the magistrates\u2019 court within the division or district would be the appropriate court to approach. Once the matter has been filed in court, both parties can either opt to settle amicably or proceed to trial.\n\nSettle Amicably\n\nBoth parties can explore settlement if the tenant agrees to vacate the premises but perhaps is requesting for more time. The parties can meet along with their solicitors and agree on the terms of the settlement. Upon reaching a conclusive agreement, the solicitors would file terms of settlement document which would be adopted by the court as its judgment in the suit.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nRadio and television stations in Nigeria have been ordered by the Federal Government to henceforth cease from reporting details of attacks by bandits and terrorists.\n\nIn a letter titled \u2018Newspaper Reviews And Current Affairs Programmes: A Need For Caution\u2019, dated July 7, 2021 and signed by Francisca Aiyetan on behalf of Balarabe Ilelah, Director General of the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), the broadcast regulatory agency said that going forward, stations should also desist from naming victims of such attacks in order not to \u201cglamourize the nefarious activities of insurgents, bandits and kidnappers \u201d in their reports.\n\nThe commission advised broadcasters to apply caution in their reportage, saying that divulging too many details may have an adverse effect on the efforts of the Nigerian security agencies.\n\nThe commission claimed that some of the topics discussed during newspaper reviews have \u201cethnological coating which pitches one section of the country against the other and leaving Nigerians in daily hysteria.\u201d\n\nIt asked broadcast stations to be guided by provisions of Sections 5.4.1(f) and 5.4.3 of the NBC Code which states: \u201cThe broadcaster shall not transmit divisive materials that may threaten or compromise the divisibility and indissolubility of Nigeria as a sovereign state. In reporting conflict situations, the broadcaster shall perform the role of a peace agent by adhering to the principle of responsibility, accuracy and neutrality.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeadlines of most newspapers on a daily basis are replete with security topics. While bringing information on security to the doorsteps of Nigerians is a necessity, there is a need for caution as too many details may have an adverse implication on the efforts of our security officials who are duty-bound to deal with the insurgency.\n\n\u201cThe commission, therefore, enjoins broadcasters to collaborate with the government in dealing with the security challenges by not glamourizing the nefarious activities of insurgents, terrorists, kidnappers, bandits etc.\n\n\u201cAdvising guests and/or analysts on programmes not to polarise the citizenry with divisive rhetoric, in driving home their point. Not giving details of either the security issues or victims of these security challenges so as not to jeopardise the efforts of the Nigerian soldiers and other security agents,\u201d the letter read. According to a report by SBM Intelligence, a total of 2371 people were abducted in Nigeria between January and June of 2021 with N10 billion demanded as ransom for victims.\n\nThe report stated that an average of 13 persons were abducted daily in the country within the period across the 36 states of the federation and the federal capital territory (FCT). The data was derived from media reports and the national security tracker of the Council of Foreign Relations, though the report did not state the total amount paid for ransom. About 605 victims were kidnapped in February and in March, 534 were kidnapped. In May 355 persons were kidnapped, while in April, 316 were affected. January had 284 while in June, there were 277. The report showed that Niger State recorded the highest number of abducted persons with 643 victims in 28 kidnap cases, while 58 people were killed during the abductions. Zamfara State came second with 519 kidnap victims in seven incidents, leading to the deaths of 22 people, while Kaduna state recorded 360 kidnap victims in 26 incidents, leading to the deaths of 41 persons.\n\nThe most targets in the abductions that took place in the first half of 2021 were schools where hundreds of students taken hostage in the north-west. Six persons were kidnapped in Abia State while in Abuja, 50 persons were abducted.

          "title": "House Adopts E-Transmission of Results \u2018Where Practicable\u2019, Opposition Walks Out",
          "text": "*Elumelu: Process, a sham, House leadership prevented INEC from addressing lawmakers\n\n*NCC: Nigeria lacks adequate network coverage for seamless electronic transmission of results\n\nAdedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu\n\nThe House of Representatives yesterday passed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, amid a walkout staged by opposition members, with the controversial Clause 52(2) intact, adding that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) \u201cmay transmit results of the election through electronic means where and when practicable\u201d.\n\nThe Senate passed same bill on Thursday but added that the \u201cNigerian Communications Commission (NCC) must certify that national coverage is adequate and secure, while the national assembly must approve,\u201d before INEC can adopt E-transmission of results.\n\nYesterday, when the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill was being done, the deputy speaker, Idris Wase, who presided over the sitting, skipped clause 52, and said it would be revisited after all other clauses had been considered.\n\nAfter the clauses of the bill were considered, Ndudi Elumelu, Minority Leader of the house, raised a point of order that clause 52 of the bill which stipulates the method of transmission of result be considered.\n\nBut Wase, said the clause could only be reconsidered, if a motion of rescission on it was moved.\n\nElumelu argued that there was no need for rescission, since the clause had not been ruled on.\n\nHowever, Wase said the decision on clause 52 had already been taken.\n\nAt this point, the minority caucus protested and walked out of the chamber.\n\nThe bill should have been passed on Thursday but for the rowdy session which later led to some lawmakers engaging in physical combat.\n\nElumelu: Process, a Sham\n\nAddressing journalists, alongside other opposition lawmakers after staging a walkout, Elumelu stated categorically that the man that spoke on behalf of the NCC told lies.\n\nHe stated: \u201cI am happy that you are asking this question and that informs why I stood up to ask him whether this is his usual person because, in our opinion, he was telling lies. And because he was telling lies, I brought up an Act that gives room for funds to be made available for places not served by the USPF. And he agreed 100 per cent that I was correct.\n\nAdding his voice, Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechuckwu said statistically, according to NCC reports, NCC had coverage for 109,000 polling units out of 119,000 polling units in 2018.\n\nHe said that means NCC did not have coverage for only 8,000 polling units.\n\nHe added, \u201cThat for me presupposes over 90 per cent coverage. Two, the reference that he made about 2G and 3G, each of these frequencies can transfer data. It is very clear. So what we are doing essentially is the rule of men and not the rule of our rules.\u201d\n\nElumelu pointed out that the walkout staged by the opposition lawmakers showed that they were disappointed in the action of Wase.\n\nHe further clarified that the issue of electronic transmission of results has nothing to do with opposition lawmakers because Hon. James Faleke of the APC also brought an amendment in agreement that results should be manually and electronically transmitted.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Nigerian people voted us to represent their interest. And in this electoral Act, we started very well, when it got to clause 52 (2), which talks about the electronic transmission of results, we could not agree as to the mode of accepting, whether to go for electronic transmission or not. In that process, the Deputy Minority Leader moved for an amendment. In his amendment, he posited that amendment should read that the next election should be by electronic transmission of results and eventually the chairman sitting (Deputy Speaker Wase) refused to listen to the amendment.\n\n\u201cThe Speaker tried to intervene and when we could not reach an agreement we had to adjourn and a decision was reached by the House that we should invite the INEC and NCC to talk about their ability to ensure that our results are transmitted electronically all over the country.\n\n\u201cBut to our greatest surprise, upon resumption this morning we found out that INEC was asked to stay back. We tried to inquire why, and they told us that it\u2019s because they do not want INEC to be seen to be biased and that was why they deprived INEC of coming. In the NCC itself also, they asked the Executive Vice Chairman not to show up and thereby he resulted in asking somebody in the capacity of a director to show up. Even the Director himself couldn\u2019t even substantiate issues.\u201d\n\nElumelu said it was because Wase refused to allow them to move for recission on Clause 52(2) that forced them to walkout.\n\n\u201cWe have no other choice than to say that we cannot be part of that fake process where they\u2019re depriving Nigerians of their right for their results to be counted accurately. Because e-transmission will guard against rigging and votes can count. But what they\u2019ve done is to discountenance our agitations that let there be transparency in the next conduct of our elections,\u201d he said.\n\nElumeku said whatever they did was a nullity, while insisting that they would continue their agitation when they resume from their annual recess.\n\nAlso, the Chairman of the House Committee on INEC, Hon. Aisha Dukku, while briefing journalists said the House in its wisdom accepted the recommendation of the committee without alteration.\n\nShe stated: \u201cWhat happened yesterday led to the adjournment of the House to today and by the ruling of yesterday. NCC was invited because they have the technical knowledge to inform us so that we make decisions with an informed mind. The experts came and enlightened us. What NCC confirmed is that we have 50 per cent coverage and we have 2G/3G and that\u2019s not enough to transmit results. This is from NCC. We cannot afford to disenfranchise an eligible voter because each vote must count.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Hon. Mark Gbillah said that, as an expert in the industry, transmission of results does not have to be by broadband.\n\nHe stated: \u201cLet me, first of all, clarify that point further as a professional in the industry. First and foremost, when you talk about 3G and 2G and LTE, which he failed to mention, these are technologies that have to do with transmission by the Internet or broadband. Now transmission of results does not have to be by broadband. I am surprised that somebody who is supposed to be a professional in the NCC does not know that difference.\n\n\u201cThis USSD function just uses the GSM network. That is all that we need. Like text messages that is all that is required to transmit results. We do not need internet service and we have more than 90 per cent coverage of that.\n\n\u201cAnd what the leader was saying about the USPF is something that this House has to investigate. In 2006, the Universal Service Provision Fund (USFP) started to collect 2.5 per cent of the profit after tax of the telecoms operators to date. And their function is to be able to provide coverage in underserved and unserved areas of this country.\n\n\u201cNigerians need to know what has the USPF been doing? If in 2018, only 8,000 per cent units were not covered, by now obviously the telecoms operators on their own have covered it and if they say the operators have not covered it, USPF has enough funds. Six months is all it takes to cover 8,000 polling units. So there is no excuse for them to say that we cannot deploy or transmit results electronically. And I challenge the EVC of NCC to a public debate. I will personally be there to provide technical explanation and proof of what I am saying.\u201d\n\nNCC: 3G network, a necessity for E-transmission of results available in only 50% of polling units\n\nAt the resumed sitting yesterday, the NCC honoured the summons of the House to explain the practicability of electronic transmission of results.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the NCC team, the Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, Engr. Ubale Maska said Nigeria does not have an adequate network covering the 119,000 polling units across the country to enable the seamless electronic transmission of election results.\n\nHe added that in all the polling units studied in 2018, only about 50% have 2G and 3G networks, stressing that the 4G network only exists where there is the 3G network, therefore making the coverage inadequate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria is facing a critical hunger level as it ranks 98 out of 107 countries in the 2020 Global Hunger Index.\n\nThe country also has the proportion of undernourished in the population rising from 7.6 per cent in 2012 to 12.6 per cent in 2020.\n\nAccording to a consulting firm focused on Africa geopolitical research and strategic communications, SBM Intel\u2019s report, the country\u2019s food crisis is a result of insecurity from Boko Haram terrorists, bandits and killer herders that have forced farmers to abandon their farmlands.\n\nOther factors, however, are the lack of proper storage facilities, volatile oil prices, climate change, rising cost of energy and logistics, stifling government policies, natural disasters, the Coronavirus pandemic, and currency devaluation.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report as published by SBM, food inflation has seen a 48.94% rise (from 15.04% to 22.95%).\n\nSBM gathered reports from major food markets across the country and noted how people lamented devastating rising prices of food which have altered their normal daily living.\n\nThe prices of most staple food items in a typical Nigerian home, including rice, beans, egg, garri, plantain, yam, beef, palm oil, fish, pepper, tomatoes, onions, bread and groundnut oil, have all surged.\n\nIn Lagos, a housewife disclosed to SBM that the food allowance her husband provides could no longer sustain the family. She precisely complained about her failure to buy monthly food items, which now occurs every two weeks or save from the allowances while expenses keep increasing.\n\nA trader in Lagos\u2019s Balogun Market was very specific as to fish, saying that the border closure affected his ability to supplement his fish stock, forcing him to raise prices for the increasingly scarce stock he has.\n\nMost of those interviewed in the low socio-economic echelons admitted they could no longer afford three square meals but had one whole meal daily supplemented with snacks.\n\nMrs Christiana, a Lagos housewife and entrepreneur disclosed she chose two-square meals daily, as allowances received can no longer afford her family decent three-meal days.\n\nAnother respondent who is a wife and mother of two at Sango-Ota, Ogun State, lamented the rapid escalation of prices of commodities in the market at Sango-Ota. She explained how she last went to the market and ended up confused about what exactly to buy since \u201cwhat N20,000 can but a few months back, today, N40,000 cannot afford the same.\u201d\n\nThe price of beans and garri in Sango-Ota rose by a significant 97.9%, which almost doubled within the period under review. Beans rose from N1,457 to N2,883 per four-litre paint rubber and garri saw a price rise from N869 to N1,856 per paint rubber. According to her, the price increases of these two staple foods were the highest in the last one year.\n\nIn Port Harcourt, a four-litre paint bucket of garri, which sold for N1,200 at the end of March, rose to N1,500 by June 2021, an increase of 25%. In the same period, a paint bucket of beans, which sold for N1,500, now sells for N1600.\n\nVisits to various markets revealed that in all the markets except in Onitsha, Port Harcourt and Calabar Municipal markets, the cost of making a pot of Jollof rice has skyrocketed. The decline in Anambra, Rivers and Cross River states was as a result of a slight reduction in the cost of beef, onions and tomatoes.",

          "text": "A few days back, someone on Nigerian Twitter asked if women would date a man who always moved around with a power bank. Seems like a harmless question, right? Well, that singular tweet snowballed into a denouncement of power banks and all who wielded it\u2014laughs in irregular power supply. Well, I wonder what they\u2019d say when they see Apple\u2019s new MagSafe Battery Pack.\n\nAfter teasing us with the spanking new magsafe feature on its iPhone 12 series last year, Apple has finally launched the long-awaited MagSafe Battery Pack\u2014its wireless charging option. This exciting piece of hardware is currently available on the Apple website at $99 and is compatible with all iPhone 12 models.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nMagSafe Battery Pack Specs: the lowdown\n\nYes, yes, we know it sounds corny, but I couldn\u2019t resist.\n\nThe MagSafe Battery pack sports a battery capacity of 1460mAh at 7.62V. Compared to other magsafe power banks, like Anker\u2019s PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless with its 5000mAh battery, Apple\u2019 new battery pack just doesn\u2019t cut it. Especially since the Anker option is a little above half of the Apple MagSafe price.\n\nHowever, the MagSafe may have some redeeming qualities.\n\nFor one, it is wireless, and has a slim, classy build\u2014way slimmer than the Anker option. That increases the cool factor and forgives the low battery capacity\u2014somewhat.\n\nIt also packs a charge. According to Apple Insider, the MagSafe Battery Pack might fully charge an iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro with little issue. Though this depends on how much energy it wastes during charging\u2014wireless charging produces a lot of heat, and this reduces the charge.\n\nThe battery pack also has a reverse-charge feature. This means that not only can your plugged\u2014and attached\u2014MagSafe Battery charge your phone, you can also charge your attached MagSafe while your iPhone is plugged to a power supply.\n\nYou can also charge both if you attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone, then plug your iPhone into a power source. You might want to charge this way if you need to connect your iPhone to another device while charging, like if you\u2019re using wired CarPlay or transferring photos to a Mac. If you charge your iPhone and MagSafe Battery Pack at the same time, your iPhone might charge to 80% or higher before your MagSafe Battery Pack begins charging. \u2014 Apple Support\n\nFun fact: When connected to a 20W or higher power source, the MagSafe Battery can charge with up to 15W of power.\n\nYou can also see your charging status and battery pack percentage on your lockscreen when charging. However, your MagSafe-compatible iPhone should run the iOS 14.7 update or later.\n\nAre these features worth $99? You tell me.\n\nBut one thing\u2019s for sure, your date will probably not run when they see you with this stylish gear.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Gokada\u2019s motorcycle-hailing business in Nigeria did not hibernate because there was no demand.\n\nThe evidence is on the streets of Lagos today where motorcycle transport has returned. If GRide had a death certificate, the cause of death would be head-on collision with sudden government policy. It was a near-death experience but Gokada scrapped itself for parts and started a rebirth in March 2020.\n\nIt has now been 18 months since the company pivoted from being a ride-hailing provider to a logistics company.\n\nGRide became GSend to help businesses and individuals in Lagos with intra-city deliveries. Since this pivot, delivery volume has increased by a hundred fold, revenue has increased 10 times and $100 million has been realised in annualized transaction value, according to the company.\n\nBut in its boldest step since it was founded in January 2018 by Fahim Saleh, Gokada now identifies as a super app. In addition to other items that can be packaged in a motorcyclist\u2019s delivery box, food is taking the centre stage.\n\nGokada\u2019s super app is entering the market at a time when Lagos residents are consuming \u20a65 trillion ($12 billion) worth of food annually. \u201cIf the population is to grow to about 30 million by 2030, Lagos will likely need food worth \u20a66.3 trillion on an annual basis,\u2019\u2019 the state\u2019s commissioner for Agriculture said in May.\n\nDika Oha, a former senior executive at Andela and Konga who leads Gokada\u2019s product development, says Gokada delivers more food than any other delivery service in Nigeria.\n\nDika Oha, VP of Product at Gokada. Image credit: Gokada\n\nThe claim is hard to verify without numbers from other players. But Gokada\u2019s evolution from transport provider to food aggregator could help ecosystem players understand the future of super apps in Africa.\n\nA standing fleet is an asset in emergencies\n\nIn August 2019, Gokada took a two-week break to readjust its business strategy following OPay\u2019s sensational entry into Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing market.\n\nA new fleet of 200cc motorcycles were fitted with new tracking features. A higher standard of quality was demanded of drivers who, in many users\u2019 eyes, looked rather unkempt for a technology business.\n\nPerhaps not anticipated at inception, but these changes would serve the company effectively six months later.\n\nFacing existential questions about its future, Gokada repurposed the tracking feature from the ride-hailing business to begin winning customers over to GSend. \u201cWe decided we could not launch without that ability for customers to track,\u201d Victor Daminabo, Gokada\u2019s head of operations, tells me.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, Gokada set an audacious target: have drivers pick-up and complete every delivery in Lagos within two hours. They set up a goods-in-transit insurance policy to cover cases of damage or loss of items in their custody, Daminabo explains.\n\nStarting off as a service for sending individual packages, Gokada iterated to enable one driver to book and fulfill multiple deliveries. That iteration birthed \u2018Gokada for business\u2019 which helps enterprises create different user profiles for staff in various branches. The organisation uses one Gokada account but each unit can monitor deliveries separately.\n\nThis was how Gokada acquired Fan Milk and Jumia Foods as enterprise customers. Rather than invest in their own assets, these companies readily adopted Gokada\u2019s logistics fleet of over 1,000 motorcycles which is already integrated with payments systems like Paystack and Flutterwave.\n\nEating into other verticals\n\nAs the ghosts of GRide gave way to a thriving GSend, the data showed something interesting: Gokada says it has recorded over 1 million deliveries so far in 2021 and about 40% have been food deliveries.\n\nThis volume was driven by formal partnerships, like with Jumia Foods. But small and medium restaurants downloaded the app and used it to find drivers who would deliver food to customers.\n\nImage credit: Rotimi Daramola\n\nSusan*, who lives in the Surulere area of Lagos, tells me the food she ordered directly from a restaurant in her neighborhood in May was delivered by a Gokada driver.\n\nWith this happening frequently, it encouraged Gokada to float GShop, a service that aggregated restaurants, opening the door for the company to bundle all it offers onto one app.\n\nSo why a super app? On one level, it is a practical decision.\n\nUsers enter the company\u2019s ecosystem of services through one channel. That singular funnel makes it easier for the company\u2019s developers to manage updates. Growth and sales teams focus resources on selling one app.\n\nBut Oha, Gokada\u2019s VP of product, explains their motivation is also to take advantage of Nigerians\u2019 increasing familiarity with ecommerce as more businesses \u2013 food, fashion and furniture outlets \u2013 use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to find and sell to customers.\n\nSocial media platforms grow through network effects \u2013 the presence of more users doing more things improves the quality and usefulness of the platforms. Super apps emulate this playbook too, following users\u2019 lead to add more products to the stack.\n\nLike Grab in Singapor and Gozem in francophone Africa, Gokada\u2019s super app journey started with transportation | Graphic by Boluwatife Sanso/TC Insights\n\nBut as Yinka Adegoke explained in this insightful piece, apps become super by offering essential services within large markets. WeChat and Alibaba serve 2 billion users a month across China and parts of Southeast Asia; but can Gokada find a market that large and homogenous?\n\nFrom food, back to ride-hailing\n\nThe only way to reach those exalted heights, then, is by aggressively focusing on customer satisfaction for high-demand products, making the app sticky and top of mind.\n\nOr as Oha puts it, ensuring Gokada is the first thought a user has when they need to order food \u2013 arguably a bigger need than sending parcels.\n\nTo assure users, Gokada is sticking with the simplicity and transparency that has made ride-hailing platforms universal: tap to order, input destination and track your order in real time as it arrives.\n\nGokada\u2019s food service notifies the user of each step along the delivery process to maintain engagement and offer assurance.\n\nAnd yes, pay on delivery.\n\nPerfecting this cycle also means paying attention to renowned global food delivery services like Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats and Deliveroo. The reward is that perfecting a time, quality and culture-sensitive business like food delivery in Africa can be a springboard for getting people to trust and use other products en masse.\n\nThose other products, according to Oha, could be groceries, fashion and electronics. And in cities that permit, motorcycle-taxi \u2013 the company\u2019s first love.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Westa.Solar sets its sights on West Africa after debut in Nigeria",
          "text": "With the increasing adoption of renewable energy use globally, a new player has emerged in the solar photovoltaic (PV) market for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in Africa.\n\nWesta.Solar was recently launched as a joint venture between Oolu Solar, a solar home systems provider and RP Global, a renewable energy investment company.\n\nThe new company offers solar systems that range from 50kW to 5MW and has commenced operations in Nigeria. Last month, it deployed its first rooftop plant at Kano-based Petrichor Industries, a packaging products manufacturing company and subsidiary of the Petrichor Group.\n\nJointly financed by Westa.Solar and the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Development Office, the 500 Kilowatts peak (kWp is the peak power of a PV system) solar power plant provides Petrichor with, significantly, almost a quarter of its electricity needs in a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Westa.Solar.\n\nA solar PPA is an arrangement in which a third-party developer owns, operates, and maintains a PV system that is located on an industrial customer\u2019s property. The latter then buys the electric output from the solar system for a predetermined period and at a set price.\n\nPetrichor\u2019s massive 500kWp rooftop solar plant was installed by Westa.Solar in Kano, Nigeria.\n\nThe plant at Petrichor represents a perfect start to life for Westa.Solar, a company that has its sights set on the larger West African market. But its debut project was not without challenges, no thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that continues to disrupt business operations.\n\n\u201cWe started the project at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, which wasn\u2019t the best time for procuring and shipping from anywhere in the world. Getting the equipment out of China, shipping, and then clearing them at the port was challenging. We also experienced tough delays at the port in Lagos,\u201d Westa.Solar\u2019s Country Manager in Nigeria, Kolawole Akinboye, told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThings kicked into overdrive once the logistics component of the project was resolved and the equipment got to the site in Kano. By then, Westa.Solar could manage the construction process, enabled by its technical know-how ability and the partner it was working with.\n\nHelping businesses save cost and hedge energy prices\n\nMany businesses in Africa grapple with expensive electricity tariffs, frequent power outages, and load shedding. These issues limit production and increase operating and maintenance costs, thereby hindering growth. In Nigeria, enterprises rely on diesel generators to make up for the significant lapse in power supply.\n\nWesta.Solar\u2019s customised solutions for commercial and industrial businesses can help overcome some of the power-related challenges businesses face and in the process, provide direct savings and a hedge on energy prices for its clients.\n\nThe decreasing costs of solar systems, relative to either grid or diesel generators, have helped on-site solar microgrids become economically viable alternatives for commercial and industrial use.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, on-site solar power is cheaper than the electricity tariffs paid by C&I companies in seven of the 15 Sub-Saharan Africa markets studied. While electricity tariffs ranged from $0.028/kWh in Ethiopia to over $0.232/kWh in Senegal, a 250kW solar project cost between $0.10-0.14/kWh in the countries assessed.\n\nThe report predicts that the cost of on-site solar will decline further to about $0.05/kWh by 2030, which will only add to its appeal to commercial users.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the cheaper rates paid for solar, as an industrial company, coming into a long-term agreement with us allows you to predict what your energy cost would be over the next few years instead of having to face rising diesel prices at some point in the future. So yes, our plants serve as a hedge for energy costs for companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\nThe power deal with Westa.Solar is expected to see Petrichor reduce dependence on Nigeria\u2019s unstable national grid, save money \u2013 as much as \u20a6235 million over the next 10 years \u2013 on electricity bills, as well as minimise its carbon footprint by cutting its use of diesel.\n\nMore projects and expansion\n\nOn the back of its successful installation of the massive 500kWp plant in Nigeria, Westa.Solar plans to develop and implement a large pipeline of C&I solar projects across West Africa.\n\nThe company currently has no fewer than 30 companies that it has opened discussions with and is in advanced negotiations with at least seven of them. The country manager expects to announce more partnerships within the next few months.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of what we hope will be many solar power projects for C&I companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting calls from various people because of the Petrichor project, because of how successful it was. We have people that are already calling to say, \u2018Wait, can you look at my own facility? What can you do with us?\u2019 So it is a door-opener because it opens the door for more success.\u201d\n\nBut for now, Westa.Solar is focused on establishing itself in Nigeria, a market that is saturated but offers many opportunities for solar energy providers.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a huge unmet need, so we are focusing on conquering the market. Then in the next year or two, we start our expansion plans across West Africa.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfrica is rich in renewable resources but has an unmet demand for power. Many providers are currently moving to fill this gap and, in the process, help to diversify sources for generating electricity in Africa away from environmentally harmful fossil fuels.\n\nThrough its on-site grids, Westa.Solar expects to support the business of its clients while increasing the penetration of renewable energies across the region, which is yet to reach an inflection point.\n\nWesta.Solar is well-positioned to seize the opportunities that will come its way as the market in Africa expands, helped by Akinboye and his team\u2019s efforts to develop resilient microgrid projects across West Africa.\n\nOver the next five to ten years, the company aims to become the leading commercial and industrial renewable energy provider in the region. \u201cThat is our goal and that is where we are going. We\u2019re changing the narrative of commercial and industrial projects in Africa.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

This partnership will enable Somalians to enjoy both global and local cashless payment opportunities.\n\n\u201cFor Visa to come to Somalia, it means that we are on the right path of growth and progress. We will continue to make partnerships and bring convenient and innovative financial solutions to the people,\u201d said Mahat Mohamed, the CEO of IBS Bank.\n\nSomalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headways in reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nIn 2014, 47 years after the Automated Teller Machine was invented and 25 years after it was introduced in Nigeria and Kenya, Salaam Bank installed the first-ever ATM in Somalia in Mogadishu, the capital state. The ATM was to facilitate cash withdrawals (dollars) for only diaspora returnees and foreigners.\n\nThen a year later in June 2015, MasterCard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market in partnership with Premier Bank and issued 5,000 debit cards to be used by Premier Bank account holders, for domestic transactions.\n\n\u201cNew players are coming on board now.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Source: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.capetowndstvinstallation.com/\u201d>capetowndstvinstallation.com</a>\n\nWhat happened? Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives has requested that the Federal Government enforce all antitrust laws against the satellite television sector due to the hike in digital TV subscription fees.\n\nWhat does this mean? The laws will keep PayTV services in check, regulate their prices, and reduce the possibility of any provider monopolising the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria, the satellite TV sector is dominated by MultiChoice \u2014 the South African company that owns DStv and GOtv \u2014 and Chinese-owned StarTimes.\n\nA trigger? MultiChoice, the market leader, announced an increment in the price of some DStv packages in July 2018, after it did the same for all plans in September 2012 and May 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s not all; there was another increase in May 2020, which the company blamed on the increased Value Added Tax (VAT) rate. At all these times, users and the government alike kicked against the hike.\n\nDespite the opposition, in July 2021, MultiChoice increased the monthly subscription fee of its DStv Compact Plus Package from \u20a610,650 ($25.88) to \u20a612,400 ($30.13).\n\nPer Premium Times, the need to break the satellite TV sector\u2019s monopoly was recognised following the adoption of the report of the ad-hoc committee investigating the non-implementation of pay-per-view rates.\n\nIt goes without saying that MultiChoice\u2019s DStv gets to be at the receiving end of any action resulting from that move.\n\nRecall last week, we reported that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) directed commercial banks to freeze MultiChoice Nigeria Limited and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nPer Vanguard, Nigeria contributes 34% of MultiChoice\u2019s total revenue, Kenya and Zambia contribute 11% and 10% respectively, while the rest of Africa contributes 45%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, this goes to show how important the Nigerian market is to the company.\n\nHopefully, the antitrust laws, when enacted will enable more Nigerians to enjoy affordable payTV services.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nAIfluence raises $1 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Thomas Ulrich from Pixabay\n\nKenyan adtech startup, AIfluence, has raised $1 million in seed investment to invest in its AI-powered influencer marketing platform.\n\nDubai-based EQ2 Ventures led the seed round, and Antler East Africa, Oui Capital, ArabyAds, and an unnamed European family office participated in the round.\n\nWhat about AIfluence? The adtech startup was founded by Nelson Aseka (CEO), George Issaias (CMO), Lamusia Anzaya (COO), and Ankit Jindal (CTO) in 2019. It was set up to accurately match influencers to brands, run end-to-end influencer marketing campaigns, and bring transparency to the measurement of impact.\n\nBuilt on a trust network model, the platform enables advertisers to recruit and manage hundreds to thousands of micro and nano influencers per campaign, resulting in authentic peer-to-peer interactions and higher conversion rates.\n\nHow does it make money? AIfluence generates revenue through brand initiatives that increase product and service awareness and lead generation and conversion campaigns that increase sales.\n\nThe company is currently developing a software as a service (SaaS) product that it claims will put the platform\u2019s power in the hands of its customers.\n\nExpansion plans? Apart from investing in AIfluence\u2019s technology and a SaaS platform, the funds will be used to grow into the rest of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia by the end of 2021.\n\nRead more: Kenyan influencer marketing startup, AIfluence, nets $1m in seed funding for regional expansion\n\nPoS business in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Nigerian streets, urban and rural, have at least one kiosk, with most of them bearing variations of the phrase \u2018PoS is Available\u2019, meaning you can withdraw and send money there.\n\nThere are so many outlets because since the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) launched the PoS system and agent banking in 2013 to achieve financial inclusion and develop a cashless economy, the PoS business has proven to be quite lucrative.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie: Data released by Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) showed an 859% surge in the volume of PoS transactions during the lockdown between March and April 2020.\n\nAlso, per Statista, the number of PoS payments increased significantly from 34 million in 2015 to 438.6 million in 2019. On the other hand, in 2020, Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) recorded that Nigerian merchants and mobile money operators (MMOs) processed over 655 million PoS transactions valued at \u20a64.7 trillion ($13 billion), a 50% increase from 2019.\n\nPoS outlets are not limited to cash deposits and withdrawals. They also offer services like fund transfers, utility bill payments, and airtime recharge.\n\nYou should read the article by one of our senior reporters, Oluwanifemi Kolawole, to know the views of some PoS users and operators in Nigeria.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nAn insight into how early-stage venture firm, Microtraction, invests.

          "text": "Microblogging platform, Twitter, on Wednesday, July 14, 2021, announced that its disappearing posts feature, Fleets, will no longer be available on the platform.\n\nIlya Brown, Twitter Head of Products and Video ads, said in a blog post that the feature will be scrapped on August 3, 2021.\n\nLaunched on August 17, 2020, Fleet was Twitter\u2019s way of getting those who don\u2019t tweet regularly to do so.\n\nAccording to a tweet by Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter\u2019s Head of Consumer Product, on March 4, 2020, \u201cWe\u2019ve been listening to this feedback and working to create new capabilities that address some of the anxieties that hold people back from talking on Twitter. Today, in Brazil only, we\u2019re starting a test (on Android and iOS) for one of those new capabilities. It\u2019s called Fleets.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the number of people joining the conversation with Fleets did not increase. Brown\u2019s blog post revealed that the feature was used mostly as a means of promoting tweets by people who already tweet frequently.\n\nSocial media and disappearing posts\n\nDisappearing posts was first seen on Snapchat with its introduction of Stories in October 2013. It was described as a \u201cnew way to share your day with friends.\u201d The posts last for 24 hours after which they\u2019ll no longer be seen.\n\nThe feature was introduced on Instagram in August 2016. Like Snapchat, Instagram Stories disappear after 24 hours of posting. More social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook and networking platform, LinkedIn, soon added the feature.\n\nAfter the feature launched on Twitter newly, it suffered stability problems due to heavy usage. Twitter Support tweeted that the rollout of Fleets would be slowed down to \u201cfix some performance and stability problems. If you don\u2019t have the feature yet, you may not get it for a few more days.\u201d\n\nWhile this means the feature was catching on in the beginning, it is not clear why its use reduced.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Twitter declined to give statistics on the usage of Fleets.\n\nHowever, Instagram, claims its Stories see 500 million interactions daily, influencer marketing agency, Mediakix says 150 million \u2014 10% \u2014 of Facebook\u2019s 1.45 billion daily users use Facebook stories. Statista also reveals that daily WhatsApp status users were up to 500 million in Q1 2019.\n\nWith no available data on other platforms\u2019 disappearing posts feature usage, could this mean we\u2019ll see more apps scrap it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter says it has learned from Fleets and will focus on creating other ways to encourage people to join the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Tessi Obasa is a young marine/offshore engineer in Nigeria who does video editing and special effects for fun. His first experience of online learning came in 2016 with a Udemy course on Android programming using Android studio. Since then, he\u2019s taken several other courses to learn new skills.\n\nIt was immediately evident during our chat that he loved learning and picking up new skills.\n\nHe\u2019s had his fair share of challenges in his learning journey, having to battle unreliable Internet connection, power challenges, and inadequate tools to practice with. Once, while taking a course on VFX special effects, the camera he needed for a project cost \u20a6800,000 ($4,000), which he couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nFor context, Nigeria\u2019s minimum wage at the time (2016) was \u20a618,000 ($90). But he soldiered on, saying to himself, \u201cMy Tecno phone camera will have to suffice.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObasa\u2019s story is not an isolated one, with youth across Africa unable to get the education they need in their country. They turn to edtech platforms to improve their chances of getting a job but are met with waves of problems.\n\nA sore thumb\n\nIt\u2019s an open secret that Africa is facing an unemployment crisis. A large number of Africa\u2019s youth have no jobs or are under-employed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents undergoing training in creative designs at Root Hub, Uyo\n\nWhile the phrase \u201cAfrica rising\u201d may have become hackneyed, one thing is not in doubt, Africa\u2019s young population is growing. According to data from the UN World Population Prospects (PDF), of the 2.4 billion new people that would be added to the current population by 2050, over half (1.3 billion) will come from Africa.\n\nAccording to analysts at the World Bank, this army of youths would join the working population and could potentially drive between 11% and 15% GDP growth on the continent. While these are optimistic outlooks, with a history of not taking advantage of opportunities, even the most optimistic person would have a hard time believing that this population growth is a good development.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, the working-age population in Africa grew at 2.6% annually, resulting in 96 million new members of the continent\u2019s workforce. However, only 63 million jobs were created during that period \u2014 a shortfall of 33 million jobs.\n\nAccording to data from the African Development Bank (AfDB) data, between 12 million and 15 million young people enter the job market annually. By 2035, Africa\u2019s working-age population is expected to grow by 450 million people.\n\nHowever, a combination of a private sector incapable of absorbing them and the inability of governments to create suitable environments for them to thrive could mean that most of these youths could either be unemployed or underemployed.\n\nFaced with the prospect of joblessness, young people are taking their destinies into their hands by gaining skills that would enable them to thrive in the workplace. For example, a report (PDF) by Google and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) shows that 31% of software developers in Africa were self-taught. This is a theme that plays out for most digital skills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow youths are gaining skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA training class\n\nWith no help forthcoming, African youths are taking their destinies into their hands. There are four major channels through which the skills gap in Africa is being closed:\n\nFormal education\n\nWhether through private schools, public schools, or vocational and technical training schools, formal education remains the best bet for most African youths to gain skills.\n\nHowever, even that comes with its challenges. One-third of youths between the ages of 12 and 14 are out of school, while almost 60% of youths between the ages of 15 and 17 are out of school.\n\nBringing gender into the equation paints a more depressing picture \u2014 9 million girls between the ages of 6 and 11 will never go to school, setting them up for a lifetime of exclusion; those who might be able to afford an education face the challenge of access.\n\nAccording to Quartz Africa, 10 of the most populous countries in Africa have 740 universities serving more than 600 million people. Compare that to Latin America, where 1,834 universities serve a population of 434 million people.\n\nThat means that without the ability to leave their countries for education, many African youths will not get a university education.\n\nEdtech\n\nEdtech platforms have seen increased patronage as smartphone penetration has increased across Africa. The coronavirus pandemic further accelerated its adoption as educational institutions across the continent were shut down. However, there are still two major problems with using edtech platforms: affordability and accessibility.\n\nAccording to Blessing Abeng, Director of Communications at Ingressive for Good, high data costs, unreliable Internet connection, inconsistent or non-existent power supply, and lack of tech tools for practice are some of the challenges African youths face in gaining tech skills.\n\nThis is a view shared by Obasa, who says, \u201cGadgets are expensive due to inflation. If you have the required gadgets, learning online will be much smoother and easier,\u201d he says.\n\nGodwin, another learner, adds, \u201cI once had to take a course on edX but could not afford the certificate even though I finished the course.\u201d A certificate on edX could range from $99 (\u20a640,687) to $149 (\u20a661,237).\n\nPrivate sector\n\nThe private sector is involved in providing African youths with skills, especially those required by the organisation. For example, with African tech talents being poached by companies from the West, some African startups are having to train talents in-house to have any chance of competing.\n\nHotels.ng, a hospitality startup in Nigeria, runs the HNG Internship, a three-month programme that aims to make newbie programmers professionals capable of getting a job. Cowrywise also has a design fund aimed at helping more women get into design.\n\nPeer/self-learning\n\nThis channel has been heavily influenced by technology. With many youths unable to afford to pay for an education, self-learning is often the only route left. Through YouTube videos or edtech platforms that provide some of their content for free, many African youths have acquired the skills that have enabled them to get jobs.\n\nA multi-pronged approach to upskilling Africa\u2019s youth\n\nIf you\u2019ve read up to this point, it is clear that the task of helping African youths gain the right skills is a huge one and cannot be achieved by any one person or group. Instead, it will require collaboration between all relevant stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevamp the education sector\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the education system in Africa needs a massive overhaul. In 2021, only 14 universities from Africa made it into the top 1,000 universities globally, according to a ranking by The Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) \u2014 only 4 schools have been added since it released its 2016 rankings. This shows that Africa\u2019s educational sector is inadequate to serve the needs of a rapidly evolving world.\n\nFor significant progress to be made, an overhaul of the entire curriculum at all levels is required. Digital and technical skills that are valuable in the digital economy must be taught, beginning at the primary level if African youths are to compete globally.\n\nAfrican countries can take a cue from Kenya\u2019s DigiSchool Programme and Rwanda\u2019s mission to have more smart classrooms.\n\nExpand digital infrastructure\n\nFor technology to play any role in upskilling Africa\u2019s youths, the necessary infrastructure must be provided. This could be in the form of expanding broadband coverage and providing access to laptops or hubs where young people can access these devices.\n\nData connectivity is also a major requirement. Most African countries have some of the highest data costs globally and are out of reach for most young people.\n\nPublic-private partnerships\n\nWhile governments have a major role to play, the reality is that they cannot solve this problem alone, and so public-private partnerships should be utilised to provide African youths with skills.\n\nCollaboration between governments, multinational development banks, and the private sector will create room for innovative financial models which promote upskilling among Africa\u2019s youths.\n\n\u201cThe government can work with power providers to make sure that we have power for a specific time. That way, we can plan. They can also partner with edtech companies to subsidise the cost of these courses,\u201d Godwin remarks.\n\nPartnerships between the government and the private sector can provide coworking spaces, libraries or give power to people in rural areas often overlooked by traditional energy solutions.\n\nThe Edo State Government of Nigeria recently partnered with Decagon to build a tech park to train 15,000 software engineering talents by 2025. Likewise, the Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency (LASPARK) has partnered with private organisations to convert recreational parks into makeshift innovation centres.\n\nAnother area for public-private partnerships is job placement. Learning a skill is no guarantee that you will get a job, so governments can partner with private organisations to help them with jobs or internships.\n\n\u201cPlacement helps, not just learning skills but channelling the skills into usefulness,\u201d Collins notes.\n\nUtilising technology to upskill Africa\u2019s youth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA training class\n\n\u201cTech has a multiplier effect, and the lockdown made it very obvious that so much can be done with technology, especially online,\u201d says Ingressive for Good\u2019s Abeng.\n\nThis multiplier effect is why Africa needs to harness technology to provide skills for its youth. Without the need to be physically present, technology can provide technical and vocational skills to African youths.\n\nAbeng reveals that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ingressive for Good partnered with Coursera to give scholarships to 5,000 people and help them learn skills to increase their earning power. The response was massive.\n\n\u201cWe expected only 2,500 to take it seriously, but 20,000+ people applied, over 5,000 were enrolled, and over 4,000 completed courses,\u201d she claims.\n\nThe organisation also has partnerships with DataCamp, Facebook, Jobberman, Geneza, Zuri, and HNG to train almost 100,000 people in digital skills. The same can be applied to virtually any skill.\n\nAfrica\u2019s population boom could become a curse if there are no plans to take advantage of it. However, it could drive progress on the continent if managed well and technology could play a massive role in that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

All three missed their shots.\n\nAfter the game ended the players\u2019 social media accounts, including Facebook-owned Instagram and Twitter, were filled with racist comments and messages.\n\nEngland Football Association, FIFA, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prince William have issued solidarity statements and condemned the attacks.\n\nRead Also: Racism against African people is finding safe haven in the international air transport \u2013 Travel services industry\n\nLewis Hamilton, an influential Black sporting figure and Formula 1\u2019s seven-time world champion, voiced his condemnation of the attack and the underlying issues faced by minorities in sport.\n\n\u201cThe pressure to deliver is felt by every sportsperson but when you are a minority representing your country, this is a layered experience. Success would feel like a double victory, but a miss feels like a two-fold failure when it\u2019s compounded with racist abuse. We must work towards a society that doesn\u2019t require Black players to prove their value or place in society only through victory.\u201d\n\nTwitter reportedly removed over 1,000 tweets and permanently suspended accounts that targeted abuse at the England players, as did Facebook and Instagram. A real estate service provider suspended an employee as they looked into racist tweets made by the employee. And a right-wing political commentator and comedian also faced scrutiny following their comments.\n\nRead Also: Racism and ethnic jingoism\n\nBut despite this outpouring of support, there is still much to be done to address the larger societal issues of racism in sports and create safe digital spaces.\n\nRacism in sports\n\nThis is not the first time fans have taken to social media platforms to racially abuse players or sports personalities. Studies have shown that domestic violence surges after a football match ends. One study found that reports of domestic violence in the northwest of England during three football World Cups went up by 26 percent when the national team won or drew, and by 38 percent when the team lost.\n\nSports have also been at the centre on racial discrimination at all levels. For example, during and before the Euro 2020, the England team kneeled before kick-off in solidarity against racism and inequality but some fans booed this gesture.\n\nMarcus Rashford, who has helped British schools tackle child hunger, has constantly highlighted the racist abuse that continues to be targeted towards him.\n\nLaw against racist abusers\n\nUnder regulations from 1989 designed to deter offensive behavior, those who hurl racist abuses at players from the stands at stadiums are banned from attending matches. But the rules do not cover online trolling \u2014 of which there is plenty.\n\nEnglish prime minister, Boris Johnson, said that the order would be extended to cover online racism.\n\nThe change came after efforts by fans to insist that more needed to be done.\n\nThree women, Shaista Aziz, Amna Abdullatif and Huda Jawad, who describe themselves as the \u201cThree Hijabis\u201d because they are Muslim and wear hijabs, led much of the push among fans to stop future perpetrators both online and offline from watching soccer in a stadium, launching a petition on Change.org titled \u201cBan racists for life from all football matches in England.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are calling for the Football Association and the government to work together now to ban all those who have carried out racist abuse, online or offline, from all football matches in England for life,\u201d the trio wrote, targeting the campaign at the prime minister, the Football Association, and Secretary of State Oliver Dowden.\n\nOver 1 million people had signed their names \u2014 a figure that continues to climb as people across the nation learn of the women\u2019s efforts and share the petition.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, Abdullatif said the response to the petition has been \u201cincredible\u201d and promised that the group\u2019s work was just beginning.\n\n\u201cWe need to see action. We need to ensure we\u2019re not just talking, which we\u2019ve done many times before about racism in football. Words alone don\u2019t create change,\u201d she said. \u201cThose perpetrating this behavior need to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nAbdullatif, who is based in Manchester, said she and the other activists hope the petition will prompt a response from the Football Association and help to implement meaningful action.\n\nTwitter and Facebook response\n\nA Twitter spokesperson said the \u201cabhorrent, racist abuse directed at England players\u201d had no place on the platform. Since the end of Sunday\u2019s game, Twitter removed more than 1,000 tweets and permanently suspended a number of accounts.\n\nThe spokesperson did not say how many accounts were suspended for violating its rules against harassment and hateful content. \u201cWe have proactively engaged and continue to collaborate with our partners across the football community to identify ways to tackle this issue collectively and will continue to play our part in curbing this unacceptable behaviour \u2014 both online and offline,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said the company didn\u2019t have numbers to share but said the platform \u201cquickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England\u2019s footballers last night and we\u2019ll continue to take action against those that break our rules.\u201d The spokesperson added that the company had encouraged all players to turn on Instagram\u2019s hidden words tool, which prevents abuse or comments from being visible in direct messages.\n\nFA\u2019s role\n\nEngland\u2019s Football Association said that it was \u201cappalled by the online racism that has been aimed at some of our England players on social media.\u201d Anyone behind the \u201cdisgusting\u201d behavior is not welcome as a fan, the FA said, adding it was supporting the players \u201cwhile urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible.\u201d\n\nThe FA statement added that social media companies \u201cneed to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers from their platforms, gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making the platforms free from this type of abhorrent abuse.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s players were frequently booed by fans at Wembley Stadium during the tournament when the players kneeled on the field before matches as an anti-racism gesture. Both teams kneeled before the start of Sunday\u2019s match, as well.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was criticized for previously failing to defend the players who kneeled before games, tweeted Monday that the players \u201cdeserve to be lauded as heroes, not racially abused on social media.\u201d\n\nSouthgate comments\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate also condemned the racist social media attacks as \u201cunforgivable\u201d\n\nSouthgate added that his team had \u201cbeen a beacon of light in bringing people together, in people being able to relate to the national team, and the national team stands for everybody and so that togetherness has to continue\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor some of them to be abused is unforgivable really. It\u2019s just not what we stand for.\u201d",

          "title": "10 Reasons Executive Management Should Leverage Emotional Intelligence",
          "text": "To quote the immortal words of John C. Maxwell, \u201ceverything rises and falls on leadership\u201d. Emotional intelligence is such a fundamental requirement for executive management such that without it their performance will be greatly stunted. Managing people and resources requires specific skillsets that enable productivity and profitability because the decisions that are taken on critical issues have immediate and future impact on the fortunes of the organization.\n\nBeing emotional is one thing, being emotionally intelligent is another thing altogether. Many leaders fail to realize that many decisions are made from a place of emotions and if those emotions are not educated, the dysfunction and chaos that will be unleashed in the workplace is better imagined. Executive management especially has to come to terms with its ability to interact with the subordinate levels of leadership in a cohesive manner via the agency of emotional intelligence. Below are some tips that might be helpful.\n\nAvoidance of Ambiguity\n\nOne of the perks of an emotionally intelligent executive management team is the ability to achieve clarity. This is manifested in many ways from strategic objectives to operational deliverables. The allocation and appropriation of resources is a tell-tale sign of whether or not it has an awareness of the competing interests and stakeholders of the organization. For example, when there is an inability to effectively communicate the goal of the top hierarchy to mid-level leaders or supervisors \u2013 who in turn convey muddled messaging to their subordinates.\n\nImagine that executive management is looking at improving the growth metrics of an organization but fails to lay out the specific parameters of what it considers to be acceptable growth, mid-management might have a different (and lower) standard of growth and when this trickles down to the people are the bottom of the leadership ladder, the overall outcome will certainly be mediocre compared to the ambitious goals the executive management originally had.\n\nImproves The Ability To Listen To Others\n\nOne of the illusions of top leadership like an executive management team is the conceited believe that they are a bunch of gods who, given their position in the organization, are heads above everyone else. Nothing could be further from the truth. Emotional intelligence helps executive management teams to take a step back to accommodate the feedback they get from lower tiers of leadership because it is easy to get stuck in a bubble of assumed knowledge. Especially when it comes to designing the customer experience, the staff members who are closest to the final consumers should have significant contributions to what changes are made to products and services that will yield the greatest utility and ensure a highly satisfied customer base.\n\nHelps To Anchor Solutions\n\nThe natural instinct most times with troubleshooting is to assume that the challenge is caused by others, emotional intelligence when applied correctly may reveal that the problem may be with the systems not the people. For example, when a printing machine isn\u2019t churning out the expected quota of published material per day owing to engineering faults \u2013 an emotionally intelligent executive management will seek to interrogate the immediate and remote causes of such a shortfall instead of a knee-jerk reaction like issuing the production manager a query.\n\nSuch executive management will focus on providing the necessary conditions for productivity instead of unduly wielding the big stick. At other times, it may be that the person or people in charge of production are incompetent \u2013 what emotional intelligence helps out with is the identification of the difference so that appropriate action can be taken.\n\nHelps To Manage Diversity\n\nExecutive management doesn\u2019t only manage competences, they manage the demography of the organization. In an age where inclusion is becoming a staple in corporate organization, it is amongst the responsibility of executive management to always ensure that the composition of the workforce from top to bottom isn\u2019t disproportionately skewed \u2013 with exceptions where the very nature of the job requires specific staff.\n\nEmotional intelligence especially at the recruitment stage will factor in these nuances that foster a healthy work community. The male to female ratio, the race ratio, the age distribution, inclusion of persons with disability are important parameters to gauging the diversity quotient of the organization \u2013 some laws provide a statutory quota for minority groups such as persons with disabilities. It the job of the executive management to be abreast of these requirements.\n\nBrings About Better Negotiations\n\nMore often than not, executive management get to enter into business transactions with third-parties on behalf of the organizations. So if they are to properly present and protect the organization\u2019s interests, they have to be armed with a high level of emotional intelligence because their actions or inactions can make or mar the fortunes of the organization they represent. Emotional intelligence comprises a knowledge on not just oneself but also of others. This awareness can be weaponized via research and market intelligence.\n\nDuring the course of engaging external stakeholders or players, executive management seeks to maximize the strengths of the organization to get the best deals. Indomie for instance is aware of its brand superiority and they sell their products at a slightly higher price to distributors, ordinarily the higher retail prices should depress sales but they know that most children prefer Indomie over generic or competing noodle brands, hence the price bump isn\u2019t an issue. Same applies to partnerships, mergers and acquisitions. Access Bank acquired Diamond Bank and the former retained its eponymous brand.\n\nBetter Motivated and More Productive Teams\n\nExecutive teams that have a high level of emotional intelligence connect with their teams in ways that the lack of such skill can\u2019t. Famed business leader, Dale Carnegie submits that, \u201cWhen dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic, but with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudice and motivated by pride and vanity.\u201d Some of the innate desires of humans include the need to be respected, recognized, rewarded etc. Knowing what to do, when to do it and how to best do it is a rare skill that if applied correctly by the executive team can greatly improve outcomes.\n\nBetter Conflict Management\n\nWhere two or three human being converge and interact, conflict is inevitable. So emotional intelligence helps executive management contain tension among/within internal or external stakeholders. Internal stakeholders include shareholders, employees etc. External stakeholders include customers and regulators etc. What happens when shareholders pass a vote of no confidence on the executive team?\n\nWhat happens when employees down tools to protest the lack of a conducive work environment? What happens when regulators flags a company\u2019s product or process for not following best practices? What happens when customers boycott the organization\u2019s products and services owing to the failure of a brand to include an advertised feature? 1Over 30% of Basecamp employees, comprising most founding staff, recently left the company en masse, in protest of an new directive against political comments in the workplace. Emotional intelligence could have helps the executive management better manage this conflict.\n\nRead also: Trust, an emotional core of leadership\n\nTalent Acquisition\n\nGenerally, talent acquisition is left for the human resource department but the playbook for hiring new staff is usually routed through the executive management. An avatar of the ideal candidate should be clearly articulate and the parameters for screening also well documented. In top level recruitment however, especially c-suite positions, the executive management directly oversees the process. Many candidates come in looking and sounding like the best thing since sliced bread but upon technical interrogation and examination, the well-disguised incompetence will be unearthed.\n\nMany candidates sometimes possess all the right qualifications on paper but a diligent engagement by a team of emotionally intelligent interviewers will probe further to reveal their soft skills and other social traits that may either be a good add or a minus to the team. Emotional intelligence is so critical in talent acquisition because if all that is achieved is to stop the wrong candidate from infiltrating the corporate fabric of the organization, that counts as a huge achievement.\n\nFor Business Organizational (Re) Structuring\n\nBusinesses shouldn\u2019t just be organizations, they should be organisms \u2013 alive and responsive to their internal and external environments. Changes like mergers and acquisition, loss of key staff, expansion and the rests are commonplace, what should also be commonplace is the emotional intelligence required to deal with these changes. The executive management can arrive at an important conclusion that the current business model isn\u2019t viable nor sustainable and that it needs to pivot or expand into other markets.\n\nBy and large, it will have the same human and material resources currently at its disposal \u2013 emotional intelligence in (re)allocating such is considered key. Samsung, a South Korean brand with great social awareness transformed from exporting dried fish to producing top tier electronics amongst other things and they have been unstoppable ever since.\n\nA Much Improved Work Environment and Culture\n\nIt is often said that the intangibles greatly determine the tangibles, even if employees of an organization are well-paid and are equipped with the facilities and resources required to discharge their duties, a toxic attitude can still dampen the overarching systems of the organization. Executive management must realize that when there is no unity of purpose, where staff are better at office politics than they are at their tasks, where the voices of junior staff aren\u2019t heard \u2013 the organization will slowly but sure morph into den of saboteurs as opposed to a team of collaborators.\n\n1https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/basecamp-employees-quit-ceo-letter/",

          "title": "Do Brands Even Need Social Media?",
          "text": "It is not out of place to say that one of the most influential tools in the world today is social media.\n\nIts strategic importance cuts across every facet of human engagement including, but not limited to, business, entertainment, lifestyle, education, security and more.\n\nIn fact, it is becoming increasingly hard to find a 21st century person go through a day without checking, at least, one social media page. I am not shy to say that life without social media can be dull.\n\nFor new businesses, startups, established businesses or entrepreneurs, social media offers huge benefits. Here we have some of the benefits that come with the use of social media for brands.\n\n1. Comes With No Cost\n\nOne of the best things about the use of social media is that it is absolutely free. While advertisements and promotions help brands to achieve business goals in a faster and more efficient way, no one can deny that brands do not always get it right, and some good money get wasted in the process. However, brands can organically leverage the benefits of social media with tactical approaches, especially through tailored messages to achieve mileage, at no extra cost.\n\n2. Builds Brand Personality\n\nSocial media is one of the best tools for shaping the brand personality of any brand. With an active online presence and engaging contents for visitors, a brand can increase awareness amongst its customers, and this will ultimately result in the brand getting the desired personality, and the benefits of social media will be translated into boosted revenues.\n\n3. A Leg In the Future\n\nThe increase in the number of social media platforms underscores its strategic place of importance in human affairs. Facebook has over 2.85 billion active monthly users.\n\nIt may shock you to know that every month, 2 billion people across the globe use Whatsapp. Can you believe that everyday people watch over 1 billion hours of videos on YouTube? In fact, with 2 billion people logging on to YouTube every month, means nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s population visit the site.\n\nNeedless to say that social media is a platform that would help any brand\u2015business or personal\u2015 in connecting with many people at once.\n\nAlso, social media can be defined as a tool that is absolutely future-proof. People will continue to utilise new social media platforms in the quest for something new and interesting, and businesses can plug into these social media channels to target and convert new audiences.\n\n4. Easier Two-Way Conversations\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter whether you have your business on social media or not, there are chances that people are having conversations about the products and services you provide. The only question here is how do you wish to get a say in these conversations?\n\nActive monitoring and being present on social media will provide you with that advantage. This is one of the reasons why social media has the ability to reach out to the different customers and prospects and foster interactions with these people.\n\nBrands that have already established themselves on the platform of social media are able to taste success due to the conversations and interaction that they have with their customers.\n\n5. Boosts Brand Advocacy\n\nWell, this is in connection with the point that is mentioned above. For those brands that have proper interaction methods with their customers using social media, the results are amazing when it comes to brand advocacy.\n\nJust imagine this situation.\n\nYou have a swarm of followers that are loyal to you and they follow every single post that you make. They share them into their feed and even post valuable feedback. Wouldn\u2019t that be amazing for the brand?\n\nRead also: NGX rebrands all market indices\n\n6. Improves SEO and Search Ranking\n\nContent sharing on social media platforms has increased in worth and become very valuable in the field of Search Engine Optimization (SEO). There are many on-page SEO content types and signals which always receive more and more shares.\n\nThis will ultimately result in the boost of the rankings for the particular websites that share these content types. So, in this world full of competition, brands need to ensure that they use social media to its full advantage so that they can create SEO boosting content for their website rankings.\n\nAfter all, Google pays a lot of attention to SEO, and the only way to reap the benefits of SEO is to adopt social media.\n\n7. Links Brands With Influencers\n\nNothing can be better than finding an influencer who, with just one post, can widen the reach of your brand in front of millions of prospects.\n\nSocial media influencers enjoy huge followership on their respective social platforms. You can find the right influencer in your niche to promote your brand effectively. One positive post from an influencer can optimize your presence in a result-driven manner.\n\n8. Enhances Reputation Management\n\nYou can use social media potential to create an effective online reputation for your brand.\n\nYou can highlight your important posts, can use listening and monitoring features of social media to appreciate the best benefits of social media. Having a positive, constructive and productive online reputation is the key to ensuring great deals and boosting sales. Social Media can do this for your business, in the most limited possible time.\n\nYou can also use social media to share your side of stories. It serves as a very effective reputation and perception tool.\n\n9. Works for Targeted Advertising & Retargeting\n\nSocial media also offers the best ways to run targeted campaigns. You can use paid ads to promote your brand on the web.\n\nSocial ads are now available on all the major social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat and Instagram, amongst others.\n\nYou can easily run paid campaigns as per your target audiences, demographics and behavioural inclinations. Retargeting is one of the most awesome benefits of social media, as it lets you target those prospects who once visited your portal. With retargeting, you can focus on those customers who once participated in the buying cycle on your site but could not make the purchase. This will increase your conversions and boosts sales.\n\nLast line: Social media is definitely a large platform that helps a lot in various fields. There is no doubt about the fact that social media has become one of the most important platforms in the world today, necessary for every brand in the marketplace, especially one that wants to succeed.",

Edo is the second State to go live in the Federation as regards leveraging technology in public procurement.\n\n\u201cWe are live and can be reached from any part of the World. You can connect to our e-procurement platform from anywhere. The beauty of technology is being able to work from any part of the world.\n\n\u201cA very huge proportion of government expenditure is done through procurement, and studies have shown that if you get procurement right at any level, then you can get governance right.\n\n\u201cProcurement is a planned activity and process through which the government spends a lot of money and we are looking for ways to make it more efficient and effective using technology, which is the right way to go,\u201d Idogun added.\n\nNoting that the system will reduce human interference that breeds corruption and bias, the Managing Director stated: \u201cWith this system, transparency is sure. This system will help the state have a transparent process without bias and not allowing manipulation due to human interference.\n\n\u201cThe process of evaluating huge piles of documents from bidders who are participating in bidding will normally take several days to complete. But technology will make it easier and seamless, as the result is achieved within a shorter timeframe.\u201d\n\nHe said the agency will be having a series of training for the media, civil society, contractors and other stakeholders to enable viable dissemination of information to the general public regarding e-procurement processes using the electronic public procurement system.\n\nHailing Governor Godwin Obaseki for his efforts in the realization of the project, Idogun said, \u201cI want to thank the Governor of Edo State, Mr. Godwin Obaseki whose vision has brought us thus far. He is a dynamic personality; he is not looking at Edo State today but looking at Edo State in the future. He wants the best for the state and its people.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Head of e-procurement unit, EDPPA, Mr. Ezekiel Obazele noted: \u201cGoing live brings joy to our hearts as it will ensure transparency, openness and accountability, and help in promoting good and inclusive governance.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom has said it is deceit and hypocrisy on the part of the President Muhammadu Buhari led federal government to encourage ranching in Katsina state with the approval of N6.25billion and release of N5billion for that purpose, while at same insisting on creating cattle routes and encouraging open grazing in other states of the country.\n\nOrtom who spoke at the Makurdi Airport was reacting to the revelation by Governor Bello Masari who recently at the commissioning of the Zobe Water Project in Dutsima Katsina state said \u201cMr. President has graciously approved the sum N6.25billion for ranch development purposes in Katsina state out of which N5billion is in the account of the state government.\u201d\n\nOrtom wondered why Buhari would ask the Attorney General of the federation, Abubakar Malami to look non existent cattle routes in other states, but go to his state to fund ranching.\n\nThe governor said the federal government should apologize to him and extend the same gesture to Benue State by releasing N100billion to Benue State for the establishment of ranches in the state.\n\n\u201cSo Mr. President approved N6.5billion for ranching in Katsina state. What kind of hypocrisy is this? Are we a serious country at all?\u201d he wondered.\n\n\u201cIf the President would say that the Attorney General of the Federation should ensure the relocation of those who have encroached on cattle routes and grazing areas to do open grazing despite the surge in the population from less than 40 million in 1950 and the over 200million people today; and the same President is encouraging ranching in Katsina state where he comes from, that is certainly laughable and very hypocritical and deceitful.\n\n\u201cWe need an explanation because it is a shame. Since 2017 we have been for ranching and of course you recall that the Governor of Katsina state did say that it is un-Islamic for anybody to talk about open grazing.\n\n\u201cThe prohibition of open grazing is the only thing that will help this country including the provision for ranching. So if the president has approved N6.5billion for Katsina state, they should also approve N100billion for Benue state with an apology to me.\n\n\u201cIt is not right for the Federal Government to approve money for ranching in a state and leave others out. And in fact ,the Governor of the state in his remark said N5billion had already been remitted to their coffers. So I begin to wonder, where are we headed?\u201d\n\nGovernor Ortom who decried the level of unbearable poverty and hunger, which he said the APC led Federal Government had unleashed on Nigerians, noting that the long time prophesy of late Fela Anikulakpo of Nigerians suffering and smiling was currently playing-out in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is sad, that is why I appreciate the late Fela Anikulakpo Kuti who prophetically, in one of the songs he sang long ago foresaw what is happening today in the country; he titled it \u2018suffering and smiling,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat is exactly what we are going through in Nigeria under the APC led Federal Government. Today,Nigerians are truly suffering and smiling. I feel so sad. Tell me where we are economically, security wise, politically where is Nigeria under this government?\n\n\u201cSo when I hear people decamping from one political party to the APC, one wonders what they are going there to do in government that has failed completely in all spheres of life.\n\n\u201cEven you the journalists who are talking to me, can you in all honesty say this government of APC and the presidency have impacted your lives? So we must not be afraid to speak out.\n\n\u201cSome people used to ask why it is me that is always talking, I said well, I\u2019m not a fan of Dino Melaye but he said, \u2018if you speak the truth, you die, if you do not speak the truth, you still die\u2019. So for me I will always speak the truth and let it be on record that I stand for the truth.\n\n\u201cRecall that a foremost black American, Martin Luther King said those who keep quiet in the face of adversity, terror, persecution and challenge are worse than those perpetrating those evil. So please it is time for us all to speak out in this country because we have failed our country but I pray God helps us.\u201d",

In fact, my kids sleep in this place on daily basis. As you can see, I have my own soakaway which I maintain very well.\n\n\u201cEven my landlord was shocked when I called to tell him about my experience. He specifically told me that he stayed in the apartment for 10 years without knowing that such soakaway existed behind my kitchen door.\u201d\n\nThe 60-year-old widow averred that after she returned from market and began preparing meals that she would serve her guest, \u201cI packed the refuse from my kitchen and made my way to deposit it into the dustbin which was on the right flank some metres away from the kitchen, close to my apartment.\n\n\u201cTo my greatest chagrin, I almost sank into the soakaway pit which was covered only with sand. Immediately I stepped out of my kitchen, I heard a shattering noise and immediately felt as if I was sinking into the ground. Immediately, I screamed out and my nephew came to my rescue. It was just God at work. I sustained minor injuries from this ugly incident.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what she had done to salvage the horrific situation, the 60 year-old retired nurse, despite not being paid her gratuity, said she requested a short-term loan from trust units operating within Calabar metropolis to get the damaged soakaway fixed in a bid to safeguard her family from what she described as a death trap.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe appealed to Federal Ministry of Works, Abuja, as well as controller of the Calabar Federal Secretariat, whom she tried severally to meet without success to respond positively by offsetting her the loan used in rehabilitating the place and thus, save her embarrassment of being harassed by her creditors.\n\nReacting to the incident, the controller of the Federal Secretariat, Calabar, Engr Eziwu Patrick who acknowledged that the premises where the soakaway pit exists used to be a former engineering/ technical unit attached to the secretariat, said it has since been sold to private individuals.",

Already, parents are wary of sending their kids to school. Insecurity has not gone worse like this since 1999.\n\n\u201cSince we gained independence, and civil war, there\u2019s no moment scarier than what we have now, Oyinlola added.\n\nOyinlola also revealed that one of the conditions tabled before Buhari, before he was elected, was restructuring.\n\nOyinlola said he was saddened that Buhari claimed not to understand \u201crestructuring\u201d when interviewed.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne of the policies we sold to the South was restructuring but it was shocking that in an interview, the President said he didn\u2019t know the meaning of restructuring. May God forgive us and have mercy because this was contrary to what we envisaged.\u201d\n\nOyinlola added that: \u201cOur style of government before the military took over was federalism. In those days, the South-West, the South-East and the North did their own things separately and whatever resources they got, they sent to the centre. Education, electricity, water and the rest were provided by the regional governments and they were doing well for their people.\n\n\u201cBut now, we can\u2019t eat or drink until we get to Abuja. Buhari\u2019s administration does not align with the rules that govern a democracy.\n\nOyinlola also accused the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration of nepotism\n\n\u201cWe are all one but when government\u2019s policies, appointments and others tilt to one region of the country, there is no way other regions will not be disgruntled.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are one in this country, but it\u2019s sad that some people from certain tribes are being pampered and handled with kid gloves while others get unruly treatment. As it is now if we can\u2019t progress together as a country, it\u2019s better we go our separate ways.\n\n\u201cIt is better that we go back to our own regional government; then little was expected from the Federal Government but now even state allocations are determined by the Federal Government. This style is no longer favorable to us; so, it\u2019s better we go our separate ways.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026 Nigeria bleeding from subsidy payment \u2013 Kyari \u2018\u2026 Irregularities make amount being spent uncertain\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s compounded by politics \u2013 Economist \u2018\u2026A pro-people policy on crude refining key\u2019 \u2026 Ignorance fuelling oppositions \u2013 Sylva\n\nThe issue of fuel subsidy removal remains a thorny one with each administration engrossed in the debate. Notwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s economic realities, its fiscal authorities are at a crossroads over the desirability or otherwise of the policy; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\nThe story of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector and its entire value-chain has continued to defy explanations. With oil sale as its main source of revenue, the country has yet to fully utilise the over $300 billion realised, in three decades, from the sale of crude.\n\nAs a major oil-producing nation, Nigeria still continues to import refined products for its domestic needs. From Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, to AGO (diesel) and kerosene, many still ask why the 10th major oil- producer globally has continued to import refined fuel. This is as the several turn-around-maintenance over the years has not been able to bring the five refineries that are almost in comatose state back to life. The country has since been left with no choice other than to fund importation of fuel at a subsidised rate.\n\nA situation where some non-oil producing countries import crude oil from Nigeria, refine and sell the same to Nigeria is an indication that something is fundamentally wrong with political leadership in the country. The refineries in the countries are at different levels of disrepair and, therefore, cannot meet local demands, just as it\u2019s been argued that oil cabals make more money through importation and distribution of oil than its production.\n\nIt\u2019s also been argued that the economy and political institutions which have become woven around this system would take quite an effort to extricate.\n\nThe conundrum, the fluctuation\n\nThe removal of petroleum subsidy has been in the front burner of debates for decades; however, it has taken a worrisome dimension since the return to civil rule in 1999, given the frequency of the demand and constant public outcry over subsidy management. Fuel price was first increased from five kobo to 9.5 kobo per litre and since then, it has become a recurring decimal in the polity. Subsequently, on October 2, 1994, the price was increased from N3.25 to N15, but on October 4, the following year, it dropped from N15 to N11.\n\nAgain, in 1998, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar increased it from N11 to N25, but reduced it to N20 on January 6, 1999. By the time he left office in 2007, the Chief Olusegun Obasanjo-led administration raised it from N20 to N75.\n\nHowever, after Obasanjo left office, the President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua-led government felt it wise to reduce the price to N65. In his case, President Goodluck Jonathan increased it to N143, but subsequently reduced it to N97 after many days of protest, killings and destruction of public property. Last year, with the global price of crude dropping, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, announced that subsidy on petrol would finally go.\n\nThis is as the Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, reiterated that market forces would begin to determine the price. Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy. Experts have argued that with the refineries not working, it would be inconsiderate for the government to remove the subsidy.\n\nCrude price burden\n\nSpeaking at a recent media parley, the minister of state for petroleum resources told journalists that the rising cost of petroleum products was not healthy for the country. Toeing the same lane at a recent virtual event, the NNPC GMD warned that rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria. He added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC and were becoming a burden.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the payment of petrol subsidy had made NNPC unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nHe expressed concerns that as commodity prices rise buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\n\u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60,\u201d he said.\n\nImpact on economic growth\n\nRecent checks revealed that the federal government spends as much as N1.3 billion as subsidy for fuel. Speaking at a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum penultimate week in Abuja, Sylva made case for the removal of fuel subsidy, arguing that the petroleum sector should be deregulated. The minister insisted that the country\u2019s economic progress would remain slow except a market-driven pricing of products was put in place.\n\n\u201cA situation where you produce something at a certain cost and you have to sell it at a lower cost to people because you are taking some of that burden off the people is not the best.\n\n\u201cIt is a very desirable thing but it is also not too sustainable because what happens is that you produce it for N10, you sell it for N5; tomorrow, you produce it again at N10, you add N5 from somewhere, produce it again at N10 and sell it for another N5.\n\n\u201cSo, the losses increase and compound on a daily basis and those accumulated losses have brought us to where we are.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that subsidy was part of what made the refineries to stop operating, the minister said, \u201cPart of the reasons the refineries were not working is subsidy because a refinery that is producing something at a certain cost and selling at a loss, how can it sustain itself. If you are producing something and they are selling at a certain subsidised price, it cannot work. That is why you see that the sector is not growing at all.\u201d\n\nThe former Bayelsa state governor also used the opportunity to blast Nigerians stating that the lack of understanding of the real issues about subsidy had led to serious opposition to its removal. He wondered why Nigerians have continued to oppose deregulation of petrol when other products such as kerosene and diesel have been deregulated.\n\n\u201cIt is actually in the interest of the common Nigerian to ensure that some people do not just profiteer on them, which is what has been happening. But at the end of the day, I believe that it is better for us because if we are able to deregulate, then we can save money.\n\n\u201cFirst, you can imagine the savings we will make as far as Foreign Exchange (Forex) is concerned and, of course, it will bring down the pressure on forex.\n\n\u201cPeople will be able to access Forex for imports, the government will not be the one providing foreign exchange for the importation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since the government will no longer be subsidising, the money which is over a trillion naira yearly, would be gained, instead of being burnt in cars, and would then be used for development.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much money the federal and state governments will have at their disposal if there is deregulation.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s concerns\n\nIn the same vein, the GMD NNPC disclosed that the country was bleeding from continuous subsidy payment. According to Kyari, the federal government can no longer sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume put at 100 million litres.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA database we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month. That means we can do with less than 70 million, the balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country.\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June. There was a day we got about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201cWe know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC are not in control of that; we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots. But when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the managing director of SD&D Capital Management Limited, Gabriel Idakolo, told Blueprint Weekend that with so many irregularities in the sector, it has become difficult for the government to ascertain the amount it spends on subsidies.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are several irregularities in the system and the Nigerian State cannot presently state the statistics of petroleum import to Nigeria. The actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it. There is also high level corruption surrounding petroleum subsidies which has made it difficult for the government to solve the problem of subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, a political economist and development researcher, Olamilekan Adefolarin, in a chat with this reporter said the politics around fuel subsidy has made it difficult for the government to address the subsidy issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cSubsidy removal on PMS and the deregulation of the downstream sector is one of the oldest and most fundamental issues of governance, politics and economy in Nigeria. Since 1999, no civilian administration has been proactive enough to tame the problems in our petroleum sector; rather they compound the challenges in that sector through anti-people policies that ended up reversing whatever gains or progress that should have impacted the economy.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the statement from the NNPC GMD and that of minister are not new and Nigerians are already aware of the Nigerian state failure. Regrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.\n\n\u201cThe question around the four refineries rehabilitation and turn-around-maintenance over the years has proven their inept and fragrant resource wastages. In addition to this is the politics and corruption in the oil and gas sector perpetuated by the ruling class who are enjoying the proceeds of subsidy.\u201d\n\nRemedy\n\nAdefolarin suggested that to address the situation, the government must come out with a pro-people policy especially as it relates to refining crude. He noted that policy that \u201cencourages the refining of crude oil in Nigeria is the appropriate policy the government must ensure it deploys to put an end to petrol importation.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, must translate to building and owning a new refinery on behalf the citizens and encouraging private individuals to build, even as he expressed the optimism that state governments could do likewise with modular refineries.\n\n\u201cEqually, to end this quagmire there is the need for the government, especially the national assembly, to pass the petroleum industry bill (PIB) for the president\u2019s assent so as to reduce the politics around the law.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Idakolo insisted that the NNPC in conjunction with the PPMC and other regulators needed to generate actual statistics of petroleum import to enable the government to plan adequately.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy must be removed on the long run but it must be after we have been able to achieve self sufficiency in petroleum products distribution through the optimisation of the five Nigerian refineries.\n\n\u201cWe should also collaborate with private refineries, especially Dangote Refinery, which will come on stream by 2022. Perpetrators of the subsidy scam must be prosecuted by the government.\u201d",

Doguwa said it was not a problem if his party, the APC, was against electronic transmission.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with not wanting electronic transmission of results? We have over 49.3 percent of the Nigerian population not covered by network and that would amount to absolute disenfranchisement, so it is a political matter,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The United States has imposed sanctions on seven Chinese officials over Beijing\u2019s crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong. This is Washington\u2019s latest effort to hold China accountable for what it calls an erosion of rule of law in the former British colony.\n\nThe sanctions, posted by the US Treasury Department on Friday, are aimed at individuals from China\u2019s Hong Kong liaison office, used by Beijing to orchestrate its policies in the Chinese territory.\n\nThe seven people added to Treasury\u2019s \u201cspecially designated nationals\u201d list were Chen Dong, He Jing, Lu Xinning, Qiu Hong, Tan Tienui, Yang Jianping, and Yin Zonghua, all deputy directors at the liaison office, according to online data.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Chinese officials over the past year had \u201csystematically undermined\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s democratic institutions, delayed elections, disqualified elected legislators from office, and arrested thousands for disagreeing with government policies.\n\n\u201cIn the face of Beijing\u2019s decisions over the past year that have stifled the democratic aspirations of people in Hong Kong, we are taking action. Today we send a clear message that the United States resolutely stands with Hong Kongers,\u201d Blinken said in a statement.\n\nThe Treasury Department referred to a separate updated business advisory issued jointly with the departments of State, Commerce, and Homeland Security that highlighted US government concerns about the effect on international companies of Hong Kong\u2019s national security law.\n\nCritics say Beijing implemented that law last year to facilitate a crackdown on pro-democracy activists and a free press.\n\nThe advisory said companies face risks associated with electronic surveillance without warrants and the surrender of corporate and customer data to authorities, adding that individuals and businesses should be aware of the potential consequences of engaging with sanctioned individuals or entities.\n\nThe actions were announced just over a year after former President Donald Trump ordered an end to Hong Kong\u2019s special status under US law to punish China for what he called \u201coppressive actions\u201d against the territory.\n\nThe United States has already imposed sanctions on other senior officials, including Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and senior police officers, for their roles in curtailing political freedoms in the territory.\n\nHong Kong officials previously called those US sanctions \u201chostile acts of hegemony\u201d.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Xia Baolong, the director of China\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, was quoted by Hong Kong Free Press as saying that sanctions will \u201conly evoke our anger\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou would only lift a rock and drop it heavily on your own feet. The long river of history has proven countless times that victory must belong to the indomitable Chinese people!\u201d Xia said in a speech.\n\nAlso on Friday, Hong Kong\u2019s national security police searched the University of Hong Kong\u2019s student union, after the government and university officials denounced students for allegedly sympathising with a man who stabbed a police officer in early July.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said at a news conference on Thursday that the Chinese government had broken its commitment on how it would deal with Hong Kong since it returned to Chinese control in 1997.\n\nChina had promised universal suffrage as an ultimate goal for Hong Kong in its mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which also states the city has wide-ranging autonomy from Beijing.\n\nSince China imposed the national security law to criminalise what it considers subversion, secessionism, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces, most pro-democracy activists and politicians have found themselves ensnared by it or arrested for other reasons.\n\nApple Daily, Hong Kong\u2019s most vocal pro-democracy newspaper, was forced to end a 26-year run in June amid the crackdown that froze the company\u2019s funds.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a news conference in Beijing before the actions were formally announced that the US should stop interfering in Hong Kong and that China would make a \u201cresolute, strong response\u201d.\n\nThe US has already imposed sanctions on other senior officials, including Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and senior police officers, for their roles in curtailing political freedoms in the territory [Isaac Lawrence/AFP]\n\nA source told the Reuters news agency on Thursday that the White House was also reviewing a possible executive order to facilitate immigration from Hong Kong but that it was still not certain to be implemented.\n\nUS Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman is preparing a visit to Japan, South Korea and Mongolia next week. The State Department\u2019s announcement of her trip made no mention of any stop in China, which had been anticipated in foreign policy circles and reported in some media.\n\nA senior State Department official told reporters on Friday that Washington was still in talks with Beijing over whether Sherman would visit China.\n\nThe US government on Tuesday also strengthened warnings to businesses about the growing risks of having supply-chain and investment-links to China\u2019s Xinjiang region, citing forced labour and human rights abuses there, which Beijing has denied.\n\n\u201cWe hope that any additional US actions related to Hong Kong will remain targeted, and that Washington will avoid policy choices detrimental to Hong Kong\u2019s people,\u201d Anna Ashton, the vice president of government affairs at the US-China Business Council, said about the advisory issued on Friday.\n\nThe South China Morning Post newspaper also said that the latest decision was greeted with a \u201ccollective shrug\u201d from analysts.\n\nThe Hong Kong-based news publication quoted former US Consul General in Hong Kong Richard Boucher as saying: \u201cEvery time there\u2019s some news of China putting more pressure on Hong Kong, there\u2019s commensurate pressure on the US side to do something. But they\u2019re running out of things to do.\u201d\n\nOther analysts were also reported as saying that the move is more symbolic, as the US is \u201ccaught between pressure to respond to Beijing\u2019s clampdown and a business community still seeking market access.\u201d",

Prime Minister Alexander De Croo declared 20 July a national day of mourning.\n\nHe said the floods \u2013 which have claimed at least 20 lives in Belgium \u2013 could be \u201cthe most catastrophic our country has ever seen\u201d.\n\nRescue workers from France, Italy and Austria were sent to the city of Liege, where residents were evacuated after flash floods.\n\nMeanwhile in the Netherlands, thousands of people fled their homes in Limburg province as rising waters swamped cities and broke through a dyke.\n\nBut waters were receding in the southern city of Maastricht and nearby towns, where residents were able to return to their homes on Friday.\n\nIn Switzerland, lakes and rivers were also swelling after heavy rainfall. The river running through the Swiss capital Bern burst its banks on Friday.\n\nLake Lucerne is flooding into the town and people in Basel have been told to keep well away from the River Rhine.",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden has said that social media companies are \u201ckilling people\u201d by failing to police misinformation on their platforms about Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nBiden\u2019s comments came a day after US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared misinformation about the vaccines a threat to public health and as US officials advised that deaths and serious illness from the virus are almost entirely preventable because of the vaccines.\n\nBiden, asked if he had a message for platforms like Facebook where false or misleading information about the coronavirus vaccines has spread, told reporters on Friday: \u201cThey\u2019re killing people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, Murthy said misinformation about COVID-19, deemed an \u201cinfodemic\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO), was deadly.\n\n\u201cMisinformation poses an imminent and insidious threat to our nation\u2019s health,\u201d Murthy said during remarks on Thursday at the White House. \u201cWe must confront misinformation as a nation. Lives are depending on it.\u201d\n\nGiven the role the internet plays in spreading health misinformation, Murthy said technology companies and social media platforms must make meaningful changes to their products and software to reduce the spread of false information while increasing access to authoritative, fact-based sources.\n\nToo often, he said, the platforms are built in ways that encourage, not counter, the spread of misinformation.\n\n\u201cWe are asking them to step up,\u201d Murthy said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait longer for them to take aggressive action.\u201d\n\nFacebook spokesperson Dani Lever responded: \u201cWe will not be distracted by accusations which aren\u2019t supported by the facts. The fact is that more than 2 billion people have viewed authoritative information about Covid-19 and vaccines on Facebook, which is more than any other place on the internet. More than 3.3 million Americans have also used our vaccine finder tool to find out where and how to get a vaccine. The facts show that Facebook is helping save lives. Period.\u201d\n\nTwitter posted on its platform, \u201cAs the Covi-19 pandemic evolves around the world, we\u2019ll continue to do our part to elevate authoritative health information.\u201d\n\nThe Delta variant of the coronavirus is now the dominant strain worldwide, accompanied by a surge of deaths around the United States almost entirely among unvaccinated people, US officials said on Friday.\n\nAmerican cases of COVID-19 are up 70 percent over the previous week and deaths are up 26 percent, with outbreaks occurring in parts of the country with low vaccination rates.\n\nEarlier on Friday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also criticised Facebook.\n\n\u201cObviously, there are steps they have taken. They\u2019re a private-sector company,\u201d Psaki told a White House briefing. \u201cThere are additional steps they can take. It\u2019s clear that there are more that can be taken.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, she said the Biden administration was in regular contact with Facebook and was flagging problematic posts.\n\nPsaki said 12 people were responsible for almost 65 percent of anti-vaccine misinformation on social media platforms. The finding was reported in May by the Washington- and London-based nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate but Facebook has disputed the methodology.",
