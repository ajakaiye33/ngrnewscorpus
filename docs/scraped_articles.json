While being interviewed in custody, he confirmed he is the owner of the seized illicit drug,\u201d the NDLEA said in the statement.\n\nThe Agency also said over 6,043.857 kilograms of assorted illicit drugs were recovered in five states of Adamawa, Ondo, Ekiti, Edo and Ebonyi with more than two hectares of cannabis farms destroyed in operations it carried out.\n\n\u201cA suspected fake security agent, Abdullahi Mohammed, who claimed to be serving in one of the security formations in Mubi, Adamawa state was arrested with four blocks of Cannabis Sativa weighing 4kg along Bazza- Michika road. In the same vein, four other suspects were arrested at different locations in Jimeta, Yola North LGA, with assorted substances such as Cannabis, Diazepam, Exol- 5 and Tramadol tablets.\n\n\u201cIn Ondo state, three persons: Alabi Idowu; Oluwatomipe Olorundare and Finity Sunday were arrested on Monday 15th November and a total of 2,771kgs of Cannabis recovered from them at Oke Ogun camp, Ipele, Owo LGA, while 59-year-old Mrs. Joy Peter was nabbed with over 39kg cannabis and Tramadol tablets on Wednesday 17th Nov.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, over 2, 832kg of drugs were seized and more than two hectares of cannabis farms destroyed in parts of Ekiti state.

Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) commended the officers and men involved in the operations across the commands for sustaining the heat on drug cartels in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are proving to the bad guys and merchants of death that we will not stay a step ahead of them but two steps in this game, and this we must sustain as we prepare to go into the new year,\u201d Marwa said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Mixed reactions have continued to trail the 14-day paternity leave approved by the Federal Government on Sept. 29 for fathers of new-born and adopted babies.\n\nWhile some respondents commended the Federal Government for the gesture, others told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the approval was not necessary.\n\nThe approval seeks to allow men to properly bond with their new-born babies or adopted ones.\n\nMr John Silas, a civil servant, who appreciated the gesture, said that it would help lactating mothers to be more comfortable.\n\n\u201cIt is a welcome development because it will help me to support my wife in taking care of the baby, most especially in making sure that exclusive breastfeeding is fully applied,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAnother respondent, Mr Mohammed Bashir, said that the responsibility of child care after childbirth should not be left to mothers alone.\n\nAccording to him, the policy is apt because it will encourage men to also play key roles in child upbringing after birth.\n\n\u201cThe policy is a right step in the right direction since sometimes children are left alone in the hands of people we they do not even know.\n\n\u201cIt should not be the responsibility of women alone to look after the new-born; men should have a stake in the process. Government has really done what needs to be done,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMr Sunday Ukoha, another civil servant said he supported the Federal Government for the approval.\n\n\u201cI am happy with the approval of the paternity leave because it will help me to support my wife, particularly soon after she is delivered of the baby.\n\n\u201cIt will help her to have adequate rest,\u2019\u2019 Ukoha said.\n\nRachel Chigozie, a businesswoman, also thanked the Federal Government for the gesture.\n\n\u201cI fully support the paternity leave; imagine my husband being there for me after delivery; it will be encouraging.\n\n\u201cHe will help me out in so many ways like in house chores in the early stage or in running some errands that will be required of him.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the contrary, Mrs Phina Mefor, a public servant, told NAN that the paternity leave was not necessary.\n\n\u201cWhat will men be doing during the paternity leave? Breastfeeding the baby or bathing the baby\u2019\u2019? she queried.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is necessary because my mother is always there to fully support me.\n\n\u201cMen can request for casual leave if need be and not an official paternity leave,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nMr Adabayo Olabisi, another respondent said that the paternity leave should be designed to suit both fathers and mothers.\n\n\u201cPaternity leave for fathers is good on the one hand and bad on the other hand; how will a 14-day leave impact on the neo-natal period in the upbringing of the new-born?\n\n\u201cThe policy should be tailored for both mothers and fathers to take care of their new-born together at the early stages,\u2019\u2019 Olabisi said.\n\nMr Abubakar Kabir, a lecturer, also argued that the men would not be doing anything at home during the leave.\n\n\u201cI totally disagree with it because the mother and the child need financial support than just for the man to be at home doing nothing.\n\n\u201cIt is more meaningful if the man is given some more money to take care of mother and child.\n\n\u201cBesides, the mother of the woman will be around to support the nursing mother,\u2019\u2019 he said.

          "text": "By Omeiza Ajayi, Abuja\n\nA chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress APC and Director General, Voice of Nigeria VON, Mr Osita Okechukwu has urged the Indigenous People of Biafran IPoB to sheathe its sword and work with other Igbo leaders of thought to actualize the dream of having a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction in 2023.\n\nAddressing journalists Sunday in Abuja, Mr Okechukwu also appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to honour elder statesman Chief Mbazulike Amechi with the release of IPOB leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cI join Ohaneze Ndigbo, eminent constitutional lawyer and Chairman, Igbo Leaders of Thought, Prof Ben Nwabueze, and people of goodwill nationwide in commending President Muhammadu Buhari for accepting to consider the release of held leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra IPoB, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cI also appeal to IPoB to support Nigerian President of Igbo extraction 2023 project. Methinks IPOB support will kill two birds with one stone.\u201d Okechukwu submitted.\n\nIt would be recalled that Igbo leaders led by the First Republic Aviation Minister, Chief Mbazuluike Amechi, had visited President Buhari in Aso Rock at the weekend, where they requested the president to release the IPOB leader, who was intercepted in Kenya in June this year.\n\nKanu had fled Nigeria in 2017, jumping bail after his Afaraukwu home in Abia State was invaded by soldiers. He is being tried of treason.\n\nAsked if IPoB support for the Igbo 2023 project is a precondition for the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, Mr Okechukwu answered in the negative.\n\n\u201cCapital No! It is not a precondition. All I am saying is that Mr President and a host of other Nigerians are silently in support of Nigerian president of Igbo extraction 2023 project but are weary and reticent of IPoB\u2019s stance. Therefore, in my little opinion, IPoB support of our project will kill two birds with one stone.\u201d Okechukwu explained.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cone stone is the release of Mazi Kanu while the other is the return of economic activities to the geopolitical zone and thirdly IPOB support will no doubt rekindle wider support of Nigeria president of Igbo extraction 2023 project.\n\n\u201cMy understanding of IPoB agitation is to end Igbo marginalization. If that is the case, then our 2023 Nigerian President of Igbo extraction will be the end of the civil war. Nigerians are waiting for IPoB to change gear\u201d, he added.\n\nPresident Buhari had during the visit of some Igbo leaders last week said even though he would not interfere with the operations of the Judiciary, he would nonetheless consider their plea for the release of Mr Kanu.\n\n\u201cYou have made an extremely difficult demand on me as leader of this country. The implication of your request is very serious. In the last six years since I became president, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the Judiciary.\n\n\u201cI said that the best thing was to subject him to the system. Let him make his case in court, instead of giving very negative impressions of the country from the outside. I feel it is even a favour to give him that opportunity\u201d, Buhari had said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Wants maximum punishment for perpetrators\n\nShina Abubakar, Osogbo\n\nFamily of murdered Timothy Adegoke, the OAU postgraduate\u2019s student found dead after lodging at Hilton Hotel and Resort has demanded that full punishment be meted to those culpable in killing the deceased.\n\nA statement issued by the Family counsel, Kayode Ajulo & Co on behalf of the family which was obtained by Sunday Vanguard stated that strangled to death and hurriedly buried in a shallow grave.\n\nREAD ALSOOld students of Unity Schools call for protection of schools in Nigeria\n\nWhile commending the Osun State Police Command for its promptness in attending to the matter, the family charged the command to ensure that every culpable persons are made to face justice.\n\nThe statement reads, \u201cWe act as solicitors to the family of the deceased; our Client, whose illustrious son, Mr. Timothy Oludare, was murdered in a cold-blooded manner in his hotel room at Ile-Ife, Osun State and it is on their unequivocal instructions that we issue this statement.\n\n\u201cFor contextual expediency, it is needful to state that the late Timothy Oludare, a 37-year-old husband and father of three had travelled from Abuja to Ile-Ife, Osun State on the 5th of November, 2021 in furtherance of his Masters of Business Administration studies at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State. He subsequently checked in at the Hilton and Resorts Hotel owned by Dr. Ramon Adedoyin, the founder of Oduduwa University on the same ill-fated day. He went \u2018missing\u2019 for the next two days only for his dead and mutilated body to be found buried in a shallow grave near the hotel.\n\n\u201cWe welcome with keen interest, the news of the arrest of six suspects linked to the gruesome murder of Mr. Timothy Oludare by men of the Osun State Police Command on the 15th November 2021. Indeed, the preliminary investigation, arrests and findings have nullified the initial apprehension that the deceased must have fallen into the hands of killer herdsmen which if true, could have exacerbated ethnic tensions in Osun State and beyond. While commending the leadership of the Nigeria Police Force for these painstaking efforts, we however strongly want to emphasize that it will serve the overriding interest of justice to bring all those involved in this dastardly murder to book.\n\n\u201cIt is worrisome and sad that Mr. Timothy Oludare can be cut down in his prime for motives best known to his killers which of course, must be extracted and investigated by the Police without delay. It portends serious danger that a place meant to serve the temporary accommodation needs of Nigerians and non-Nigerians alike could in actual fact be a place where cold-blooded murders are orchestrated and carried out in the most desperate and daring manner. Again, we note the temerity and the audacity in which the murder of the late Timothy Oludare was carried out as contained in the preliminary findings made by the Osun State Police Command. According to the findings, our Client\u2019s son was strangled to death in his hotel room, his body was subsequently mutilated and wrapped in a blood-soaked blanket/bedsheet belonging to the hotel and finally buried in a shallow grave near the hotel.\n\n\u201cThe law is clear that an offender(s) who causes the death of a person is guilty of murder under 316 of the Criminal Code Laws Cap 34, Laws of Osun State and same is punishable by death under Section 319 of the same law and it is our legally considered view that the confessional statements as obtained from some of the suspects are cogent enough to establish the varying degrees of guilt of all the suspects.\n\n\u201cAs things stand, the hotel and its vicinity are a crime scene and should be treated as such, nothing must be on the way of a thorough and wider investigation of this highly reprehensible murder because nobody irrespective of their status or influence is bigger than the extant laws of the land.\n\n\u201cWe therefore urge utmost professionalism by the Police in this matter; no stone must be left unturned to get to the root of this matter. On our part, we are ready to partner with the Police to ensure that justice is not only done but seen to be done. While we trust that this matter will reach its expected legal conclusion, we want to reiterate that we will not hesitate for a second to do everything within legally permissible limits to fight anyone who attempts to frustrate the expected end of justice.\n\n\u201cAs it is historically believed that Ile-Ife is the cradle of the human race, it is important that the ancient city and by extension, other parts of the nation must not be allowed to become safe havens for murderers and other criminals alike. It shreds our collective humanity into pieces when the blood of any innocent Nigerian can be spilled without consequences.\n\n\u201cConclusively, as a firm committed to the promotion of the rule of law and protection of the fundamental rights of all law abiding citizens which include among others, the right to life, we are emphatically restating that the killers of Timothy Oludare must face the full weight of the law\u201d.",
          "summary": "A statement issued by the Family counsel, Kayode Ajulo & Co on behalf of the family which was obtained by Sunday Vanguard stated that strangled to death and hurriedly buried in a shallow grave.\nIndeed, the preliminary investigation, arrests and findings have nullified the initial apprehension that the deceased must have fallen into the hands of killer herdsmen which if true, could have exacerbated ethnic tensions in Osun State and beyond.\n\u201cIt is worrisome and sad that Mr. Timothy Oludare can be cut down in his prime for motives best known to his killers which of course, must be extracted and investigated by the Police without delay.\nAgain, we note the temerity and the audacity in which the murder of the late Timothy Oludare was carried out as contained in the preliminary findings made by the Osun State Police Command.\nIt shreds our collective humanity into pieces when the blood of any innocent Nigerian can be spilled without consequences.",

          "text": "Southwest Camerounians have claimed they depend on food and other items from Nigeria to survive.\n\nThe Southwest Cameroun region, also known as the Ambazonian Republic is fighting for independence from the country following blockade from other parts of the mother country.\n\nThe region has appealed to the international community, especially Nigeria to help in prosecuting a war against Cameroun.\n\nBishops and other congregants from the region who were in Calabar, Nigeria, over the weekend for a religious event disclosed this to DAILY POST.\n\n63-year-old Bishop Victor Takomi from Mamfe in a chat with our correspondent said even though insurrection is ensuing bitterly between the Ambazonian Boys and President Paul Biya\u2019s soldiers, they all need food. We, in particular, need food and supports from Nigeria because we face a blockade within Cameroon.\u201d\n\nHe said despite the hostilities Nigerian businessmen still defy the guns to export foods into Cameroon without which hunger would have become their second-highest killer after the guns.\n\nHe said commercial activities still thrive between the two regions and Nigeria though it is not a tea party to move or cross the international border.\n\n\u201cIn my part of \u2018Ambazonia\u2019, we export mostly palm oil and cocoa to Nigeria. We go through lots of hassles, risks to our lives and detentions to be able to export or get foods from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNigerians have helped us tremendously. They export almost everything to us such as foods, textiles, electronics, detergents, drinks etc.\n\n\u201cWith or without border closure or killings, the volumes of businesses are high.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is that they don\u2019t really harass Nigerians that bring foods to us. Our Amba Boys would only harass anybody not necessarily Nigerians if they suspect saboteurs or soldiers from the La Republique du Cameroon.\n\n\u201cFor instance, when we were coming, many vehicles were intercepted. We were blocked in Cameroon by Amba Boys when we were coming to Nigeria. Some drivers and passengers were taken into the bush, some returned while some did not.\u201d\n\nTakom said that fighting would usually erupt when military vehicles approach, or when they have information about sabotage or suspicious movements.\n\nAccording to him, every day is not a fighting day, disclosing, too, that there are certain days which the Amba Boys would declare no movement. \u201cOn such days you are much at risk if you disobey.\u201d\n\nHe also said that whereas they were able to leave Cameroon without harm despite the hostilities but when they crossed into Ikom and Ugep towns in Cross River State in the night on their way to Calabar, armed robbers attacked them.",

          "text": "The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has urged Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje to stop the revocation of facilities and sale of Yusuf Maitama Sule University Kano properties.\n\nThe union said the illegal allocations and selling of land vested to the University at the Main Campus, along Muhammadu Buhari Way and the revocation of Kwanar Dawaki Campus and Centre for Entrepreneurship Studies at Dawakin Tofa Local Government, should be reverted.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued by the ASUU, Chairman of Yusuf Maitama Sule University Kano branch Dr. Abdulrazaq Ibrahim on Saturday.\n\nThe statement said, \u2018\u2019In the interest of preserving industrial harmony; reinstate the affected facilities and the land to the University. It also draws his attention to abstain from taking further decisions that could potentially undermine the growth of and expansion in the University.\n\nThe statement said,\u2019\u2019 The Government had revoked an important facility of the University at Kwanar Dawaki which was hosting faculty of Basic Medical sciences. This leaves the faculty members with no option but to squat in a small building at the Main Campus and the students shuttling between Campuses for lectures and practical\u2019s.\n\n\u2018\u2019Recently, the Government also revoked another University facility; Centre for Entrepreneurship Studies at Dawakin Tofa Local Government. This action, in particular, jeopardizes the conduct of Entrepreneurship Studies and IJMB programs offered by the University.\u2019\u2019\n\nIt said the unprecedented sale of state-owned properties by the Kano State Government is no longer news. More worrisome is revocation and sales of properties belonging to a virtually new University that aspires for growth.\n\n\u2018\u2019It is worthy condemning that the State Government had converted land vested to the University at the Main Campus, to commercial plots in areas not designed for such purpose. This trend is not only distorting the present and future plans of the University as contained in its Academic Brief but also making it grossly uncertain. Thus, the Government is in clear violation of the FGN-ASUU 2009 Agreement which ensures University Autonomy and Academic Freedom.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2019As a pressure group, the Union will continue to monitor the situation closely with a view to protecting the university from eventual collapse. We also call on all stakeholders to join hands with the Union in ensuring that the sanctity of the University is assured.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2019The Union strongly insists that the government should put a stop to this unacceptable behaviour and to expedite action to reinstate the listed facilities and land property. It is, therefore, worthy of note that failure to address these issues will leave the Union with no option but to take legal action.\u2019\u2019\n\nChapter five (5) b. (iii) of the Agreement provides that \u201cthere is need for all sides, that is, Government and the University, actively to promote and protect University Autonomy and Academic Freedom in accordance with the goals and objectives of the university and the law\u201d\n\nUniAbuja abduction: ASUU calls for immediate rescue of members",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nStrong indications emerged yesterday that the All Progressives Congress (APC) may be engulfed in a fresh crisis over disagreement in the zoning arrangements to be adopted for the national leadership of the ruling party ahead of the 2023 presidential and general elections.\n\nSunday Sun gathered from a credible source in the party that following the rejection of the proposal to zone the national chairmanship position of the party to the Southeast by the party stakeholders, the governors under the auspices of APC Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) will meet in Abuja today at night to deliberate on the zoning arrangements and other sundry issues affecting the party.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nOur source also disclosed that although the zoning arrangement for presidential ticket of the party would be played down during the PGF meeting today, they would, however, deliberate on the zoning arrangement for the national leadership of the party and a possible date for the much-awaited party\u2019s national convention.\n\nThe source also explained that since the initial tentative plan proposed by the stakeholders to hold the convention on December 17 or 18 will likely not be feasible, the governors might likely change and shift the date by one month, likely the second week of January 2022, explaining that the collective opinion was that the initial December date could be so choked with Christmas festivities.\n\nAlso revealing that since the undue pressure from certain quarters for the Southeast to take the chairmanship position has been roundly rejected by the stakeholders in the zone, including the two APC governors, and other party chieftains in the zone, our source said that it would also be resolved during the meeting.\n\n\u201cI can confirm to you that the APC governors will be meeting in Abuja on Sunday. They will deliberate among other things on the National Convention and zoning arrangements for the party\u2019s national leadership. You know that there have been undue pressures from certain blocs of the party on the Southeast zone to accept the position of the national chairmanship.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is now crystal clear to them that the zone is not ready to accept or be intimidated into accepting that position they are imposing on them. From the governors to the least stakeholder in the Southeast, nobody bought into such proposal. The Southeast party caucus and leaders have taken a position, after meeting recently, not to accept the proposal to zone the party\u2019s chairmanship position to the zone.\n\n\u201cAnd regardless of the outcome of the meeting of the governors on Sunday, the Southeast stakeholders are not likely to shift ground in rejecting the chairmanship position. We are equally good enough to be the president of this country not just the inconsequential position of the party\u2019s national chairmanship they are imposing on us,\u201d the source noted in anger.\n\nThe source also told Sunday Sun that \u201canother thing that will constitute an item in the agenda for the meeting of the governors will be the likely date for the party\u2019s national convention. You know that December 17 or 18 this year was initially proposed, but it is obvious that it may not be tenable because conducting the convention will be choked by the Christmas festivities. So, the governors will also deliberate on the likelihood of extending it by one month, which will fall in the middle of January next year.\n\n\u201cLet me also inform you that the governors will not discuss the issue of zoning of the presidential ticket for 2023. The decision to skip it is deliberate because they want to take it one at a time even though we know very well that once the issue of zoning for the national leadership is resolved, it is as good as resolving the issue of zoning of the presidential ticket.\u201d\n\nRecently, the report of Southeast APC leaders rejecting the chairmanship position of the party had dominated the social media platform, with the insistent that they are only interested in position of the presidency.\n\nQuoting the spokesman of a group, Chief Chinedu Ogbonna, who also issued a threat on erring politicians, the statement read: \u201cIgbo leaders are reaching out to other regions for their support in producing the next president in 2023 in the interest of peace, equity and unity just as the Igbo have supported other regions in the past, therefore, Igbo should not be seen hurting their own cause.\n\n\u201cWe call on our politicians from the Southeast extraction to go all out and contest. Our people are blessed; we have enough presidential materials like former President of the Senate, Sen. Ken Nnamani, Governor Dave Umahi, Chris Ngige, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu and many others.\n\n\u201cSo, we are ready, our stand is that any politicians from Igboland who put him/herself up for the position of national chairman would be regarded as a traitor and an enemy of the Igbo people and history won\u2019t be kind on that fellow. It is simply treacherous,\u201d the group warned.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "title": "How zoning rocked Jonathan\u2019s presidency in 2015 \u2013 Nwankwo, ex-minister",
          "text": "From CHIJIOKE AGWU, Abakaliki\n\nChief Fidelis Nwankwo is a former Minister of State for Health under former President Goodluck Jonathan. In this interview with Sunday Sun, Nwankwo who is also a one-time Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Federal Commissioner spoke on the zoning controversy in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and other topical national issues.\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight as a minister in President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s administration, what do you think was the major factor for the PDP losing the 2015 presidential election?\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nWell, honestly speaking, by the time we lost the election, it was not obvious to us. We didn\u2019t foresee it, but with hindsight, one can begin to hazard some guesses as to the reasons I think we lost that election. I want to believe that one of the factors was the issue of rotation of the position of the Presidency within our party, the People\u2019s Democratic Party. You recall that at the inception of the political party in 1998, the first president was Olusegun Obasanjo, a Southerner. He did two tenures of eight years, and after him there was Musa Yar\u2019Adua whose tenure was short-lived because of death. Incidentally going by the constitution, Goodluck Jonathan who was his vice president had to take over and completed his four years in the first tenure; he did a full four-year tenure of his own and wanted to go back, probably that was a mistake we in PDP made. We didn\u2019t know that this was not well received even by members of the party from the North. But probably again due to the power of incumbency, it was not properly voiced out, and we went into that election thinking that we had a united front, not knowing that some people had resentments and to the point they were either unwilling to sell the Jonathan presidency in the North, and in some cases they were even afraid because the people felt that they were betraying them by joining forces with the South to extend the tenure of Jonathan. So, for me, I think that was the main reason we lost that election. That means that we really have to take the issue of zoning or rotation of positions seriously, I think we can learn from that mistake.\n\nFrom what you said, the PDP lost the presidency due to poorly managed zoning issue. Are you not seeing the party repeating the same mistake in 2023 going by the sound bites from the PDP?\n\nThis is a little bit of a tricky situation sincerely speaking. You talked about rotation in the context of political party. APC just had its own presidency from the North for eight years by 2023, and I think to them it is a very straight forward matter in terms of decision making. So, with that they can simply say we have had eight years of the North, it can simply go to the South. For PDP, it is a little bit tricky because last time we picked from the South it backfired. Should we go back to the same South having had a Northern president or should we stick to the North that felt that they were denied? So, I think it is a tricky situation and the party, thank God the party now has new Executives and part of their job is to give the party a new direction. I think the best thing is to wait for them to assume office and articulate what they think is the best for the party and the country at large because they have to put all available information into use and advise the party either to do zoning by zoning to the South which is the clamour of members especially non-partisan people or zone to the North, to correct the mistakes of 2019 or still the third option, throw it open and let the best candidate emerge. We have sacrificed eight years to APC so to say. But for me, it is better to act from the point of view of knowledge, researched information; we should be able to find out the views of the majority of the party members, stakeholders, what do they think the party members would prefer, what do they think is the message that Nigerians should buy if we are selling because when you are selling this message it is not just to the PDP members, we are selling to the Nigerian electorate, what would they want to hear is very important.\n\nWhat is your assessment of the Muhammadu Buhari presidency?\n\nLet\u2019s look at security for instance. You don\u2019t need security experts or anybody to tell you the security situation in the country today. It is something that you can see and smell. The insecurity in 2015 was child\u2019s play compared to what we have now. I think we have lost our sense of outrage because when you say 30 killed by herdsmen or bandits, people no longer stop to shiver, it has become a normal thing. I think in 2015, what was common then was just Boko Haram, but more things have been added; the bandits, the herdsmen, the IPOB, the ESN, everywhere is insecure. I think if you judge them by that criteria alone, it is a disaster. We have witnessed a lot of killings and destruction under this APC government that it has got to a stage where nothing shocks us again in terms of insecurity.\n\nWhat is your reaction to the just held Anambra State election; candidate of your party, Valentine Ozigbo came a distant second?\n\nLet me put it this way, I am not happy that our party didn\u2019t win that election because we have always had the potential to take Anambra State governorship, but lack of proper organization by the party, has always cost us the governorship. If you watch the process of our party primary that produced the candidate, then you will not be too surprised; it was rancorous, disorderly and they got to the point that maybe when we were supposed to have over a thousand delegates, we had less than 20 per cent voting, and the division created by the contest itself, at least two or three candidates left the party to contest in other parties. There was no time for reconciliation. I think it is a very big relief that the party executives that conducted that primary has given way for new executives at the national level. We really need a new beginning; a new thinking from the national executives of PDP. Anambra is essentially a PDP state, but it is a very big shame that we just remain a potential force. But on the other hand, I think the perception some members of a certain party were creating before the election was the one that if it has materialized, it would have been too dangerous for our democracy; where a party that is not on ground was saying we are going to win and people believed that somehow by one magic or the other, they were going to win and that is APC, of course, and they came in with a new method, I can\u2019t call it ingenious; it is disingenuous, and undemocratic. You bought people and ask them to say they are defecting. So, for them, once big individuals defect to APC, the party becomes popular and they can now lay claim to justify their winning. I thank God that Anambra people debunked that. They made nonsense of that. So, power belongs to the people. I congratulate APGA faithful in Anambra State and the Anambra voters irrespective of the number of voters that turned out. Antecedent is very important, what you do yesterday, people will remind you of it tomorrow and the people were not that forgetful. So, I think it renewed a lot of people\u2019s faith in the power of the ballot that the ballot still counts. The vote counts and we hope that INEC will make improvement on what they have done there before 2023.\n\nYou were the Director General of Divine Mandate Campaign Organization that brought Governor David Umahi to power first in 2015 and again in 2019. People were surprised you didn\u2019t defect to the APC with him. Why did you choose to remain in PDP?\n\nWas I expected to defect with him? Yes, human being is the most unpredictable animal that you can think of. Human being is not like natural science where you can take an object to the lab to study and predict to confirm its properties or the way they behave. If you boil water to 100 degrees, you know what you will get or you mix sodium and chlorine, you know what will come out from it. Human behaviour is not predictable, but what was steady for me is the principle of PDP, I believe in PDP and I am a foundation member of PDP. I was one of the seven members that were given the flag in 1998 to come and form PDP in Ebonyi State. So, the principle of the party remains dear to me and I remain faithful to it. Well, for reason best known to him which I think he tried to explain, he decided to leave PDP. I haven\u2019t seen any reason myself and nobody was able to convince me why I should leave the party that I formed, and go for another one. The party that still holds promises and the party that the people in this state have grown to believe is their own party. PDP has not lost any election since 1998. No other party has even won even a senate seat, it is only one, two or three instances. And all the times, they claimed their victory in courts, not by outright win, like the only seat now by the APC in the state was won in the court. It could be by technical default or whatever. So, I still believe in PDP and if the constitution permits a sitting governor to defect to another party, well maybe it can be morally questioned, but if it is constitutionally permitted, people still talk about it. Maybe there is need to take a second look at the constitution because I think it is wrong for a party to give you a mandate and you move away with that mandate. If you are going, you should leave the mandate for the party. Like I said, that should be a constitutional matter that has to be looked into.\n\nUmahi said he left PDP because the party was not willing to zone its 2023 presidential ticket to the Southeast. Are you not pushing for the presidency to come to Southeast in 2023?\n\nWell, if you belong to a political party or political associations like age grades or society or club; there are rules guiding them. As an organized party, PDP has a rule. If the rule says categorically that there are rules or regulations or guidelines that say the presidency should go to Southeast at a particular period, then you hold on to it and the party can be held accountable if they fail to give the Southeast the presidency, but if otherwise, then we can only be pragmatic about it. If it requires lobbying for you to convince your party that it is proper for the party to give the ticket to your region or geopolitical zone; then you should muster every means available to you and legitimately pursue that, and when you pursue that and it fails, then you devise another strategy. Good enough there are some powerful politicians from the Southeast who have declared intention to run for the position of the presidency under PDP, so let\u2019s just watch and see.\n\nWhat is your take on the zoning of governorship of Ebonyi in 2023; some people are saying it could start from anywhere, including the South where the incumbent governor comes from since the rotation has gone round?\n\nMy advice and what I think, is that in my own party, the PDP, zoning has served us right. It has helped us to maintain orderliness in the party and it should be continued and if we are continuing the zoning system, the sequence has to be maintained. The sequence started from Ebonyi North and moved to the Central and ending up in South now. It has to start from where it started initially which is Ebonyi North, after that it goes to Ebonyi Central; that is if the party says that they are continuing with zoning. It will serve the party better if they continue with the zoning. Zoning has come to stay everywhere. Even in the instance of Anambra, the three frontline candidates all came from the South and not only from South, but the same local government. One would think that somebody from another zone will even clear one or three local governments from his own zone, but though the three candidates came from the same local government and the same zone; they came second and third. This shows that the issue of zoning has gone beyond political parties, it is now taking roots even in the mouth of the people, the electorate. I am not sure that the case of Ebonyi will be different. In 2015, somebody from the North tried to defy the zoning and ran under the Labour Party, everybody and major stakeholders of the state PDP ruled against it even those of us from the North sided with the Southerner to become governor so that the zoning system will be preserved and also the oneness of the state. That would have been the most dangerous thing that would have happened to us if a Northerner had become governor in 2015 at the expense of somebody from the South and you know one thing that happened that time that made it more audacious; the Northerner picked somebody from the central as his running mate.\n\nWill you run for the governorship of Ebonyi in 2023?\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "title": "What President Buhari must do to unite Nigeria \u2013 Gov. Makinde",
          "text": "By Agatha Emeadi\n\nOyo State governor, Seyi Makinde recently spoke with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Yoruba Service, in the aftermath of the National Convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In the interview monitored in Lagos, Governor Makinde, among other things, speaks about the cohesiveness witnessed by the party in the build-up to the convention, the need for unity within the country, declaring that the cohesion within the PDP has shown that the party can reunite Nigeria. Excerpts:\n\nWhat is your general assessment of the PDP National Convention and what do you think are the implications for the country?\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nEverything ended well. This is because since we have been holding National Conventions in the annals of the PDP, we have not had anyone with this type of positive outcome. Out of 21 vacant positions available to be occupied, 18 of them were occupied through consensus arrangement. We already knew the majority of the candidates that were to occupy the positions and stakeholders from different zones had also endorsed them. The topmost position, which is the National Chairmanship, was filled by consensus, with Dr Iyorchia Ayu, as the National Chairman. We just affirmed his candidature at the convention. You know the major problem we have in Nigeria today is disunity. There is no unity and, in fact, we have never been divided like this since I grew up to start monitoring political activities in the country. For example, if you go to the Northwest, bandits are operating. If you go to the Northeast, insurgents are there. If you try to go to the North-central, it is farmers/herders clashes. And if you come down to the Southwest, it is the same thing.\n\nBefore now, we used to think Hausa and Fulanis are of the same ethnicity, but now, we have come to understand the fact that they are not. If you go to Yobe, Zamfara and Sokoto, people are saying that Hausa people are killing the Fulani and vice versa. But at the PDP National Convention, you saw a practical demonstration that the party can unite Nigerians, as we came up with different people from different zones and that too without rancour. So, one of the implications of the successful conduct of the PDP National Convention is that the PDP can restore the hopes of Nigerians for a safe and united country.\n\nAs an opposition politician in the country, if you meet with President Muhammadu Buhari today, how best would you advise him on the situation regarding disunity and insecurity in the country?\n\nIf I have such an opportunity, I will simply tell him that if he cannot trust those from other ethnic groups in the country to serve in the government, then we can never be united in this country. You see, it is very simple. Look at the Service Chiefs we have today. Why don\u2019t we have anyone from South-Eastern zone? Is there no one in the military in that same zone that can occupy the topmost position? So, I will advise the Presidency to tone down the issue of ethnicity and seriously toe the path of unity in the country. I am saying this because if there is unity, we will experience progress in different sectors of our economy.\n\nAs governor of Oyo State, what are the three major things you have done since you assumed office?\n\nIn Oyo State, we have what we call the four service point agenda or four pillars, which our administration rests upon: these pillars are security, education, health and economic expansion through agribusiness. On education; we are operating a free education policy. I promised to ensure that our children, who have been \u2018out of school\u2019 and roaming the streets, return to their different schools. That was why we had to stop the payment of the N3,000 education levy they were paying before we came into government, because we observed some parents could not even afford the payment. As of today, over 50,000 out-of-school children are back in school. We gave them textbooks and notebooks. We organised free tutorials for those of them who were preparing for WASSCE and NECO \u2013 we recruited special teachers for them and got them paid. Today, it would not come as a surprise to our people that Oyo State is now in the 9th position as against the 29th position we occupied when we had a high number of out-of-school-children in the Southwest. Also, before we came in, I promised that our youths in Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) would no longer waste years in school before they graduate. I vowed to take sole ownership of the institution for the state so that it could run as a proper university and it was achieved. On the issue of health, we believe that our people need to be healthy in order to be productive. So, on that, we felt where significant things can be done is at the primary health care level. We have 351 Electoral Wards in Oyo State and we said one functional PHC must be in each ward. Most of them are almost at the point of completion and we are equipping them as well. What this means is that wherever you are, you can access a PHC facility within one or two kilometres. Apart from our intervention in fixing and equipping one Primary Health Centre per ward, we have also made massive investments on health care service delivery at the secondary level too. We have fixed and equipped many general hospitals, including the Adeoyo State Hospital, Ring Road, Agbami Chest Centre, Jericho and the Saki Specialist Hospital, Saki. We have equally procured 10 ambulances and put in place a solid structure that will culminate in the overall improvement of the health sector. In the area of infrastructure, before we came in, at least, I campaigned everywhere and I saw the situation of the infrastructure gap in the state. For example, the Moniya-Iseyin road; when we came in, we had to award the road and it is completed now due to our intervention. Travelling along the road before now used to be almost three hours, but now it is about 40 minutes. Today, I am happy to tell you that we have also started the construction of Oyo to Iseyin and the Saki-Ogboro-Igboho road. In Ibadan, the Ajia-Airport road with a spur to Amuloko is being done. The Apete-Awotan-Akufo road, which is the first road to be constructed with concrete in the state, is also a major intervention by our government. The big one is the Circular Road, which has been re-awarded and before the completion of this government, 70 kilometres out of the 110 kilometres will be done. Sincerely, we met a state that was deep inside the hole, but we are coming up and we want to start running. Realistically, I will give our administration 60 to 70 per cent pass mark in terms of performance, because there is room for improvement on what we are doing.\n\nBut some residents in Oke-Ogun have raised concern over the issue of insecurity around that axis of the state and are of the opinion that you have not done enough for them as expected. So, what will you say about that?\n\nFirst let me say that before we came in, there was nothing like Amotekun, it was the creation of this current government. And now, if you ask the people if they want Amotekun to be scrapped or not, I know they want it to stay. You can also experiment with that on your Facebook timeline and get the opinions of the people.\n\nThere are challenges in terms of security in Nigeria. If you compare the general situation with what we have in Oyo State, we will even be thanking God, because we are fighting it. In places where there was no coverage before, they are now being covered and we are pumping funds massively into the security sector. We have bought a lot of patrol vehicles for security agencies to ensure they perform optimally and we have noticed that there is cooperation and synergy among the security agencies. The truth is, we have never had it so good like this in the state, though we will continue to do more. It is in this same government that we asked the Inspector-General of Police to provide us a Mobile Police Squadron at Ago-Are. And now, from Ago-Are to Saki, it is a rapid response for the police officers who are there currently. We have applied for another squadron for Oyo town. So, the people know that we are doing well on the issue of security and we are not relenting. When you compare what we have here with the general situation in the country, you will agree that we are still the safest \u2013 or one of the safest \u2013 in Nigeria.\n\nPeople like Sunday Igboho and others think little or nothing is being done on the issue of security, which brought up the clamour for Yoruba Nation. What can you say?\n\nI think the best approach to take care of headache is not to cut off such head. There are better ways of addressing some matters. Our forefathers who negotiated this country sacrificed a lot of things. But some of these people who are clamouring that Nigerians should be divided, what have they sacrificed? Have they gone to battle at any war front? See, it is not just about sitting somewhere and clamouring for division when we can explore other means to achieve unity.\n\nSo, what do you think are the other means available to be explored to achieve that unity?\n\nIt is restructuring \u2013 all of us have to sit down and think of what is next. We see different things in different ways. So, we still have opportunity to all sit together and address some matters we feel are probably problematic to us. It looks as though things have fallen apart and the centre is not holding anymore. But I believe that the six years of APC so far have worsened the situation of this country. I am for restructuring and discouraging disunity, because our people will benefit a lot from a united Nigeria.\n\nSome have said you are eyeing the Aso Villa in 2023, while some are of the opinion that you want to pursue the bid for a second term as governor of Oyo State. Which one obtains?\n\nWe have to leave everything to God, because only He knows tomorrow. For now, I am still executing the assignment which the people of the state gave to me and I am not yet through with them. Let us even spend three years in Oyo State and evaluate what and what has been done. If people decide to let us continue what we are doing, it is good. It is the decision of the people that will matter on this. I want the will of God to prevail. I believe if God says yes on anything, no human being can say God\u2019s will won\u2019t be done.\n\nThere have been different talks about you not doing enough for some of your party members, who supported you to become the governor thereby making them aggrieved?\n\nWhat I want you to know is that I am also a man; I have flesh and blood and I make mistakes. Maybe there are some issues we need to address and we are trying to look at them. I know that wherever we need to make amends, we will definitely do that. I don\u2019t want to believe that I did not do well with some members of the party, but some may feel I have not done enough while some may feel I have done the best. But those who think I have not done enough could be right and I think we need to evaluate all of these. Moving on, there is room for improvement.\n\nNow that the PDP National Convention programme is over, what three significant things should the people of Oyo State expect from your government?\n\nI have always said that Oyo State has a comparative advantage in the area of agriculture. So, we are focusing more on the upgrade of our farm settlements to what we call Agribusiness Industrial Hub and we will ensure that the ongoing works are fast-tracked. Secondly, another area through which we know we can expand the economy of the state is solid minerals. We are going ahead to map out the solid minerals in Oyo State, especially lithium. The state is a lithium belt and it is the gold of the future. We want to ensure we market it to the world. I was talking to the Australian Ambassador at the agribusiness summit we just held few weeks ago and we are planning a trip to go and woo investors. Also, we will work with local investors as well on solid mineral potentials.\n\nWhat is your advice for the teeming youths who are leaving the country to seek greener pasture in foreign lands?\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates). Click Here to Apply .\n\nActually, the youths of Oyo State are the bedrock of our activities on empowerment. We are training 10,000 of them on farming technologies. Once they are done with the training we are organising for them at CSS Integrated Farms, Gora, Nasarawa, they will come back and we will empower them to launch out as entrepreneurs. So, I think we have, so far, been able to make the youths in Oyo State begin to have interest in the potential in the state and Nigeria as a whole. Meanwhile, you cannot discourage some of them from seeking greener pasture, but I can tell you that most of them will come back if the right things are being done here. They will come back better because they would have gained a lot of things \u2013 talk of insight and knowledge. But I have the belief that with the programme we are doing for the youths in our state, they are well on their way to contributing their own quota to the development of the state.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "The Osun State government has said that it has uncovered a plot by a group of political dissidents to set the state on fire and then blame it on Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.\n\nThe government said that the scheme has already come on stream with one Adelowo Adebiyi\u2019s false allegation issued earlier in the week that his life was in danger, which was followed by a staged attack on the Oranmiyan House by their own goons.\n\nThe Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Osun State, Funke Egbemode, who disclosed this in a statement said:\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\n\u201cIt is intriguing that \u2018gunmen\u2019 surfaced at that building shortly after Adebiyi and his gang asked the civil defence guards of the building to withdraw. A case of the witch howling yesterday and the child dying today. Nobody is fooled.\n\n\u201cThis statement is, therefore, a reaffirmation of the resolve of the Government of Osun State to protect the peace of the land and safeguard the lives and property of our citizens from vultures hovering over the state. It is also a warning that the government will not sit by and watch as anarchists prowl the land with their politics of violence. There is no place for lawlessness in our state.\n\n\u201cThis is imperative given the activities of a band of desperate pseudo-progressive politicians who having locked themselves out of relevance are now seeking to break heads and bones. We know it is in the character of wolves to visit violence on their environment so they can have something to eat. But Osun State is not a jungle and government will not allow anyone, no matter who they are, to turn it into a jungle.\n\n\u201cThe latest unfounded, untrue accusation by Mr Adelowo Adebiyi that the government was behind an attempt on his life is a wicked assault. We also must use this opportunity to remind Mr Adebiyi that slander is punishable according to the Nigerian constitution.\n\n\u201cIt is not the fault of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola that the political gamble that Mr Adebiyi and his cohorts took did not pay off. If he and his co-travellers chose to stray from the same family that gave them political life and brought them to prominence, they should be big enough to accept the consequences of their misadventure.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, they have blamed every other person but themselves for the embarrassing outcomes of their decisions. They have chosen to stay afloat through lies and cheap blackmail rather than accepting the several peace offers of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola to return home again.\n\n\u201cIt is in their interest to stop insulting the intelligence of Osun people by spinning incoherent stories aimed at gaining needless sympathy. It is sufficiently clear that Oyetola is a man of peace, a man without a history of violence. Osun has become more peaceful because of the peaceful disposition of Oyetola. Even Nigerians across social, political and religious divides attest to the governor\u2019s decent and gentlemanly ways. What is the antecedent of these mischief makers?

          "title": "In Double Standard, US Threatens Nigeria with Arms Embargo, While Silent on Israel",
          "text": "\u2022 100 NAF personnel as force reviews safety standards\n\n\u2022 CAN faults removal of Nigeria from religious violations list\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos, Kingsley Nwezeh and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nIn what seems to be a clear case of double standard, the United States has threatened that Nigeria risks arms embargo for alleged violations of the laws on armed conflicts in the fight against banditry, terrorism, and other forms of violence in different parts of the federation.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with CNN International released yesterday by the US Department of State, the US Secretary of State, Antony J. Blinken, threatened that his country would apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria if the allegations of rights violations were found to be credible.\n\nThe threat came just as the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) faulted the removal of Nigeria from the US 2021 list of religious violators, insisting that Christians are still being persecuted by terrorist groups and other Islamic associations in the country.\n\nAccording to reports, the United States was said to have vetoed over 50 United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions critical of Israel since 1972.\n\nDuring the last escalation of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, the US had reportedly stuck to that playbook, blocking a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\n\nSeveral resolutions condemning violence against Palestine protesters, and the illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, were also reportedly thwarted by the US.\n\nThe UN resolutions had also stated that East Jerusalem should not be considered Israeli territory, but the US recognised Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital in December 2017.\n\nIn contrast to Washington\u2019s blanket support for Israel, concerns have heightened that the US wants to tie Nigeria\u2019s hand behind her back in the face of attacks by terrorists, and bandits by threatening arms embargo against the country in the fight against insurgent groups.\n\nBut Blinken, in a surprise move, said his country would apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria.\n\nThe Leahy Laws prohibit the US Department of State and Department of Defence from providing military assistance to foreign security force units that violate human rights with impunity.\n\nBlinken said: \u201cOf course, we also have laws in place \u2013 the Leahy laws, for example. That makes sure that if there are units that have committed abuses; we are not going to provide equipment to those units.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the US would invoke the Leahy Laws against Nigeria, the secretary of state promised: \u201cWell, we look in any instance if there are credible allegations that prove out or that we believe meet the standard of the law, of course, we will apply the law.\n\n\u201cIf there is genuine transparency, accountability, and change that follows from these incidents and these abuses, I think that is very important, not only to our administration. It is also important to the US Congress in making judgments about continuing to assist the security forces,\u201d Blinken explained.\n\nThe secretary of state, however, explained the nature of military assistance the US had been giving Nigeria, noting that it was not all about the sale of military hardware alone, but also about the software.\n\nAccording to Blinken, \u201cthe military assistance itself is not just the hardware that we might provide \u2013 airplanes or helicopters. It is also the software as well as the human software\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cBecause one of the things that we are doing is making sure that as we are providing equipment to deal with profound security challenges that are faced here in Nigeria \u2013 terrorism, criminal activity, other violence, those who will be using the equipment are trained.\n\n\u201cSecurity forces must be trained in a way that makes sure that they are doing it to avoid hurting the good guys, even as they are going after the bad guys, to make sure that the laws of armed conflict are fully in mind. If they make mistakes, they are corrected and they are brought to light immediately,\u201d Blinken explained.\n\nReacting to the report on the Lekki Tollgate incident, Blinken admitted that the report of the Lekki Incident had brought transparency to what happened on the night of October 20, 2020.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think the first of all, the fact of the report, of the panel\u2019s work is usually important because it is bringing vital transparency to what happened, to the violence that took place around the #EndSARS protests and the allegations of abuses by the security forces.\n\n\u201cI have not seen the published report yet. I think it will hopefully be coming out very, very soon. But a couple of things are really important,\u201d Blinken added.\n\nHe explained that the report was important to make sure that such an incident would not happen again.\n\nHe argued that reforms \u201care necessary to build and rebuild trust between the citizens and the security services, between citizens and the state. That is an obligation of both the state government and the federal government.\u201d\n\nBlinken insisted that officers of the Nigerian Army and the Nigeria Police, who played one role or the other in the Lekki Incident should be made to account for their roles.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf there are individuals that \u2013 as it emerges from this report \u2013 who are responsible for committing abuses, there has to be accountability in terms of those individuals. That too is vital to rebuilding trust between citizens and the state and the security services.\u201d\n\nThe panel\u2019s report had recommended that all officers deployed to the tollgate should face appropriate disciplinary action. Except for Commander, 81 Division Garrison, Brig. Gen. Francis Omata, the panel demanded that all military officers involved in the operations should be stripped of their status and dismissed on the ground that they \u201care not fit and proper to serve in any public or security service of the nation.\u201d\n\nThe panel equally recommended that the Divisional Police Officer, Maroko Police Division, Mr. Raji Ganiyu, and all police officers deployed for operation between October 20 and 21, 2020 should be prosecuted for arbitrary and indiscriminate shooting and killing of the #EndSARS protesters.\n\nOn the Ethiopia-Tigray conflict, Blinken disclosed that the US \u201cis acting in close coordination with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, supporting his efforts, and other leaders on the continent including Kenyan President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta to end the conflict.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised the African-led solutions to end the Ethiopia-Tigray conflict, noting that the African Union with Obasanjo \u201cis doing exactly that. It is a very important approach and it is something that we will support.\u201d\n\nCAN Faults Removal of Nigeria from Religious Violations List\n\nIn another development, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) yesterday faulted the removal of Nigeria Nigeria from the US 2021 list of religious violators, insisting that Christians are still being persecuted by terrorist groups and other Islamic associations in the country.\n\nThe apex Christian organisation said that it was at a loss on the data or statistics used by the US government in arriving at delisting Nigeria from the list of \u2018Countries of Particular Concern\u2019 on the issue of freedom of religion.\n\nUS Secretary of State, Blinken, had in a statement on Wednesday, blacklisted Russia, China, and eight other countries as religious violators, leaving out Nigeria which was placed on the same list in 2020.\n\nSpeaking in Nigeria during a two-day official visit that ended on Friday, Blinken had disclosed that the delisting of Nigeria was based on facts.\n\nBut CAN in a statement yesterday condemned the decision, saying that Christians were still being ferociously attacked and that nothing has changed between 2020 and 2021 to warrant the removal of Nigeria from the list of religious violators.\n\nThe statement signed by CAN President, Rev Samson Ayokunle, read in part: \u201cThe US government did not contact us when they were listing Nigeria among the countries of \u2018Particular Concern\u2019 on religious freedom, neither did they seek our opinion before removing Nigeria from the list. If they had done, we would have been able to compare the statistics then and now on the issue of freedom of religion in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhatever may be the data they used, our prayer is that Nigeria would be a country where no religious group is discriminated against or persecuted and that our government would see to it that all religiously biased policies are discontinued.\n\n\u201cChristians had faced and are still facing persecution from ISWAP and the Boko Haram Islamic Group till today as before. These are the people who said their agenda was to wipe away Christianity from Nigeria and to plant Islam as the only religion from the North down to the Atlantic Ocean in the South. That agenda with the killing of Christians has not stopped till today and Nigerians are living witnesses.\n\n\u201cThe bandits have joined other militant Islamic groups to be ferociously attacking churches, killing worshippers, and kidnapping for ransom. The herdsmen are equally doing their havoc. We have lost many people and places of worship to their assault, especially in the North-central part of the country and the northeast.\n\n\u201cThough the madness has grown now and those who are not Christians are being attacked, killed, and kidnapped, this is because these criminal acts have become a lucrative business and it is whoever you can kidnap for money! If the government had responded appropriately when this criminal madness began and subdued these evil groups immediately, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are now!\u201d\n\nThe Christian association also said discrimination against Christians, especially in Northern Nigeria has not stopped.\n\n\u201cUp till today, our government is still funding the membership of Nigeria in all the International Islamic organisations like OIC and its allies without being part of any international Christian organisation.\u201d\n\nUS Trains 100 NAF Personnel as Force Reviews Safety Standards\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has stated that it would collaborate with the United States Air Force to conduct a training programme for its personnel on safety standards, disclosing the US had trained 100 of its personnel in the last six months.\n\nThe training is coming as the air force began a review of its safety standards in a bid to maintain high standards.\n\nAbout four air force planes had recently crashed in Abuja, Kaduna, and Borno within three months, recording high casualty figures and raising safety issues about the health of the air force fleet.\n\nThe air force, has, however, replenished its fleet with 12 A-29 Super Tucano fighter jets made up of six attack aircraft and six reconnaissance mission jets.\n\nThe air force said: \u201cEfforts were on to collaborate with the United States Air Force to organise an in-country safety management training for more NAF personnel before the end of the year\u201d.\n\nIt said so far 100 NAF personnel have undergone various safety courses within and outside the country in the last six months as part of measures to maintain international best practices in its operations.\n\nA statement issued by NAF said the review was predicated on the need to continually review and evaluate key safety strategies affecting its operations while ensuring the service remained a credible reference point for maintenance of high safety standards which was at the forefront of discussions at the just concluded 2021 NAF Safety Review Board (SRB) meeting.\n\nThe statement signed by NAF Spokesman, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said the meeting, which was held at the NAF Headquarters Abuja, \u201callowed the service to take stock and appraise its safety practices and procedures for enhanced operational effectiveness and efficiency\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks at the meeting, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, disclosed that as a highly technical service operating sophisticated aircraft, equipment, and military hardware, flight safety should be inherent in all NAF daily activities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Katsina recruits 500 more vigilance operatives to tackle banditry\n\nLaleye Dipo in Minna\n\nTo curb incessant banditry and kidnapping in Niger State, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello has banned the sale of motorcycles in the state.\n\nThis is coming as bandits have invaded Zagzaga community in the Munya Local Government Area of Niger State, the third within one week, and abducted 10 more villagers, bringing the total number of persons with the bandits to 83.\n\nThey have also demanded for N150million ransom by the bandits before those in captivity would be set free.\n\nThe Katsina State Government has however, recruited 500 more persons as vigilance operatives to complement efforts of other security agencies in rural communities.\n\nSecretary to the Niger State Government, Mr. Ahmed Matane, said in a statement issued in Minna yesterday that the ban on sales of motorcycle resulted from incessant security challenges in some parts of state.\n\nHe stated that the ban was also informed by the fact that bandits and kidnappers now demand motorcycles as ransom.\n\nHe explained that the ban covered the sale of \u201cany motorcycle (Bajaj, Boxer, Qiujeng, Honda ACE, Jingchen) with engine capacity from 185 Cubic Centimetres (cc) and above\u2019\u2019.\n\nMatane stated also that the measure was aimed at eradicating the activities of criminals, bandits and kidnappers who unleashed mayhem on innocent citizens.\n\nHe condemned the degree of carnage and pandemonium bandits and kidnappers caused in parts of the state and reiterated its continued determination to rid the state of security threats.\n\nMatane added that the government was aware of the inconveniences the measure would cause the people, but the decision was taken in the overall interest of the state.\n\nHe appealed to dealers in motorcycles in the state to comply with the directive.\n\nHe urged the citizens to cooperate with security agencies on the security measures being put in place to put an end to activities of criminal elements.\n\nThe secretary to the state government also stated that government had ordered security agencies in the state to ensure effective and strict compliance and enforcement of the directive.\n\nMatane reaffirmed that commercial motorcycling and operation of illegal garages remained banned in Minna and its environs.\n\nMeanwhile, bandits have invaded Zagzaga community in the Munya Local Government Area of Niger State, the third within one week, and abducted 10 more villagers, bringing the total number of persons with the bandits to 83.\n\nThey have also demanded for N150million ransom by the bandits before those in captivity will be set free.\n\nAn eyewitness told THISDAY yesterday that the bandits returned to the community in the early morning hours, riding 10 motorcycles.\n\n\u201cThey parked their motorcycles about 500 metres to our village and came on foot, and began to select those they wanted to take away\n\n\u201cThey were asking for names of some particular set of people which gave us the impression that they were working with informants,\u201d the eyewitness further said.\n\nIt was learnt that before the Saturday morning invasion the bandits had phoned to demand for the N150million ransom.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that people are now leaving Zagzaga in droves as a result of the activities of the bandits who have set up a camp at Sohon Kabula with not less than 30 motorcycles at their disposal.\n\nMeanwhile, the Katsina State Government has recruited 500 more persons as vigilance operatives to complement efforts of other security agencies in rural communities.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mustapha Inuwa, said this was part of efforts to check banditry.\n\nHe spoke while receving the interim report on the recruitment of vigilance groups, led by the Special Adviser on Security, Alhaji Ibrahim Katsina.\n\nHe said the measures were part of sustained efforts by the administration to restore peace and security.\n\n\u2018Each state in the North-west that is currently facing security challenges has been given the mandate to recruit credible vigilance members to boost their security architecture,\u2019\u2019 Inuwa said.\n\nAlso speaking, a member of the Security Committee representing Katsina Emirate Council, Kauran Katsina and district head of Rimi, Alhaji Nuhu Abdulkadir, said the Committee had lived up to its mandates and had searched diligently for trustworthy and reliable people in the communities, who had the needed qualities to be trained and work alongside security personnel for the restoration of peace in Katsina.\n\nA member of the Security Committee representing Daura Emirate Council, and also a retired Deputy Commissioner of Police, Lawal Al-Hassan said the Committee selected 13 vigilantes from each local government area of the state, who were of proven courage and integrity, with the right disposition to get the job done.\n\nWith the previous 500 persons that were recruited, the total number of vigilantes in the state is now 1,000.\n\nShare this:

The implication of your request is very serious\u2026 But the demand you made is heavy, I will consider it\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThough, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday declared that an unconditional release of the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, currently standing trial for treason, runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers, and that such a demand was quite heavy, nonetheless, he said he would consider the plea for amnesty for him.\n\nA group of Igbo elders, under the aegis of \u201cHighly Respected Igbo Greats,\u201d led by First Republic parliamentarian and minister of aviation, Mbazulike Amaechi, requested the amnesty for Kanu, during a visit to Buhari at the State House, Abuja, yesterday.\n\nWhile receiving the delegation, led by the 93 year-old statesman, Buhari said: \u201cYou\u2019ve made an extremely difficult demand on me as leader of this country. The implication of your request is very serious.\n\n\u201cIn the last six years, since I became President, nobody would say I have confronted or interfered in the work of the Judiciary. God has spared you, and given you a clear head at this age, with a very sharp memory. A lot of people half your age are confused already.

          "text": "*Wants diversity harnessed, translated to strength for a peaceful, prosperous future\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nFormer president Goodluck Jonathan has described the mismanagement of the ethnic diversity in Nigeria in particular and Africa at large as the basic problem affecting democracy and unity in the continent.\n\nThis is as the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, said the next president of Nigeria could come from anywhere, adding that what the country needed at the moment \u2018is good leadership.\u2019\n\nJonathan who spoke during the second anniversary of the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation with the theme, \u201cDemocracy and the Unity of the State\u201d, yesterday in Abuja, said \u201cOur diversity is often misconstrued to be the source of our challenges, but I feel, if properly harnessed, it will be the source of our greatness.\u201d\n\nHe explained that one good way to make progress in this regard is to strengthen government institutions to improve integration, equity, and social inclusion in the various nations.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor us, we carry the burden of promoting peace and prosperity, as aptly captured in our mission, not just in Nigeria, but in Africa and there is no better way than through consistent engagement with different stakeholders in our democratic space.\n\n\u201cSome nations are going through many challenges that have continued to pose serious threats to their unity and corporate existence.\n\n\u201cDemocracy thrives on the mutuality of trust between government and the people and among the different groups within a state.\n\n\u201cThis Dialogue: \u2018Democracy and the Unity of State\u2019 captures the essence of democracy, which drives its steam from productive civic engagements. The event of today therefore creates an open forum for brothers and sisters and friends alike to discuss our common challenges and share experience on how to surmount them.\u201d\n\nThe former president said that friends from outside Nigeria had also been invited to share the experiences of their nations and the lessons from their democratic journey in a complex and diverse setting.\n\nJonathan said, \u201cOur expectation therefore is to mobilise well-meaning citizens and leaders across board towards addressing some of the anxieties in our various nations.\n\n\u201cIn Africa we need to harness our diversities and differences and translate them to strength for a more peaceful and prosperous future.\u201d\n\nHe affirmed that the weapons of warfare in times like this should be love, justice and hope as the pursuit of these virtues will guarantee sustainable peace and unity in Africa.\n\n\u201cWhile guns, drones and other artillery may win the war, to win the peace we need to constantly engage in meaningful conversations in order to reach a compromise on issues affecting us all,\u201d he explained.\n\nIn his goodwill message, the Senate President, Lawan said the next president of Nigeria could come from any part of the country, stressing that what matters most is good leadership.\n\nWhile referring to Jonathan, he said, \u201cMy belief is that you have demonstrated very clearly that this country can be great. It can be great if the political class decides to be selfless. Most of us here don\u2019t belong to the PDP, we are here because you are a unifier.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The United States has once again warned that it may stop rendering military assistance to Nigeria if the country fails to protect human rights.\n\nAntony Blinken, the United States Secretary of State disclosed this an interview with CNN.\n\n\n\nBliken urged the Muhammadu Buhari-led government to sanction any individuals found to have violated human rights during the October 2020 #EndSARS protests when the white paper on the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and Other Matters is ready.\n\nHe added that the US might evoke the Leahy Law on military aid against Nigeria if the country failed to protect human rights.\n\nThe Leahy Law is an American rights ordinance that prohibits the US government from providing military assistance to foreign security force units that violate human rights with impunity.\n\nAsked during the CNN interview whether the US had changed its conclusion in the light of the panel\u2019s report, Blinken said he was waiting for the full report to be released by the Lagos State Government.\n\nHe, however, argued that the most important thing was ensuring that those found wanting face the full weight of the law.\n\nHe said, \u201cBut a couple of things are really important. As I said, the report itself, done by the state government, but then once it\u2019s out, for there to actually be action on the basis of the report, action as necessary by the states, action by the Federal Government, and action in the sense of two things.\n\n\u201cFirst, making sure that based on what is documented to have happened, it won\u2019t happen again \u2013 so there may be reforms that are necessary \u2013 and building or rebuilding trust between the citizens and the security services, between citizens and the state. That is an obligation of both the state government and the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cSecond is accountability. If there are individuals that as it emerges from this report who are responsible for committing abuses, there has to be accountability in terms of those individuals. That too is vital to rebuilding trust between citizens and the state and the security services.\u201d\n\nOn what the US would do if human rights abuses continued, he responded, \u201cAnd, of course, we also have laws in place \u2013 the Leahy laws, for example \u2013 that make sure that if there are units that have committed abuses, we\u2019re not going to provide equipment to those units.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the Leahy law would be imposed on Nigeria, the Secretary of State responded, \u201cWell, we look in any instance if and if there are credible allegations that prove, that we believe meet the standard of the law, yes, of course, we\u2019ll apply the law.\u201d\n\nAnd on if the US government would bow to pressure by the US Congress to impose an arms embargo on Nigeria amid incessant allegations of human rights abuse, Blinken said it would all depend on Nigeria\u2019s response.\n\nHe explained that the assistance being given to the Nigerian military was not only hardware but training to tackle terrorism and criminal activities.",

Immediately the incident happened, we started to follow up with her to find out how she was doing, especially economically and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in his compassionate nature has done this to ameliorate the family\u2019s suffering as much as possible,\u201d Oshodi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is not possible to bring back the dead, but the government is donating a two-bedroom apartment fully furnished to the family to make life easy, as much as possible, for those left behind. We believe this will help them ease into the next phase of life without stress.\n\n\u201cThis was not planned but the government had to make quick arrangements in the interim. So this is a temporary arrangement for her to stay with her children, pursuing other actions going forward. The rent has been paid for three years in advance, and the kitchen is stocked with some foodstuff.\n\n\u201cThe government will let us know when a proper and more formidable arrangement has been made for her but for now, what we have is because of the immediate need. The apartment is fitted with basic amenities to make life comfortable for the family. She would also get N1 million to start any business of her choice.\u201d\n\nOyeleke, a domestic help, thanked the state government for the kind gesture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe appealed to Sanwo-Olu to assist her with permanent employment for her to be able to take adequate care of herself and the children.\n\n\u201cI also want the government to help me find a profitable job so I can train my children properly. My children used to attend a private school but I enrolled them in a government school because I could no longer afford the fees of a private school,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis new house is rented and I would not be able to afford the rent when the three years that was paid for expires, so I would love to be employed profitably.

          "text": "Williams Abiodun, the lawyer to Ramon Adedoyin, founder of Oduduwa University and Ile-Ife Polytechnic, has claimed that staff of his client\u2019s hotel hid the corpse of Timothy Adegoke, the late student, for fear of being arrested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdedoyin is the chairman of Hilton Hotel and Resort, Ile-Ife.\n\nAdegoke, on the other hand, was a master\u2019s degree student of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) before his controversial death.\n\nThe 37-year-old was said to have travelled from Abuja to write an exam at the OAU distance learning centre in Moro, Osun on November 5.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was, however, declared missing two days later \u2014 only to be found dead.\n\nThe police had earlier arrested Adegoke as investigation into the matter continues.\n\nSpeaking with The Nation, Abiodun said the student \u201cdied naturally in his sleep\u201d on the night he lodged at the hotel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawyer also said his client had originally denied that the late student lodged in his hotel because there was no record in the company\u2019s account showing he paid to use the facility.\n\nAccording to him, the deceased paid into the personal account of Adesola Tobilola, a receptionist at the hotel, who confessed to the police that she shared the money with another staff.\n\nAbiodun said when the staff discovered that Adegoke had died, they were scared that they would be arrested and therefore whisked his corpse away from the hotel and dumped him in a neighbouring area.\n\n\u201cWhen the police arrested Adesola, they notified me that they needed to question other staff and I took five of them to the police but they were detained,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen they interrogated Adesola, she disclosed that the man (Adegoke) transferred the money into her personal account and (the money) was stolen without recoding it in the hotel\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cShe shared the money with another staff. That was why the hotel initially denied that Adegoke lodged in the hotel.\n\n\u201cLast week Saturday, the Investigating Police Officer (IPO) told me that all the arrested staff had confessed that Adegoke actually slept in the hotel but died in his sleep naturally.\n\n\u201cThe staff had shared the money that was paid by the guest and did not input it in the record.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey knew there was a problem, they took the body in the dead of the night and dumped it somewhere and returned to the hotel as if nothing happened.\n\n\u201cChief (Adedoyin) questioned them repeatedly but they all denied it until police forced them to talk.\n\n\u201cThey did not bury the body, they took the police to where the body was dumped. Where they dumped the body was on farmland on the Ife/Osogbo road. The farmers hinted at the police.\n\n\u201cOnly two staff were involved in dumping the corpse of Adegoke: the receptionist and one Kosim who is the plumber of the hotel. Kosim is this Tabligh Muslim, not a spiritualist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawyer said the body of the late student was intact when it was recovered.\n\n\u201cAdegoke\u2019s body was intact when it was recovered. He died a natural death because he was resting his head on his palm. He spread his legs tiredly,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThere was no single mark of violence on his body. The only offence these people committed was wrongful interference and dumping of the dead body.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer also dismissed claims that his client attempted to bribe the family of the deceased.\n\n\u201cAdedoyin never sent me to any of the family members of the deceased to bribe them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have never seen any member of the victim\u2019s family. Chief was not around when the incident happened. I don\u2019t know when his corpse was discovered in the hotel room, but it seems he died on Friday night or Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe IPO told me that the guy was feeling sick on the 5th of November, that was the reason why the wife was worried and called her husband on 6th repeatedly without anybody picking. The remains were probably discovered on Sunday by one of the workers.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable. All rights reserved.

          "title": "The NFT artist who captured the global lockdown with 700 portraits",
          "text": "A few streets away from Eko Atlantic City, the doors to the exhibition halls of Gallery B57 are open, revealing a black and white portrait of Instagram Influencer, Sanchan.\n\nPortrait of Instagram influencer, Sanchan\n\nLast year, during the global lockdown, Nigerian-born international visual artist, Ade Adekola, made an open call on Instagram for people who were interested in having their photographs turned into portraits. He opened a sign-up form with a commitment to do 30 portraits, but when he opened the form two hours later, the number of requests had exceeded 80. He had to close the call immediately to avoid being overwhelmed.\n\nDuring the process of creating the portraits\u2014all 80 of them\u2014he was able to improve his creative process, developing new techniques that helped him optimise the way he worked. He took the original photographs shared by interested persons, stripped them of all colours, turning them into black and white. He then turned them into engravings, before shading, cutting, and colouring them. Optimising this process, coupled with the overwhelmingly positive feedback he received from his 80 selected muses, encouraged him to create more portraits.\n\nIn the end, Adekola created 700 portraits, but there are only 40 portraits with striking designs and a collage of all 700 portraits on display at the exhibition halls of the gallery.\n\nThe allure of the 40 portraits on display, chosen by Adekola for their unique poses, circumstance or personal resonance to the subject, was elevated by presenting it in lightboxes.\n\nNow titled Lockdown Portraits, his project would go on to form a part of his exhibition titled, Dislocation &\u2026 alongside Anthology of an African Wedding and Diaspora Axis.\n\nOpening up conversations for dislocated people\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is an exhibition featuring NFT art, 3D textiles and augmented reality and events that feature creators from Tokyo, Israel and Singapore on social media and other digital collaborative platforms.\n\nThe artworks in the exhibition were conceived, executed and completed during the year-long lockdown, exploring and amplifying the effects of dislocation on humanity.\n\nIn Diaspora Axis, Adekola took a blend of various nationalities and used it to create a textile design. Ade set out to give agency to people with double or more nationalities, who were confused about their \u201ctrue identities\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, the inspiration for the anthology series, from that disability perspective, are people who had an emotional roadmap, and that roadmap was truncated. I just open up the space for you to enter and think about what may or could have happened.\u201d\n\nThe design was adopted by an Israeli company to create and display dresses. Using 3D, over 70 design patterns are shown to consumers. \u201cSo, when you buy it, they send the physical garment to you, all cut,\u201d Adekola explained.\n\nA pandemic is a form of dislocation to Adekola, who said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to explore the different kinds of dislocation forces. So, the pandemic is a kind of dislocation where people are in isolation\u2014a prolonged one.\u201d\n\nBuying African emotional entanglement\n\nA scene from Anthology of an African Wedding\n\nAnthology of an African Wedding collection explores dislocation from the angle of emotional entanglement in Yoruba wedding cultures. The Yoruba nation hails from the southwest region of Nigeria, and their wedding culture is colourful, vibrant, and in many ways, extravagant.\n\nViewable using augmented reality, Anthology of an African Wedding collection brings viewers a step closer to experiencing a Yoruba wedding with its traditional gowns, headgear and rings.\n\nAdekola has evolved his art using Photoshop for over 20 years, creating over 20,000 texture designs that he used to create Anthology of an African Wedding. Anthology of an African Wedding, which also sells as an NFT on OpenSea, consists of 18 art pieces\u20149 showing traditional wedding scenes and 9 white wedding ones.\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is on display at Gallery B57 until December 1st.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Chipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration may revolutionise Africa\u2019s creative hustle",
          "text": "Want to be a creator in Africa? Okay. But be wary; it\u2019s going to take time, thick skin, and a little bit of what we at TechCabal like to call \u201cthe creative hustle\u201d.\n\nFor years, Africa\u2019s creative industry has been hampered by poor returns, leaving creators at the mercy of sponsors and algorithm-manipulated trends.\n\nBut fintechs like Chipper Cash stand to be a driving force behind fan-sponsored content that may change the way Africans create and consume digital media.\n\nWhere the money resides\u2026\n\nTwitter has been a space for clapbacks, online discourse, and creativity since its inception. On the third most popular social media platform in Africa, the continent\u2019s Twitter users wield power so influential that Twitter began to build out its first Africa-based team in Ghana this year.\n\nWhile Twitter is an impactful platform for creators, it has not always been a lucrative one. In a world where creators are waking up to the value of their content, monetisation has become more essential than ever, and social media platforms are finally catching on.\n\nThe digital content industry is predicted to skyrocket to a value of $38.2 billion by 2030. But developing content in an increasingly competitive market requires funding and return on investment that Africa\u2019s creators are not seeing, which \u201cthe quality of work creators produce,\u201d said David I. Adeleke, Communications Lead and Managing Editor at Nestcoin, in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nSo when TikTok, a newer entry into Africa\u2019s social media space, came on the scene, it offered a monetisation plan, out of necessity. To incentivise creators to pivot from the more popular social media platforms in Africa like Facebook, it rolled out its very own Creator Fund offering payouts to TikTok-ers once that reached 100,000 authentic views on the app.\n\nStill, in a world where creators like Ryan Kaji, a 9-year-old from the US, made an estimated $29.5 from YouTube and an additional $200 million from branded toys and clothing, Africa\u2019s creatives are making far less money from their work.\n\nThe funding divide\n\nYouTubers earn money directly from YouTube for ads inserted on top of their videos. They are paid on a cost-per-thousand-views (CPM) basis, and accrue earnings when a viewer watches at least 30 seconds of a played ad, or half the ad for a shorter advertisement.\n\nOf the 10 countries with the highest CPM per video, Algeria, is the only African country on the list. Algerian YouTubers receive $24.50 CPM. And, after earnings are garnered, YouTube takes a 55% cut, further reducing take-home pay.\n\nAccording to Mike Otieno, co-founder of Wowzi, a seamless, Africa-focused, AI-driven influencer marketing platform, South Africa is the most mature market for paid creative content in Africa, with the nation\u2019s influencers earning more, on the whole, than other influencers throughout the continent.\n\nBut, even with higher than average earnings, Caspar Lee, South Africa\u2019s most watched YouTuber, earns around 10% of Kaji\u2019s YouTube earnings per year. Nigeria\u2019s highest earning YouTuber, Mark Angel Comedy, earns around 12.2% of that same figure. And Uganda\u2019s most watched creator on YouTube, musician Eddy Kenzo, earns around 1.6% of that.\n\nThe difference between creator revenues and earnings in countries like the US versus countries in Africa comes down to market size and potential, says Otieno.\n\n\u201cMarkets with many big brands making a lot of money means more allocation to advertising budgets, which trickles down to creators. Thriving markets also tend to be hyper competitive, so brands want to outdo each other.\u201d\n\nWhen bigger brands enter growing markets, they do so with a long-term outlook of the markets\u2019 growth, spreading endorsement funding out over a longer period. Brands with smaller budgets, on the other hand, tend to place conversion as a top priority and aim to get a \u201cmaximum return for their buck,\u201d remarked Otiento.\n\nBut forecasting a market\u2019s potential growth does not account for the power and value that creators add to the creative ecosystem in the present.\n\nChipper Cash, an Africa-made cross-border payments company valued at $2 billion, is working to change this by giving creators the opportunity to receive direct revenue from the audience that loves and understands the true value of their creative content.\n\nTwitter sponsors\n\nTwitter joined the creator monetisation club in May with its very own Tip Jar function. Through the Tip Jar, users are now able to send money to their favourite online voices via PayPal, Venmo, or Cash App in app integrations. But, as none of these payment aps are widely used throughout Africa, the region\u2019s Tweeters were still limited in their ability to sponsor their favourite creators.\n\nIn October, Chipper Cash announced its all-new seamless integration with Twitter\u2019s Tip Jar.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations at Chipper Cash, shared that the fintech company worked with Twitter to build out the platform\u2019s tech to create a \u201ccheap mechanism for tipping out creators\u201d.\n\nTwitter users will be able to receive payments via a QR code or direct link using their chipper.me link along with their username and an easily accessible button on mobile, using the Twitter Tips feature.\n\nThe integration will also support smaller micro transactions, with no charge for withdrawals.\n\nJalakasi believes that the app\u2019s integration with Twitter will change the \u201cfundamental misalignment of incentives\u201d by getting rid of \u201cunnecessary middlemen [such as brand sponsors] in the creative economy value chain\u201d and help \u201cexpand monetisation pathways for African creators\u201d at large.\n\nSo far, the Twitter-Chipper Cash integration is only supported for users in Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.\n\nFunding the fandom\n\nIt\u2019s clear that fans of Africa\u2019s top creatives are willing and ready to fund their faves. On Wednesday, Nigerian singer-songwriter, Davido, raised more than $338,000 via social media after posting his bank account information and asking fans and friends to send him a little bit of birthday cash.\n\n\u201cFans funding creatives\u201d has been a tried and true method in other parts of the world.\n\nChipper Cash\u2019s Twitter integration is reminiscent of similar models used on China-made live-streaming apps. Fuelled by digital payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay integrated into the social media app itself, users were able to tip their favourite creators without leaving the app. Live stream tip functions were so successful in China that the market reached an estimated $4.4 billion in revenue in 2018 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014which led to an additional surge in live stream viewing.\n\nWhat user-generated tip culture has provided in China is a robust influencer culture with a robust, local, influencer economy that spans e-commerce, gaming, entertainment, and education.\n\nChina\u2019s influencers wield so much power that, in a recent double-11 sale for Chinese e-commerce giant, Taobao, a top influencer generated $1.67 billion in sales over a 12-hour period.\n\nTikTok, born from the Chinese short video app, Douyin, has attempted to replicate this metric abroad and is now also offering gifts in the form of tips in select regions.\n\nYouTube also began offering a similar system with its Super Chat function in 2021, from which it keeps around 30% of overall earnings gained. Payment also requires linking your credit card to Google Pay.\n\nTwitter-unfriendly\n\nBut before Chipper Cash further expands throughout Africa, ideas about Twitter in certain countries will need a revamp.\n\nKenya is one of the fastest growing economies in sub-saharan Africa and a hotspot for tech innovation. In the country, Twitter is used as a vibrant space for social discourse. The unstoppable force that is Kenyans on Twitter (or KOT) has resulted in the relocation of a New York Times East Africa Bureau Chief and a rally to stop IMF loans to the country.\n\nOtieno says that moments like this make popular creators on apps like TikTok and Instagram hesitant to shift towards using Twitter.\n\n\u201cTwitter guys are seen as noisemakers in Kenya, so it\u2019s not somewhere people go to show love.\u201d\n\nHowever, Otieno believes that the integration of new app add-ons like Twitter Spaces and a clear monetisation scheme like Chipper Cash provides, creates an added benefit for creators to tweet and speak.\n\n\u201cIf you speak to TikTok and Instagram influencers, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a Twitter account. I just don\u2019t understand that space.\u2019 But Spaces gave Twitter more life. I think that influencers have started to become more receptive, and we will start to see more of a transition.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jumia records all-time high quarterly orders and unveils its fintech ambition",
          "text": "Yesterday, African e-commerce giant, Jumia, released its earnings report for the third quarter of 2021.\n\nDespite sharing healthy numbers as a result of accelerated growth across core usage KPIs\u2014including orders, annual active customers and gross merchandise volume (GMV)\u2014the markets responded differently with the stock price dropping by 20%.\n\nBefore sharing details of the report, recall that Jumia changed the functional (default) currency of its financial report from euros to dollars in Q2 2021. This will continue into the foreseeable future.\n\nHighlights from the report\n\nJumia\u2019s adjusted EBITDA and operating losses in Q3 2021 went up by 94% and 93% year-over-year, respectively, to $52.5 million and $64 million. This increase in loss was driven by a hike in the company\u2019s investment in sales & advertising and technology.\n\nSales and advertising expenses reached $24.0 million, up 228% year-over-year, while technology and content expenses increased by 27% to $9.4 million. This is a continuation of its return to aggressive advertising which slowed during the pandemic.\n\nCommenting on this result, the company\u2019s Co-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec said, \u201cWe believe that these investments are long-term in nature and that accelerating growth will ultimately contribute to profitability, leveraging the strong efficiency gains achieved throughout 2020 and the first half of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia ended the quarter with $185 million in cash and cash equivalents and $399 million in financial assets.\n\nHistoric number of quarterly orders\n\nA major highlight from the report was that orders made on Jumia reached an all-time quarterly high of 8.5 million, representing a 28% year-over-year growth. It\u2019s the fastest growth rate of the past seven quarters, according to the company. Closely related to that, Jumia\u2019s annual active consumers reached 7.3 million and its gross merchandise value (GMV) reached $238 million, both up 8% year-over-year.\n\nIn the third quarter, FMCG inventories overtook fashion inventories as the fastest-growing category in terms of items sold. The former posted the highest ever volume number, almost doubling on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThe second-fastest-growing category was food delivery, growing by almost 40% year-over-year. This category posted its highest ever quarterly volume with over 2 million orders, surpassing the previous record registered in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nJumia noted that it saw growth momentum across all inventory categories, except phones & electronics. The company attributes this slowdown to a global supply disruption, including global chipset shortages.\n\nJumiaPay and its fintech ambition\n\nIn the second quarter, JumiaPay\u2014Jumia\u2019s financial and digital services\u2014posted its largest-ever quarterly GMV processed. The company followed by disclosing in its third-quarter report that JumiaPay processed 36% of all orders on Jumia, a significant feat considering that it competes with numerous payment options. Riding on that wave, JumiaPay has continued to grow as the company expands the range of services available to consumers on JumiaPay App.\n\nIn Nigeria for example, customers are now able to book bus tickets via the JumiaPay App, including a proprietary seat mapping selection that will be rolled out in other markets in the near future. In Egypt, JumiaPay added new consumers, including several universities which students can now pay their tuition fees online via the JumiaPay app as well as a major Arabic content streaming platform, Shahid.\n\nOptimistic about its fintech ambitions for JumiaPay, the company shared a picture of its roadmap. In the near future, it plans to launch payment cards, savings, insurance and \u2018buy now pay later\u2019 offerings to consumers of JumiaPay. For merchants, it\u2019s looking to roll out point of sale, QR Codes, consumer financing, and other offerings.\n\nSource: Jumia\n\nLogistics services\n\nFor its logistics service to third parties, Jumia reached a major milestone by recording $1 million revenue from this service. It delivered 2.9 million packages on behalf of 766 clients, this was a 123% increase on the 1.3 million packages that were delivered in Q2 2021.\n\nThe company also mentioned that it took part in impact initiatives such as Giga, a global initiative to connect every school in Africa to the Internet and every young person to information, opportunity and choice. It also partnered with Solar Taxi, a modern eco-friendly mobility company, to provide an affordable and eco-friendly delivery solution in Ghana.\n\nThe increase in losses incurred by Jumia in the third quarter wasn\u2019t good news to some investors but the company sees it as a necessary path to achieving its goal of profitability and scale.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Immediately you launch your career as an artiste and record some success, you\u2019re like a business operating and generating revenue with customers in over 70 countries. At this point, you have become a global business.\u201d Oluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi)\n\nCelebrities are humans first, you know? In the grand scheme of things, they are only individuals striving to live their best lives, showcasing their creativity while making money, and spreading as much love as possible, some of the things that made them famous in the first place.\n\nTo an average LinkedIn user, Ajibade Oluwatosin (his profile name as of the time I reached out) is just a \u201cGlobal superstar and VC.\u201d A cursory glance won\u2019t reveal that he\u2019s the popular Mr Eazi.\n\nI only figured it out a few weeks ago when one of my contacts liked one of his posts. I wasted no time sending a connection request, which he accepted rather quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with this new connection,\u201d I asked myself.\n\nI remembered that Mr Eazi\u2019s emPawa Africa, a talent incubator, was instrumental in placing Joeboy in the limelight. That was when I concluded he would be a good fit for the Techpoint Africa Experts series. I sent him a message, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Eazi. Source: Instagram\n\nMr Eazi had just returned from an engagement on the evening we\u2019d scheduled our talk and needed a moment to catch his breath, which he did in record time.\n\nShortly after, we exchanged pleasantries, and the stage was set for a somewhat friendly conversation; his mood, best described as calm.\n\nSeeing Mr Eazi very relaxed was quite the revelation because his demeanour was not too different from his public appearances and videos. I guess I expected a contrasting personality, as is often the case with artistes.\n\nI got the thoughts of one of his fans while writing this.\n\n\u201cI think Mr Eazi is a laid back musician. He\u2019s very African and indigenous and relates a lot with his roots.\u201d\n\nOluwatosin said it was easy to build a persona around the name Mr Eazi, which was the nickname his friends in university gave him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the nickname is just an expression of who I am. I like to live calmly,\u201d he shared.\n\nAnd this calm personality seems to be reflected in every part of his life. Expectedly, though, he takes on a new life when he has to match his fans\u2019 energy and excitement at shows and events.\n\nSince gaining popularity, Mr Eazi\u2019s reputation has grown in leaps and bounds, preceding him even beyond the music scene.\n\nThere was a funny moment. as we spoke. when he revealed his spontaneity and unpredictability. What do you think about Don Eazi as president of any nation or Pastor Eazi?\n\nThirty-year-old Oluwatosin lived his early years in Sango Otta, Ogun State. The Nigeria-born musician later relocated to Ghana for his undergraduate studies before starting his music career in London.\n\nGiven his ardent local and global following, Mr Eazi\u2019s name and content mostly scream \u2018Afrobeats to the world!\u2019 since he came into the music industry a few years back.\n\nHe believes Africa is experiencing its best years in the global music industry, with many of its music genres being embraced globally.\n\nMotivation and obsession\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwatosin Ajibade (Mr Eazi). Source: Supplied\n\nA look at the mark the young artiste has made in a short time shows that he is clearly motivated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who is fascinated with seeing ideas come to life. There\u2019s some form of joy that comes from conceiving an idea and seeing it come to life.\u201d\n\nStrangely, in an industry where one can make tons of money, his excitement mostly comes from creating music in the studio; the monetary value of the music produced is secondary in his books.\n\nAs with most success stories, there\u2019s some history. Oluwatosin\u2019s career track hasn\u2019t always been straightforward. A mechanical engineering graduate, Oluwatosin traded FMCGs and gold before deciding to stick to music.\n\n\n\nThe rest of this article will be made public on November 23, by noon (WAT)..

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSomething good is a frontier; something better is also a frontier and something excellent is just another frontier! You can always go beyond these frontiers! And so what is excellent? Just a frontier!\u201d \u2014 Mehmet Murat ildan\n\n\u201cThere exist limitless opportunities in every industry. Where there is an open mind, there will always be a frontier.\u201d \u2014 Charles Kettering\n\nWhen I think about the word \u2018frontier\u2019, what comes to mind is the American Wild West. Why? My first idea of what that word means came from a book romanticising the life of one of America\u2019s founding fathers, Benjamin Franklin. For the life of me, I can\u2019t remember the title, and Google Search is not helping.\n\nBut back to the word frontier. While there are several meanings of the word, for our purposes, we would be adopting this definition by the Merriam Webster Dictionary: \u201ca new field for exploitative or developmental activity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy all the talk about frontiers? We\u2019ll get into that at the end of this article, but for now, let\u2019s take a look at some numbers.\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the now\n\nAccording to Briter Bridges, as of Q1 2020, there were 210 edtech startups in Africa. The African e-learning space is many times described as nascent. A bit surprising, as it is not a novel industry on the continent.\n\nThe African Virtual University, created by the World Bank in 1997 and established by a charter signed by eighteen African member states, is Africa\u2019s first Internet-based school. It also has a physical building in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi.\n\nNigeria also has a distance learning university, the National Open University of Nigeria, founded in 2002 and the first of its kind in West Africa.\n\nHowever, only just recently has the edtech space begun to pick up steam.\n\nAccording to Boye Oshinaga, Gradely CEO, \u201cThe edtech industry is at its infrastructure-building phase in Nigeria and Africa, where those players that invest in the rails will get a big payoff in the coming years.\u201d\n\nWhy the infrastructure-building phase? Because a lot of what would power the industry is just as nascent as the edtech space.\n\nMost of the time, accessibility to these edtech startups requires an Internet connection, or at the very least, a smartphone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Internet World Stats, Internet penetration in Africa as of Q1 2020 stood at 39.3%, much lower than the world average of 58.8%.\n\nThe Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), however, predicts that 65% of sub-Saharan Africa will have a smartphone by 2025, a number which stood at 50% as of 2020.\n\nEdtech startups vary across different sectors: massive open online courses (MOOCs), extended reality learning content, gamified learning, examination preparation, and subject-based instructional content, among others.\n\nEyitayo Ogunmola, Utiva CEO, classifies them into edtech and teched. He says the former has more to do with \u201cdeploying tech solutions to creating learning experiences.\u201d The latter, on the other hand, \u201cis majorly around incubating and accelerating talent.\u201d\n\nBut he also introduces some unlikely sectors, like jobtech, HR tech, and workforce development tech.\n\n\u201cPeople also think Jobberman and all the hiring platforms are also education technology because many of them are now deploying learning as a subset of the value.\n\n\u201cSo the education technology industry, in Africa, by extension, is a combination of the three different categories that I\u2019ve mentioned: the edtech as a product, the teched as a service, and also the other value creation products and services that are also supercharging the learning side of things.\u201d\n\nThe edtech industry in Africa: the future\n\nSo, what happens next?\n\nEvolving business models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgunmola is very confident that these sectors will never merge because \u201cthey offer different kinds of value.\u201d So while he doesn\u2019t see them merging, he believes the industry is headed the way of a harmonious divergence.\n\nInterestingly, he believes that in the future, edtech will focus more on its adaptability and new learning models than technology. Comparing fintechs and edtechs, he says the latter would be a combination of APIs and new learning models, unlike the former, which appears to be largely API-driven.\n\n\u201cI see many companies are adopting new technologies, but I also see many companies adopting new approaches; it\u2019s going to be a combination. For example, in the future, it\u2019s going to be a combination of self-paced learning, instructor learning models, gamification to incentivise learning and completion rates, and micro franchising.\n\n\u201cThere are other things like VR and augmented reality. Facebook is exploring the metaverse, right? It will be about those things.\u201d\n\nOshinaga agrees.\n\n\u201cAll disruptive technologies and the behaviour to make them widely acceptable over the next ten years already exist in some form. They will just be utilised further to deliver clearer advantages over current systems and eventually win.\u201d\n\nHe, however, says, \u201cThe future of the industry is AI-driven and personalised, and will have education delivered in more animated, interactive, and immersive content formats. Methodologies such as Use of Technology in the Classroom and other widespread methodologies will be empirically tested to prove their relevance.\u201d\n\nHe also believes homeschooling would increase, citing examples of the US and the UK.\n\n\u201cIn the future, parents will take charge of their children\u2019s learning and be more proactive in what skills they try to imbibe in the child or what exposure they are looking to add to enrich their children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nThe increase in homeschooling occurred during the pandemic, but Africa\u2019s story is split in the middle. Some countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ghana, and Zimbabwe \u2014 do not have any laws recognising homeschooling. However, in some, like Kenya, it appears to be illegal. In contrast, others like Zambia, Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana have legalised homeschooling.\n\nIn fact, in Botswana, you are not mandated to send your child to school.\n\nWhile homeschooling data is not available in most African countries \u2014 a challenge we\u2019ll come to in a bit \u2014 South Africa, where homeschooling has been legal for several years, showed a spike in the heat of the pandemic.\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree on is the emergence and importance of more data in the next frontier of the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cAs you deploy technology into the learning space, leaders would have to focus aggressively on the data that has been generated and use that data to improve the technology because this is the intersection of human behaviour and technology,\u201d Ogunmola says.\n\nHe further submits that how this data is utilised to help improve learning for the user is far more important than collecting data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about, \u2018I have 50 projects on this platform; go and work on them.\u2019 It\u2019s about whether the platform can provide you with feedback during learning to improve your capacity. Because ultimately, this is education \u2014 improving your capacity.\u201d\n\nBut, Africa\u2019s data collection and retention structures are pretty underdeveloped. Look no further than identity verification and collection processes in several African countries and how long it has taken to get to this stage.\n\nOshinaga laments the lack of data, especially in the use of government funds without any thought to \u2018Who needs it more?\u2019 or \u2018Is this school performing well enough to warrant this funding, or should it be shut down and focus shifted to other schools?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo he says, \u201cWe will have more data on the performance of teachers and schools at a more global level so it\u2019s clear what donors, governments, investors, and companies can do about it.\u201d\n\nAs we said in an earlier article, for greater efficacy, the government would do better to support players looking to aid universities in providing learning for students.\n\nPutting it succinctly, Ogunmola says, \u201cUniversities would never be edtechs.\u201d\n\nTying it back to data collation, he says, \u201cImagine all universities have the data of all their students. Name, email, and mobile number, not some email they submitted ten years ago that is no longer updated. If they have this updated, they can share that data with us in the form of an API, and we can continue to improve the alumni. That\u2019s how we build a much-improved ecosystem of talent; it\u2019s not by this disintegrated and disaggregated form of engagement.\u201d\n\nAccessibility/Affordability\n\nIn 2020, as the coronavirus swept cities and students remained at home for an extended period, many K-12 schools and universities moved online. This marked a turning point for edtech use as startups like uLesson saw a rise in users and consequently accelerated expansion plans.\n\nBut for most users, especially those in the low and middle-income bracket, some of these services were out of reach due to Internet and smartphone availability. To help with this, some countries turned to tried-and-true radio programmes as an avenue to improve accessibility and affordability.\n\nAccording to Yomi Ojo, Founder of SchoolsCompass, the divide between the haves and have nots is a huge challenge for the edtech industry.\n\n\u201cA lot of these technologies are being built for the privileged, but it further widens the educational gap between them and the less-privileged. School owners and edtech products are overlooking these things; it\u2019s a time bomb.\u201d\n\nBut as Ojo himself says, edtech startups are not non-profit organisations. He believes that the government should do more to provide better Internet services and partner with these companies.\n\nA position Ogunmola and Oshinaga agree with to varying degrees. While both believe public-private partnerships would help in the future, Ogunmola thinks we will see more Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) models or loans.\n\nAccording to Ogunmola, Utiva is one of many companies already implementing these ideas. TalentQL is another one doing so via its AltSchool Africa product.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I take a loan for learning if I can guarantee that it\u2019s going to get me a job?\u201d Ogunmola asks.\n\nFunding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of August 2021, Africa\u2019s edtech industry has attracted $20 million in funding since 2019. This is not a lot of money, especially compared to investments in edtech on a global scale, which reached $18.6 billion in 2019 alone.\n\nBut Oshinaga believes we would see better investment rounds in the future. \u201cWe already have a Series A of over $5m and seed of $2-4m.

Emmanuel Paul has that answer and more here: Led by ex-OPay exec, Kredi Money wants to be the one-stop-shop for payments, loans, insurance, other financial services.\n\nOzow\u2019s $48m Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Pays, CEO and Co-Founder of Ozow\n\nSouth African fintech startup, Ozow has closed a $48 million Series B to ease online payments for South Africans.\n\nPer TechCrunch, The funding was led by Tencent, a Chinese Internet-based company. Other investors, Endeavor Catalyst and Endeavor Harvest Fund, also participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Ozow do? The startup makes it possible to pay online with bank transfers or manual Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) without using your bank app.\n\nHow? It\u2019s called automated EFT; it works just like a payment gateway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen making an online payment, customers choose Ozow as a payment option, select a bank, log in with online banking details, and Ozow automates the payment.\n\nMerchants, on the other hand, only need an account number and smartphone to receive payments.\n\nOzow\u2019s CEO, Thomas Pays, says he started the company in 2014 to create a \u201ccentral platform that could basically provide solutions to eCommerce, point of sale, e-billing and peer to peer payment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with TechCrunch, Pays says, seven years ago, digital payment was very fragmented,\n\n\u201cif I want a point of sale device, I need to go to a company like Yoco. If I want to accept payments via card on my eCommerce site, I need to go to a PayU.\u201d\n\nOzow plans to use the funding to expand its team from 100 to 250. A part of it will also be geared towards expansion into Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria.\n\nGetting blockchain skills with Bitmama\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nAccording to Statista, the blockchain technology market is currently valued at $6.92 billion. That value is expected to reach $162.84 billion by 2027. This means that as the market grows, the demand for blockchain talent will also increase.\n\nIn light of this, African crypto exchange, Bitmama, is launching Bitmama Credits Programme to support young people globally with the skills needed to get a career in the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nThe programme will begin in the first quarter of next year, offering blockchain learning materials and internships.\n\nThe big picture: With the advent of several blockchain innovations such as Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralised finance (DeFi) and Web3, the demand for blockchain talent is climbing.\n\nIn 2019, the demand for blockchain jobs increased by 300% from the previous year.\n\nInterestingly, high demand also means huge salaries. The average salary for a blockchain developer is between $150,000 and $175,000; that\u2019s approximately $15,000 to $40,000 higher than the standard salary for software engineers.\n\nWhy\u2019s there so much demand?: According to 101 Blockchains, the need for blockchain talent is fueled by the advantages of blockchain, such as security, transparency, and traceability.\n\nWith more innovations coming out of the space, the demand for blockchain talent is bound to increase.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching\n\nGoogle\u2019s Next $1 Trillion Opportunity.

          "title": "Debate over direct primaries puts Nigeria\u2019s politicians, parties in quandary",
          "text": "The recent passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 by Nigeria\u2019s National Assembly inserting direct primaries as the legal mode for political parties to pick their candidates for general elections is currently dominating discourse in the polity.\n\nWhile direct primaries involve the participation of all party members in the selection of party candidates, the indirect primaries involve the use of delegates who are usually leaders and members of the executives at the ward, local government and state levels, to elect the party\u2019s candidates at a congress or convention.\n\nUnlike indirect primary, which is organised in a particular selected venue, and is often restricted to only delegates, the direct primaries take place at ward levels.\n\nAcross Nigeria there have been diverse views about the issue, while some have kicked against it, others have supported NASS decision.\n\nSome stakeholders have argued that NASS should allow political parties to pick the option best suited for them. Similarly, others have pointed out that direct primaries was only out to restore sanity, give the party back to the people, rather than the current practise where the nomination of candidates for election has been hijacked by few party leaders.\n\nRead Also: Why direct primaries may be difficult to operate in current electoral system \u2013 Sentonji\n\nThe practice now is that the indirect primaries has enabled a few political power brokers to hijack party platforms, at the expense of the majority, by only allowing some carefully selected party delegates to elect candidates.\n\nAmong the opponents of the idea of a direct primary is the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) who are in favour of an indirect primary being operated presently.\n\nSince their spirited attempts to scuttle the lawmakers\u2019 effort did not scale through, observers say that their next move perhaps, is to lobby President Muhammadu Buhari not to sign the bill into law.\n\nSpeaking recently on why he pushed for direct primaries when hosting a group of youths, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, noted that it would bring more accountability and adequate representation as political office holders would not be restricted to pleasing a group of people selected as delegates, but work for the interest of the generality of party members, and by extension, the electorate.\n\nGbajabiamila stressed that some members of the political class might not be comfortable with the arrangement, but added that the majority of the masses were in support of direct primaries, which he said would give them the opportunity of deciding who would represent them.\n\n\u201cIf I know that my return will depend on a few men, I may care about you. But if I know that my return will depend on my accountability and representation to the people, I will do the right thing. It is important for this generation to open the door of leadership to the next generation. We must allow every Nigerian to participate fully in the process of leadership. I, therefore, stand with Direct Primary.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I said at different fora that I\u2019m for direct primaries. We have to do this for the sake of the institution. When you gather yourselves (as youths), chances are that you\u2019ll win. Democracy is a government of the people. Democracy is not just a general election. It starts from the primaries.\u201d\n\nBut Gbajabiamila\u2019s position did not go down well with the Kebbi State Governor and Chairman of the PGF, Atiku Abubakar Bagudu, who faulted the National Assembly\u2019s insertion of direct primary into the law, maintaining that political parties should be allowed to pick the option best suited for them.\n\nBagudu stressed that the resolution was against the spirit of Executive Order signed by President Buhari, which frowns at large gathering in the wake of the global pandemic, adding that cumbersome, unwieldy and would overstretch the limited resources of INEC, statutorily mandated to oversee primaries conducted by political parties.\n\n\u201cWe have discussed the pros and cons. There has been concern that political parties are voluntary organisations. We express the concern that political parties be allowed to choose from the options that they so desire. There is an Executive Order, signed by President Buhari against large gatherings. These are issues we discussed and hope that the best will be achieved for Nigeria,\u201d Bagudu said.\n\nAmid the uproar, the federal lawmakers are insisting that the move was necessary to safeguard the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nSpokesman of the House of Representatives, Benjamin Kalu said recently that both chambers adopted direct primaries because it far outweighs the indirect primaries, which he noted was not in consonant with the tenets of democracy.\n\nMeanwhile, while the furore generated by the issue of direct primary is tearing the APC apart, it is not clear what the positions of the PDP Governors are on the issue.\n\nJust when the bill was passed the PDP responded through its Spokesman, and condemned the NASS decision, saying that no party has the right to impose its will on another on the method to adopt for primaries election.\n\n\u201cIt is the inalienable right of each political party, within the context of our constitutional democracy, to decide its form of internal democratic practices, including the processes of nominating its candidates for elections at any level.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also believes that no political party should force its own processes on any other political party as the direct primaries amendment, a practice of the APC, sought to achieve,\u201d the PDP had said.\n\nBut reports say that the PDP Governors appear relatively unbothered on the issue, especially since they are in control after the recent national convention in which the entire party structure at the national level is in their firm grip. Furthermore, it appears that the PDP Governors are confident that whether it\u2019s direct or indirect primary, they are fully in charge for the time being.\n\nHowever, pundits say that though direct primaries might not solve the developmental challenges facing the country and its electoral system, it would eliminate the \u2018highest bidder\u2019 syndrome existing in most political parties in Nigeria and go a long way in reducing the emergence of fraudulent and questionable individuals as candidates.\n\nSimilar view was shared by Political Analyst, Kunle Okunade who noted that direct primaries system would give back the parties and candidates to the members of the political parties which would indirectly deepens internal democracy and reduces candidates\u2019 imposition by the few stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWith this candidates with legitimacy would emerge and this will strengthen the country\u2019s electoral process. My fear is whether the party leaders would follow the due process in the practice of direct system because based on observations of how it was practiced in 2019 in Lagos APC, the process was allegedly fraudulent and shambles,\u201d Okuade said.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with BusinessDay, Chekwas Okorie, popular politician and founding member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) applauded the decision of the federal lawmakers, saying that it would deepen democracy, give the party back to the person which was long overdue.\n\n\u201cI have always supported direct primaries; I have been an advocate of it for years, because it guarantees inclusiveness in selecting a leader from the councillor to the president in political parties. Every party member participates and selects the leader that they want.\n\n\u201cThe practice now is bad; the delegates are often handpicked by the governors, these delegates would go on to carry out the order of the governors.\n\n\u201cBut in indirect primaries somebody who is not popular but can deliver can go on and win. Party members have a right to choose their leaders and they would not disappoint, if they do they don\u2019t vote for such a person again.\n\nThe party\u2019s constitution is clear on the right of party members, which is to vote and be voted for, but with the situation now their rights are being curtailed.\n\nEqually, speaking in similar vein, Kayode Kehinde political analyst, said that direct primaries adopted by federal lawmakers was in recognition of the agitations against the ills of favoritism and god-fatherism within the Nigerian political system, adding that since they represent the people their position should be respected.\n\n\u201cGoing by the most discussed key position on the adoption of the direct primaries election by NASS as a question of whether NASS or any other structure should propose or impose on political parties on what model to adopt in the process of choosing their party representatives for elections, a valid perceptive to this is that NASS is a body that acts as a representation of the people and by necessity, it should discuss issues in the interest of the people.\n\n\u201cWe know the injustice in the current system, hence, if it is considered, the indirect electoral process in party Primaries is not a platform in expressing the peoples\u2019 decision with political representatives, so it should be!\u201d\n\nFurthermore, among the concerns by stakeholders is that direct primaries would place an extra additional logistics burden on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to monitor direct primaries involving the 18 registered parties. Questions have been asked if the commission has the capability to cope with such an enormous task.\n\nThere are those that are concerned that the enormous resources required for such may put extra financial burden on the country.\n\nSuch is the view of Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, who said he would not support the idea of direct primary elections for political parties because it will cause more problems than envisaged, while more money would be needed.\n\nHe said that INEC lacked the required personnel to monitor the conduct of direct primaries by political parties.\n\n\u201cThe electoral law should allow political parties to adopt any of the processes suitable for them in conducting their primaries. The adoption of direct party primaries will only give the governors more power to do whatever they want,\u201d Ortom said.\n\nFestus Okoye, INEC, National Commissioner and Chairman, Information & Voter Education Committee said monitoring direct primaries comes with greater financial and security implications, adding that INEC would require about 17,618 officials to supervise direct primaries involving APC and PDP alone in one day.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf a political party decides to organise its primary at the local government level, it means that the Commission must deploy monitors to the 774 local government areas of the country.\n\n\u201cThe monitoring of direct primaries has financial and national security implications. The ad-hoc staff must be harvested from ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) or the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) or the universities or other sources as may be determined by the commission and supervised by a certain category of our staff.\u201d",

          "text": "Francis Herbert, a father of five, whose two children are in two different Nigerian universities, is a sad man today.\n\nHerbert is in pain today because the children, who were supposed to have either rounded off their programmes or at the tail end of their studies, are caught in the web of endless imbroglio between the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nAccording to him, each of the children has lost two academic years.\n\n\u201cI am pained that while my children have lost two academic years, their friends who are in private universities have gone ahead of them. One of my children who got admission in 2019 has just finished year-one, whereas her friends in private universities are now at 300-level. The other one who was supposed to have graduated last year has not even started her project. It is painful that the disagreement between ASUU and the Federal Government is now negatively impacting on my family; holding down the progress of my innocent children,\u201d Herbert said.\n\n\u201cMust everybody go to private university? It is high time ASUU changed strategy. While I am not carpeting them for insisting that government should live up to expectation in funding the university education, at the same time, I want to advise that ASUU must, looking at the negative implications of their incessant strikes, come up with other strategies to engage with the government,\u201d he further said.\n\nWith the rumour of an impending fresh strike, he said that he and his children are now apprehensive and just wishing that it does not materialise.\n\nHerbert is just one out of several other parents who are sad today at what the university system is doing to their children.\n\nRead Also: ASUU strikes halt student housing growth\n\nWhile on a visit to Slot, a popular phone dealer at Computer Village Ikeja in Lagos, to trade-in his two old Tecno phones, a baker was surprised to see his neighbour\u2019s son, who was supposed to be in school.\n\nBut the undergraduate was not shy at meeting him because he is now \u2018hustling\u2019 among hundreds of other undergraduates who are now out of school because of the inability of the parents and sponsors to pay their tuition fees.\n\nThe undergraduate-turned hustler is a product of the nine-month strike by ASUU.\n\nFrom March 2020, which was the peak of Covid-19 and lockdowns and until November 20, 2020, Nigerian university undergraduates were at home idle due to the industrial action, which led to over 2000 students dropping out of school for the inability of their parents and sponsors to pay their tuition fees, as well as getting involved in family businesses or running their own outfits.\n\nSadly, ASUU is about beating the drum again despite the high rate of university dropout in recent time, and Nigeria having the highest rate of out-of-school in Africa with about 10.5 million children aged 5-14 years, according to UNICEF data.\n\nMany concerned citizens are beginning to raise the alarm over the implication of another ASUU strike, especially on the students and the future of the country.\n\nLooking at the sad experience of the nine-month strike last year, most observers decried that the crime rate increased during the strike as many idle hands were engaged negatively and some undergraduates died while committing crime.\n\nDonald Mmecha, a banker with StanbicIBTC, lamented that his children have not recovered from the forced long holiday during the nine-month ASUU strike last year and the only option left for him to guarantee their academic success is to move them to foreign schools, which are very expensive now with the staggering exchange rate.\n\nConsidering thousands of undergraduates whose parents cannot afford tuition fees in foreign universities, Mmecha warned that the country will be sitting on a cake of gun powder if these indigent undergraduates finally drop out of school due to incessant strike and lack of sponsors.\n\n\u201cDuring the strike, my house became a workshop for my engineering undergraduate son and studio for my Theatre Art undergraduate daughter. But my eldest son, a final year law student, was devastated because the online class did not work for his practical courses. We cannot afford another strike; families are suffering, and many are poorer now,\u201d he said.\n\nMargaret Esoh, a mother of two undergraduates and a consultant physician, had to move her two daughters to a United Kingdom university in February this year because she feared another ASUU strike considering the inflation, ensuing hardship and the kind of people running the country now.\n\n\u201cIt was very expensive sending them to a UK university. I sold some shares, but the pain is worth it because they are doing well over there despite being stepped down by a year. My concern is securing their future, which the Nigerian education system cannot guarantee,\u201d the doctor said.\n\nShe decried that the incessant strike is impacting negatively on the rating and quality of graduates from Nigerian universities.\n\nBusola Ekehinde, a business woman, regrets that people in her class cannot afford foreign universities, and their inability is forcing their children to suffer in the supremacy battle between ASUU and the Federal Government.\n\nHer fear is that when university strikes, the students are vulnerable and evil people take advantage of them.\n\n\u201cMama Ineh, our fellow trader, lost one of her sons who joined an oil bunkering gang in Yanegoa. The son was in a university in Port Harcourt and joined the gang instead of returning during last year\u2019s strike,\u201d the trader said, nothing further that she had to force her son to run her business during the strike in order to safeguard him.\n\nThe undergraduates are also angry on hearing news of another strike.\n\nAduke Ogunmade, a University of Lagos undergraduate urged the government to meet the demands of the lecturers as students cannot survive another shutting down of campuses after the nine-month long 2020 strike that impacted negatively on students, education standard and rating of Nigerian universities.\n\nEmeka Ibenegbu, a student of Abia State University Uturu, noted that crime rate would surely soar in the face of current hardship if the strike commences as many students will not continue to stay idle, but engage their hands positively or negatively.\n\n\u201cI know some of my mates who did not return to school because their sponsors are either dead or lost their jobs. What do you want that fellow to do and some who the strike will force to be idle may connect with the bad eggs out there and the society is heated up in crime,\u201d Emeka decried.\n\nIbiso Amaye, a University of Calabar undergraduate, who lost her classmate to human traffickers in Malaysia last year, lamented that the brilliant student was lured with the promise of goodlife and the ASUU strike of last year created an opportunity for him to leave.\n\n\u201cEven the parents thought he was still hanging with his friends in Calabar as he would usually do, not knowing that he died in Malaysia in the hands of traffickers who sold him out. If not for the strike, he would not have travelled,\u201d Amaye said.\n\nHowever, across the country, university lecturers do not see reasons they should not embark on the proposed strike, considering the government\u2019s persistence in failing its promises to them.\n\nAnele Oguezi, an associate professor at Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ebonyi State, said university lecturers\u2019 welfare should not be debated if the country wants to secure its future because the universities are breeding grounds for result-oriented researches, innovations and skills needed in technology, leadership, corporate world, economy, and all endeavours.\n\n\u201cWhy treat lecturers so badly, how much are we asking for that the Federal Government cannot offer? If you consider the salaries and allowances of our senators and governors, you will shut down universities forever. Government should abide by the agreements with ASUU to avert the strike, and that is the only way,\u201d he said.\n\nOnyedi Ifeatu, a senior lecturer at Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, is concerned about the welfare of students, but noted that if the teacher is not happy, the student will learn nothing.\n\n\u201cI am a parent too, I need money to pay my children\u2019s tuition fees, but it is not coming the way I expect it to and I am not supposed to take advantage of my students. If an average professor in a Nigerian university earns barely N400, 000 a month, then how much do you think others in lower cadre earn. The welfare is poor and should be addressed for us to teach with our mind\u201d, Ifeatu said.\n\nIfeatu assured that the strike is likely going to hold because the Federal Government has always been promising, and reaching agreements with ASUU but not fulfilling the promises.\n\n\u201cYes, there seems to be a truce between ASUU and the federal government, but if the government has been fulfilling its part of the agreements, there will never be a case of strike in Nigeria and our demand is little compared with what politicians earn. Why will the government take politicians more seriously than lecturers whose impacts are felt across the society,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Emmanuel Osodeke, a professor and ASUU president, noted that ASUU will not be deceived again and if the government did not meet the agreement it reached with the union that made it to call off the 2020 strike, the union will commence with the strike as planned.\n\nHe also cleared the air, saying that the union has not shelved the strike because of the government\u2019s usual promise of settling the matter, but that the union will meet after three weeks to make a decision on the next move should the government fail again.\n\nNigerians wait and pray that before three weeks the issue will be resolved as many students may not survive another, considering the many that dropped out already due to hardship.\n\nThe other day, Adamu Adamu, minister of Education, said that Nigerian universities were producing unemployable youths.\n\nAccording to him, the country\u2019s education system, over the years, produced graduates with no generic and essential skills needed for global opportunities and responsibilities.\n\nIt blamed the curricula used in teaching in schools, particularly at tertiary institutions, and students\u2019 poor interest in marketable skills and other requirements of the workplace as largely responsible for the crisis.\n\n\u201cNigeria is still faced with the challenges of skills gaps, especially in the area of technical and vocational fields which need to be addressed adequately. These challenges did not come overnight, but as a result of long time neglect and poor management,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics say that since government is aware of the precarious state of education in the country, it should then be doing everything possible to shore up capacity in the sector by way of adequate funding.\n\nSpeaking on Channels Television interview programme recently, Dele Ashiru, chairman, ASUU, University of Lagos chapter, said the Federal Government cannot in good conscience say it does not have the resources to fund tertiary education in the country, considering the money government spends on mundane things.\n\nHe also carpeted state governors who continue to plant new universities when the existing ones are not being funded.\n\nAshiru said that governors are turning establishment of universities into constituency project.\n\n\u201cThey continue to establish more universities even when they do not fund the existing ones. In some of the institutions, all the buildings there are TetFunds structures, and the universities borrow money to pay salaries,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged government to change its attitude toward education of its citizens, and begin to see it as public good.\n\nDespite the reported decision by ASUU to shelve strike, BusinessDay can report that there is still apprehension that the Federal Government may not be able to meet the conditions. The days ahead will tell.",
          "summary": "Francis Herbert, a father of five, whose two children are in two different Nigerian universities, is a sad man today.\nMany concerned citizens are beginning to raise the alarm over the implication of another ASUU strike, especially on the students and the future of the country.\nMy concern is securing their future, which the Nigerian education system cannot guarantee,\u201d the doctor said.\nShe decried that the incessant strike is impacting negatively on the rating and quality of graduates from Nigerian universities.\nIf an average professor in a Nigerian university earns barely N400, 000 a month, then how much do you think others in lower cadre earn.",

          "text": "The former deputy speaker of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Oludare Kadiri, has alleged that his signature was forged to swindle the state assembly of about N50 million.\n\nMr Kadiri said this during an interview with selected journalists in Abeokuta on Saturday.\n\nThe lawmaker, who represents Ijebu North Constituency 2, was impeached last March over allegations of gross misconduct.\n\nThe ex-deputy speaker was also accused of insubordination to the Office of the Speaker, abuse of office, threat to lives and properties, conduct likely to cause a breach of peace and attempted murder, committed in his constituency.\n\nBut Mr Kadiri explained that he was kicked out of office for asking for accountability of the finances of the House, being the Vice Chairman of the House Committee on Finance.\n\nHe said that for raising questions, he was impeached and removed from all committees in the house.\n\nFielding questions from journalists, the ex-deputy speaker said, \u201cI\u2019m just coming back from abroad, I\u2019ve been on medical leave for about two months. I was on bed when I saw a report online and attached to it is a document with my signature. Like two to three days later, I got a call from the EFCC asking me to come.\n\n\u201cI went there on Monday. They asked me one or two questions and they showed me my signature and asked if I was the one that sent it out. I said no. They asked me about the signature and I told them I don\u2019t know anything about that signature and I didn\u2019t collect any money.\n\n\u201cI was aware that the Speaker, being the leader of the house, should be able to explain things about the signature. That was all and they allowed me to go.\n\n\u201cI know the EFCC is investigating the House. I was impeached because I was asking questions, and I felt the speaker was not open about the accountability of the House. When I was the deputy speaker, I don\u2019t know all about the finances of the House, the amount the executive was giving us. I don\u2019t know about our running cost.\n\n\u201cHow can I be the chairman of the committee who will sign a document to everyone that the money was spent in the judiciary and I don\u2019t know anything about it? That led to the impeachment.\n\n\u201cHe (the Speaker) removed me from all committees in the House. I don\u2019t belong to any committee anymore. Yet, I didn\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\nMr Kadiri said he saw, at the EFCC office, bundles of documents with the signatures of many members of the House, adding that his own signature seen on the document was forged.\n\n\u201cWhat I saw online was just two documents. I saw bundles of documents at the EFCC office with my signature forged on it. A very big Ghana-must-go bag with my fake signatures and other members signatures.\n\n\u201cThey claimed that I collected money like N2million, N400,000, N3million, N4million, N1million at different times in the last two years. They said I went to foreign trainings, I went for seminars, slept in hotels. Which foreign training? Since I came, I have never been to any training or seminar and I didn\u2019t sign any document.\n\n\u201cThe money they said I signed was an average of N50 million. It can\u2019t be less than that for my own alone,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked who he suspects to have forged his signature, Mr Kadiri said the speaker \u201cshould be able to explain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe speaker should be able to answer the question because he is the chief officer of the house. Everything goes through him. So, it\u2019s Mr Speaker that I will allege, probably with some other people but I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cHe was the one that took the documents to EFCC, so he should be the one to tell us. That\u2019s the question I want to ask when I go back to the office on Tuesday that, who forged this signature? I will speak for myself, I don\u2019t know about other people. EFCC said they will be calling others at the appropriate time.\n\n\u201cNormally our monthly maintenance allowance comes into our accounts. So, I can only be responsible for the money paid into my account. All the money being alleged was released in cash through the banks. So, the speaker should be able to explain how he was using my signature to go and collect money in the bank.\u201d\n\nMr Kadiri also denied that the former governor and senator representing Ogun central, Ibikunle Amosun, has been sponsoring him to destabilize the house.\n\nHe told journalists that he saw Mr Amosun last while the latter was still the governor of the state.\n\n\u2018His allegations are untrue\u2019\n\nWhen contacted for his reaction, the Speaker of the Assembly, Kunle Oluomo, dismissed Mr Kadiri\u2019s allegation, saying he is not in charge of payment in the state legislature.\n\n\u201cThat is not true. I am not the accounting officer of the House and not in charge of payments. Besides, you recall sometimes ago after his impeachment by 19 out of 26 members, he called me a thief in a video; that is already in court.\n\n\u201cMaybe when I see this one somewhere also, I will join it with the one in court as I have already sued him and his media collaborators.\n\n\u201cFinally, the onus is on him to prove that. The House doesn\u2019t even have that type of money.\u201d",
          "summary": "The former deputy speaker of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Oludare Kadiri, has alleged that his signature was forged to swindle the state assembly of about N50 million.\nThey asked me about the signature and I told them I don\u2019t know anything about that signature and I didn\u2019t collect any money.\nWhen I was the deputy speaker, I don\u2019t know all about the finances of the House, the amount the executive was giving us.\nI saw bundles of documents at the EFCC office with my signature forged on it.\nSo, it\u2019s Mr Speaker that I will allege, probably with some other people but I don\u2019t know.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, says his government is in talks with the World Bank to obtain $30 million loan to build a vaccine plant in Nigeria.\n\nThe president who made this known on Saturday during the graduation of Senior Executive Course 43 participants of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies in Jos, said he hoped that the vaccine plant to be built in collaboration with May & Baker Nigeria Plc would commence next year.\n\nBuhari who was represented by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, in the event attended by Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, among other dignitaries, noted that the plant will initially \u2018fill and finish\u2019 before full manufacturing of vaccines will follow.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in talks with the World Bank\u2019s private lending arm and other lenders to raise about $30m to help finance a vaccine plant \u2013 Biovaccines Nigeria Ltd, (with 49 per cent of the company owned by the Nigerian government and the balance held by May & Baker Nigeria Plc), plans to begin construction of the plant in the first quarter of next year,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe plant will initially \u2018fill and finish,\u2019 which means importing the raw materials for the vaccines and then packaging them for distribution. Full manufacturing is expected to follow.\n\nBuhari said but for providence and the good policies of his government, the COVID-19 pandemic would have wreaked unimaginable havoc on the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe GDP contracted to -6.10 per cent during the second quarter of 2020; the oil price at one point was about $10 a barrel and then finally settled at about $45 per barrel during the second quarter of 2020.\n\n\u201cUnemployment went up to 33.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020; the transportation sector declined by 49 per cent; the hospitality sector fell 40 per cent; the education sector fell 24 per cent; real estate declined by 22 per cent; trade declined by 17 per cent and construction declined by 40 per cent.\n\n\u201cNigeria was in a terrible economic situation and in response, the President took two swift steps. One was to set up a small inter-ministerial Committee headed by the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, to quickly work out the implications and the immediate mitigation for the economic shocks we were headed for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second thing the President did swiftly was to direct a team of ministers and interagency heads to draw up a 12-month economic emergency plan, which became known as the Economic Sustainability Plan.\n\n\u201cWe were clear that the only way of avoiding an economic disaster that could last for years was for the government to essentially put forward a major fiscal stimulus plan. Such a plan must have clear objectives of saving jobs and creating new ones, supporting businesses that may close down, and employees that may not be paid during lockdowns, and, of course, healthcare support to reduce the COVID-19 caseload. So, we promptly put forward a stimulus plan in the order of N2.3 trillion.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Director General of NIPSS, Chukwuemeka Udaya, said 85 Senior Executive Course participants passed out during the ceremony.\n\nAccording to him, the participants toured 14 states within Nigeria and also visited six African countries and five countries outside the continent in the course of the Senior Executive Course which began in February 2021",

          "text": "The Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, has issued a statement warning against the release of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB.\n\nIf the IPOB leader is released, AYCF\u2019s National President, Yerima Shettima, has warned that additional Kanu\u2019s will emerge, complicating the country\u2019s insecurity situation.\n\nAllowing Kanu to go unpunished, Shettima said reoort, would be detrimental to Nigeria and the Federal Government.\n\nHe was reacting to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s remark that he would consider the IPOB leader\u2019s release.\n\nBuhari had made the remark during a meeting with some Southeast leaders under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats, led by First Republic parliamentarian and Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi at the State House, Abuja.\n\nAmaechi pleaded with the president to release Kanu, rather than opt for military actions.\n\nResponding, Buhari who promised to consider their appeal, however, noted that an unconditional release of Kanu runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary.\n\nHowever, Shettima stressed that Kanu\u2019s release would undermine what he has done to Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Shettima: \u201cThere is the possibility of undermining the consequences of what this man (Nnamdi Kanu) did to the country and by implication, if he is allowed to go unpunished, it would be sending the wrong message. Nobody in the history of this country has done more damage to this country since the civil war than this young man.\n\n\u201cIf at the end of the day, they allow him to go unpunished after what he has done, the implication is that nobody will ever commit any offence of this nature and be punished because everybody will always refer to him.\n\n\u201cAnd this means that the constitution is automatically suspended in the country. This means that some people can just commit any crime at the expense of over 200 million Nigerians and get away with it. Somebody can kill, pronounce killing and still get away with it; then what is the essence of condemning people to death for killing, murder when compared to what this man (Kanu) did?\n\n\u201cThis is just a way of undermining the laws of our land, and indirectly they are saying the government of the day can be easily influenced. This means, somebody can commit any offence and then come to Buhari or any other government after this and seek forgiveness.\u201d\n\nThe AYCF National President noted that Kanu is not remorseful of his actions, hence he may boast of being begged.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis man is not even remorseful, indirectly, it\u2019s like the government is begging him to continue with what he\u2019s doing, and he would go unpunished.\n\n\u201cThe consequence is that, if he is allowed to go unpunished, we would end up having millions of Kanu rising, even, if he decides not to go ahead with further actions.\n\n\u201cIf he is allowed to go, he (Kanu) will come out boasting that he did not beg to be released. He is not remorseful and there is nothing to show he regrets his actions, and anybody can do such and get away with it; we are not in Banana Republic for God\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the law should be allowed to take its full course in Kanu\u2019s matter.\n\n\u201cThe law must take its full course and I hope it\u2019s not what I\u2019m thinking because nobody has done the kind of damage this man has done to this country; and up till date, we have not recovered from the consequences of what he has done to this country, we are watching.\n\n\u201cIf we allow him to go unpunished, then we are saying that the country should produce millions of him. With him alone, look at the damage he has done to his region, but for us in the North, we would ensure he has no sympathizer.\n\n\u201cNobody is saying he should be dealt with without committing any crime, but if he is found wanting; then he should be made to face the consequences of his actions since the matter is in court,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s announcement that he will examine the petition of some Southeast leaders to free Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has elicited mixed reactions.\n\nDuring a meeting with Buhari at the State House in Abuja, Southeast leaders under the auspices of Highly Respected Igbo Greats, led by First Republic politician and Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, appealed for Kanu\u2019s release.\n\nInstead of resorting to military force, Amaechi called with the president to pursue political solutions in Kanu\u2019s issue.\n\nBuhari, who pledged to review their petition, responded by stating that Kanu\u2019s unconditional release would be in violation of the idea of separation of powers between the Executive and the Judiciary.\n\nThe president also emphasized his non-interference approach with the judiciary.\n\nHowever, a constitutional lawyer, Maduabuchi Idam, contested the president\u2019s claim that ordering Kanu\u2019s release would constitute meddling with the judiciary.\n\nContrary to the president\u2019s assertion, Idam noted that the Nigerian constitution allows Buhari to order Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami to drop the prosecution against Kanu.\n\nThe Abuja-based lawyer told DAILY POST that the president might order Malami to withdraw any cases against anyone, including the IPOB leader, in the national good.\n\nAccording to Idam: \u201cKindly note that if an offence is alleged to have been committed, it is the state that prosecutes the alleged offender. In this context, the state is the Presidency and that is why it is the office of the Attorney General of the Federation that prosecutes Mr. Nnamdi Kanu and those of his members on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, by virtue of Section 174 (1),(c) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as Amended, the AGF has the constitutional power to amongst others, enter a \u201cnulle prosecui\u201d ( power to discontinue a case) in favour of any person being prosecuted for any offence on behalf of the Federal Government. Similarly, the power is also available to the AG of the State with respect to State offences. See Section 211 of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the above, the President of Nigeria, in the interest of the public, can direct the AGF to withdraw any case that is instituted against any one on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cBy the operation of the said provision of the constitution, the AGF has the vires to personally or through an officer in his office, walk into the court where Mr. Kanu is undergoing prosecution and apply to withdraw the charges against him and his members, and the court has no power under the constitution or any law, to refuse the Application or demand the AGF to give an explanation for that.\n\n\u201cIf the President feels that a matter should be withdrawn from the court for public interest, all he needs to do is to direct the AGF to do the needful.\n\n\u201cI must say that I commend the courage of Mr. President for the first time, at least for saying that he will consider the request to release the IPOB Leader, Mr. Nnamdi Kanu and his members.\u201d\n\nIdam\u2019s remark was, however, countered by a Northern socio-political activist, Yaro Abdullahi, who warned on the dangers of releasing Kanu.\n\nAbdullahi warned that Kanu\u2019s release may serve as a spring board for other people to commit serious crimes and get away with it.\n\nHe pointed out that nobody in the history of Nigeria has committed Kanu\u2019s kind of crime; hence releasing him would be sending the wrong message.\n\n\u201cHow do you start considering the release of a criminal like Kanu, who ordered killing of people. Because of his criminal style of agitation, the Southeast is no longer peaceful, releasing him would be sending the wrong signal that people can just do anything and get away with it.\n\n\u201cThis is my view. The president should allow the judiciary to do their work and not listen to all those appeals. If the courts find him guilty, he should face the music and if it\u2019s the other way round, he should be released.\n\n\u201cThe president, while considering should also note the damage Kanu is capable of doing if set free,\u201d he told DAILY POST.",

          "text": "The United States government says it hopes that Nigeria will become a strong example for world democracies when the nation heads to the polls come 2023.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Channels Television, U.S. Secretary of State, Mr Antony Blinken, said the United States anticipates an election that goes \u201csmoothly, freely and fairly, with real participation which will send a very strong message about democratic resilience\u201d.\n\nBlinken who in a recent address warned that \u2018democratic recession\u2019 is growing around the world, noted on Friday in Abuja that he is pleased with the fact that President Muhammadu Buhari is willing to respect term limits.\n\nAccording to him, respecting such a democratic principle is powerful on its own. He, however, noted that there has to be something more.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Secretary of State explained that \u201cone of the reasons that citizens are losing faith in some places, in democracy, in the institutions is because they feel that its not delivering for them. It\u2019s not actually producing things that they need, that they want, that will make a difference in their lives.\n\n\u201cSo, in different countries including in Nigeria, when everything is done based on patronage as opposed to actually delivering all the things that people need, that actually erodes trust in democracy.\n\n\u201cBut the more the government can be responsive to the needs of people, the more they will say you know what, this system works, I want to be a part of it, I want to defend it and that I think will create enthusiasm around the elections. And that alone will also send a very important message to countries through the continent and around the world.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Blinken told members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Abuja that the United States government believes now is the time for major geopolitical players across the world to start treating Africa as one of them.\n\n\u201cThe United States firmly believes that it is time to start treating Africa as a subject in geopolitics, and structure it as a major geopolitical player it has become \u2013 the facts speak for themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking specifically about Nigeria, the U.S. official highlighted some of the reasons it would not be out of place to call the nation the giant of Africa.\n\nAmong several other qualities, he noted Nigeria\u2019s cultural influence, saying people across the world listen to the Afrobeat music genre and watch Nollywood movies. He, however, believes there are areas that require improvements.\n\n\u201dYour strengths are undeniable \u2013 a dynamic democracy, a robust economy, and a very powerful civil society. Challenges you face here are undeniable as well, including the disruption and insecurity caused by terrorism,\u201d said Blinken.\n\n\u201cWhat happens here in Nigeria is felt around the world, and that, in a nutshell, is why I came to Abuja. United States knows that in most of the challenges and opportunities we face, Africa will make a difference.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t achieve our goals around the world \u2013 whether ending the COVID-19 pandemic, building a strong and inclusive global economy, combating the climate crisis\u2026 without the leadership of the African governments, institutions, and citizens.\n\n\u201cCountries like Nigeria, not just global leaders, they are increasingly prominent around the world beyond this region, and they are deserving a permanent seat wherever the most consequential issues are discussed.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Secretary of State stressed the need to foster democracy across the African continent and appealed to its leaders to stop interfering with democratic processes.\n\nAlluding to the threats to democracy also in the U.S., he stated that it was important for countries in every part of the world to share best practices.\n\nBlinken also asked them to make public pledges to hold each other accountable, as well as show how democracy can deliver what citizens want quickly and effectively.",

          "title": "IMF Advises FG To Remove Fuel, Electricity Subsidies",
          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called on the Federal Government of Nigeria to completely remove fuel and electricity subsidies early next year.\n\nIn its preliminary findings at the end of its official staff visit to the country under the Artile IV Mission, IMF also called for reforms in the fiscal, exchange rate, trade and governance \u201cto alter the long-running lacklustre growth path.\u201d\n\nThe Washington-based organization made these suggestions in a report published on its official website on Friday, November 19.\n\nAccording to the IMF, the removal of \u201cretrogressive\u201d fuel and electricity subsidies should be considered a priority as part of the fiscal policy.\n\n\u201cThe headline fiscal deficit is projected to worsen in the near term and remain elevated over the medium term. Despite much higher oil prices, the general government fiscal deficit is projected to widen in 2021 to 6.3 percent of GDP, reflecting implicit fuel subsidies and higher security spending, and remain at that level in 2022. There are significant downside risks to the near-term fiscal outlook from the ongoing pandemic, weak security situation and spending pressures associated with the electoral cycle.\n\n\u201cOver the medium term, without bold revenue mobilization efforts, fiscal deficits are projected to stay elevated above the pre-pandemic levels with public debt increasing to 43 percent in 2026. General government interest payments are expected to remain high as a share of revenues making the fiscal position highly vulnerable to real interest rate shocks and dependent on central bank financing.\n\n\u201cThe complete removal of regressive fuel and electricity subsidies is a near-term priority, combined with adequate compensatory measures for the poor. The mission stressed the need to fully remove fuel subsidies and move to a market-based pricing mechanism in early 2022 as stipulated in the 2021 Petroleum Industry Act. In addition, the implementation of cost-reflective electricity tariffs as of January 2022 should not be delayed. Well-targeted social assistance will be needed to cushion any negative impacts on the poor particularly in light of still elevated inflation.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s past experiences with fuel subsidy removal, which have all been short-lived and reversed, underscore the importance of building a consensus and improving public trust regarding the protection of the poor and efficient and transparent use of the saved resources,\u201d the report partly read.\n\nThe IMF further noted that significant additional domestic revenue mobilization is critical to put the public debt and debt-servicing capacity on a sustainable path.\n\nIn the international financial institution\u2019s view, the near-term priorities are to implement e-customs reforms including efficient procedures and controls, developing a VAT Compliance Improvement Program, improving compliance across large, medium, and micro/small taxpayers and rationalising tax incentives and customs duty waivers.\n\n\u201cAs the recovery gains strength and compliance improves, Nigeria will have to adopt tax rates comparable to its peers in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to raise revenues to levels targeted in the 2021-25 National Development Plan.\n\n\u201cThe cumulative net savings from the recommended measures, after making room for additional social assistance to cushion impacts of reforms, could amount to 5.1 percent of GDP over 2022-26. Such a consolidation would keep public debt below 40 percent of GDP and reduce dependence on central bank financing of the deficit.\n\n\u201cA further move toward a market-clearing exchange rate will also help build foreign exchange buffers through higher capital inflows. Despite the recent SDR allocation and a successful Eurobond issuance, gross reserves remain significantly below the IMF\u2019s recommended adequacy levels.\n\n\u201cSlow FX reforms and uncertainties regarding the ability to repatriate foreign funds have discouraged new capital inflows. With an external position that is assessed to be weaker than implied by Nigeria\u2019s economic fundamentals and desired policies, a narrow export base, and limited capital inflows, the mission recommended preserving foreign exchange reserves through sustainable policies. The mission assessed Nigeria\u2019s capacity to repay the outstanding credit from the 2020 Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to be adequate,\u201d the report further read.\n\nGiving more inferences to aid development in Nigeria, the IMF said a more open trade regime is needed to unleash the growth potential brought by the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA).\n\n\u201cThe authorities are committed to implementing the AfCFTA and are working to enhance trade facilitation through increased use of technology. However, overall trade regime continues to be protectionist and restrictive with numerous products prohibited from FX access for imports, including basic necessities and food items, high tariff and non-tariff barriers, and difficult trade logistics.\n\n\u201cBuilding on current efforts to improve port infrastructure and reduce the burden of customs administration, the mission recommended decisive actions to reduce barriers to trade and reliance on import substitution.\u201d\n\nAs regards corruption, the IMF affirmed that there are ongoing efforts to improve transparency and governance, however, the organization stressed that more is needed to build public trust to implement difficult but needed reforms.",

          "text": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been sacked as Manchester United manager after an \u201cembarrassing\u201d 4-1 defeat at Watford.\n\nUnited have confirmed Solskjaer\u2019s assistant Michael Carrick will be placed in temporary charge, with the club looking to appoint an interim manager until the end of the season.\n\nSolskjaer signed a new three-year deal in July but leaves after overseeing five defeats in their last seven Premier League matches \u2013 a run which sees them 12 points behind leaders Chelsea.\n\nThe Old Trafford hierarchy had ignored increasingly vociferous calls to relieve Solskjaer of his duties in the wake of a humiliating 5-0 loss to rivals Liverpool and a 2-0 derby defeat to Manchester City in early November.\n\nBut his position was discussed by United officials on Saturday evening following the crushing defeat at Vicarage Road, before the announcement of his dismissal followed on Sunday morning.\n\nA club statement said: \u201cManchester United announces that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has left his role as manager.\n\n\u201cOle will always be a legend at Manchester United and it is with regret that we have reached this difficult decision. While the past few weeks have been disappointing, they should not obscure all the work he has done over the past three years to rebuild the foundations for long-term success.\n\n\u201cOle leaves with our sincerest thanks for his tireless efforts as manager and our very best wishes for the future. His place in the club\u2019s history will always be secure, not just for his story as a player, but as a great man and a manager who gave us many great moments. He will forever be welcome back at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United family.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer was booed by a number of the United fans in the away end at full time at Watford, although midfielder Bruno Fernandes appeared to try to redirect their frustration towards the players.\n\nGoalkeeper David de Gea labelled the defeat \u201cembarrassing\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d.\n\nAfter the game, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher described Solskjaer\u2019s position as \u201cuntenable\u201d but described the performance of the club\u2019s players as \u201cscandalous\u201d.\n\nOle\u2019s journey \u2018at the wheel\u2019 ends without a trophy\n\nFormer United striker Solskjaer returned to the club initially as caretaker manager after the dismissal of Jose Mourinho in December 2018 and immediately produced an upturn in United\u2019s form \u2013 including the 3-1 win at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League.\n\n\u2018Ole\u2019s at the wheel\u2019 became a trending topic as Solskjaer was appointed on a permanent basis in March 2019.\n\nHe was unable to lead United into the top four of the Premier League that season but did achieve third and second-place finishes in his two full seasons in charge.\n\nHowever, Solskjaer failed to deliver silverware during his tenure, with the defeat on penalties to Villarreal in last season\u2019s Europa League final being their best effort.\n\nHow did Solskjaer compare?\n\nThe Norwegian departs Manchester United with an inferior win percentage to that of Jose Mourinho, the man he replaced. Here, we take a look at the numbers\u2026\n\nSaturday\u2019s defeat to Watford was Solskjaer\u2019s 168th game in charge of the club. In total, he won 91 of them, drawing 37 and losing 40.\n\nOf Manchester United\u2019s four permanent managers since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s departure from the club, including David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho as well as Solskjaer, the Norwegian\u2019s overall win rate of 54 per cent puts him second.\n\nMourinho\u2019s win rate is the highest of the four at 58 per cent, while Moyes and Van Gaal trail on 53 per cent and 52 per cent respectively.\n\nOverall, Solskjaer\u2019s record against the traditional big-six \u2013 Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham \u2013 was mixed, with 14 wins, 10 draws and 12 losses.\n\nIndeed, a big-six mini-league of head-to-head meetings since Solskjaer\u2019s appointment puts Manchester United 18 points behind City and 23 behind Liverpool.\n\nThat, of course, is despite heavy investment in the squad. This summer, Manchester United brought in Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane at considerable expense.\n\nTheir latest round of spending pushed their net spend under Solskjaer to \u00a3312m \u2013 \u00a333m more than any other Premier League side and \u00a3196m more than City and Liverpool\u2019s combined.\n\nManchester United will now pin their hopes on a new manager to restore their former glories.",

          "title": "US: Rittenhouse \u2018Not Guilty\u2019 Verdict Puts Biden in Difficult Political Spot",
          "text": "A difficult political atmosphere for President Joe Biden may have become even more treacherous with the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse.\n\nBiden was already facing sliding poll numbers with an electorate worn down by the coronavirus pandemic and increasing inflation. Now, the president finds himself caught between outraged Democrats \u2014 some of whom were already stewing over Biden\u2019s inability to land police reform and voting rights legislation \u2014 and Republicans looking to use the Rittenhouse case to exploit the national divide over matters of grievance and race.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the last things Biden wants to be engaging in at this moment as he tries to finish up the big Build Back Better bill and get that across the finish line through the Senate,\u201d said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. \u201cRace and Kyle Rittenhouse is not the space where he wants or needs to be going deep right now.\u201d\n\nThe acquittal of Rittenhouse has touched off new conversations about racial justice, vigilantism and policing in America. The Illinois teen armed himself with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle during an August 2020 protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, days after the shooting of a Black man by a white police officer. He said he came to small city to help protect a car lot from vandals and provide medical aid.\n\nRittenhouse would end up fatally shooting two men and maiming a third. Rittenhouse and his lawyers successfully argued that he had acted in self-defense during a confrontation in which he feared for his life.\n\nThe verdict in the case comes at a moment when Biden is trying to keep fellow Democrats focused on passing his massive social services and climate bill and hoping to turn the tide with Americans who have soured on his performance as president.\n\nThe president responded carefully following Friday\u2019s verdict, expressing respect for the jury\u2019s decision. He later added in a written statement that, like many Americans, he was \u201cangry and concerned\u201d with the jury acquittal of Rittenhouse.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans, who had success in this month\u2019s Virginia election in part by accusing Democrats of promoting critical race theory in public schools, are embracing 18-year-old Rittenhouse as their newest hero in America\u2019s culture wars.\n\nGOP Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona and Matt Gaetz of Florida have said they\u2019d like to hire him as an intern, with Gosar suggesting they arm wrestle for the honor. Another Republican, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, on Saturday predicted that liberal outrage over the Rittenhouse trial would benefit her party.\n\n\u201cIt seems liberals want self-defense to be illegal,\u201d Boebert tweeted. \u201cTry running on that in 2022 and see how far it gets you with the majority of the sane American public.\u201d\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was quick to stand with Rittenhouse following the verdict. He called the teen \u201cbrave\u201d for testifying in his own defense and accused the left of trying \u201cto fan hatred\u201d with its treatment of Rittenhouse.\n\nTrump has spent much of his post-presidency stoking divisions with his frontal criticism of Biden and of any Republican who has not marched in lockstep with his views. And most Republicans, either through silence or direct endorsement, have followed his lead.\n\nIn the aftermath of the acquittal, Republicans have highlighted a tweet by Biden during his winning 2020 presidential campaign in which he appeared to suggest that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist.\n\nThe tweet, from September 2020, excoriated Trump for failing \u201cto disavow white supremacists on the debate stage\u201d the previous night and included a video that contained a still image of Rittenhouse from the night of the Kenosha shooting and footage of torch-bearing white supremacists at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel are among party officials who have called on Biden to apologize.\n\n\u201cHe smeared a teenager to score political points and spread lies about this case,\u201d McDaniel wrote on Twitter. \u201cWhat Biden did was dangerous and inflammatory.\u201d\n\nAsked by a reporter soon after the verdict if he stood by his campaign social media posting, Biden responded that \u201cI stand by what the jury has concluded.\u201d\n\nBorick, the Muhlenberg College pollster, said the results of this month\u2019s elections in Virginia show that driving at cultural issues \u2014 including race and transgender rights \u2014 could be a good strategy for Republicans trying to energize a segment of the electorate that was passionate about Trump but less enthusiastic about the rest of the GOP. But Borick warned that the GOP\u2019s fulsome embrace of Rittenhouse wasn\u2019t without risk.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a great place to be if you\u2019re trying, come the midterms, to reach suburban voters and educated voters who might not fault the decision to acquit Rittenhouse because of the circumstances but are far from comfortable holding him up as a hero,\u201d Borick said.\n\nEven before the verdict, Biden had been facing increased pressure from some Democrats over the lack of progress on passing voting rights and police reform legislation.\n\nLast month, a day after Senate Republicans filibustered a major voting bill for the second time this year, Biden acknowledged that the process of governing could be \u201cfrustrating and sometimes dispiriting\u201d but urged supporters to \u201ckeep the faith.\u201d\n\nAt the same, civil rights leaders have expressed frustration that Biden has not used the power of the bully pulpit more to push for a broad police reform bill named after George Floyd, the Black Minneapolis man whose killing last year by police touched off protests around the U.S.\n\nSpeaking at an event earlier this week where he signed into law a trio of bills to increase aid to police, Biden only made passing mention of the George Floyd act, asking legislators from both parties to work together to make it law.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s next,\u201d Biden said.",

          "title": "In Double Standard, US Threatens Nigeria with Arms Embargo but Silent on Israel",
          "text": "In what seems to be a clear case of double standard, the United States has threatened that Nigeria risks arms embargo for alleged violations of the laws on armed conflicts in the fight against banditry, terrorism, and other forms of violence in different parts of the federation.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with CNN International released on Saturday by the US Department of State, the US Secretary of State, Antony J. Blinken, threatened that his country would apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria if the allegations of rights violations were found to be credible.\n\nThe threat came just as the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) faulted the removal of Nigeria from the US 2021 list of religious violators, insisting that Christians are still being persecuted by terrorist groups and other Islamic associations in the country.\n\nAccording to reports, the United States was said to have vetoed over 50 United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions critical of Israel since 1972.\n\nDuring the last escalation of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, the US had reportedly stuck to that playbook, blocking a joint statement calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.\n\nSeveral resolutions condemning violence against Palestine protesters, and the illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, were also reportedly thwarted by the US.\n\nThe UN resolutions had also stated that East Jerusalem should not be considered Israeli territory, but the US recognised Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital in December 2017.\n\nIn contrast to Washington\u2019s blanket support for Israel, concerns have heightened that the US wants to tie Nigeria\u2019s hand behind her back in the face of attacks by terrorists, and bandits by threatening arms embargo against the country in the fight against insurgent groups.\n\nBut Blinken, in a surprise move, said his country would apply the Leahy Laws against Nigeria.\n\nThe Leahy Laws prohibit the US Department of State and Department of Defence from providing military assistance to foreign security force units that violate human rights with impunity.\n\nBlinken said: \u201cOf course, we also have laws in place \u2013 the Leahy laws, for example. That makes sure that if there are units that have committed abuses; we are not going to provide equipment to those units.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the US would invoke the Leahy Laws against Nigeria, the secretary of state promised: \u201cWell, we look in any instance if there are credible allegations that prove out or that we believe meet the standard of the law, of course, we will apply the law.\n\n\u201cIf there is genuine transparency, accountability, and change that follows from these incidents and these abuses, I think that is very important, not only to our administration. It is also important to the US Congress in making judgments about continuing to assist the security forces,\u201d Blinken explained.\n\nThe secretary of state, however, explained the nature of military assistance the US had been giving Nigeria, noting that it was not all about the sale of military hardware alone, but also about the software.\n\nAccording to Blinken, \u201cthe military assistance itself is not just the hardware that we might provide \u2013 airplanes or helicopters. It is also the software as well as the human software\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cBecause one of the things that we are doing is making sure that as we are providing equipment to deal with profound security challenges that are faced here in Nigeria \u2013 terrorism, criminal activity, other violence, those who will be using the equipment are trained.\n\n\u201cSecurity forces must be trained in a way that makes sure that they are doing it to avoid hurting the good guys, even as they are going after the bad guys, to make sure that the laws of armed conflict are fully in mind. If they make mistakes, they are corrected and they are brought to light immediately,\u201d Blinken explained.\n\nReacting to the report on the Lekki Tollgate incident, Blinken admitted that the report of the Lekki Incident had brought transparency to what happened on the night of October 20, 2020.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think the first of all, the fact of the report, of the panel\u2019s work is usually important because it is bringing vital transparency to what happened, to the violence that took place around the #EndSARS protests and the allegations of abuses by the security forces.\n\n\u201cI have not seen the published report yet. I think it will hopefully be coming out very, very soon. But a couple of things are really important,\u201d Blinken added.\n\nHe explained that the report was important to make sure that such an incident would not happen again.\n\nHe argued that reforms \u201care necessary to build and rebuild trust between the citizens and the security services, between citizens and the state. That is an obligation of both the state government and the federal government.\u201d\n\nBlinken insisted that officers of the Nigerian Army and the Nigeria Police, who played one role or the other in the Lekki Incident should be made to account for their roles.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf there are individuals that \u2013 as it emerges from this report \u2013 who are responsible for committing abuses, there has to be accountability in terms of those individuals. That too is vital to rebuilding trust between citizens and the state and the security services.\u201d\n\nThe panel\u2019s report had recommended that all officers deployed to the tollgate should face appropriate disciplinary action. Except for Commander, 81 Division Garrison, Brig. Gen. Francis Omata, the panel demanded that all military officers involved in the operations should be stripped of their status and dismissed on the ground that they \u201care not fit and proper to serve in any public or security service of the nation.\u201d\n\nThe panel equally recommended that the Divisional Police Officer, Maroko Police Division, Mr. Raji Ganiyu, and all police officers deployed for operation between October 20 and 21, 2020 should be prosecuted for arbitrary and indiscriminate shooting and killing of the #EndSARS protesters.\n\nOn the Ethiopia-Tigray conflict, Blinken disclosed that the US \u201cis acting in close coordination with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, supporting his efforts, and other leaders on the continent including Kenyan President Uhuru Muigai Kenyatta to end the conflict.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised the African-led solutions to end the Ethiopia-Tigray conflict, noting that the African Union with Obasanjo \u201cis doing exactly that. It is a very important approach and it is something that we will support.\u201d\n\nIn another development, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on Saturday faulted the removal of Nigeria from the US 2021 list of religious violators, insisting that Christians are still being persecuted by terrorist groups and other Islamic associations in the country.\n\nThe apex Christian organisation said that it was at a loss on the data or statistics used by the US government in arriving at delisting Nigeria from the list of \u2018Countries of Particular Concern\u2019 on the issue of freedom of religion.\n\nUS Secretary of State, Blinken, had in a statement on Wednesday, blacklisted Russia, China, and eight other countries as religious violators, leaving out Nigeria which was placed on the same list in 2020.\n\nSpeaking in Nigeria during a two-day official visit that ended on Friday, Blinken had disclosed that the delisting of Nigeria was based on facts.\n\nBut CAN in a statement Saturday condemned the decision, saying that Christians were still being ferociously attacked and that nothing has changed between 2020 and 2021 to warrant the removal of Nigeria from the list of religious violators.\n\nThe statement signed by CAN President, Rev Samson Ayokunle, read in part: \u201cThe US government did not contact us when they were listing Nigeria among the countries of \u2018Particular Concern\u2019 on religious freedom, neither did they seek our opinion before removing Nigeria from the list. If they had done, we would have been able to compare the statistics then and now on the issue of freedom of religion in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhatever may be the data they used, our prayer is that Nigeria would be a country where no religious group is discriminated against or persecuted and that our government would see to it that all religiously biased policies are discontinued.\n\n\u201cChristians had faced and are still facing persecution from ISWAP and the Boko Haram Islamic Group till today as before. These are the people who said their agenda was to wipe away Christianity from Nigeria and to plant Islam as the only religion from the North down to the Atlantic Ocean in the South. That agenda with the killing of Christians has not stopped till today and Nigerians are living witnesses.\n\n\u201cThe bandits have joined other militant Islamic groups to be ferociously attacking churches, killing worshippers, and kidnapping for ransom. The herdsmen are equally doing their havoc. We have lost many people and places of worship to their assault, especially in the North-central part of the country and the northeast.\n\n\u201cThough the madness has grown now and those who are not Christians are being attacked, killed, and kidnapped, this is because these criminal acts have become a lucrative business and it is whoever you can kidnap for money! If the government had responded appropriately when this criminal madness began and subdued these evil groups immediately, we wouldn\u2019t be where we are now!\u201d\n\nThe Christian association also said discrimination against Christians, especially in Northern Nigeria has not stopped.\n\n\u201cUp till today, our government is still funding the membership of Nigeria in all the International Islamic organisations like OIC and its allies without being part of any international Christian organisation.\u201d\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi in Lagos, Kingsley Nwezeh and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",
