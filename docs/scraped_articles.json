          "title": "2023: APC governors meet over consensus, zoning",
          "text": "Governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress Tuesday night went into a closed-door meeting at the Kebbi Governor\u2019s Lodge, Abuja.\n\nTuesday\u2019s meeting came just hours after the Progressive Governor met with the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), at the Presidential Villa.\n\nAlthough the PGF Chairman, Abubakar Bagudu, did not state specifics to be discussed on Tuesday night, it is believed that the core agenda would be on the consensus chairmanship candidate ahead of March 26.\n\nEarlier at the Presidential Villa, our correspondent gathered that the governors tried in vain to change the President\u2019s mind to dump Abdullahi Adamu as the consensus candidate for the national chairmanship.\n\nAfter enumerating their reasons against the former Nasarawa State Governor, Buhari was said to have bluntly refused to change his mind.\n\nThe Kebbi State Governor also debunked notions that the Progressive Governors Forum was still divided over the party\u2019s direction regarding zoning and chairmanship after what appeared to be a heated disagreement among them as they emerged from the meeting with the President.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere\u2019s no altercation, I\u2019m not aware of any. Mallam Nasiru (Kaduna State governor), again last week, answered that look, if by altercation people are talking about differences of opinion before a decision is arrived at, then maybe, that is what people can\u2026but as a body, the 22 governors of APC are united behind the party and Mr President.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, concerned party members under the auspices of the \u2018APC National Stakeholders\u2019 warned against attempts to \u201cimpose\u201d former members of the Peoples Democratic Party, Senators Abdullahi Adamu and Ken Nnamani, as the party\u2019s National Chairman and Deputy National Chairman, respectively.\n\n\u201cWe have always been against imposition in whatever guise, considering our belief that whenever a consensus option is adopted, as long as it is not predated by wide consultation, it would no doubt violate every known democratic ethos and principles.\n\n\u201cThe lingering and now widespread speculation as to the plan to bring a former member of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP in the person of Senator Abdullahi Adamu as the APC National Chairman in the forthcoming Convention, where loyal, qualified and competent foundation members of the APC are also in the race is not only an aberration but a violation of the established principle of APC which respects long-term fidelity and frowns at injustice.\n\n\u201cWhile it is within his constitutional rights to vie for any position within the APC or even the country as a whole, we believe that the individuals who are purportedly behind the plot to make Abdullahi Adamu the next APC National Chairman cannot sit down alone in their zones and decide who gets what,\u201d they said.\n\nThe PUNCH also learnt that APC Governors from the Southeast protested the zoning of the office of the National Secretary to the Southwest, with Bagudu insisting that it was too late to amend the zoning formula.\n\nThe PGF Chairman\u2019s position notwithstanding, the Southeast governors, our correspondent learned, are determined to air their stance to the party\u2019s National Secretary, Dr John Akpanudoedehe, in a meeting of the APC governors holding Tuesday night.\n\nIn attendance are the Governors of Kebbi, Abubakar Bagudu; Borno, Babagana Zulum; Jigawa, Muhammad Abubakar; Ondo, Rotimi Akeredolu; Niger, Abubakar Bello; Kaduna, Nasir El-Rufai; Ekiti, Kayode Fayemi; Kogi, Yahaya Bello; Ogun, Dapo Abiodun; Ebonyi, Dave Umahi; Osun, Gboyega Oyetola; Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Plateau, Simon Lalong; Imo, Hope Uzondinma; Nasarrawa, Abdullahi Sule, Kano, Dr Abdullahi Ganduje; Kwara, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq; Katsina, Aminu Masari; Zamfara, Bello Matawalle; Cross River, Ben Ayade and Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Nkem Okeke.\n\nThe Yobe State Governor and Caretaker Committee Chairman, Mai Mala Buni, was the last to arrive.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nMotorists in Kano State are lamenting the lingering petroleum scarcity and the flagrant price hike of the commodity by marketers.\n\nA cross section of the beleaguered motorists who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) lamented the nefarious activities of the shylock marketers, saying the scarcity had resulted in long queues at filling stations.\n\nA NAN Correspondent who monitored the situation, observed that only few petroleum marketers sold the product at the pump price of N165 per litre in Kano city.\n\nThe investigation further revealed that such filling stations attracted high patronage, leading to resurfacing of long queues, where motorists spent several hours to refill their vehicles.\n\nSome filling stations, particularly at the environs, had the product in stock, but they close in the day time and open in the night to sell at exorbitant prices.\n\nThe survey further revealed that majority of filling stations in the city had run out of stock, hence, they remained closed.\n\nThe situation left some motorists with no option other than to buy from the black market, because they could not afford to wait in the long queues.\n\nNAN also reports that a four-litre gallon of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS-petrol) at the black market sold for N1,200 and above.\n\nThe survey further indicates that some filling stations at the outskirts of Kano metropolis sold the product at at a minimum of N220 per litre and above, as reported from filling stations on the outskirts of Kano. They sold the product for between N235 and N245.\n\nSome of the motorists interviewed lamented the ugly situation and urged the government to take urgent measures that would address the problems.\n\nAminu Kabiru, a driver, said that he encountered difficulties daily before getting fuel for his vehicle for the past four weeks.\n\nHe said that was why they increased transport fares to sustain the operations.\n\nTasiu Musa, another motorist, said that development would only aggravate the suffering by the people.\n\nMusa added,\u201dthis could also lead to inflation because of the vital role that the transportation sector plays in the development of the economy.\u201d\n\nHe urged the government to come to the aid of Nigerians by addressing the problems in good time.\n\nHowever, all efforts to talk to the Chairman, Kano State Chapter of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Alhaji Bashir Danmallam, on the issue proved abortive, because he neither answered several phone calls, nor responded to SMS text message sent to him.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

We have read Nigerians speculating, the only thing I can tell you is that we are in deep talks with Kwankwaso, in fact we have almost concluded, in the next few days, we will be reverting to Nigerians to tell them what understanding we have had with him (Kwankwaso), but I can assure you that he is on his way into NNPP,\u201d Major said.\n\nHe also ruled out an automatic presidential ticket for Kwankwaso, saying other aspirants would be given the opportunity to contest for it.\n\nHe said Kwankwaso, during the talks, assured that he would be a loyal party member and would follow the dictates and rules of the party.\n\n\u201cThe presidential ticket is not automatic, he (Kwankwaso) has told us that his moves towards coming into the party should not be seen as an attempt to take the ticket automatically, and we have encouraged other aspirants to come so that we can fully demonstrate the power of the rights of people,\u201d he said.\n\nMajor also said the party will not be going into any coalition or merge with any group or political party, as this had been tried in the past without meaningful result.\n\n\u201cWe have never been part of any coalition, it is important to let you know that the NNPP is a very old party and so we have seen a lot of these things come and go, we have never believed in this coalition thing because we have experimented it.\n\n\u201cIn 2007 we went into some form of electoral alliance, we did not get what we wanted to get, coming together entails either a merger arrangement or a coalition, we have experimented with coalition repeatedly, and it has not given us any result, the only thing they have tried and it worked is the merger,\u201d he said.\n\nThe meeting adopted the proposal to amend the party\u2019s constitution granting waivers to new members and restructuring of the party.\n\nThis is to enable new comers contest for party\u2019s elective positions or as candidate of the party in state and national elections.\n\nMembers of the Caretaker Committee were sworn in immediately as the with the outgoing national chairman becoming the Board of Trustees (BoT) chairman.\n\nAVM John Chris Ifeimeje (Retd) emerged the acting national chairman in the national caretaker committee of the party.\n\nThe caretaker committee was shared between the party\u2019s old NNPP members and other members of the Kwankwaso groups.\n\nSome of the prominent Kwankwaso loyalists that attended the meeting include former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prof. Rufai Ahmed Alkali; former National Secretary of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Engr. Buba Galadima; and former Kaduna Senator Suleiman Othman Hunkuyi among others",

The number needed for each of the Bills to scale through is 73 yes votes.\n\n\u201cTruth is, while the Northern Senators saw nothing wrong in voting to change the name of Kunchi LGA in Kano State to Ghari LGA, they turned round to oppose that of Gwol typical of their opposition against anything Plateau or that resembles Plateau State.\n\n\u201cThe people of Plateau State abhor the attitude and betrayal of Senators of the core North who voted against the collective decision taken at the meeting of the so-called Northern Senators preceding the Senate sitting\u201d, he decried.\n\n\u201cThe action of the Northern Senators has again unveiled the deception and hypocrisy with which the core North perceives and treats ethnic minorities of the Middle Belt states, Plateau State in particular\u201d, Gyang maintained.\n\nHe however said those that passed include; \u201cChange of names of Afikpo North and Afikpo South in Ebonyi state to Afikpo and Edda LGAs \u2013 93 registered, 90 voted for, 2 against and 1 abstained.\n\n\u201cChange of name of Kunchi LGA of Kano State to Ghari LGA \u2013 93 registered, 89 voted for, 1 voted against and 3 did not vote.\n\n\u201cChange of name of Egbado North and Egbado South LGA of Ogun State to Yewa North and Yewa South \u2013 97 registered, 93 voted for, two voted against, two abstained and two did not vote.\n\nOthers are, \u201cCorrection of name Atigbo LGA of Oyo State to Atisbo LGA \u2013 87 registered, 79 voted for, 6 voted against, none abstained and three did not vote.\n\n\u201cCorrection of the name Abio/Akpor LGA to Obio/Akpor LGA. 96 registered, 91 voted yes, two voted against, none abstained and 3 did not vote.\n\nGyang, who is the Deputy Chairman, Senate Committee on Defence, said, \u201cTruth is, the destiny and heritage of Plateau State and people can never be outsourced no matter the conspiracy\u201d.",

Mangala Limited, an Abuja firm to the Court of Appeal, over a property situated on Plot 445 Maitama, Abuja.\n\nProfessor Idris Bugaje, Executive Secretary of the Board, in a statement on Tuesday, explained that NBTE had directed its lawyers to immediately file an appeal against the judgement of the Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja that ruled in favour of Mangal over the matter.\n\nAccording to the NBTE boss, the board has been involved in an ensuing battle, in its bid to retrieve its property, situated on Plot 445 Maitama, Abuja, saying that it had hitherto been illegally occupied by Messrs. D.B. Mangal Limited.\n\nHe said, \u201cSequel to a petition submitted by our above named board, the Special Presidential Investigation Panel on the Recovery of Public Property had in 2019 declared that the property rightfully belongs to the NBTE. The Honourable Minister for Education had in 2021 granted approval, for the NBTE to recover the said property with the aid of the relevant Security agencies.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that the NBTE had accordingly engaged the services of security agencies and proceeded to recover the property on November 11, 2021.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of the board stated that the recovery efforts was thwarted by D.B. Mangal Limited and their thugs, through brazen acts of brigandage.\n\nProfessor Idris Bugaje noted that the ensuing dispute has resulted in several litigations, adding that one of which was instituted by D. B. Mangal Limited, wherein it is claiming that its fundamental human rights had been breached in the process of the NBTE trying to recover its property.\n\nHe stated that the court gave ruling on the 28th February 2022, in respect of the suit filed by D. B. Mangal Limited, stressing that the ruling of the Court was made in favour of D. B. Mangal Limited.\n\nProfessor Bugaje alleged that the Abuja Court did not rule on the ownership of the property in contention, as such, the board is filing an appeal.\n\nTo set the records straight, he said, the judgment of the court did not in any way address the issue of ownership of the property in dispute, saying that the NBTE has accordingly instructed its Lawyers, to immediately file an appeal against the ruling at the Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja.\n\nHe stressed that the beauty of the judicial system is that a party that is not satisfied with the decision of a court, can seek redress or relief from a higher court.\n\nAccording to him, it should equally be noted that the suit instituted against D.

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja and Toba Adedeji, Osogbo\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has acknowledged that the contributions of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, to Nigeria and the rest of the world stand out as the testimonies of his divine calling.\n\nOsun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola and Senate Chief Whip Orji Uzor Kalu also poured encomiums on Pastor Adeboye on his landmark birthday.\n\nA statement yesterday in Abuja by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, reads: \u201cPresident Buhari joins members of Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), the Christian community, particularly clergymen in Nigeria and abroad, in celebrating with Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye on the auspicious occasion of his 80th birthday on March 2, 2022.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari felicitates the wife, Pastor Foluke Adenike Adeboye, family members, friends and relations as the General Overseer turns an octogenarian, with clear evidences of walking the path of a righteous man by dedicating his life to the service of God, and humanity.\n\n\u201cThe President recalls his private and public meetings with the renowned preacher and teacher of the Bible over many years, most remarkably the visit when he (the President) was recuperating in London in 2017, appreciating Pastor Adeboye\u2019s warmth and friendliness, which he also extends to leaders and others from all walks of life.\n\n\u201cOn the cleric\u2019s 80th birthday, President Buhari believes his contributions to the betterment of Nigeria and other countries stand out clearly as testimonies of his divine calling, impacting greatly on education, health and infrastructural development, which include many urban and rural roads.\n\n\u201cThe President salutes the focus of the RCCG leader on works of the Kingdom and peace for the nation, praying that his path will be like a shining light, with grace for good health and strength.\u201d\n\nIn a statement in Osogbo, the state capital, Oyetola said: \u201cOver the decades, you have consistently remained energetic and untiring in your propagation and pursuit of a better society. You are a leader of immense spiritual depth and insight. You live and lead an extraordinary life.\u201d\n\nIn his message, Kalu said:\n\n\u201cLocally and internationally, Daddy G. O., as fondly called, is known for his contributions to humanity. His attributes should be emulated by leaders across the globe. Pastor Adeboye is a genuine leader in all ramifications.\u201d\n\nTinubu: you teach many to maintain complete obedience to God\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) stalwart, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has said the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has taught many people the ability to remain focused, and maintain complete obedience to God.\n\nIn a congratulatory message on the landmark birthday, Asiwaju Tinubu said: \u201cWe heartily join the children, family members, friends and associates of Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, in celebrating his glorious 80th birthday. The life of this extraordinary man of God has been one of amazing grace.\n\n\u201cPastor Adeboye is known worldwide as a gallant soldier of the cross, a formidable preacher \u2013 one that is acting under the great commission as instructed by Jesus Christ himself. It is no wonder that the Redeemed Christian Church of God is the largest Pentecostal denomination in the world with millions of members in almost all the nations in the world.\n\n\u201cOutside the pulpit, Pastor Adeboye is a towering national and global figure with enthralling cosmopolitan outlook.\n\n\u201cHe is comfortable with presidents, governors, and royalties as he is with ordinary folks on the street. Such is the magnetic force in the all-embracing personality of this man of grace who embodies all the values of Jesus Christ, who said unto us: \u2018Let all men come unto me\u2019.\n\n\u201cThrough the example of his life, Pastor Adeboye has taught many the importance and value of service, faithfulness, resilience, perseverance, the ability to remain focused, and maintain complete obedience to God. Together with his wife, Mummy G. O., who for over five decades has remained a pillar of support and worthy partner to Pastor Adeboye, the two are role models to many.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I, and our household, have gained much from our relationship with this giant of faith. We are proud of our friendship and association with Pastor Adeboye and Mummy G. O. and are grateful to them for opening their home and hearts wide to us.\n\n\u201cTheir unflinching love has been a great influence on my wife, Senator Oluremi Tinubu, who is an ordained Assistant Pastor of RCCG. When I was governor of Lagos State for eight years, Pastor Adeboye was never far from us with his wise counsel and good wishes. He accepted, without conditions, to personally conduct the Lagos State Government Annual Thanksgiving Service that debuted with my administration, which has now been institutionalised as a yearly event by my successors.\n\n\u201cDaddy G. O. is blessed to have joined the prestigious club of Octogenarians, in great health and, indeed, with a yet numerable number of grey hairs on his head.\n\n\u201cIt gladdens our hearts that at 80, Pastor Adeboye can boldly say, like Caleb in the Book of Joshua: \u2018As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.\u2019\n\n\u201cMay Pastor Adeboye continue to soar high like the eagle. As we pray to God Almighty to add more to his age and expand his ministry, Pastor Adeboye shall run and not be weary; he shall walk and not faint and Almighty God, the owner of the work He has committed to Pastor Adeboye\u2019s hands, shall renew his strength daily. Happy 80th birthday, Pastor Adeboye.\n\n\u201cWe love you, Sir.\u201d",

          "text": "Protest has greeted Anambra State governor-elect Prof Charles Soludo\u2019s online job application from members of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA).\n\nThe Nation gathered yesterday that 22,000 people have applied for the posts of commissioners, senior special assistants, among others.\n\nThe APGA members condemned the recruitment method for political appointees, describing it as strange.\n\nSoludo, the former governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), after winning the November 6, 2021 governorship election, had asked political appointees, who would want to serve in his government, to apply online.\n\nBut APGA members rejected the online method, saying Soludo did not consult them before taking such decision.\n\nSpeaking with The Nation yesterday, some APGA members, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cSoludo\u2019s online method of selecting those to work in his administration is not acceptable because it doesn\u2019t justify his preparedness to be a governor.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cit shows that he doesn\u2019t know the people much; he doesn\u2019t know the kind of people he can use to implement his manifesto and he wants people from the moon to give him ideas on what he is going to do at the Government House.\n\n\u201cDid Soludo fill online form before former President Olusegun Obasanjo gave him appointment as the Economic Adviser or as the Governor of Central Bank?\n\n\u201cSoludo shut the door against party members shortly after he was declared winner of the November 6, 2021 poll and told us that he didn\u2019t want to see anybody.\n\n\u201cAfter that, he announced his bogus transition committee. The next thing he did was to release online application form.\n\n\u201cLet me ask one question, did he secure votes that made him governor from online device?\n\n\u201cWe mobilised votes for him physically in our wards and in our local governments. So why should we express our interests to work in his government online?\n\n\u201cDuring campaigns, he was accessible to us. He didn\u2019t ask people to come in through online to vote.\u201d\n\nA media assistant to Soludo, Mr. Joe Anatune, said as at Monday, 22,000 job applications had been received.\n\nHe said the online talent hunt was a kind of data bank that would be retained by the state government to identify the sector each applicant would be employed.\n\nAnatune said: \u201cThis is not a one-off thing, but a kind of employment bank or database from which applicants are engaged, depending on the demand for such job specifications.\u201d\n\nThe National Coordinator of APGA Media Warriors Forum, Chinedu Obigwe, debunked the stories making the rounds that Soludo had abandoned APGA members in his appointment plans.\n\nHe said in a statement yesterday in Awka that the public should disregard such insinuations.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m saying it authoritatively that the report did not emanate from APGA stalwarts.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s important for me to use this medium to tell the public that Soludo is well prepared for the task of governing Ndi Anambra and he is determined to do his best for them.\n\n\u201cHe is not joking with any of his moves and nobody should take his directives for granted.\n\n\u201cThose behind the report are labouring in vain to sow a seed of discord between APGA faithful and Soludo, but they have failed already,\u201d Obigwe said.",

          "text": "By John Ofikhenua, Abuja and Muyiwa Lucas\n\nCommuters were stranded in many parts of the country yesterday as petrol scarcity bites harder.\n\nQueues remained in many city centres while fares skyrocketed.\n\nMany motorists in Abuja said they wake up as early as 4 a.m. to queue at petrol stations.\n\nSome said they could not even afford to buy from the black market.\n\nIt was learnt that some petrol stations now prefer to sell only at night.\n\nThere were queues at retail outlets in Maitama, Wuse, Gwarimpa, Wuye and Kubwa expressways.\n\nA resident, Alhaji Mamudu Aliyu, said the hardship was biting harder.\n\n\u201cThe scarcity is getting to a month and nothing has been done. At times it looks like it is getting better and the next day it gets worse,\u201d he said.\n\nA taxi driver, Malam Umar Ibrahim, said he had been at the petrol station for over four hours.\n\nIn Enugu metropolis, fares increased by over 100 per cent, leaving commuters groaning.\n\nA NAN correspondent, who monitored the development, reports that fares for short distances of about four or five stops away on commercial buses and tricycles rose from N50 to N100, while N100 fares have doubled.\n\nThe situation left many commuters, including civil servants, pupils and students trekking long distances.\n\nA bus driver plying the Garki-Polo Park route, Mr Andy Onyia, blamed the increase in fares on the fuel pump price hike.\n\nHe said they now buy petrol for between N200 and N210 per litre, adding: \u201cYou don\u2019t expect commercial bus drivers to still charge the old prices.\u201d\n\nSome cargoes of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), otherwise known as petrol, which some members of the Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN) paid for last December are yet to arrive.\n\nA member of the association said the private depots were not selling to members of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) because their stock was not sufficient to supply to outsiders.\n\nThe source, who pleaded not to be named, urged the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited to raise its petrol importation volume.\n\nThe source said: \u201cWe are selling what NNPC is giving to us. We are loading. The issue is that some of this fuel that we load today was paid for in December. It was paid for with a bank loan.\n\n\u201cThere was a projection in the bank loan. The projection was that you are to receive the product by the middle of January and pay back in January.\n\n\u201cSo, who pays for the interest between when we were supposed to have paid back and today?\u201d\n\nAnother source in the association said there was no need to sell above the official rate since their filling stations were selling the product.\n\nExplaining why the depots were not selling to IPMAN, the source said: \u201cIt makes sense if I have 100 stations to concentrate on my stations rather than selling to any other person.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t sell to them (IPMAN) and they want to blackmail me, they can say anything. I will not load and be selling to IPMAN and leave my stations dry.\u201d\n\nThe source said any member of the association selling above the pump price of N165/litre should be reported.\n\n\u201cIf you see any private station selling above N165 let me know. I will tell you it is not a DAPPMAN station.\n\n\u201cThere is no DAPPMAN station that is selling above N165/litre. So, anybody who is claiming we are selling above ex-depot, we are simply concentrating on our own stations.\n\n\u201cBut the point is that if you can drive into any petrol station between 15 minutes and buy your fuel, will you go and patronise jerry cans outside?\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is NNPC should bring the product in and all these queues and allegations will disappear.\u201d\n\nIt was learnt that a member of the association, who paid for two cargoes of petrol, only received one.\n\nNNPC Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Malam Garba Deen Muhammad, did not pick up his call.\n\nHe also did not respond to a text message asking him to confirm whether DAPPMAN members were yet to receive the petrol they paid for since December.\n\nThe Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) said its members would not lift products for depot owners selling petrol above the official depot price of N148.77.\n\nNUPENG\u2019s Secretary General, Mr Afolabi Olawale, told NAN: \u201cOne of the lines of action we are going to take is any depot that is not selling at the official rate, our members will not carry their products.\u201d\n\nThe union on February 26, issued a 24-hour ultimatum to marketers to revert to the official rate of N148.77.\n\nIt had accused the marketers of exploiting Nigerians by selling PMS from the depots at prices far above the official rate.\n\nOlawale said: \u201cDepot owners are not the ones directly importing the products and are taking products from NNPC.\n\n\u201cNobody has given official statements that PMS is no longer under subsidy regime and in that wise, the general public cannot be buying products at N250, N220, N180, from the depot.\n\n\u201cWe are asking all these depot owners to stop exploiting the general public and sell at official rate.\u201d\n\nExecutive Secretary, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), Clement Isong, urged Nigerians to stop buying more petrol than they need.\n\nHe said: \u201cNNPC says they are giving us more supplies than they used to; we (MOMAN) are supplying to our stations more than we used to and my members tell me they are selling at the pumps more than they used to sell.\n\n\u201cSo the answer to the continued scarcity is that customers are buying more than they usually buy. There is a panic buying of petrol,\u201d Isong said.\n\nNigerians have been spending hours on queues since Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) announced on February 8 that methanol above Nigeria\u2019s specification was discovered in a limited quantity of petrol in the supply chain.\n\nMany Nigerians had expected the negligent or incompetent officials to have been suspended or sanctioned by now for allowing toxic petrol into the supply chain, but there have been no consequences.\n\nSome believe if something similar had happened in other climes, culpable officials or agents would have been identified, made to resign or at least been queried.\n\nSo far, there is no indication that anyone has been held to account for a situation that subjected millions of Nigeria.",

Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\n\u2018Why I said that the 2020 December agreement we had with ASUU is on course in terms of implementation, is that in that agreement, there is a line that says the federal government should pay N40 billion for (Earned Academic Allowances (EAA) for ASUU and other unions, that has been paid,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018N30 billion was also budgeted or was to be paid for revitalisation that also was paid late last year. N22.127 billion was agreed also in that December agreement, to be paid from the supplementary budget as Earned Allowances for 2021, that money was also paid last year; it was put in the supplementary budget which was passed around June-July and the money was remitted. So, the government has done that.\u2019\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

But ASUU has written back to NITDA to say that some of those observations were not correct,\u2019 he said.\n\nNgige said arrangements have now been concluded for the technical teams of NITDA and ASUU to meet and jointly conduct or repeat the test on the UTAS platform, so as to find a solution to the impasse.\n\nUniversity lecturers in Nigeria have been on a warning strike since February 14, to press home their demands, one of which is for government to accept UTAS as the platform for payment of their salaries but the government prefers to use the IPPIS platform, currently being used for the payment of salaries of all public workers.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari outrightly rejected governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) request for him to change his mind on his preference for Senator Abdullahi Adamu as the consensus candidate for the national chairmanship.\n\nA source who was present at the meeting Tuesday with the President at the presidential villa, Abuja shortly before he left for Kenya, confirmed the development.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nThe President was said to have bluntly refused to shift ground when the governors advanced their reasons against the serving senator representing Nasarawa West Senatorial District becoming the national chairman.\n\nMeanwhile, the governors have insisted that the national convention scheduled for March 26 in Abuja will hold despite the tight time frame provided by the timetable of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) released for next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nThe chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, gave this assurance after he led governors of the party to meet with President Buhari.\n\nThe chairman of the APC Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, (CECPC) and Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, was however absent at the meeting.\n\nThere had been speculation that a section of the party was pushing for the postponement of the national convention so that both the election of the national executives and the primaries to select its candidates for the 2023 elections can be done simultaneously.\n\nBut fielding questions from State House Correspondents, Bagudu assured that the party will maintain the March date for the exercise.\n\nHe said the governors met with the president to congratulate him for signing the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2022 as well on the victory of the APC in some of the by-elections conducted over the weekend.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nOn INEC timetable for next year\u2019s election and reports that some APC governors are moving for the postponement of the planned National Convention so that everything can be done together, Bagudu said: \u2018Last week, we were in this hall, about 20 APC governors, and this question came up and we clearly said we came to discuss the National Convention, which is slated for March 26 and are working hard to ensure that on March 26, we have our convention and elect our national officers and that remains the case.\u2019\n\nAsked how united the APC governors are, as feelers from the meeting show that there was an altercation, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s no altercation, I\u2019m not aware of any. Mallam Nasiru (El-Rufai), again last week, answered that look, if by altercation people are talking about differences of opinion before a decision is arrived at, then maybe, that is what people can\u2026 but as a body, the 22 governors of APC are united behind the party and behind Mr President.\n\nSpeaking on the purpose of the visit, Bagudu said: \u2018Today, Tuesday, 1st of March, a number of APC governors came to Mr President to, among others, congratulate him on signing the Electoral Act. This is something many Nigerians have expressed different views about, but Mr President had once again taken the courageous step of, even while having observations, signed and requested the National Assembly to look at it.\n\n\u2018So, we congratulate the National Assembly for passage of the amendments and equally congratulate Mr President for signing the amendment.\n\n\u2018Secondly, our party, the All Progressives Congress, participated in a number of by-elections over the last weekend and equally, we congratulated Mr President and in addition, we spoke about other issues that concern our party.\u2019\n\nOn reports in some quarters that governors are still not satisfied with the provisions of the Act, the Kebbi Governor said: \u2018I\u2019ve always had cause to address this. Legislation, everywhere in the world, is based on continuous improvement. Constitutions that are 200 years old are subject to reviews sometimes and those reviews are not cut and dry. Even people who truly believe in the need for legislation may have to worry about the implications of it.\n\n\u2018Like I said, we\u2019re never against the principle of amending laws. They are never against the National Assembly, but even among the National Assembly, there\u2019s debate and this debate is also in the \u2026 To imagine that there is some legislation that is punitive to the governors or to the National Assembly. I think that will be tantamount to negation of the Oath of Office, if whoever is participating in doing that.\u2019\n\nApart from Bagudu, other APC governors at the meeting included Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Aminu Masari (Katsina), Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Abubakar Badaru (Jigawa), Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Hope Uzodinma (Imo), Gboyega Oyetola (Osun), Dapo Abiodun (Ogun), Sani Bello (Niger), Umar Ganduje (Kano), and outing deputy governor of Anambra State, Nkem Okeke.",

          "title": "Resilient Zenith Bank Beats Market Expectations with Double-digit Growth in Gross Earnings in 2021",
          "text": "Kayode Tokede\n\nZenith Bank Plc has announced an impressive result for the year ended December 31, 2021 as it recorded a double-digit growth of 10 per cent in gross earnings which rose to N765.6 billion from N696.5 billion reported in the previous year.\n\nThis was despite a challenging macroeconomic environment aggravated by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nAccording to the bank\u2019s audited financial results for the 2021 financial year presented to the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX), the Group achieved 10 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in gross earnings on the back of 23 per cent YoY growth in non-interest income from N251.7 billion to N309 billion and a two per cent YoY growth in interest income from N420.8 billion to N427.6 billion.\n\nAlso, Zenith Bank\u2019s profit before tax (PBT) grew by 10 per cent from N255.9 billion to N280.4 billion in the current year under review. The increase in PBT was due to growth in the bank\u2019s top-line and very strong management of the treasury portfolio that increased efficiency, resulting in a drop in interest expense by 12 per cent from N121.1 billion in 2020 to N106.8 billion in the year under review.\n\nThis further led to a seven per cent increase in net interest income of N320.8 billion in 2021, from N299.7 billion in 2020.\n\nIts customer deposits increased by 21 per cent, growing from N5.34 trillion in the previous year to N6.47 trillion in 2021.\n\nThe growth in customer deposits came from both corporate and retail customers. For instance, while retail deposits grew by N146 billion from N1.72 trillion in 2020 to N1.87 trillion in 2021.\n\nThe Group\u2019s continuous drive for retail deposits combined with the strategic rebalancing of its funding base helped to reduce the cost of funding from 2.1 per cent to 1.5 per cent in the current year.\n\nAlthough operating expenses grew by 13 per cent YoY, growth remained below the inflation rate, and the Group improved its Earnings per Share (EPS) which grew by six per cent from N7.34 to N7.78.\n\nZenith Bank\u2019s total assets also increased by 11 per cent, growing from N8.48 trillion in 2020 to N9.45 trillion in 2021, mainly driven by growth in customer deposits. With the steady recovery in economic activities, the Group prudently grew its gross loans by 20 per cent, from N2.9 trillion in 2020 to N3.5 trillion in 2021, with moderated non-performing loan (NPL) ratio from 4.29 per cent to 4.19 per cent YoY.\n\nFurthermore, the Group recorded impressive liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of 71.6 per cent and 21 per cent, which remained above regulatory thresholds of 30 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.\n\nIn 2022, the Group intends to consolidate on the gains achieved in the previous year in all business segments and combine leadership in the industry, innovation and technology to drive improved performance and deliver enhanced returns to all stakeholders.\n\nAs a testament to its commitment to its shareholders, the bank has announced a proposed final dividend pay-out of N2.80 per share, bringing the total dividend to N3.10 per share.\n\nZenith Bank has continued to distinguish itself in the Nigerian financial services industry through superior service offerings, unique customer experience and sound financial indices. The bank remains a clear leader in the digital space with several firsts in deploying innovative products, solutions and an assortment of alternative channels that ensure convenience, speed and safety of transactions.\n\nIn recognition of its track record of excellent performance, Zenith Bank was voted as Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021, Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards 2020 and 2021, Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, and Best in Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2020 and 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom. Also, the bank emerged as the Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2020 and 2021, Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital in the \u201c2021 Top 1000 World Banks\u201d Ranking by The Banker Magazine and the Retail Bank of the year at the BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Awards 2020 and 2021.\n\nSimilarly, Zenith Bank was honoured as Bank of the Decade (People\u2019s Choice) at the THISDAY Awards 2020 and emerged winner in four categories at the Sustainability, Enterprise, and Responsibility (SERAS) Awards 2021, carting home the awards for \u201cBest Company in Reporting and Transparency\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Infrastructure Development\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Gender Equality and Women Empowerment\u201d, and the coveted \u201cMost Responsible Organisation in Africa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Over 230 pro-women groups, under the aegis of Women of Nigeria, have condemned the National Assembly for voting against proposed gender bills on Tuesday, saying the lawmakers denied women the opportunity of inclusion and representation in governance.\n\nThe groups have, therefore, demanded that all rejected gender bills should be reconsidered, saying they will storm the National Assembly on Wednesday to seek an audience with the lawmakers.\n\n\u201cNigerian women demand an emergency meeting with the leadership of the National Assembly to discuss these provisions. We will be there at 8 am, tomorrow, Wednesday, March 2nd,\u201d the groups have said.\n\nSpeaking at a virtual press conference on Tuesday evening, Dr Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, Executive Director at Ward-C, who spoke for the groups, which are signatories to the statement, said Nigerian women were disappointed by the actions of the lawmakers.\n\nShe said, \u201cNigerian women, therefore, demand that all gender Bills be reconsidered. Ultimately, our demands will benefit not just women but Nigeria as a whole.\n\n\u201cMore women in governance will only bring progress, and respect for Nigeria in the committee of nations. We cannot, in 2022, be negotiating the rights of women and the sanctity of the dignity of girls. We call on the National Assembly to represent these Bills as a matter of urgency and ensure that they are passed.\u201d\n\nThe groups also said they were \u201cdisappointed and aggrieved at the actions of the 9th National Assembly (NASS) today, Tuesday, March 1, 2022, when they denied women the opportunity of inclusion and representation in governance by voting against the gender bills\u201d.\n\nThe statement further read, \u201cThe NASS has spoken loud and clear that they do not want progress for society: for mothers, aunties, sisters, wives, and for daughters.\n\n\u201cIt is particularly sad that in a month globally dedicated to celebrating women worldwide, our NASS has chosen to deny women basic human rights particularly, the right to identity and belonging.\n\n\u201cThe proposed gender bills in the 5th Constitution Alteration Bills that were all rejected are Bills targeted at addressing the current gender imbalance across the legislative arm of governments across the country whilst reducing the under-representation of women in political office.\n\nThe men of the 9th NASS have reinforced the discrimination and political bias against women as enshrined in the 1999 constitution by 1. Denying citizenship to a foreign-born husband of a Nigerian woman. (While it allows Nigerian men's foreign-born wives to be awarded automatic citizenship), 2. Denying Nigerian women indigeneity through marriage, 3. Denying 35% appointed positions for women and settling for 20%., 4. Denying women affirmative action in party administration and leadership, 5. Denying specific seats for women in the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nAccording to the groups, the federal lawmakers, \u201cby their actions have taken us backwards\u201d.\n\n\u201cTheir actions undermine the importance and relevance of women\u2019s contribution to the governance of Nigeria including the key role women play to bring victory to political parties in elections at all levels across the country. They also voted against diaspora voting,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe groups involved include 9jafeminista, Abiodun Essiet Initiative for Girls, Action Aid Nigeria, Above Whispers Foundation, ACTS Generation GBV, Amnesty International Nigeria, ARDA Development Communication Inc., Arise Nigerian Woman Foundation, FIDA Nigeria, First Future Leadership, FOMWAN, Forward in Action for Education, Poverty and Malnutrition (FACE-PAM), Women Advocacy, HIV Prevention and Other Diseases (WAHPOD), Women Advocates Research and Documentation Center (WARDC), Women Aid Collective (WACOL), Women and Youth Empowerment for Advancement and Health Initiative, Women Youth and Children Upliftment Foundation (WYCUT), Women Consortium of Nigeria (WOCON), Women education advocacy and development Initiatives (WEADI), and Women Empowerment and Initiative Development.",

That has been paid,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cN30 billion was also budgeted or was to be paid for revitalisation. That also was paid late last year.\n\n\u201cN22.127 billion was agreed also in that December agreement, to be paid from the supplementary budget as earned allowances for 2021. That money was also paid last year; it was put in the supplementary budget which was passed around June-July and the money was remitted. So, the government has done that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the controversy surrounding the adoption of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) payment platform as preferred by university lecturers, instead of the government\u2019s Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS), is being considered.\n\n\u201cUTAS, which the universities developed, has been subjected to test by the body responsible for that, Nigeria Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), which ran a user acceptance test, also called integrity and vulnerability test. But in their report, they pointed out to ASUU the areas of lapses in that platform, which will not make it usable as presently configured. But ASUU has written back to NITDA to say that some of those observations were not correct,\u201d he said.\n\nNgige said arrangements have been concluded for the technical teams of NITDA and ASUU to meet and jointly conduct tests on the UTAS platform so as to find a solution to the impasse.",

          "title": "Development finance institutions are looking to Africa\u2019s digital frontier for impact and returns",
          "text": "Development finance institutions have long funded traditional finance and infrastructure projects in Africa; now they\u2019re increasingly backing Africa\u2019s digital future. What will this mean for the continent?\n\nOn the about page of the UK government\u2019s overseas investment arm, the CDC Group declares its goal to be \u201cdo good without losing money\u201d. That may well be the universal motto of its counterparts like Proparco, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) or any of the many institutions that recently jointly committed to investing $80 billion in African businesses over the next 5 years.\n\nIn theory, these \u201cImpact-first\u201d funds typically focus on how to move the development needle when they invest. This is even more true in Africa, where both development and the capital it needs are sorely lacking. However, what is arguably more important than how much capital is available is how the capital is allocated. Now that development finance institutions (DFIs), which represent the bulk of available capital in Africa, are looking to technology startups to support development goals and find returns, players in that ecosystem, and Africa in general, need to step up the thinking and conversations that should shape the future of Africa\u2019s digital economy.\n\nDFI interests and money are not new\n\nTo be clear, DFIs are not new in Africa. They have been here, at least since the Colonial Development Corporation was set up by the UK\u2019s Overseas Resources Development Act in 1948. That Colonial Development Corporation became the Commonwealth Development Corporation Group (CDC Group) and will become British International Investment (BII) later this year. Both the CDC Group and peers like Proparco, FMO, and others have been active in Africa for decades. What is interesting is the role they play in funding technology startups and funds in Africa. They are, after all, impact investors, and asking how much impact potential they see in Africa\u2019s insurgent tech startups is a legitimate question.\n\nAt a surface level, the implication of more capital from DFIs going to African VC funds or technology businesses is clear. It means capital for experiments and growth will probably be less of a headache. This can mean a variety of things, depending on how it is executed and engaged with by relevant stakeholders. For example, it can mean growth stage capital is here, that is if DFIs, which are notoriously slow and bureaucratic, can fix their processes. It can mean more opportunities unlocked as DFI money de-risks investment in high risk but critical business models. In short, it can mean everything that better access to capital brings plus development impact.\n\nAfrica\u2019s telecoms infrastructure, the backbone of its digital growth today, is an example of DFI money doing good while making returns. Image source: Wikimedia\n\nBut it can also mean DFIs\u2019s public money competing with private investors over the best (or less risky) deals, and there is some ugly history that makes this scenario, wild as it may seem plausible. It can mean that we are deepening our vulnerability to public money that is itself vulnerable to political currents, especially foreign public money. Of course, the reality is that we lack significant options and, on the balance, this is a much better deal than where we are coming from.\n\nSo, why are we seeing this interest and influx of capital backing the funds that invest in African startups, and in some cases, directly backing startups? Ido Sum, a partner at TLcom Capital thinks this activity is happening because individual pioneers in development finance institutions \u201csaw the potential and ignited internal processes in their respective institutions to consider VC as an impactful and material asset class.\u201d\n\nThat makes sense. DFIs have been active on the continent for decades. Mo Ibrahim\u2019s Celtel, (later acquired by Bharti Airtel) is a good example of how DFI activity supported the development of Africa\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure. That first-mover advantage or least \u201cactively-prospecting\u201d advantage in growth markets can enable them to see and take advantage of opportunities early on. Sum agrees. He says that \u201c[DFIs] were able to see the changes in dynamics and in the creation of a new generation of startup companies through working with early managers on the continent like ourselves [TLcom Capital] and others.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cAfter supporting the establishment of the African PE industry, with the help of some entrepreneurial team like ourselves, several DFIs decided in late 2015 to try and support the establishment of a local VC industry on the continent\u2014that hardly existed before. With EIB and AfDB being the pioneers, and Proparco, BIO, IFC and CDC following shortly after.\u201d\n\nFollowing this first foray into backing \u201cfund of funds,\u201d TLcom Capital, for instance, became the first institutionally backed commercial VC in Africa, when it closed $40 million for its TIDE Africa Fund in 2017. Since then, DFI money backing VC funds have only gone up, and in some cases, they have invested directly into ventures.\n\nThis is a long-winded way of saying more money than ever is coming into African startups because DFIs judge technology businesses to be a good way to deliver their impact mandates and make handsome returns\u2014or at least, not lose too much in a market as immature as Africa.\n\nDo we need DFI money?\n\nYes, in short, and more specifically, yes because the capital that Africa needs to develop her economies is in short supply. When DFIs invest in emerging markets for example, their investments should ideally skew towards the more difficult or riskier businesses that private investors almost automatically avoid. In other words, DFI money is welcome because it can enable founders to take on tough problems. Tough problems and sometimes obstinate legacy monopolies that thrive on maintaining friction need tough money to break through seed-stage business. That type of growth capital needs to be substantial. \u201cToday, a fund can raise capital up to say $50 million from family offices and high-net-worth individuals. [But] larger funds still require DFIs, almost without exception,\u201d says David van Dijk, investment advisor and co-founder of African Business Angel Network.\n\nThere is some indication that local limited partners (LPs) are stepping up. For the first close of TLcom Capital\u2019s $150 million fund, FBQuest, and Sango Capital committed additional funds, doubling down on their earlier commitments to TLcom Capital. However, traditional sources of capital for funds investing in African companies remain locked out. As long as the doors of pension funds, insurance companies, or university endowments remain closed, DFIs will continue to play a strong role in financing what you might call Africa\u2019s future. It\u2019s not what can be. It is what is.\n\nThat does not mean DFIs are going it alone. Far from it. A number of DFIs explicitly make it a part of their mandate to \u201cinspire\u201d third-party capital to come alongside them. This co-investment strategy rests on the back of the fact that the public component of DFI money is, in theory, willing to shoulder a greater share of the risk. The Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO, for example, leverages a first-loss guarantee to encourage private investors to co-invest alongside. This de-risked investment\u2014the near-technical name for how DFIs/MFBs enable private investor partners to put up money\u2014is lacking or insufficient in Africa.\n\nAn obligatory note here on \u201cde-risked capital\u201d from impact funds. Nimrod Zalk, Industrial Development Advisor in the Office of the Director-General of the South African Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, notes that it is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance principles\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\n\nThere is a cost for over dependence on DFIs\n\nEverything has a price, even capital, and sometimes we will only truly know how much after the fact. That said, the biggest obvious risk of overly depending on DFI funding to build Africa\u2019s nascent technology businesses is ownership. Not just equity ownership, but ownership of the direction, the data and the results that technology can create for Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear if the much-talked-about \u201cblended finance\u201d de-risk projects to enable development, or if they simply de-risk investor returns through complex financial engineering, regardless of impact outcomes.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Nimrod Zalk, Advisor, South African Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to celebrate the latest fundraise from startup X. Almost everyone agrees that building an impactful and profitable business is difficult, but there is surprisingly little conversation around what building a truly Africa-led ecosystem that is both sustainable and economically viable means.\n\nAlso because DFIs especially foreign DFIs or multilateral financial institutions (MFBs) are run from offices geographically distant from where their target investments are located, the question of competent allocation remains. There is also the small matter of how little data is available and how much less is shared. The result? Everyone operates in self-contained silos from London, Paris, or Amsterdam, or even (looking at you AfDB) Abidjan. \u201cHow are you able to invest in these companies if you\u2019re not on the ground?\u201d asks David van Dijk, himself a seasoned investor.\n\nWhere leadership is lacking, impact is a fairytale.\n\nBeing African-led does not refer to a nominal leadership. Instead it means a system that is driven by targeted investments and solutions in the most pressing problem areas in Africa. In a perfect world, DFI and MFB activity in Africa\u2019s fairly young venture space should be led (not nominally) by African development finance institutions. In the real world of today, however, these organisations do not even have sufficient capital to lead the original impact mandates for which they were created.\n\nWho will own Africa\u2019s digital future? Image source: Olumide Bamgbelu/Unsplash\n\n\u201cA lot of African countries have a challenging fiscal environment. The governments cannot finance their development banks. This is where the big multilateral development banks can help,\u201d says Zalk. He adds that national development banks in Africa are themselves plagued by a myriad of issues that affect their performance. \u201cThere are issues around governance. They have made bad loans and bad investments in the past that might have been driven by corruption or lack of technical know-how.\u201d All of this combines to lock out the type of capital scale that is needed to say nothing of directing these funds towards something as alien as venture capital. To unlock and direct capital better, Zalk suggests that national development institutions in Africa should be consolidated. That should help these institutions gain more financial clout and firepower to direct African technology to the areas of greatest need.\n\nFor example, Zalk who is also a non-executive director on the board of the South African Industrial Development Corporation is unconvinced about the hype around service-based technology. \u201cA lot of attention has been focused on things like payment based systems like M-pesa and shopping on ecommerce stores. I believe what is being missed out is [the opportunity] to industrialise,\u201d he argues, \u201cHistorically, manufacturing is one of those places where countries have been able to adapt technology for development.\u201d He believes that the convention of discouraging local production over imports is faulty, \u201cOver the last few decades, there has been discouragement from conventional policy advice about building local production systems, and a view that you can always import the things you need. But the COVID crisis points to the need to change the structure of African economies. It is no longer sufficient to export primary and semi-processed commodities, we must find ways to add much more local value, and construct more sophisticated production structures.\u201d\n\nRather than directing \u201cimpact money\u201d to the latest shiny software technology, Zalk believes that investing in agricultural research and 21-century relevant education for example, are more important. That \u201cindustrialisation over software\u201d argument is one that is very nuanced and nationally disparate. Africa is, after all, not one country or even a functioning union of countries. What one country needs may not necessarily be what the other will need. The point again is that by passively accepting that \u201cDFIs bring the money\u201d, we unconsciously give up the more subtle type of ownership in how what is being built is built.\n\nNo one disputes today that Africa needs and welcomes DFI money. We simply do not have, or have not unlocked, enough capital from here, and there are a myriad of issues why. But, we are beginning to see local players step up, especially in MENA and South Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is a missing \u2018key\u2019\n\n\u2018Knowledge yield\u2019 is my fancy term for how much knowledge return on investment (KROI) an investment brings. It is basically asking alongside any investment update, \u2018What is my money teaching me?\u2019\n\nWhere money comes from is not as relevant as what it teaches. Within some contexts, capital conveys information. So, beyond simply looking at impact metrics and returns, it is important to ask what businesses that have received investments teach in the short to medium term about the African consumer and market landscape. This is a big conversation, not just something for the stage, but something that should intimately concern every person invested in the future of Africa.\n\nKnowledge yield is not obvious on balance sheets as traditional returns on investment typically are. It is the result of deliberately seeking non-intuitive market data to judge assumptions and verify claims because capital in itself, is a zombie. Instead of simply fighting to have a piece of the DFI pie, companies, governments and even private investors can redirect their energy towards learning from the data yield of past and current investment, building better data systems so that they can more artfully distribute capital.\n\nYes, Africa still clearly needs the so-called patient capital from DFIs. We also need to learn how lead that capital, to transform the continent.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Payroll tech heats up in Africa, on the heels of a booming fintech sector",
          "text": "Across Africa, innovation in the fintech space is at an all-time high as consumers increasingly rely on mobile financial services, startups roll out newer digital finance solutions, and venture capital investors incrementally back founders playing in this landscape.\n\nLast year, fintechs accounted for nearly $3 billion, or two-thirds of all the investment secured by African startups, per a report by markets insights firm Briter Bridges. That\u2019s more than double the $1.35 billion raised by fintechs in 2020 and three times the amount secured in 2019.\n\nAmid the fintech boom, new frontiers are being explored by African entrepreneurs in the sector, one of which is payroll and corporate benefits management. In this sub-segment, a number of startups have sprung up\u2014each with similar but distinct business models\u2014looking to tap into the human resources management (HRM) market on the continent that\u2019s historically relied on analog back-office processes.\n\nTraditional payroll payment processes typically take three or more days to fulfil. But it\u2019s possible to reduce this process to minutes by deploying new payment methods being championed by tech startups. Through web portals or mobile self-service apps, companies can track time, process a locally compliant payroll, and pay their employees.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOne of the most notable players in this market is Bento Africa, a Nigerian startup founded in 2019, whose cloud-based solutions help African businesses automate the disbursement of salaries and other statutory remittances, including taxes and pension.\n\nThe company currently serves over 900 active Nigerian businesses across sectors, Bento co-founder and CEO Ebun Okubanjo told TechCabal in an interview. Last December, the startup announced an expansion to Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, and plans to set up operations in six other markets in Africa by the end of this year.\n\nThat announcement came a month after YC-backed Workpay, a Nairobi-based startup that also plays in the payroll and HR management space, expanded in the other direction aiming to tap small and medium-sized businesses in West Africa.\n\nFounded in 2019, Workpay allows SMEs to easily manage and pay their employees from anywhere in Africa, and in a marked difference from Bento\u2019s offerings, Workpay makes it possible for companies with remote teams to pay in 15 currencies across the continent as well as hire in Africa legally without the need to set up a local entity.\n\nWorkpay claims its platform currently supports 400 businesses and counts among its clients Flutterwave, Paystack, and Yoco. As of November 2021, the company processed $2.5 million in monthly payroll disbursements to banks and mobile wallets.\n\nA snapshot of the Bento Africa website. Image credit: Bento.\n\nFrom payroll to employee benefits\n\nBroader ecosystems are being created around the payroll fintech space in Africa, with startups doing much more than process paychecks and offering complementary benefits, including salary advances, loans, pension, health, and insurance covers.\n\nBento, for instance, leverages its payroll data to provide tailored credit solutions to employees on its platform. Okubanjo told TechCabal that the startup offers better rates than traditional retail lenders and disbursement is done in minutes, leveraging its proprietary credit engine built in partnership with Tarya, Israel\u2019s largest P2P lending firm.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s where the opportunity lies as the credit culture is only just beginning to take root in Africa,\u201d the CEO said. Bento has partnerships with 5 banks, 2 of which power its loans. According to Okubanjo, the startup has processed up to \u20a61 billion ($2.4 million) in loans since its launch, offered at flexible interest rates (between 2-5% per month), and with a default rate of around 1%.\n\nBento\u2019s goal is to \u201credefine the intersection of work and life and transform the way people earn, spend and borrow on the continent.\u201d To achieve this, it plans to start offering employees on its platform access to other third-party products and services, such as unemployment insurance, savings, and investments, all of which come at no cost to their employers.\n\nZuberi is a Ghana-based earned wage access platform. Image source: Zuberi.\n\nMore recently, a fast-emerging category in the payroll fintech space is earned wage access (EWA) platforms. Fintechs in this subcategory\u2014such as Nigeria\u2019s Earnipay and Ghana-based Zuberi Pay\u2014partner with employers and financing companies to give employees flexible access to earned wages.\n\nSalaried workers in need of quick cash between paydays have historically relied on borrowing from payday lenders, taking bank loans, or applying for salary advances. But these often come with exploitative interest rates, and the latter can plunge an employee into debt.\n\nUK-born Julian Owusu founded Zuberi in 2020, a couple of years after he returned to Ghana as a footballer, and saw how his colleagues, in need of urgent money before payday, would borrow from loan sharks at interest rates as high as 50-60%.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t really care because the pressure was on them and they just needed money today,\u201d Owusu recalled in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThat\u2019s how I experienced the problem firsthand but it took a few years after I\u2019d stopped playing football and became a product manager that I moved to solve this problem.\u201d\n\nUsed by over 300 medium-to-large-sized businesses, Zuberi is an on-demand mobile employee benefits platform whose core product is a salary streaming feature that allows workers to access a part of their salary daily after they have worked. So rather than waiting till the end of the month, employees have the opportunity to withdraw their pay on-demand.\n\n\u201cPersonal cash flow is too slow for somebody living in such a volatile market as Africa,\u201d Owusu said. \u201cThere are so many unplanned events that completely throw people off any type of financial plan they have at the start of a month.\u201d While the Zuberi service is free for organisations, the platform charges employees a transaction fee every time they use the app to access their salary early.\n\nSnapshots of mobile platform Zuberi. Image credit: TechCabal.\n\nIn an earlier interview with TechCabal, Earnipay co-founder and COO Busayo Oyetunji explained that the app allows employees to withdraw up to 50% of their daily accrued salary as earned at the time of access, at any time of the month.\n\nAt the end of the month, the employer deducts the amount withdrawn from their salary, refunds Earnipay, then pays the employee the balance. Earnipay makes money from transaction fees, which are grouped in tiers. Withdrawing \u20a65,000-\u20a610,000 ($12-$24) attracts a fee of \u20a6500 ($1.21), and withdrawing \u20a610,001-\u20a650,000 ($24.11-$120) attracts a \u20a61,000 ($2.41) fee.\n\nEarnipay currently serves over 22 businesses with close to 5,000 employees, including outsourcing firms and HR solution providers in Nigeria. Some of its clients include Eden Life and Thrive Agric, whose \u201cthousands of employees\u201d have used the app to access their salary over 1,000 times, according to company figures.\n\nIn addition to offering employees an interest-free mobile alternative to digital loans, the plan for Zuberi, according to Owusu, is to be an all-in-one platform \u201chosting a suite of products that allows African workers gain access to various benefits that impact their lives instantly.\u201d\n\nGaining investors\u2019 attention\n\nAs with almost all sub-sectors in fintech, payroll-focused startups have attracted notable venture capital funding in recent years.\n\nIn August 2020, Workpay received $2.1 million in seed funding to accelerate expansion to other markets, beginning with Nigeria. The funding was led by Kepple Africa Ventures\u2014which previously invested $100,000 in the startup in 2019\u2014with participation from Y Combinator and several VC and angel investors. The startup also got equity-free funding from Google. At the time, WorkPay was processing payrolls for more than 25,000 employees in Kenya and had more than 300 small and medium businesses on its platform.\n\nIn January, SeamlessHR, a Nigeria-based company that offers HR and payroll software closed a $10 million Series A funding round, led by pan-African VC firm TLcom Capital, for its next phase of growth and regional expansion. The company\u2019s eponymous product is a cloud-based, end-to-end HR software that helps businesses manage and streamline their entire human resource processes and workflow. Its product suite includes management systems including payroll.\n\nEarlier this month, Earnipay announced a $4 million seed financing round led by early-stage venture capital firm Canaan. YC-backed South African wage access startup FloatPays, which plans to expand across the continent, also recently grabbed $1 million in funding from Naspers Foundry, topping up the $4 million round it announced in January.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why investors are backing payroll fintechs or broadly tech startups digitising the administrative stack for companies. For one, the appetite for cloud computing solutions by organisations is growing in Africa. From an estimated market size of $14.2 billion in 2021, the Middle East and Africa\u2019s cloud computing industry is expected to grow to $31.4 billion by 2026.\n\nBrendan Dickinson, general partner at Canaan, said the VC firm has seen earned wage access grow rapidly in many markets and believes it\u2019s \u201ca natural fit\u201d in Africa while explaining the rationale behind backing Earnipay.\n\nHowever, the size and readiness of the African economy for software services is relatively small and nascent compared to a market like the United States. \u201cIf we were an American company, we\u2019d probably be doing 6x growth for the efforts we put in because the economy is bigger,\u201d SeamlessHR CEO Emmanuel Okeleji told TechCabal during the company\u2019s fundraising announcement.\n\nFor EWA fintechs looking to enhance the financial well-being of employees, some of the threats inherent in loan-taking and salary advances may come up. Earnipay founder and CEO Nonso Onwuzulike noted that an earner unable to manage their personal finances may unnecessarily dip into their salary before payday, and still struggle to control their finances.\n\nZuberi\u2019s Owusu added that it\u2019s crucial to bring onboard companies that are committed to paying salaries on time in order to run a successful flexible salary fintech. And to increase chances of repayment, Bento Africa requires employees that apply for its loans to take unemployment and health insurance covers.\n\nThese are some of the challenges that payroll and employee benefits platforms in Africa have to grapple with as they build and scale. Nonetheless, the emerging tech sub-sector is surely one to keep tabs on as Africa\u2019s broader fintech space continues to thrive.\n\nAlso, as financial wellness gains precedence across organisations, these fintechs are well-poised to serve a generation of a financially literate and tech-savvy workforce. And for employers, offering EWA as part of a robust HR benefits package through startups is an opportunity to provide a high-value benefit for a relatively low cost.\n\n\u201cIt can demonstrate a company\u2019s commitment to the wellbeing of its workforce, helping employers stand out from the crowd in the competition for talent and talent retention,\u201d Earnipay\u2019s Onwuzulike added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Ex-Techpoint and TechCabal Editor, Victor Ekwealor\u2019s life as a creative, growth expert, and tech entrepreneur",
          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s The Experts series, a bi-weekly where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, and how they became successful in the industry. to get email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the expression, \u201che has worn many hats,\u201d were to take human form, the result would probably be Victor Ekwealor. He has tried his hands at so many things that I wonder if he set out to discover as much as possible or he is simply restless by nature.\n\nMany successful entrepreneurs pass through this phase, but does an award-winning creative fit into this box? I was curious about his journey to becoming a tech entrepreneur, product strategist, and growth expert.\n\nUntil recently, Victor was quick to shrug off the entrepreneur tag. For the better part of his career, he has been a content writer, journalist, editor, and growth specialist, helping startups refine their processes by leveraging his numerous skills. But at some point, he decided to explore a new phase of building a product.\n\nI met Victor for a chat on a cool morning. After exchanging pleasantries, we settled down to talk, which was pretty easy because I enjoy talking, and he is a great listener. But I knew this already from our time together at Techpoint Africa when he was a senior editor. But we\u2019ll get there soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat would a conversation with Victor be without context? It\u2019s the Victoresque way of doing things; he almost always provides context when he speaks or writes. So I was not shocked when he answered my question about why he had to try out many things.\n\nVictor explained how he constantly sees a need to tap into his creative mind even if he doesn\u2019t succeed in everything he sets out to do.\n\n\u201cI am a creative, and I solve problems. The problems I find interest in most times are problems I am passionate about, and as I get older, there are more rewarding problems.\u201d\n\nI gave him a knowing look. We shared a laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis public profile hardly reflects the early phase of his life, but he considers it all a part of the thread woven together to get the rich tapestry that is his life today.\n\nAnd because there\u2019s been so much to do, he admits that it\u2019s a task to sometimes define who he is without going with the convenient response of a recently occupied role.\n\nA foundation of building confidence\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an interesting life. I\u2019ve lived multiple lives. I\u2019ve done everything legal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Ekwealor\n\nVictor believes a lack of confidence limits creativity, and he is nothing if not confident. He found expression early in life because he could try out his craft in many things growing up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApart from having liberal parents, Victor grew up consuming a lot of books. And this formed the foundation for his exploits in creative writing, storytelling, logic, narration, and informed thought processes.\n\nHe was a professional model, actor, and athlete. He has also dabbled into acting, music, teaching, cooking, and real estate. Whether he perfected any of these crafts is another discussion altogether.\n\nInterestingly, a cursory look at Victor\u2019s LinkedIn profile only reflects a few of his exploits in tech.\n\n\u201cWhen I got into tech, all the things I\u2019ve done gave me context to be a generalist because I have a lot of transferable skills.\u201d\n\nIf there was a light-bulb moment in Victor\u2019s life, it was getting into tech and discovering the potential of working with startups in the innovative space.\n\nFirst stop: Media tech\n\n\u201cThe thing I like about digital media is that your work is tangible. You can see the result of what you\u2019re doing. And there\u2019s a potential for outsizing acts.\u201d\n\nAlthough Victor was exposed to the Internet before turning ten, he didn\u2019t consider a tech career.\n\nHowever, his interest piqued as he followed Seun Onigbinde\u2019s story of building BudgIt when he got into CcHUB\u2019s incubator. He was intrigued at how someone who used to work in a bank was building a solution to address a public challenge.\n\nAt that point, he had a startup idea to build a product for elections, but he soon shelved it to join Techpoint Africa as a writer in 2015.\n\nVictor describes his roles at Techpoint Africa as very important for his future endeavours.\n\nAt Techpoint Africa, he wasn\u2019t limited in his basic role as a journalist in writing and editing. He mentioned being involved in hosting shows, videography, photography, business growth, and brand building. When I joined Techpoint Africa as an intern in 2019, Victor was a senior editor, heading the editorial team\u2019s technology desk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Ekwealor\n\nAt some point, he was in Kenya as the company\u2019s country lead.\n\nWhile at Techpoint Africa, Victor had some other defining moments; he won a journalism award in 2017 courtesy of PwC. In 2018, he bagged the Best Journalist for Business Reporting at the West Africa Media Excellence Awards.\n\nBy January 2020, Victor was ready for something new. In what seemed to be a vertical move, he joined TechCabal as managing editor, a position requiring what he calls a mix of refining the editorial, product management, and company building. It was even more challenging as it all happened during a pandemic.\n\nNext stop: Growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Ekwealor\n\nThere\u2019s no good time to leave a startup, especially when you believe in what the team is building. The consensus is that leaving either has to do with money/compensation or disinterest in a startup\u2019s mission. The other option is searching for other opportunities for personal and professional growth.\n\nVictor\u2019s longest appointment with a startup so far was at Techpoint Africa, where he spent four years. He spent one year at TechCabal before moving to Spleet and then Dash, where he spent six months each serving as Vice President of Growth and Global Head of Growth, respectively.\n\nCurious, I asked why he did not spend more time at the startups, and he succinctly stated that it\u2019s not how long but how well that matters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no right time to leave a startup; there\u2019s always going to be work to be done. Create something that has a general impact on the brand. See something through.\u201d\n\nVictor\u2019s previous responsibilities in product strategy and product development helped him transition somewhat naturally into growth full time.\n\nBefore he started getting paid to do this, Victor volunteered to help startups figure things out based on shared context. For context, he helps startups understand what they should do to grow and retain customers. This was his role at Spleet, a Nigerian-founded proptech startup, and Dash, an Africa-focused payments startup. He mentored teams and also consulted for startups.\n\nAlthough they are mutually inclusive processes, he tried to correct a misconception about growth and marketing as we spoke.\n\n\u201cIf marketing gets 1,000 people interested in a product, growth will answer questions like \u2018Why are they leaving at the rate of 100 per month?\u2019 \u2018Why are they stuck on the sign-up page?\u2019 \u2018Why did they sign up and not proceed?\u2019 Growth uses metrics to make products better.\u201d\n\nIt all adds up, eventually\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Ekwealor\n\nAlthough he occasionally does growth consulting, Victor now considers himself a tech entrepreneur. And it made sense when he disclosed that he currently leads a startup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m building a benefits platform for gig-economy workers,\u201d he said, after taking a few seconds to decide whether to make the revelation.\n\nVictor expressed his fear about building in an African market, but he is not new to taking risks. He mentioned his challenge with product iteration, but that is not enough to deter him, and he\u2019s willing to take his chances.\n\nMy gut told me he had more to say, so I nudged him. Building a startup is no simple task, but he\u2019s encouraged by the maxim, \u201cEverything good will come,\u201d as long as he puts in the effort. Victor believes there\u2019s a lot to do in a short time; nevertheless, he plans to retire at 40.\n\nVictor\u2019s continued interest in the startup space hinges on the available prospects. It is typical for these business entities to evolve, so there will always be opportunities to do the best possible.\n\nSpeaking of what has made his life easier and eliminated unhealthy work ethics, Victor said he has learnt to delegate better, avoid burnout by allocating time to rest, and avoid procrastination by optimising calendar use. He has also built healthier habits and makes out time to work out.\n\nVictor loves to sing, recreate to stay fit, read, host events, and hang out with friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) caught the world\u2019s attention in 2021, after pictures, tweets, and even music started selling on the Internet for millions of dollars. The idea of selling readily available content to anyone on the Internet for millions of dollars seemed far-fetched, but the concept of fungibility and virtual ownership has since caught on.\n\nNFTs have continued to grow in popularity due majorly to their ability to create wealth relatively quickly. They have become a money-making venture for both creators and those who trade their works.\n\nInterestingly, we\u2019ve seen NFTs go beyond buying and selling artworks to becoming status symbols, a path into some of the most exclusive communities in the world.\n\nAn example is the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), an NFT community with some of the biggest celebrities on the planet as members. Becoming a member of the BAYC is relatively easy as long as you have anywhere between $288,000 and $3 million to buy one of its 10,000 grungy apes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club collection. Source: The New Yoker\n\nPeople have created similar NFT communities similar to the BAYC since the massive success of the project. Nowadays, the mission of most NFT projects or collections is to become as exclusive as the BAYC and make early members automatic millionaires.\n\nHowever, while most NFT collections chase money and exclusivity, one project wants to be a source of hope for African school children.\n\nThe Satoshibles, an NFT project named closely after Bitcoin\u2019s elusive founder(s), Satoshi Nakamoto is the first NFT project secured by the Bitcoin network through Stacks. NFTs are created popularly and transferred on the Ethereum network because of advanced technological features that aren\u2019t present on the Bitcoin network. However, Satoshibles have found a way around it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Satoshibles\n\nThe true uniqueness of the Satoshibles lies in their humanitarian efforts to create a conducive learning environment for African children through NFTs.\n\nThe Satoshibles have taken on this cause with the Built with Bitcoin Foundation (BWB), a humanitarian organisation providing essential utilities and quality education to communities globally, an effort powered by cryptocurrencies.\n\nWith Ray Youssef (Paxful Founder and CEO) as Executive Director, the Foundation has built schools, supported sustainable farming, and provided access to clean water across Africa. According to the BWB website, accepting donations in cryptocurrency makes it possible to take assistance from anywhere in the world. The blockchain infrastructure on which cryptocurrencies are built also offers transparent fund tracking.\n\nHow it all happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa had a chat with Brian Laughlan, creator of the Satoshibles collection, and Yusuf Nessary, Director of Philanthropy, BWB, on how they came together to do some good with NFTs and cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cWhen we launched the Satoshibles project, part of the pledge was to give back and try to do some social good with the funds the collection raised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe saddled our community with the decision to choose a foundation that had similar values to ours that would help put these funds to good use, and the overwhelming response was BWB,\u201d Laughlan said.\n\nHe added that the community wanted to work with BWB because of its selfless efforts to help people over the past five years, not just in Africa but in many other parts of the world.\n\nThe Foundation has built eight water projects, four tech centres, and several schools that have touched the lives of over 2,300 students across the globe.\n\nAccording to Laughlan, BWB and the Satoshibles shared terrific ideas on how they could further the work going on at BWB to reach more communities. All these ideas ultimately culminated in the Built with NFT initiative.\n\nUsing NFT for good\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer lab built with initial donation\n\nThe Satoshibles kicked off the project by donating \u039e10 (10 Eth= ~$47,500 at the time), which went into building a computer lab in two schools in Kaduna, Nigeria, and other community projects within Northern Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Nessary, that was just phase one of the partnerships between the Satoshibles and BWB.\n\n\u201cFor phase two, we thought, \u2018why don\u2019t we create a collection called Built with NFT, and 100% of the proceeds from the project goes back into the Foundation to reinvest in communities around the world?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have 500 children that currently attend our BWB schools in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, hand painting these masterpieces, thus raising funds and awareness to build other schools around the world,\u201d Nessary beamed.\n\nAfrican children helping the rest of the world\n\nWhile the Built with NFT project builds schools and creates a conducive learning environment for African children, it creates something else that cannot necessarily be seen and touched but can be felt.\n\nThe project builds a sense of purpose for primary school children, giving them a chance beyond being recipients but builders and creators.\n\nWith each paint stroke and colour coming alive on paper, their little hands could have a say in children\u2019s futures anywhere on the planet.\n\nFor Nessary, giving the children the ability to create is a story in itself; even more important is that they decide the narrative themselves. He said, \u201cwe pride ourselves in being part of the conversation with the students, the staff and the family members of the communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a situation where BWB has all the answers; it is the community members that know what they need. It is our responsibility to work with them.\u201d\n\nNessary is not new to philanthropy; while Built with NFTs is his first NFT-powered work, he has been involved in several philanthropic causes for about a decade. Before working at BWB, he was the Founder of Zam Zam Water, a non-profit organisation devoted to supplying clean water and quality education to communities across the globe.\n\nBWB started five years ago after Nessary got an email from someone who wanted to donate to a foundation he worked for with Bitcoin.\n\nIt was 2017, and cryptocurrencies were still only popular among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nNot knowing what Bitcoin was, Nessary had reservations about accepting the unfamiliar currency from the person. After some back and forth, they developed a trusting relationship, and Nessary discovered how crypto could eliminate the cross border transaction barriers and accept donations from anyone in the world at any time.\n\nInterestingly, the stranger that sent the Bitcoin email was Ray Youssef (Paxful Founder), who would later become Nessary\u2019s Co-founder at BWB.\n\nWhile Laughlan hasn\u2019t actively participated in philanthropy like Nessary, he has always supported well-meaning causes but supporting a cause on a scale as large as Built with NFTs has sparked his desire to play a bigger role in community development.\n\nHow primary school pupils create NFTs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating the NFTs produced moments of triumph that everyone involved in the process was grateful for. According to Nessary, \u201cgetting the children to create artworks was a success on its own.\u201d\n\nThey were proud of getting the pupils to use their imagination. The project also necessitated the need for an art department in the school. It was already bearing fruits before it kicked off. The schools had no art teachers, so it employed local artists to teach students the basics of art and painting.\n\n\u201c\u2018What do you want to be when you grow up?\u2019 That was the idea we wanted the pupils to flow with,\u201d Nessary told Techpoint Africa.\n\nAnd the kids flowed with it. After learning the basics of painting, they created pictures of their desired future selves. There were references to soldiers and police officers among the older children, while the younger ones painted their fathers, mothers, and even their teachers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe started by getting consent forms from all the parents and all the teachers that were involved in signing off. No family or student was forced to participate. It was all voluntary,\u201d Nessary explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was also important that everyone participating, especially the teachers and parents, understood what they were doing. So it was necessary to explain the concepts of blockchain and NFTs to them.\n\nThere have been other NFT-for-good projects\n\nThe Satoshibles and BWB are not the only ones using NFTs for the good of others. Beeple, an NFT artist known popularly for selling an NFT worth $69 million, donated proceeds from selling another of his pieces worth $6 million to the Open Earth Foundation.\n\nIt is a non-profit foundation that combats climate change by using technologies and collaborations to help create a healthier world.\n\nPopular American talk show host, Ellen DeGeneres also sold multiple NFTs that generated $33,495, which she donated to World Central Kitchen (WCK), a food relief organisation.\n\nHowever, the Built with NFT project was unique because it gave a sense of purpose, giving the children and the community a role to play in creating a better tomorrow not just for themselves but for others around the world.\n\nBesides the project\u2019s primary goal, a lot of learning and reeducating was done in the process, helping the locals see technology as something that can create hope and not just what powers flashy and luxurious gadgets.\n\nAccording to Laughlan, who is excited and constantly letting his imagination run wild, \u201cthe possibilities are endless.\u201d They\u2019ve created this with a technology that isn\u2019t controlled by any entity or government.\n\nNessary was also just as ecstatic. For him, seeing a project through is exceptionally gratifying and satisfying, but he is most appreciative of how well he\u2019s connected with everyone working on the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt with NFT homepage\n\nSo far, over 200 of the works have been minted, with each artwork carrying the name and age of the student who painted it. They\u2019re available for sale on the Built with NFT website or on OpenSea. Every painting has a story, and with every purchase, children worldwide get access to a better life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t watch too many movies growing up because my dad thought they were a waste of time; he still does today. As a result, I only watched Nigerian series like Super Story. The plot was usually enough to keep me interested, but as I got older and started watching Hollywood movies, I wondered why there was such a vast difference in quality.\n\nSo, you can imagine my surprise and controlled excitement when I saw The Critics Company while going through the blog post announcing the #YouTubeBlackVoices Creator Class of 2022. I quickly sent an email to the team to schedule an interview. A few weeks ago, I spoke to the group\u2019s producer, Ridwan Abdullateef, who shared the team\u2019s journey.\n\nEarly days\n\nThe Critics Company is a team of filmmakers ranging from 8 to 27 based in the Northern Nigerian city of Kaduna. Some of the team members who are siblings or cousins and had never met each other started meeting up to watch movies.\n\n\u201cFilmmaking for The Critics started about five years ago. It started from a love for films. Some of the team members are actually cousins and had not met before five years ago, but whenever they came together, the common ground was always movies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team on set. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cAll the cool stuff we saw in Hollywood was absent in Nollywood, and so it got to the point when we started criticising the Nollywood films, and we did that through comedy, but at some point, even the comedy was no longer funny,\u201d Abdullateef shares.\n\nRather than remain critics, they decided to start making their movies, and this was where they ran into the first problem.\n\n\u201cIf something is missing somewhere, you can\u2019t just talk all the time. You have to take action, and so that inspired going out to make the first film, but unfortunately again, no one on the team knew how to film or edit movies.\u201d\n\nAt the time, most of the team were teenagers with no training in filmmaking or resources to pay for training. Turning to the Internet, the group watched tutorials on YouTube and read books on filmmaking. Using a smartphone that belonged to a teammate\u2019s father, they started shooting short films, which they uploaded online.\n\n\u201cWe have this pause and play on most mobile phones today where you can record someone, pause it while they change or do something else, and it looks like it was filmed in one take. So that was where we started.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany teenagers in Nigeria are either in secondary school or on their way to university, so how has the team handled their parents\u2019 expectations?\n\nAccording to Abdullateef, their parents wanted them to get a university degree. Two members of the group \u2013 Godwin Josiah and Raymond Yusuff \u2013 got admitted into the Kaduna State University and the University of Abuja, respectively, before dropping out.\n\n\u201cWe got into discussions with our parents, but they didn\u2019t understand or listen to us, but with persistence and continuous hard work, they came to realise that this was what we wanted to do. Also, for the past three years, we\u2019ve been living alone, so that has helped.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Kaduna to the world\n\nIn the early days, the team posted their short movies on Facebook. However, when they made their first movie \u2013 Redemption \u2013 they felt putting it on YouTube would give them access to a broader audience. However, their videos did not receive as much attention as they did on Facebook until a few months later.\n\nNollywood producer and maker of The Wedding Party, Kemi Adetiba, also came across their videos and helped them raise money to get equipment. In 2020, they worked on the set of her political thriller, King of Boys: The Return of the King.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdetiba is not the only veteran filmmaker interested in the team. Hollywood executives J.J. Abrams, Franklin Leonard, and Scott Myers have also noticed them, with Leonard and Abrams sending the team some equipment in 2020. In addition to King of Boys, the team has also worked on projects for Kaspersky, Africa No Filter, and Revelation Entertainment.\n\nAfrica\u2019s creator economy is still growing, fuelled by youth on Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. However, one of the challenges they face is monetisation \u2013 getting those willing to pay for their services and charging the right price.\n\nEven though The Critics started making movies as a hobby, it has become a job for them, and Abdullateef credits the support of older filmmakers for their growth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have older, seasoned professionals in the industry. We\u2019re in talks with mentors like J.J. Abrams, Franklin Leonard, etc., who give us advice on how to monetise our products. They know how much people in Europe get paid, and so they ensure that we also get paid on that level.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re also represented by Creative Arts Agency, a talent management agency with Beyonc\u00e9 on its books while Olisa Agbakoba Legal handles their legal affairs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a hobby for us anymore. We work very professionally. Everything passes through a process before we sign a contract with a client.\u201d\n\nWhere they once needed better filming equipment, the team now has to ensure that every project is better than the last while balancing other commitments. Having gotten opportunities to work with industry experts so early in their careers, the team is focused on learning as much as they can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

ATIKU ABUBAKAR\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nAtiku Abubakar a Nigerian politician was born in Jada, a village which was formerly under the administration of the British Cameroons, which later joined Nigeria. He became the only child to his parents, Garba Abubakar and Aisha Kande when his only sister died at infancy. Abubakar is married to four wives and has been blessed with twenty-eight children.\n\nAt an early age of eight, Abubakar started schooling at the Jada Primary School, Adamawa, which he completed in 1960. In the same year, Abubakar was admitted into Adamawa Provincial Secondary School. He graduated from the secondary school in 1965 after he made grade three in the West African Senior School Certificate Examination.\n\nAbubakar continued to study at the Nigeria Police College in Kaduna. He progressed to work as a tax officer in the regional Ministry of Finance; he gained admission to the School of Hygiene in Kano in 1966, where he finished with a diploma.\n\nHe served as a student Union President at the time, and in the same year he enrolled for a Law diploma at the Ahmadu Bello University Institute of Administration.\n\nCAREER\n\nAbubakar was employed by the Nigeria Custom Service after graduation in 1969.

It should focus on that area. You are focusing on these social services and amenities at a time when the economy of the nation is depressed and not growing at all.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cSome of the things that happened in the recent past can\u2019t be spoken about publicly. I urge the commission never to allow what happened during the sharing of conditional cash transfer from the Federal Government to happen again.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not happy and are angry with the way the conditional cash transfer and sharing of social and economic amenities were handled. The commission needs to look at that and never allow it to happen again.\u201d\n\nNoting that the visit came at the right time as it was necessary to address the lingering issues troubling Nigerians, Obaseki said: \u201cOur founding fathers thought it wise that, in order to preserve the unity of this country, they needed to create a commission that would complement the policy which ensured that every Nigerian will feel that they are part of the country. This was done so that whatever belongs to the country would be equitably and fairly distributed to all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThank you for keeping the spirit of the constitution alive and trying to enforce the constitution as many people feel marginalised in spite of the effort of the commission. Nigerians feel they are not getting what is due them.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe cake we are trying to share in this country is becoming too small as our focus is to build a bigger cake that will be equitably shared. Everybody should be made to contribute something to the national cake for it to be enough for us to share.\n\n\u201cYou have done well as you go about to implement the first task of your mandate, which is ensuring equitable distribution of positions. In fairness, you have done well in that regard.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Executive Chairman, Federal Character Commission, Dr. Muheeba Dankaka, said the visit is in continuation of her engagements with critical stakeholders in the country, adding: \u201cUpon assumption of office, I made it a matter of policy to consult widely and drink from the wealth of experiences of our leaders of thought like you to guide my actions in the course of my assignment.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Character Commission was established with a primary focus of ensuring a strong, virile and indivisible nation, based on fairness, equity and justice, to promote national unity, foster national loyalty and give every citizen of Nigeria a sense of belonging to the nation, notwithstanding the diversities of ethnic origin, culture, language or religion, which may exist.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "The former Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu has said that the divestment of assets by some International Oil Companies (IOCs) is beyond the global push for the energy transition.\n\nKachikwu spoke at a Chief Executive Officer Round Table Session at the ongoing Nigerian International Energy Summit (NIES) on Tuesday in Abuja with the topic: \u201cStrategies for Confronting the Energy Transition.\u201d\n\nKachikwu\u2019s remarks appeared to be in response to the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari who had noted in his own remarks that the IOCs were exiting the country due to the global push for energy transition and net carbon zero target.\n\nKachikwu noted that the IOCs including Shell and Exxon Mobil have divested some of their Nigeria assets in the past few years citing the need to diversify their portfolios.\n\nThe former minister said there was the need for the companies to be engaged in further discussions regarding the move, while noting that the sale of the assets was beneficial to Nigerian companies and would deepen local participation in the oil and gas space.\n\nKachikwu said the successful completion of the 2020 marginal Oilfields bid round and the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act were huge milestones for the Federal Government.\n\nHe said Nigeria must look at efficient ways to improve oil and gas production and speed up the development of production now, especially with the rise in crude oil prices.\n\nKachikwu emphasised the need to improve domestic refining capacity by rehabilitating the existing refineries and supporting private-owned refineries such as the Dangote Refinery being constructed in Ibeju Lekki, Lagos.\n\nHe said energy transition was inevitable and Nigeria must prepare for it by focusing on its abundant gas resources.\n\nOn the funding constraints for the development of oil and gas projects due to the global energy transition, Kachikwu recommended the setting up of a special fund for such purposes.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyari whose remarks came as the Federal Government announced that it had established a $50m Liquefied Petroleum Gas (cooking gas) Energy Fund in partnership with Afriexim Bank to deepen the use of LPG in Nigeria, noted that the NNPC would work with its partners in facilitating the process in Nigeria regardless of the massive investment drop in fossil fuel projects amidst oil firms exits from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cCompanies are divesting. They are leaving our country literally, that\u2019s the best way to put it. But they are not leaving because opportunities are not there,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is because companies are shifting their portfolios where they can add value, and not just that, where they can also add to the journey towards net carbon zero production. We understand this very perfectly.\n\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t afford not to realise that this country must benefit from the realities of today.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, today in Nigeria, or mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, countries in this region could be described as energy deficient.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the poverty of energy and there\u2019s a huge gap to be filled,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cThis country has the largest reserves of gas and crude oil including condensates, and therefore there\u2019s simply no way you can transit to a net carbon zero situation without necessarily having a transition fuel.\n\n\u201cIt is very clear to the world that gas will be the transition fuel. And that can\u2019t happen except you are able to put in on the ground, convert it to a usable form and make it available to its users.\u2019\n\nThe NNPC boss observed that \u201cyou can\u2019t do that except you find financing for it. And today we all understand the level of underfunding in the fossil fuel industry.\u201d\n\nKyari noted funding for fossil fuel projects had dropped by about 50 per cent when compared to what it was about 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cAnd the impacts are already showing. There\u2019s a clear demand and supply gap that we are seeing today and that\u2019s why we are seeing the $104 oil in the market today,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe NNPC boss added, \u201cNo one has invested significantly in the last 10 years and more so in the last five years. And it is much more difficult in our country today because we are not able to invest in the fossil fuel industry in the last five years to the extent that we are seeing the effects of what that really means.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, said the world should support a drive to develop African natural gas production, describing it as green energy to ramp up electricity output.\n\n\u201cAfrica is not denying the need to transit to renewable fuels, to cleaner energies, but we are only saying at this point, just when we are getting our act together, please allow us to enjoy our resources a little bit,\u201d the minister stated.\n\nSylva explained that for countries such as Nigeria, which was rich in natural resources but still energy poor, the transition must not come at the expense of affordable and reliable energy for people, cities, and industry.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, it must be inclusive, equitable, and just\u2014which means preserving the right to sustainable development and poverty eradication as enshrined in global treaties such as the Paris accord,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn a bid to deepen gas usage in Nigeria, Sylva told delegates at the summit that the Federal Government had inaugurated the National Gas Expansion Programme to expand Nigeria\u2019s domestic utilisation as part of the National Gas Policy.\n\n\u201cWith this programme, we have established a 20 million cylinder injection scheme; five to 10 million of these are to be introduced in pilot states this year.\n\n\u201cWe have also established an LPG Energy Fund in the order of $50m, in its first phase, in partnership with Afriexim Bank.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Mr Leye Falade, the General Manager, Production, Nigeria LNG Ltd. (NLNG), reiterated the company\u2019s commitment to improving domestic gas consumption in Nigeria.\n\nFalade said the NLNG had in 2021 signed a Sales and Purchase Agreement with three indigenous power companies to deliver 1.1MTPA of gas for them to supply power to industrial clusters\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Residents of Ungwan Romi, Abuja Road junction of Chikun local government area of Kaduna State were subjected to panic and apprehension on Sunday evening and Monday morning following a discovery of an object suspected to be an Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) planted in the area.\n\nThe Kaduna popular beer parlour near Nnamdi Azikiwe bypassed by Abuja highway always witnesses football fans and fun seekers.\n\nIt was reliably gathered that at the time the suspected object was sighted, several football fans were watching the final match between Liverpool and Chelsea football in the beer parlour.\n\nAn eyewitness identified as Mr Bayo told journalists that when the owner of the beer parlour sighted the suspected object on Sunday evening, he moved it to a nearby motor mechanic workshop not knowing what the content was.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, disturbed by the way the object was thrown into the mechanic workshop, the security man attached to the workshop moved the object farther away to the back of the workshop.\n\nThe following day being Monday, the owner of the beer parlour, Mr. Larry Nuhu called the attention of the police who came with bomb detecting experts and neutralised the object and moved it away to their office.\n\nThe eyewitness added, \u201cI saw the object wrapped in a black bag with a battery connected to it, the kind of battery motorcycle uses. But this morning being Monday, the Kaduna State Commissioner of police came with some of his men who are bomb experts and removed the object.\n\nMeanwhile, the State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan on Monday evening paid an assessment visit to the scene of the averted incident.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAruwan who arrived at the scene in company of the Garrison Commander advised the owner of the beer parlour to scale up personal security in the area just as he said the State government would continue to beef up security in the State.\n\nSpeaking with Journalists about the incident, the proprietor of the beer parlour, Mr. Larry Nuhu explained that, \u201cWhat happened yesterday (Sunday evening) at 9.30 or there about was that one of my staff rushed to call me and told me that one man came with a bag and suddenly he dropped the bag in the beer parlour and left. It was a black bag and it was opened and I peeped inside and I saw cables there, negative and positive. Thank God I have knowledge of science. So I noticed that it must be something dangerous, though positive and negative were not connected.\n\n\u201cAnother thought came into me to move the object from where customers were staying because it might be timed to cause serious damage. But I decided to move it away so that the damage could be minimal if it is timed.\n\nI took the risk and threw the bag far from the scene. So this morning I called the JTF who in turn invited the police.\n\n\u201cThe bomb experts came and identified it, it was a bomb. They combed the area and told me it was now safe. The Commissioner of Police later came and gave me the advice to beef up local security in the area. He also advised that we should not allow anybody with a bag to enter the place.\n\n\u201cI can estimate that over 70 to 80 people were watching the football match. This is because people were already leaving because the match had come to an end. So some people had earlier left the place.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, Kaduna State Police command has confirmed an explosion, suspected to be an Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) which occurred on Sunday night in Kabala West area of Kaduna South Local Government Area of Kaduna State.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) ASP Muhammad Jalige confirmed the incident to the Journalists on Monday in Kaduna.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe explosion is suspected to be IED, there is no casualty recorded in the incident. There was nobody in the building when it exploded.

          "text": "Piqued over the frequent shutdown of school activities due to incessant strikes, the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) yesterday staged a nationwide protest, calling for immediate negotiations to end the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Union Universities (ASUU).\n\nIn Abuja, the angry students, who barricaded the entrance of the Federal Ministry of Education, carried placards with various inscriptions urging the federal government to listen to the cries of the students and reach agreement with the lecturers\u2019 union.\n\nASUU embarked on a one-month warning strike on February 14, 2022 over what it viewed as government\u2019s unfaithfulness towards the implementation of the Memorandum of Action it signed with the union.\n\nSome of ASUU\u2019s demands include: adequate funding for the revitalisation of public universities, payment of earned academic allowances, adoption of Universities Transparency Accountability Solutions (UTAS) to solve the inconsistencies associated with the Integrated Payroll Personnel Information System (IPPIS), payment of promotion arrears, and the renegotiation of 2009 ASUU/FG agreement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd with the union and federal government set to meet tomorrow, the students have vowed to continue the protest until the strike is called off.\n\nSpeaking during the protest, NANS national president, Comrade Sunday Asefon, pointed out the country\u2019s leaders had enjoyed free, quality education in the past but now want to punish the current generation with endless disruptions in the sector.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is disheartening to note that the Academic Staff Union of University (ASUU) has gone on strike more than four years cumulatively since 1999. The consequences of this development are grave on the part of the students who are the victims of these incessant industrial actions embarked upon by ASUU as a result of labour disagreement with the federal government. The resultant effect of these incessant strikes is inconsistency in scholarship, research, and learning output.\n\n\u201cAt the end of every strike, ASUU members get their salary, government officials and politicians get their pay, ministers in charge of the Ministry of Education and his counterpart in the Ministry of Labour get their pay and allowances for unproductive meetings with ASUU, but the students get nothing but the inability to get mobilised for NYSC as a result of age limitation, limited job opportunities as a result of age limitation, and the untimely death of students traversing the poor Nigerian roads unnecessarily all as a result of incessant ASUU strikes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is more worrisome that most of the industrial actions could have been avoided if the government has been responsible enough to fulfil promises/agreements freely entered with ASUU over the years and fulfil their part of the bargain. Public tertiary institution in Nigeria has taken a downward slope in recent years and there is an urgent need to fix the system. Many students no longer trust the education outcome of our tertiary institutions as a result of the incessant strikes and infrastructural neglect from the government.\u201d\n\nAccording to Comrade Asefon, it is these developments that has caused the high level of migration of Nigerian students abroad in search of stable and quality education.\n\n\u201cMany of our students are currently trapped in war-ravaged Ukraine as a result of the incessant strikes in our universities and the lack of adequate infrastructural development,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said the students are, therefore, compelled to take the following positions: \u201cThat the federal government must as a matter of urgency honour every agreement freely entered with ASUU and renegotiate areas that need renegotiation in good faith with ASUU while we call on ASUU to be open-minded, progressive, and be realistic in their terms.\n\nASUU Strike: Education Minister Walks Out Of Meeting With Students\n\n\u201cFederal government must do all it takes to convince ASUU to suspend its strike and return to the classroom immediately to ensure continuity in our academic calendar.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that due to the protest, which cut across the 36 states of the federation, the minister of education, Malam Adamu Adamu, angrily walked out of a meeting with the Nigerian students who were protesting the ASUU strike.\n\nThe minister had scheduled an impromptu meeting with the leadership of NANS as students barricaded the entrance of the Federal Ministry of Education.\n\nThe students asked the minister to close down his office since he could not resolve the ASUU matter, even as they lamented the failure of government to resolve the issue after several years.\n\nNANS national president, Asefon, lamented that \u201cASUU strike is killing education more and more. This strike has been affecting our lives since 1999 and Nigerian students want to be part of the discussion between federal government and ASUU to find a lasting solution to the matter.\n\n\u201cWe want federal government and ASUU to as a matter of urgency call off this strike while negotiation continues. We want to go back to classes; if not, this will be more than #EndSars protest,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, trouble erupted when, in the course of the meeting, the NANS\u2019 leadership questioned the minister for abandoning the education sector in a mess while sending his children to study abroad.\n\nAdamu who was not happy at the attack on his person said he was disappointed with the comments and stepped out of the conference room.\n\nReactions have since followed the minister\u2019s action which occurred during a brief meeting that had the registrar of Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, and the executive secretary of the National Universities Commission (NUC), Prof. Abubakar Rasheed, in attendance.\n\nIn Ebonyi State, hundreds of students of Ebonyi State University and other tertiary institutions in the state, under the aegis of NANS, Ebonyi State chapter, yesterday protested against the one-month industrial action embarked by ASUU.\n\nThe students who converged at the Presco campus of the university for the peaceful protest said the protest was to register their displeasure at the ongoing warning strike by the union.\n\nThe students during the protest that lasted for over four hours barricaded the Presco campus section of the ever-busy Abakaliki-Enugu Road, thereby causing both vehicular and human traffic congestion along the major highway.\n\nThe students insisted that the protest would continue until the union calls off the industrial action and return to classes.\n\nThe students, led by the acting deputy coordinator of Zone F, Comrade Ewa Chukwumaijem, and the Joint Campus Committee (JJC) chairman-elect in the state, Comrade Ituma Kelvin, carried placards with inscriptions like: \u201cage is irreversible, house rents are non-refundable, stop disrupting our life\u2019s plans, FG, \u201cstop delaying our career, stop toying with our future and that of our dear nation\u201d and \u201cwe can\u2019t continue to be bait for anybody,\u201d among others.\n\nAddressing newsmen, Comrade Chukwumaijem noted that the strikes had always been about the selfish interests of ASUU and never about the interest of the students.\n\nHe called on the federal government and ASUU to take immediate actions towards resolving the strike in the interest of students.\n\nIn Cross River State, the students in Calabar led a peaceful protest to the Governor\u2019s office, urging the federal government to put an end to the strike embarked upon by ASUU.\n\nThe protesting students gathered at the gate of the government house in Calabar carrying placards with different inscriptions such as \u201cPut an end to strike now\u201d, \u201cput your children in public schools and not send them to Ukraine and Russia \u201c, \u201cGet our state library revived now.\u201d\n\nThe protesting students, who were led by their leader, Anthony Efa, said they were unfortunate to find themselves in a nation with no value for education.\n\nAccording to him, it is unfair for a student to be admitted into one of the nation\u2019s tertiary institutions for a four-year course only to end up staying six years due to incessant strikes.\n\nIn Kano State, NANS members converged on Kofar Nassarawa bridge in Kano City to express their concern over the strike, describing it as very unfortunate.\n\nThey carried placards with different inscriptions calling on the federal government and ASUU to bring a lasting solution to the strike. They sang solidarity songs against ASUU and the federal government.\n\nSpeaking at the Ministry of Higher Education, the leader of the protesters, Yazid Tanko Mohammed, explained that the students were conducting the peaceful protest to convey their grievances on the ongoing strike by university lecturers, saying the strike was causing a great setback to their education.\n\nIn her response, the commissioner for Higher Education, Dr . Mariya Bunkure, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Alhaji Dahiru Adda\u2019u, said the Ministry would convey their grievances to Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje for onward submission to the federal level.\n\nIn Adamawa State, a road accident resulted in the death of three persons close to the venue of the students\u2019 protest. The accident involved a trailer load of cattle and a motorcycle in Vinikilang Girei local government area of Adamawa State.\n\nThe accident happened a few metres to River Benue bridge. An eye witness said the truck was on a high speed from the Mubi axis and rammed into the motorcycle, killing them and a passer-by.\n\nOfficials of Federal Road Safety Corps were seen evacuating the corpses to Specialist Hospital Yola, and also controlling traffic on the busy Girei-Yola Road.\n\nThe road mishap occurred at the same spot students from various tertiary institutions across the state had assembled to protest the ASUU strike, during which they barricaded the river Benue bridge linking state capital and other parts of the state.\n\nThe students, under the aegis of NAN, said the protest was in line with the directives issued by the national president of the union.\n\nComrade Anasam Maspalma, chairman, NANS Joint Campus Committee (JCC), Adamawa axis, said the decision for the action was taken at the concluded non-elective Congress held in Sokoto state.\n\n\u201cThe protest is our fundamental right to show our dissatisfaction against the actions of ASUU/FG that led to the closure of our universities.\n\n\u201cStudents are tired of the strike; we are saying enough is enough to ASUU/FG strike. As it is, graduating students cannot mobilise for the National Youth Service Corps for service to the fatherland. We want to go back to school and continue with our studies,\u201d Maspalma added.\n\nMeanwhile, ASUU has said it will not back down on the current industrial action, accusing the federal government of not keeping to its promises.\n\nPresident of the union, Emmanuel Osodeke, said yesterday that it is now more than two weeks since ASUU declared a one-month warning strike over the federal government\u2019s inability to honour its agreement with the body.\n\n\u201cFor the past nine years or so, they have been giving us promises but once the strike is over, they relapse,\u201d he said ahead of today\u2019s meeting with the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige.\n\n\u201cSo, our colleagues are tired of these promises which they don\u2019t fulfil. What we want is actions,\u201d the ASUU leader said in a televised interview via Channels Television breakfast show, Sunrise Daily.\n\nNANS yesterday staged a protest in Ibadan , Oyo State , saying they will resist any attempt by the federal government and ASUU to send them into the streets.\n\nThe students advised both the federal government and ASUU to resolve their crisis over the ongoing strike of the union for the sake of the students.\n\nSpeaking at a protest that took them to Iyaganku press centre of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Oyo State chapter, the Southwest coordinator of NANS, Tegbe Steven Fiyinfoluwa vowed the students will block all the federal roads today if the federal government and ASUU fail to reach an agreement.\n\nSome of the placards displayed during the protest by the students read: \u201cFG and ASUU, stop the madness, stop the strike and revitalise our education\u201d, After the end of strike, only students lose. FG should learn to respect agreement.\u201d",

          "text": "The minister of state for petroleum resources, Timipre Sylva, the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Dr Mohammad Barkindo, and the minister of mines and hydrocarbons, Equatorial Guinea, Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, have made a strong defence for fossil fuel investments, saying Africa\u2019s development needs are being overlooked in the global dynamics of decarbonisation.\n\nThe all spoke at the opening session the fifth Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES), with the theme: \u201cRevitalising the Industry: \u201d Future Fuels and Energy Transition.\u201d\n\nThis is as experts in Nigeria\u2019s energy sector have said that acquisition of assets of International Oil Companies (IOCs) by Nigeria\u2019s indigenous oil exploration company will impact positively on the nation\u2019s energy sector.\n\nAfrica accounts for less than three per cent of global carbon emissions while some 600 million Africans lack access to electricity, they said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt would be a tragedy of unimaginable proportions if, despite the billions of dollars invested in these resources, they flowed west as stranded assets,\u201d OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said during the energy conference in Nigeria.\n\nHis comments came as the latest report from the UN\u2019s Climate Science Panel warned that half of the world\u2019s population was vulnerable to dangerous climate impacts and that drastic action was needed.\n\nBut resource-rich developing countries have often pushed back on calls for a rapid shift away from fossil fuels, arguing that they have not had time to benefit economically from the fuels and are not responsible for the bulk of the emissions.\n\nTimipre Sylva said the whole world should support a campaign to expand the production of natural gas in Africa, which he described as green energy and the only way to increase electricity production.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSylva said energy transition push must consider the development needs of developing countries, especially those with huge hydrocarbon resources.\n\n\u201cIn adopting global future fuels, energy-poverty and climate change nexus have to be both addressed simultaneously. It must be geared towards clean and sustainable sources.\n\n\u201cFor countries such as Nigeria that is rich in natural resources but still energy poor, the transition must not come at the expense of affordable and reliable energy for people, cities, and industry. On the contrary, it must be inclusive, equitable, and just \u2013 which means preserving the right to sustainable development and poverty eradication as enshrined in global treaties such as the Paris Accord.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that what makes the most sense from the point of view of \u201cbalancing energy security with environmental sustainability is the use of gas as a transition fuel.\u201d\n\nSylva pointed out that natural gas ticked all the boxes as the vehicle to help government achieve its aspirations and that is why it embraced the resource to help turn around the economy by declaring year 2021-2030 as Nigeria\u2019s decade of gas.\n\n\u201cAfrica is not denying the need to transition to renewable fuels, to cleaner energy, but we are only saying, at this point, just as we are mobilizing, please allow us to enjoy a few of our resources,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile drillers and some governments say gas burns much cleaner than oil or coal, climate scientists disagree, citing growing research that the gas industry is responsible for significant emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.\n\nThe oil minister of Equatorial Guinea, a major oil exporter, suggested that if oil majors pull out of a hydrocarbon project, they should hand it over to local authorities.\n\n\u201cIf an asset is no longer profitable for an operator, just hand it over to us, it\u2019s not nationalisation,\u201d said Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima during the conference.\n\nOPEC\u2019s Barkindo described the oil and gas industry as \u201cunder siege\u201d, saying there were more than 700 lawsuits against oil companies worldwide.\n\n\u201cClimate activists have seized the momentum and are dictating the terms and pace of the energy transition,\u201d he said, noting that global energy demand was steadily rising to levels that could not be satisfied unless hydrocarbons were part of the mix of energy sources.\n\n\u201cAny discussion of the oil and gas industries being relegated to the past and the need to stop further investment in oil and gas is misguided,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the US Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard expressed the opposition of the US government to fresh investment in the development of hydrocarbon.\n\nShe insisted that the impact of climate change was visible for everyone to see around the world, noting that the US would continue to support poor countries to transit seamlessly into cleaner energy.\n\nAn energy expert, John Obot, said that the current wave of divestment hitting the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry was deemed necessary to allow smaller entities to contribute to economic activities in areas that had become less attractive to international oil companies (IOCs).\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2018Currently, five IOCs operate in Nigeria and they include SPDC and TotalEnergies, Chevron and ExxonMobil as well as Eni. These five IOCs are also responsible for 45 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s oil production and 40 per cent of gas.\n\n\u201cWhile the IOCs may have maintained some dominance on Nigeria\u2019s oil assets, their grip began to relax in 1991 when indigenous players made their entry, thanks to Professor Jubril Aminu\u2019s deliberate policy of encouraging indigenous participation in the Nigerian oil and gas sector, under military president, Ibrahim Babangida.\u201d\n\nBeginning in 2010 and led by SPDC, IOCs operating in Nigeria have divested 26 assets. Seplat (formed as an SPV by Shebah and Platform) took OML 4, 38 and 41 off Shell in 2010 for a reported $340m.\n\nOther transactions have happened subsequently; Neconde (OML 42) in 2011, Eroton (OML 18) in 2014, First E&P (OML 83 and 85) in 2014, Aiteo (OML 29) in 2015 and just last year, Trans-Niger Oil and Gas (TNOG) (OML 17).\n\nWith the wave of new divestment announcements, at least five Nigerian oil and gas companies are reportedly planning to submit bids for Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s oil assets in the country this month.\n\nSeplat Energy Plc recently announced an agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited from Exxon Mobil Corporation, Delaware, for $1.28 billion. This was disclosed in a notice published by the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) on February 24, 2022. The transaction is reminiscent of the $1.5 billion ConocoPhillips Nigerian operation by Oando in 2014.\n\nExperts have described it as an unprecedented move by the local firm, which has continued to expand to new frontiers of operations since its inception over a decade ago.\n\nAccording to an energy analyst, Dr Tayo Bello, it is interesting to note that indigenous players had focused on growing production levels thus improving revenue and royalties due. Their ability to negotiate with local communities has helped provide right-of-way and access hitherto denied the IOCs. This has had the salutary effect of reducing insecurity and sabotage.\n\nAccording to him, the deal by Seplat signifies positive developments in the Nigerian oil sector, and poses new challenges to the future contributions of oil to the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) has said it will ensure that operators present their \u201cGreen Story\u2019\u2019 in Field Development Plan (FDP) as Nigeria moves to attain net zero carbon by 2060.\n\nChief executive of NUPRC, Gbenga Komolafe, made this known while speaking at the ongoing NIES in Abuja.\n\nAccording to Komolafe, the energy transition regime has posed a challenge and opportunity for Nigeria to reposition its energy focus and regulatory policies toward the development of clean and renewable energy.\n\nAccording to him, investors in the upstream are being asked to provide their green story as a basis for attracting required funds for field development.\n\nAlso speaking, Dr Nasir Sani-Gwarzo, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, said Nigeria was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2030.\n\nHe said this was being driven by programmes such as the Decade of Gas Initiative and promotion of gas-based industries which would lead to job creation for Nigerians.\n\nOn his part, Mr Simbi Wabote, the executive secretary, Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), said international oil companies were divesting their assets due to the global energy transition.\n\nWabote said this was, however, an opportunity for indigenous companies to take charge of the industry in line with NCDMB\u2019s mandate.",

          "text": "The family has confirmed the death of Emmanuel Sunny Ojeagbase, founder and executive chairman of Complete Communications Limited, publishers of Complete Sports newspapers.\n\nMr Ojeagbase, who is also the publisher of Success Digest and other online publications, died on Saturday, February 22, 2022, in Atlanta, United States of America (USA), after a brief illness, according to a statement released on Monday.\n\nHe was 71 years old at the time.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the family, the late Ojeagbase was from Uzebba, Iuleha in Edo State\u2019s Owan West. Before adding Emmanuel to his name, he was known as Sunny Ojeagbase (or simply \u201cS.O.\u201d).\n\nWhen he founded Sports Souvenir weekly newspaper in 1984, the late media mogul cemented his place in Nigerian history as the country\u2019s first publisher of sports news.\n\nHe was previously a retired Nigerian Army soldier who began his career in sports writing as a stringer for the Daily Times newspapers in the mid-1970s.\n\nMr. Ojeagbase rose fast through sheer talent, tenacity, and hard work, and was appointed sports editor of the Sunday Concord newspapers in 1980, and the sports editor of The Guardian newspapers in 1983. In 1984, he left The Guardian to pursue his dream of becoming an entrepreneur.\n\nMr Ojeagbase launched numerous more pioneering sports titles into the Nigerian sports industry between 1984 and 1994, including Complete Football magazine, Complete Football International (CFI), and International Soccer Review (ISR). Surprisingly, the Complete Football titles were instrumental in assuring Nigeria\u2019s first entry at the FIFA World Cup in the United States in 1994, as well as the country\u2019s gold medal win in football at the Atlanta \u201996 Olympic Games in the United States. In 1995, Mr. Ojeagbase launched Complete Sports as Nigeria\u2019s No. 1 daily sports publication, sandwiched between those two monumental occurrences in Nigerian sports.\n\nIn 1994, Mr. Ojeagbase co-founded the Success Attitude Development Centre (SADC) with his wife, Esther Ojeagbase, with the aim and mission of teaching young Nigerian entrepreneurs how to start, run, and succeed in their businesses. SADC has gone on to develop and inspire thousands of successful entrepreneurs, many of whom are now labor employers, who are Ojeagbase\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\n\nMr. Ojeagbase was ordained as a pastor in March 2003, and he preached the gospel of God to everyone who came into contact with him, both in words and acts. His mantra was to do business and live life with the fear of God, integrity, compassion and peace of mind. He was a totally self-made man who was passionate about acquiring knowledge as attested to by a huge library filled with books on business management, leadership, entrepreneurship and related fields. He had a Diploma in Journalism from the University of Lagos, but he was conferred with an honorary Doctorate degree by a different institution for his accomplishments as an entrepreneur. He also received tons of awards and recognitions for his contributions to sports journalism, publishing, business mentorship and entrepreneurship.\n\nMr Ojeagbase was a rallying point for members of his immediate and extended families and also a benefactor to thousands of people. He created and facilitated breakthrough opportunities and jobs for young journalists and contemporaries alike. His generosity and philanthropy was limitless. He was completely detribalised and, despite being a Pastor, was extremely tolerant and unbiased to people of other faiths. He was a good man at heart and a great man in achievements.\n\nMr Sunny Emmanuel Ojeagbase is survived by his wife, Mrs Ojeagbase, his children both biological and adopted, as well as grandchildren and other relatives. He will also be sorely missed by friends, mentees and business associates.\n\nCondolence registers have been opened at Complete Sports headquarters at Plot 9, Alhaji Adenekan Street, Okota, Lagos; and at SADC headquarters, No. 36, Esuola Street, Off Ago Palace Way, Okota, Lagos.\n\nBurial arrangements will be announced by the family.",

Hungary and Romania approved visa-free access to all Nigerians coming from Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor now, movements to the Hungarian Zahony border and Romanian Suceava, Tulcea, Satu Mare County, and Maramures borders is advised, as they have approved visa free access to all Nigerians coming from Ukraine,\u201d a statement by Gabriel Aduda, permanent secretary of the Foreign Affairs ministry, read.\n\nMinister assures\n\n\n\nSpeaking Monday at a meeting with Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila, the minister, Mr Onyeama, assured of safe returns of Nigerians in Ukraine.\n\n\n\nHe said his ministry had arranged with the management of an indigenous airline- Air Peace \u2013 to evacuate Nigerians who have crossed the Ukrainian-Polish border Wednesday March 2, 2002.\n\n\n\nSpeaker had invited Onyeama, with a view to assessing government preparedness and response mechanism being put in place in response to the crisis in Ukraine, especially as it affects Nigerians in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides, the minister said there was a high level engagement of the Nigerian government with the Nigerian Ambassador to Ukraine on the matter, with evacuation expected to commence Wednesday, adding that there were 5,600 Nigerian students and about 8,000 other Nigerian citizens living in the troubled nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile stating that some Nigerians had successfully crossed borders to Ukraine\u2019s neighbouring countries, the minister said he had gotten approval of President Muhammadu Buhari to evacuate the stranded citizens, even as he stressed that some of them were however, not willing to leave the country.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the meeting, Speaker Gbajabiamila noted that the House was deeply worried over the crisis, and its escalation, urging speedy evacuation of stranded Nigerians.\n\n\n\nHe said many Nigerians did not believe Russia would invade Ukraine until the crisis erupted.\n\n\n\nGbajabiamila said the House was ready to approve any supplementary budget the executive may send to the parliament if need be, to cater for such emergencies.\n\n\n\nThe lawmaker further called for a closer working relationship between the ministry\u2019s officials and the House to ensure safety of Nigerians living abroad.\n\n\n\nAngry parents\n\nMeanwhile, scores of parents whose children are currently trapped in Ukraine Monday besieged the Russian Embassy in Abuja to demand the safety of their wards and immediate evacuation efforts by the Nigerian Government.\n\n\n\nThe Concerned Parents, led by Barrister Ada Njoku, urged the Russian Government to ensure they do all within their powers to bring their children back home alive.\n\n\n\nShe lauded the federal government\u2019s efforts at making necessary arrangements to evacuate some of the stranded Nigerians to Poland.\n\nNigerian government had listed four borders in Ukraine where its citizens seeking to leave the country can be evacuated.\n\n\n\nThe parents wondered why it has suddenly become a crime for Nigerians to migrate abroad in search of better and greener pastures.\n\n\n\nAnother visibly angry parent, Blessing David, said her daughter had been in Ukraine for more than five years for studies and that she never knew a time would come that she would be highly apprehensive about her safety.\n\n\n\nShe urged the federal government to urgently come to their aid as any form of delay might be disastrous.\n\n\n\nDavid called for urgent prayers and solidarity for their safe evacuation.\n\n\u201dThe Minister of Foreign Affairs should treat this matter as an emergency, while our citizens should stay calm, comply with safety procedures and avoid self-help in order to avoid the mischief of human traffickers,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nNigerian Immigration\n\nIn a related development, the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) has said Nigerians with expired or invalid passports in Ukraine would be allowed back home.\n\n\n\nActing Comptroller-General of Immigration Isah Jere disclosed this Sunday to Premium Times in a telephone interview.\n\n\n\nJere said the government had approved the entry of Nigerians without passports.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigerians in Ukraine without passports are free to travel back to Nigeria. We have spoken to the airlines and other operators to allow them. It is not their fault,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring COVID-19 we could not travel and the passports were fixed to expire on a certain date so we cannot stop it. Each passing day, it draws closer to its expiration date.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Minister has approved that any Nigerian whether studying there or not can return, they will renew it here,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nNegotiation continues as war rages\n\nIn a related development, delegations from Kyiv and Moscow have begun talks at the Ukraine-Belarus border, the foreign ministries of both countries have confirmed.\n\n\n\nUkraine said its goal for the talks is an \u201cimmediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops\u201d from Ukrainian territory.\n\nAl Jazeera reports that Kyiv has sent a delegation of several high-ranking officials, but the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is not joining the discussion.\n\n\n\nRussian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said Russia wants to reach an agreement that is in the interest of both sides.\n\n\n\nThe negotiation comes five days after Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nAnalysts said it is the biggest attack on a European state since the Second World War.\n\n\n\nBy Monday afternoon, Ukrainian soldiers were still trying to resist Russia\u2019s advances.\n\n\n\nIn the face of stiff resistance and devastating sanctions, Putin set Russia\u2019s nuclear forces on high alert, threatening to elevate the war to a terrifying new level.\n\n\n\nRussia has made some military gains in southern Ukraine, experts told Finacial Times, but \u201cthe pace of its advance has slowed and it is yet to take any big Ukrainian population centres, with the capital Kyiv still under government control.\u201d\n\n\n\nZelensky said Monday that Ukraine was braced for a crucial 24 hours, as Russian troops stepped up efforts to encircle the capital.\n\nThe bulk of Putin\u2019s ground forces remained more than 30km north of Kyiv, according to an assessment by the UK defence ministry, their advance frustrated by logistical failures and staunch Ukrainian resistance.\n\n\n\nReinforcements were expected Monday to buttress what appears to be Russia\u2019s objective of taking Kyiv to force a surrender, the Financial Times reports.\n\nHeavy fighting continued around Kharkiv, although media reports suggested that the second largest city remained in government hands.\n\n\n\nIn southern Ukraine, Russian attempts to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea appeared to be having more success.\n\n\n\nIts forces have captured the towns of Berdyansk, on the Sea of Azov, and Enerhodar, according to a Russian defence ministry statement seen by Financial Times.\n\n\n\n\u201cReports suggested that the port of Mariupol, the last big stronghold of Ukrainian resistance that has stopped Russia from connecting the eastern border region of Donbas to Crimea, was surrounded.\u201d\n\n\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry added that its troops had seized territory around a nuclear power plant in Zaporizhiya and that Russia now controlled all of the Ukrainian airspaces.\n\n\n\nUkraine\u2019s military confirmed Russian troops continued to attack airports, air defence systems, critical infrastructure and residential areas around the country and had launched missile strikes on buildings in the cities of Zhytomyr and Chernihiv.\n\n\n\nThe exact death tolls are unclear as of Monday, but the United Nations (UN) has said 102 civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded. The UN however said the figure is likely a vast undercount.\n\n\n\nMore than 500,000 people have fled Ukraine while about 3 million require humanitarian aid, according to the UN.\n\n\n\nUS asks Americans in Russia to leave \u2018immediately\u2019\n\nAlso, the United States recommended Monday that Americans in Russia leave immediately following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\u201cUS citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available,\u201d said the State Department, which had previously urged US citizens not to travel to Russia.\n\n\n\nThe department warned that options for getting out of Russia are dwindling quickly as international sanctions bite, including many countries having closed their airspace to Russian carriers.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe US government\u2019s ability to provide routine or emergency services to US citizens in Russia is severely limited,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\nIt warned of \u201cpotential for harassment against US citizens by Russian government security officials.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe latest guidance came after the department\u2019s announcement earlier in the day that non-emergency staff and their families at the US Embassy in Moscow are now authorized to leave the country. AFP\n\n\n\nDozens killed in Kharkiv attack\n\n\u201cKharkiv has just been massively fired upon by grads [rockets]. Dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded,\u201d the interior ministry said on Facebook.\n\n\n\nThe attack came on the fifth day of the Russian invasion as negotiators from both sides held talks in Belarus.\n\n\n\nRussia is attacking Ukraine on several fronts but its advance has been slowed by Ukrainian resistance.\n\n\n\nVideos shared on social media showed rockets landing in Kharkiv, in what some defence analysts described as typical of a cluster munition strike on a dense urban area.\n\n\n\nRussia has previously denied targeting residential areas.\n\nIn the capital, Kyiv, the bulk of Russian forces are about 30km (19 miles) outside the north of the city, slowed by fierce Ukrainian resistance, according to the UK Ministry of Defence.\n\n\n\nBut street-level fighting continues in several parts of the city.\n\nDespite the danger, a two-day curfew has been lifted, with residents emerging from underground shelters to buy food and gather supplies.\n\n\n\nAnother video circulating on social media showed huge clouds of smoke at a burning shopping centre in Chernihiv, another city that has been under pressure from the Russian offensive.\n\n\n\nHappy to stay alive\n\nKasenya, who spent more than 36 hours underground, told the BBC she had managed to get home. \u201cI can\u2019t describe how I am feeling, I\u2019m happy to stay alive and safe and just have the possibility to see my splendid and beautiful Kyiv,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, on the northern border with Belarus, Ukrainian and Russian officials have ended their first round of talks.\n\n\n\nHopes for a breakthrough are slim, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there was a \u201csmall chance to end the war\u201d.\n\n\n\nA Ukrainian official said both sides would now return to their respective capitals for further consultations before a second round of negotiations.\n\n\n\nThe UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said millions of civilians were being forced to huddle in makeshift bomb shelters such as underground rail stations to escape explosions.\n\n\n\nSince the invasion began on Thursday, her office has recorded 102 civilian deaths, including seven children \u2013 and more than 300 injured.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe real figures are, I fear, considerably higher,\u201d she said.\n\nTo the north and north-east, Kharkiv and Chernihiv were shelled by Russian forces overnight but remain in Ukraine\u2019s control. Shells landed near a shopping centre in Kharkiv during the day, while fighting continued in the streets.\n\n\n\nTo the south, Russian forces are trying to take control of the key strategic port of Mariupol, near Russia-annexed Crimea. Ukraine denied reports that Zaporizhzhia, home to Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant, had fallen into Russia hands.\n\n\n\nHuman rights group Amnesty International also accused Russia of indiscriminate use of weaponry on populated areas, something it said could constitute a war crime.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Lithuania\u2019s government said it would ask prosecutors at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague to investigate \u201cwar crimes and crimes against humanity\u201d in Ukraine",

warnings of a humanitarian crisis.\n\nEight people were reported killed in the strike in Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second biggest city, on day six of Russia\u2019s invasion of its pro-Western neighbour.\n\nKharkiv officials said 10 more people had been killed by Russian shelling on a local government building, and 10 more were found alive under the rubble.\n\nUkrainian officials said the strike on the TV tower in Kyiv killed five people, knocked out some state broadcasting but left the structure intact.\n\nREAD ALSO: US Says Russian Advance On Ukraine Capital, Kyiv, Stalled\n\nIt came after Russia warned Kyiv residents living near security infrastructure to leave their homes.\n\n\u201cThis is state terrorism on the part of Russia,\u201d said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing Moscow of committing a \u201cwar crime\u201d.\n\nAfter a call with US President Joe Biden later Tuesday he said on Twitter: \u201cWe must stop the aggressor as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nRussia has denied targeting civilian infrastructure.\n\nVisiting Estonia on Tuesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the bombardment of Kharkiv \u201cabsolutely sickening\u201d and reminiscent of massacres of civilians in Sarajevo in the 1990s.\n\nStrategic win along Azov Sea\n\nThe International Criminal Court has already opened a war crimes investigation against Russia since Moscow began its invasion on Thursday.\n\nUkraine says more than 350 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed in the conflict so far.\n\nThere was no breakthrough in initial talks between Russia and Ukraine Monday and Russian forces have pressed further into the country.\n\nIn southern Ukraine, the city of Mariupol on the Azov Sea was left without electricity after bombardment, while Kherson on the Black Sea reported Russian checkpoints encircling the city.\n\nIn a key victory for Moscow, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said its troops had linked up with the forces of pro-Moscow rebels from eastern Ukraine in a region along the Azov Sea coast.\n\nBut Ukrainian forces say that despite incursions by \u201csabotage groups\u201d into the cities, Russian

people are displaced within ex-Soviet Ukraine, which has a population of 44 million.\n\nThe UN estimates that up to four million refugees may need help in the coming months and 12 million more will need assistance within the country.\n\nIt has asked for $1.7 billion in urgent aid, while the EU pledged 500 million euros.\n\nRussia has defied international bans, boycotts and sanctions to press ahead with an offensive it says is aimed at defending Ukraine\u2019s Russian speakers and toppling the leadership.\n\nDefence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia would continue \u201cuntil set goals

of armoured vehicles and artillery north of the city.\n\nZelensky said defending the city was now \u201cthe key priority for the state\u201d.\n\nInside Kyiv, makeshift barricades dotted the streets and residents formed long queues outside the few shops that remained open to buy basic essentials.\n\nIn the village of Shaika near Kyiv, Natasha, 51, opened a canteen in the local church to feed soldiers and volunteers.\n\n\u201cThe shelling and the bombing kept us up all night,\u201d she said.\n\nSanctions hit Russians\n\nWestern nations have moved to further isolate Russia, responding with an intensifying diplomatic, economic, cultural and sporting backlash.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday suggested Russia should be stripped of UN rights council membership.\n\nGermany has already promised arms for Ukraine, while the EU also said it will buy and supply arms to Ukraine, the first such move in its history.\n\nTurkey said it would implement an international treaty to limit ships passing through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits, a move requested by Ukraine to block the transit of Russian warships.\n\nAnd global shipping magnates Maersk, MSC and CMA CGM all said Tuesday they were suspending non-essential deliveries to Russia in the latest economic punishment.\n\nWithin Russia, sanctions imposed by the West have begun to bite.\n\nPutin announced emergency

cash.\n\nRussian conductor sacked\n\nThe response from the world of sports also gathered steam.\n\nRussia was expelled from the World Cup and the country\u2019s clubs and national teams suspended from

          "text": "The Principal of Dowen College, Lagos, Adebisi Layiwola has told a coroners inquest that the school was in the process of investigating an allegation that Sylvester Oromoni Jnr was bullied when it got the news of his death.\n\nThe principal gave this testimony on Tuesday at the proceedings to unravel the circumstances behind the controversial death of the 12 year old student.\n\nMrs Layiwola who was testifying as the 10th witness in the proceedings said she has been the principal of the school for the last four years.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWhen the uncle of the deceased came to the school, we were still in the process of the investigation. He received a call from the sister of the deceased in my presence, that the deceased\u2019s case had taken a bad turn. It was not long after, he received another call that the boy had passed on,\u201d she said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Securing Nigeria Requires Patriotism, Says President Buhari\n\nAt this point in her testimony, the Dowen College principal broke down in tears and the coroner ordered a 10-minute break to allow her regain her composure and continue with her testimony.\n\nWhile answering questions during cross-examination by counsel to the Oromoni family, Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana, the principal testified that there was no cult in the school .\n\n\u201cOn the cult allegation, there is no cult in the school. In October, I was informed that the deceased was told to describe the nudity of his sister by some students.\n\n\u201cWe called the students who were involved but we did not really talk to them about being in a cult. We spoke to them on the issue of bullying. We also set up a panel to investigate and make recommendations.\u201d\n\n\u201cDue to the sensitive nature of the case, the boy in question was given an internal suspension, for two weeks.\n\n\u201cHe was made to apologise to the sister and the deceased. He also went for counselling,\u201d she said.\n\nMr Falana also asked if the witness was aware that some parents had withdrawn their children from the school because of bullying allegations.\n\n\u201cNo. I cannot remember,\u201d the principal replied.\n\nWhen asked if she was aware that a parent came to Maroko Police Station to complain that her son was bullied.\n\nShe said: \u201cYes it is true. The boy has been withdrawn after Sylvester\u2019s case, and the boy that bullied him was expelled after the death of the deceased.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your school, do you have PTA?\u201d Mr Falana asked.\n\n\u201cNo, we have a parents\u2019 forum,\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cHas the forum ever discussed allegations of bullying in the association? The lawyer asked.\n\n\u201cI cannot remember, no,\u201d she replied.\n\nDo you have a CCTV camera in your school?\n\n\u201cWe have now,\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cWas it after the death of the deceased?\n\nYes, came the reply.\n\nThe school principal also testified that she did not see the deceased until November 23, 2021, adding that the condition of his health necessitated his admission at the school\u2019s sick bay, with medical personnel treating him.\n\n\u201cThe medical doctor told me the deceased had pain in the hip. I was not in school on Nov. 21 and 22, 2021. As a principal I work with different competent people.\n\n\u201cI did not see the deceased on those two days because I was not given a report on him immediately and his case was not critical,\u201d she said.\n\nMr Falana also asked if the witness asked the students whether they gave the deceased a substance to drink.\n\nShe said: \u201cI did not ask them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be surprised that a black substance was found in the deceased body?\u201d Falana asked.\n\nThe witness responded: \u201cI would not be surprised because I am not a pathologist.\u201d\n\n\u201cUp till now, has your school sent a letter of condolence to the school?\u201d Mr Falana asked.\n\nYes, she replied.\n\n\u201cIt was sent to them via our normal means of delivery. It was delivered by email and WhatsApp,\u201d she said.\n\nThe principal said the next day, a call was placed to the deceased father.\n\n\u201cI called the father to commiserate with him immediately after the death occurred,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBased on the mismanagement of the affairs of the school, are you aware that the members of the school\u2019s board have all resigned?\u201d Mr Falana, asked.\n\nNo, she replied.\n\n\u201cHas the board been dissolved?\u201d He asked.\n\nShe replied, \u201cno.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t you be surprised to learn that members of the board have announced that they are no longer members of the board?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be surprised,\u201d she replied.\n\nThe principal was also confronted with information that the school\u2019s doctor, Mojisola Bisiriyu worked with the American hospital at the same time she claimed to have been employed by Dowen College.\n\nAs proof of this assertion, Mr Falana tendered two documents in evidence, a news article and a website printout, one to show that the board at Dowen college had been dissolved and the order to show that the school\u2019s doctor was in the employment of another company contrary to her earlier testimony that she worked at Dowen College, on Mondays to Fridays\n\nCounsel to the School, Anthony Kpokpo objected to the website publication being admitted in evidence. He submitted that it could not be taken as proof of employment and wondered how the court could establish its authenticity.\n\nMr Falana simply replied that a google search would yield the information to anyone. He asked the court to dismiss the objections and admit both documents.\n\nMagistrate Mikhail Kadiri admitted both documents in evidence after giving the assurance that the court would study them carefully to determine their relevance to the proceedings.\n\nHe adjourned further proceedings to March 7 and 8.",

The country\u2019s defence ministry said earlier that Russian troops would carry out an attack on what they said was the infrastructure of Ukraine\u2019s intelligence services in Kyiv and urged residents living nearby to leave.\n\n\u201cIn order to suppress information attacks on Russia, the technological infrastructure of the SBU [Ukraine\u2019s Security Service] and the 72nd main PSO [Psychological Operations Unit] centre in Kyiv will be hit with high-precision weapons,\u201d defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.\n\n\u201cWe call on \u2026 Kyiv residents living near relay nodes to leave their homes,\u201d Konashenkov added.\n\nAttack on Kharkiv\n\nIn the country\u2019s northeast, a residential area in the city of Kharkiv lay in ruins after a building was struck. The second-largest city in Ukraine was came under heavy bombardment throughout the Monday night and into Tuesday morning.\n\nRussian shelling struck central Kharkiv\u2019s Freedom Square just after sunrise Tuesday, badly damaging a regional administration building and some other structures, and killing at least six people and injuring dozens of others, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nIt was the first time the Russian military hit the centre of the city of 1.5 million people, though shells have been hitting residential neighborhoods in Kharkiv for days.\n\nThe Ukrainian emergency service said it had put out 24 fires in and around Kharkiv caused by shelling, and it had disabled 69 explosive devices.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Andrew Simmons, reporting from the city of Lviv, in western Ukraine, says there is a sense of \u201cdread\u201d sweeping across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are hearing of a lot of fighting in the south, in the area near Mariupol, and that is getting fiercer all the time,\u201d Simmons said.\n\n\u201cAnd people are dealing with a massive explosion, and a number of rocket attacks, in Kharkiv,\u201d he added.\n\nThe UN estimates that 12 million people in Ukraine will need relief and protection, while it projected that more than four million Ukrainian refugees may need help in neighbouring countries in the coming months.\n\nIn Kyiv, Russia warned residents to flee their homes as satellite images taken on Monday showed a Russian military convoy north of Kyiv that stretches for about 40 miles (64 kilometres), substantially longer than the 17 miles (27 km) reported earlier in the day.\n\nHowever, a US defence official said the Russian advance on the capital has stalled as its forces struggle with basic logistics challenges, including shortages of food and fuel, with some units appearing to be gripped by low morale.\n\n\u201cOne reason why things appear to be stalled north of Kyiv is that the Russians themselves are regrouping and rethinking and trying to adjust to the challenges that they\u2019ve had,\u201d said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\nThe official told reporters that it was unclear whether the convoy itself had stalled, but it was not making much progress.\n\nMeanwhile, in the southern port city of Mariupol, Russian attacks seriously wounded several people, the AP news agency reported.\n\nAmid heavy Russian shelling, women in a maternity hospital were forced to stay in the improvised bomb shelter in the basement.\n\nSetting out his conditions for further talks with Russia, Zelenskyy told Reuters and CNN in a joint interview, \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to at least stop bombing people, just stop the bombing and then sit down at the negotiating table.\u201d\n\nTalks began on Monday with Ukraine calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Dorsa Jabbari speaking from Moscow said there was no clear confirmation from Ukraine if it will attend talks scheduled on Wednesday at the Belarus border, according to Russia\n\nSpeaking in a heavily guarded government compound in Kyiv, Ukraine President Zelenskyy said Russia must \u201cfirst stop bombing people\u201d before peace talks could make any headway.\n\nSetting out his conditions for further talks with Russia, Zelenskyy told Reuters and CNN in a joint interview, \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to at least stop bombing people, just stop the bombing and then sit down at the negotiating table.\u201d\n\nTalks began on Monday with Ukraine calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Dorsa Jabbari speaking from Moscow said there was no clear confirmation from Ukraine if it will attend talks scheduled on Wednesday at the Belarus border, according to Russia.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been huge expectations out of these talks to begin with,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut many analysts here [in Moscow] believe as long as the two sides are able to sit down together, there is a possibility that they could find a way out of it,\u201d Jabbari added.",
