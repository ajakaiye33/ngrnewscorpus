          "text": "The minority caucus in the House of Representatives has condemned \u201cin its entirety,\u201d the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria by the Federal Government, describing it as a clear violation of freedom of speech and other democratic rights and tenets as provided by the 1999 constitution.\n\nThe caucus, in a statement issued on Saturday by Minority Leader of the House, Ndudi Elumelu, titled \u2018Reps Minority Caucus Condemns Suspension of Twitter\u2019, described the suspension as \u201cprovocative, obnoxious and unjustifiable.\u201d\n\nThe opposition added that the suspension \u201csmacks of intolerance, insensitivity and aversion to the views, opinions and aspirations of Nigerian citizens, especially the youth, on matters of state.\u201d\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cOur caucus rejects this thoughtless decision of the Federal Government, which amounts to a clampdown and a direct infringement on the rights of Nigerians to free speech as guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution (as amended). It further shows the All Progressives Congress-led administration as one that is unwilling to listen to Nigerians but ready to use any means to suppress and subjugate its citizens.\n\n\u201cThe minority caucus is disturbed that the suspension of Twitter in the country came after the social media platform deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweets. Such response by the Federal Government has raised further concerns over the APC-led administration\u2019s disturbing rating on issues of political intolerance, abuse of rights and violation of rules in our country.\n\n\u201cThe minority caucus cautions that the development is capable of leading to further restiveness among Nigerians and worsen the situation in the country.\n\n\u201cMoreover, this action of the Federal Government, coming at a time the National Assembly is conducting its public hearing towards the amendment of the constitution, may constitute a major setback capable of diminishing public confidence in the exercise as well as other processes genuine efforts by the legislature to strengthen democratic tenets in the country.\u201d\n\nThe caucus, therefore, called on the President to immediately reverse the suspension placed on Twitter so as not to exacerbate the already tense situation in the country.",

From a user perspective, the resources available within the private network can be accessed remotely.\n\nOne of the Twitter users who spoke to Vanguard said, \u201cI have shifted to VPN to access Twitter. They have actually suspended Twitter as I type now but with VPN, you can tweet.\u201d\n\nAnother user, who deplored government\u2019s decision in banning Twitter said, \u201cthey have done what they know but what they don\u2019t know, they don\u2019t know. In this era of emerging technology, there is only little government can do to control Information flow. I think they should know that Nigeria is part of the global community\u201d.\n\nFor Twittter users who still wants to continue to tweet after the blocking, all they need to do is to download VPN then change their location to any other country, It will open instantly.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

In expressing its anger, government, however, ought to exercise restraints to avoid giving the impression that it is intolerant of opposing views and expression of opinions by individuals and corporate citizens\u2019\u2019, the Guild stated.\n\nStressing its concern over the growing insecurity in the country, the Guild advises social media businesses, which provide micro-messaging services, to also beam their searchlight on the activities of those who want to use their platforms to cause divisions and spread hatred in the country and the global community as well.\n\nNoting the socio-political and economic benefits of social media platforms, the NGE notes that strong democracies rely on both civic and political participation by citizens, saying that Twitter, has over the years, aided citizens\u2019 participation in the nation\u2019s democratic process.\n\nThe Guild is aware of the democratizing influence of social media platforms, including Twitter, in helping to check to promote democracy worldwide.\n\n\u2018\u2019Twitter also builds a market research prospect for businesses to see what customers are chit-chatting about, their feeling and what is important to them about products and services.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Guild, therefore, calls on the Federal Government to immediately rescind its decision in order not to deny millions of Nigerians the right to express their views, and the economic those who rely on Twitter to provide services and earn a living.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Ibrahim Apekhade Yusuf\n\nDoes Nigeria have what it takes to enforce Federal Government\u2019s \u2018indefinite suspension\u2019 of Twitter? Some Information and Communications Technology (ICT) experts believe it does not.\n\nA cross section of the experts contacted on Friday said Nigeria lacks a central information dissemination system that is required to make a ban work. President, Association of Telecommunications\n\nCompanies of Nigeria (ATCON), Ikechukwu Nnamani said he received the news with shock and was trying to study the situation to determine what level of intervention is required. Nnamani who is also the Founder/CEO, Medallion Communications Limited, an interconnect clearinghouse and co-location data service company, however, hinted that the Association is already in talks with relevant government agencies to see how the issue can be resolved without any backlash.\n\nBut the immediate past President of ATCON, Olusola Teniola, said: \u201cFrom the look of things, it is very clear that the government is trying to regulate the internet and social media.\n\n\u201cUnlike China, which is a communist country and has a central information system, this is not possible in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, Twitter is still being accessed; it is not inoperative as we speak. So I think it is a mere wishful thinking on the part of government.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead Also: Anger as Buhari suspends Twitter operations in Nigeria\n\nPressed further, Teniola said: \u201cIn the case of Nigeria, it is very difficult to enforce because Twitter doesn\u2019t have a physical office or presence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTheir office is in Ghana. What obtains is that it is the local technology companies that provide access to their services which people access here.\n\n\u201cEven though the government is desirous of banning the activities of\n\nTwitter, it is powerless in this instance because there are several ways to access Twitter.\n\n\u201cI think the government decision would be weakened by the fact there are several other ways to bypass the ban and easily access their (Twitter) service. So there is really no cause for alarm. The digital world cannot be controlled, because it is a global platform.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting to the Twitter suspension, Mr. Akeem Baiyewu, a digital media expert, described it as an exercise in futility.\n\nWaxing philosophical, Baiyewu said the ban on Twitter was tantamount to stopping the wind from blowing.\n\nOn what is the likely socioeconomic backlash arising from the ban, Baiyewu said, \u201cIt is a mere empty threat by the government and cannot stand the test of time.\n\n\u201cThere is no question of whether services would be disrupted. No. People should go about their businesses without any let or hindrance because the ban can\u2019t work here.\u201d\n\nExpatiating, he said: \u201cThe whole world is going global and transparency comes with democracy. In today\u2019s world, if you violate any rule, you face the consequence.\n\n\u201cTwitter didn\u2019t impose its rule on the spur of the moment. It has its own rules of engagements which anyone ready to access their services must adhere to. Twitter didn\u2019t force the government to access its services and cannot expect preferential treatment from the social media platform. They (Twitter) made their rules and the federal government joined voluntarily.\n\n\u201cAccording to Twitter, there was a violation of its rules by the top hierarchy of the federal government and it had to enforce its rule. So, I don\u2019t think Twitter committed any infraction whatsoever.\u201d\n\nHow Myanmar enforced Twitter, Instagram ban\n\nMyanmar which joined the likes of China, North Korea and others in banning the social media first blocked Facebook and shortly afterwards ordered mobile networks and internet service providers to block Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram.\n\nThe Southeast Asian country\u2019s military seized power in a coup in February, detaining its civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi along with other government officials.\n\nFacebook users had reportedly been using the social media platform to protest the coup, sharing photos of themselves giving the three-finger salute that\u2019s become associated with resistance in the area.\n\n\u201cAll mobile operators, international gateways and internet service providers in Myanmar received a directive on 5 February 2021 from the Myanmar Ministry of Transport and Communications (MoTC) to, until further notice, block the social media platforms Twitter and Instagram,\u201d Norwegian telecom company Telenor said in a statement late yesterday. The company provides mobile services in Myanmar.",

          "title": "Invasion plot by foreign herders: Yoruba groups to comb South-West forests",
          "text": "From Lukman Olabiyi, Lagos, Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure, and Lawrence Enyoghasu, Lagos\n\nSeveral security and socio-political groups in the South-West have declared their readiness to repel any attacks launched on any part of the region by foreign herders.\n\nThere are also plans by the different groups to comb the vast forests of the region in a bid to flush out criminal elements posing as lawful herders.\n\nChairman of South West Security Network, Operation Amotekun in Oyo State, General Ajibola Togun, rtd had on Thursday alleged that an invasion of the six South-West states by foreign herdsmen from Mali, Niger Republic, Chad and Burkina Faso, was imminent.\n\nHe also disclosed that these non-Nigerians are already hiding in forest reserves in the zone, saying the invasion by the herders would soon happen and that it would definitely begin from Yorubaland.\n\nIn separate interviews yesterday, leaders of the South West Security Network, Operation Amotekun, Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, and Agbekoya, among others, warned the foreign bandits disguising as herders to steer clear of the six states of the South West, warning of dire consequences if such plots were actualized.\n\nThe groups threatened to deal decisively with Fulani herdsmen or any hoodlum that might want to perpetrate any form of trouble in the region.\n\nChairman, Forum of Amotekun Commanders in the South West, Mr Adeleye Adetunji said his men are battle ready to fight any form of crime in any of the six states of the region. He called for proactive efforts of all Yoruba people to fight the menace of insecurity to a standstill in the region.\n\nAdetunji who expressed the determination of the corps to bring an end to insecurity, especially killing, kidnapping and banditry in the region, maintained that efforts are on top gear to involve local vigilantes in the activities of Amotekun.\n\nHe added that the conventional security agencies were being carried along in the fight against insecurity in the region, stressing that the fight against crime is a collective one, which should not be left in the hands of only the security agents.\n\nAlso speaking, the Field Commander of Operation Amotekun in Osun State, Chief Amitolu Shittu warned herders from any part of the world against coming to the South West region, warning that such efforts would be foiled. He said the forests in the South West would be combed to identify illegal herders, especially those from neighbouring countries. Shittu also cautioned those working for the herders within the region to desist from such act before they are identified and made to face the music.\n\nHe said: \u201cVehicular movements from one place to another is guaranteed by the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Nevertheless, that privilege should not be taken as a way to foment crimes in other regions.\n\n\u201cOur borders are too porous and that is responsible for easy movement of the herders from our neighbouring countries, especially Chad and Niger. The fact, however remains that the South West will not tolerate such illegal migration and anyone caught will be taught serious lessons.\u201d\n\nAare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Otunba, Iba Gani Adams, said the Oodua People\u2019s Congress (OPC), which he heads, has been raising similar alarms has severally warned that the forests in the region had been infiltrated by criminal herders, regretting that such warnings fell on deaf ears.\n\nHe said Fulani headers were indeed plotting an invasion but warned that the perpetrators would meet their waterloo. He also asserted that certain Yoruba leaders were giving support to the activities of criminal herders \u201cby empowering them spiritually and traditionally.\u201d\n\nHe said the OPC members are always battle ready and willing to fight in the defence of Yoruba land.\n\n\u201cThey have indeed surrounded us. We are shocked that when the herdsmen want to establish themselves in any community and the community rejects them, you see Nigerian Army backing them up and forcing them on the community. Then the community can\u2019t access their lands. In a community like Owo, we have nothing less than 10,000 herdsmen in the forests. There are allegations of unknown helicopters coming to drop food for them.\n\n\u201cI said it about two years ago but people didn\u2019t believe me that there are many dangerous herdsmen in Igbo-Ora, Oke Ogun and other parts of Oyo State. They were there until they were chased out by OPC and others. They have almost overrun the Middle-Belt and now in the South-West. The South-East has taken its destiny into its own hands.\n\n\u201cWe have to put our house in order. When we are alerting our people they don\u2019t do anything. They don\u2019t call for advice. Even there are some grassroots people conniving with these criminals. We have some Yoruba people empowering the herders spiritually. They give them our spiritual powers. They also help them to gather information about rich Yoruba people. We also have some members of the political class that give them support. The Obas have a big role to play in this. Some of the Obas take it with levity and when the crisis come, they would call the police, an agent of the government. We are in trouble and we have to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeighbouring countries have always encouraged crisis and banditry in Nigeria but they will not find it easy if they come to the South West. We have had enough political crisis and no crisis should brew in the South West again,\u201d he added.\n\nFulani invasion : Traditionally, we\u2019re prepared for them\u2013Agbekoya\n\nThe foremost farmers and hunters union in South West, Agbekoya Farmers Society, accused the Federal Government of tacitly supporting criminal herders in the region. The group warned, however, that it would not allow the invasion of any part of Yoruba land by foreign herders.\n\nNational Secretary of the union, Adegbenro Ogunlana, said: \u201cIt is the Federal Government that is encouraging and pampering them. That is why it seems difficult to check their movement.\n\n\u201cAgbekoya has what it uses to fight, and we are already preparing. We are not relenting. It\u2019s not until we start carrying guns that we are fighting. We have what can tame them, but we cannot be revealing everything in the public.\n\nThe Agbekoya scribe disclosed that apart from preparing for the invaders, members of Agbekoya would stage a protest on June 12 to express their feelings.\n\n\u201cInsecurity in the land is seriously affecting us. People cannot go to the farm, and there is poverty.\n\n\u201cBut we are very much prepared for the Fulani invaders. Traditionally we are prepared for them. It is only Agbekoya that do fight wars without using guns or cutlasses. That is why it takes us time before we respond or declare war on our enemies. Already, our members are stationed across the forests in South West. We are getting reports on daily basis and there are some other steps already taken as well which I can not reveal. But we are battle ready,\u201d he said.",

Senator Adamu Aliero who led the Senate delegation, announced the donation in Birnin Kebbi on Friday, during their condolence visit to the Kebbi State Governor, Senator Abubakar Atiku Bagudu over the boat mishap.\n\nHe noted that the donation would be given to Emir of Yauri Emirate, who will then give it out to the victims\u2019 families. According to him the Senate is deeply concerned by the unfortunate incident, and will ensure that measures are taken by the Nigerian Inland Water Ways to take away trunks and bursting rocks that could cause the perennial accidents.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have lost many lives from 2003 to date and anytime the water recedes from the River Niger, we will not have this kind of accident. If these measures are taken, in addition to the one to be taken by HYPPADEC, we will drastically reduce the accident and provide succour to the people living along riverine areas.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Uzor Orji Kalu who delivered the resolution of the Senate on the incident, told Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu that the entire Senate members were shocked because of the incident. He explained that the Senate Leader, Dr. Abdullahi Yahyah moved a motion over the incident and was seconded by Senator Adamu Aliero.\n\nAccording to him, the Senate in its wisdom decided to ask the national Inland Water Way to make sure that in the next budget, should provide money to make sure it removes those tree trunks and rocky areas in the river. \u201cThe Senate also plans to make special provision of funds to look around that area in terms of what they will be working with the state government inline with the policy of National Inland Water Way and other relief agencies. Senate in its resolution also asked NEMA to go to the area quickly, to see how they can help the people that have survived and reposition them.\n\n\u201cAnd Senate LSO asked that we should be able to make new laws that will protect our waterways and make sure that such incident do not recur again. The Senate also asked in the resolution that very soon new areas that would improve the waterways should be put in place to take care of the riverine areas.\u201d\n\nWhile condoling the Governor and people of the state, Senator Orji said: \u201c we are really touched in what happened. This is one motion that brought a lot of sympathy, a lot of crying on the floor of the Senate and I can see many of Senators, not only from Kebbi state, but across the country.\n\n\u201cThe Senate President himself told us to come here immediately, first, to condole with the governor of the state, the people of the state, Emir of Yauri Emirate and the people of Warrah where this incident happened and the local government area.\n\n\u201cSo, on behalf of our Senate President, on whose endorsement we are here today and the three Senators from Kebbi State, we want to genuinely ask you to accept our condolences.

          "title": "Alleged random arrest of youths in South-East: FG plotting war on Igboland",
          "text": "By Vincent Kalu, Sunday Ani and Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nAgainst the alleged arrest of several youths in states in the South-East, President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof George Obiozor; First Republic Aviation Minister, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi and former Anambra State governor, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife and others, have raised the alarm that the Federal Government is plotting war on Igboland.\n\nProf. Obiozor, during a press conference in Enugu on Friday, urged President Muhammadu Buhari to halt the use of brute force on the South-East and advised him to rather employ dialogue by engaging all Nigerian groups through their various leaders, instead of his decision to quell rising tension and agitations in the South-East with force.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide called for dialogue to resolve the present national crisis. The Federal Government should acknowledge that because of the reality of Nigeria\u2019s irresistible pluralism, it is always preferable to go for dialogue instead of force.\n\n\u201cMay I repeat that history shows that military and violent means to solve national problem leads to national fractionalization, anarchy and eventual or inevitable disintegration. The Federal Government should realise and be confident enough, that no secessionist forces can defeat Nigeria,\u201d Obiozor said.\n\nWhile urging Buhari to reconsider the use of force in resolving the present national crisis, the Ohanaeze leader asked the government to consider it imperative to conduct urgent in-depth investigations on the destruction of lives and property in the Southeast.\n\nWhile condemning the statement by Buhari threatening to shock some Nigerians, Obiozor urged youths in Igbo land to join Ohanaeze Ndigbo in seeking a peaceful solution to the security challenges.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo wants to make it categorically clear that Ndigbo will not support the break-up of Nigeria but Ndigbo will not be victims of Nigerian unity. In this context, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide considers as unfortunate the implications of the President\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cThe last time I checked or heard a President speak of shock and awe, it was reserved for the enemy, not the citizens. I also want to appeal to all Igbo youths involved in the violence that we cannot change our lots and situations by steering and provoking hatred amongst ourselves, raining insults and abuses on ourselves and declaring war against those who disagree with your own ideas and approach to resolving our common problems,\u201d Obiozor said.\n\nIn the same vein, Chief Amaechi said the killing of Igbo youth was not by accident, noting that anybody who can count his teeth with his tongues knows that there has been a plan to undo the Igbo and if possible visit genocide on Igbo land.\n\nAccording to him, only a tree hears that it will be cut down and still stands on the same place. He therefore called on elders of Igbo land, traditional rulers of Igbo land, religious leaders of Igbo land to come together and examine the whole thing and find a way to stop the killing or \u201creduce the chances of our being killed or genocide being visited on us.\n\n\u201cIt could be tactical withdrawal of some statements and actions of youth that could give ammunition to enemies or apply diplomacy and politics. And also approach leaders from other parts of Nigeria and appeal to them to look and observe what is happening and for them to know that if they finish the Igbo, they will be emboldened to go after the non-Igbo in order to achieve the century old objective, which is very well known.\n\n\u201cThey said they were killing IPOB and MASSOB youth, but most of them are innocent. The elders should talk to the youth, both IPOB and MASSOB, not to give weapons to their enemies to kill them. The Igbo should come together and used their feet to search what has fallen into the water,\u201d Amechi said.\n\nAlso, former Governor Ezeife, has accused the Federal Government of sending soldiers and policemen to the South-East with the sole intention to terrorise and kill the people, particularly the young men.\n\nEzeife, who said the incident had been going on for almost two weeks now, corroborated it with the instruction by the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to officers recently deployed to the South-East for special assignment, to deal ruthlessly with the people without bothering about human rights violations.\n\nAccording to him, since then, there have been gory pictures and stories of what have been happening in the East.\n\n\u201cI have been saying that the Buhari-led Federal Government is pushing the Southeast out of Nigeria. How can you explain that in a country where you are a citizen, your children are being massacred like that?\u201d\n\nHe alleged that the soldiers are targeting young men so that when the full war is declared, there won\u2019t be any young men to fight back. This, he said is the preliminary aspect of the war, and it is intended to kill all the young men who can come out and fight and leave the old men who can\u2019t even hold a gun.\n\n\u201cThis is what I see with my eyes. I can\u2019t understand how a president of Nigeria can be showing such a level of hatred for a part of the country he is governing,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer National Vice President of the Nigeria Bar Association, Monday Ubani, said he has read about such reports but was yet to get an independent confirmation from the governments in the South-East.\n\nHe said if the development is true, then the quietness of the governors, the senators and House of Representatives members from the South-East was disappointing, as they were the right people expected to raise the alarm.\n\nPresident General of Igbo Speaking Community in Lagos, Chief Sunday Ude, said what is happening in the South-East is very bad and unfair.\n\nHe called on the Federal Government to stop the killing as a matter of urgency because it is getting out of hand.",
          "summary": "\u201cMay I repeat that history shows that military and violent means to solve national problem leads to national fractionalization, anarchy and eventual or inevitable disintegration.\nThe Federal Government should realise and be confident enough, that no secessionist forces can defeat Nigeria,\u201d Obiozor said.\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo wants to make it categorically clear that Ndigbo will not support the break-up of Nigeria but Ndigbo will not be victims of Nigerian unity.\n\u201cI have been saying that the Buhari-led Federal Government is pushing the Southeast out of Nigeria.\nPresident General of Igbo Speaking Community in Lagos, Chief Sunday Ude, said what is happening in the South-East is very bad and unfair.",

          "text": "\u2022Experts doubt ability to enforce order\n\n\u2022Twitter says \u2018suspension deeply concerning\u2019\n\n\u2022NBC now to license social media\n\n\u2022Nigerian Tweeps prepare to use Virtual Private Networks\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nIn a shocking overreaction, the federal government yesterday announced the suspension of the operations of micro-blogging platform/social networking service provider, Twitter, in the country.\n\nThis was apparently in response to Twitter\u2019s deletion of a \u201ccivil war\u201d post by President Muhammadu Buhari, which the social media platform said violated its policies.\n\nThe suspension of Twitter, popularly among Nigerians, sent shock across the country, with many describing the action as illegal and an infringement on their freedom of expression.\n\nOwners of the micro-blogging platform also reacted, saying the suspension is \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d.\n\nBut experts punched holes in federal government\u2019s ability to enforce the suspension of Twitter and deny Nigerians access to the platform, given the availability of other options of accessing the micro-blog, like using Virtual Private Networks (VPN), geo-location changes and other technologies.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, in a statement signed by his media aide, Segun Adeyemi, said the measure against Twitter \u201cis with immediate effect.\u201d\n\nThe announcement by the Information Minister cited the \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe statement titled, \u2018FG Suspends Twitter\u2019s Operations in Nigeria\u2019, read: \u201cThe Federal Government has suspended indefinitely the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn the press statement, Lai Mohammed also announced that the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) would immediately commence the process of licensing all social media operations in Nigeria. The NBC is the regulator of all radio and television stations in Nigeria.\n\nHowever, as at press time, Twitter was still up in Nigeria, as users still had access to the platform.\n\nPresident Buhari had condemned the attacks on police stations, prisons and offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission, especially in the South-East, warning that those supporting insurrection and violence in the country would be shocked.\n\nBuhari had tweeted, \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe President\u2019s tweet riled some persons who felt he was insensitive to have made an analogy of the civil war. His critics subsequently reported the tweet to Twitter and the microblogging site later deleted the post with a comment, \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules\u201d.\n\nAnalysts said yesterday that Twitter was not unfair to Buhari as being claimed, \u201cbecause a second Tweet by the Nigerian President that said almost the same thing as the \u2018civil war\u2019 Tweet was not deleted.\u201d\n\nDisapprovals Trail Suspension\n\nThe former vice president and PDP\u2019s presidential candidate in the last general election, Atiku Abubakar said in his verified twitter handle that the Twitter ban would not affect him.\n\nAtiku said in a single tweet: \u201cHopefully, this isn\u2019t my last tweet. #smile\u201d\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki remarked: \u201cNo sir, this should not be the response from the President of a nation with a vibrant youthful population for whom the #Twitter is part of their daily lives and a source of their income and livelihood. This must be reviewed.\u201d\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) vehemently rejected the Twitter suspension, describing it as a draconian action and a slide towards a fascist regime in our country.\n\nThe party asserted that the suspension \u201cis a vexatious, condemnable and barbaric move to muzzle Nigerians, particularly the youth, ostensibly to prevent them from holding the overtly corrupt, vindictive and divisive Buhari administration accountable for its atrocities, including human right violations, patronising of terrorists and outright suppressive acts against innocent Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIn a statement by their National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP said, \u201cOur party is appalled that the Federal Government could exhibit such primitive intolerance and power intoxication because the social media giant demonstrated international best practices in not allowing the Buhari presidency to use Twitter as a platform to propagate and spread the Buhari administration\u2019s hatred towards Nigerians.\u201d\n\nCivil society organisation, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) vowed to sue the federal government over its suspension of Twitter.\n\nIn a statement released yesterday, SERAP said, \u201cNigerians have a right to freedom of expression and access to information, including online, and we plan to fight to keep it that way. Nigeria, we\u2019ll see in court.\u201d\n\nThe British embassy in Nigeria also condemned the Twitter suspension.\n\nAccording to the British Deputy High Commissioner in Abuja, Gill Atkinson, the federal government must not suppress basic freedom as all Nigerians have the right to freedom of speech.\n\nTweeting from @GillAtkinson11, she said: \u201cAll Nigerians have the right to freedom of speech and the responsibility not to misuse that right. Any action taken by Government must be measured, proportionate and not suppress basic freedoms.\u201d\n\nHer tweet was liked by the Twitter handles of @UKinNigeria and Paul Arkwright, the former UK diplomat to Nigeria.\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association threatened to challenge the twitter suspension in court.\n\nNBA President, Olumide Akpata, described the decision as illegal.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhether one likes it or not, we are operating a\n\nconstitutional democracy, the primary consequence of which is that everything must be done according to law; and government must be conducted within the framework of recognised rules and principles which restrict discretionary power.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Bar Association finds no constitutional or legal authority to support the peremptory action of the Federal Government to suspend the operations of Twitter in Nigeria and deprive Nigerians of their right to freely express their constitutionally guaranteed opinions. Beyond the dent on our constitutional democracy, at a time when the Nigerian economy is unarguably struggling, the impact of arbitrary decisions such as this on investor confidence is better imagined.\n\n\u201cConsequently, if this decision is not immediately reversed, the Nigerian Bar Association will have no choice but to challenge same in the interest of the public and our democracy.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), said the decision to suspend Twitter shows that Buhari has suspended Chapter IV of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe human rights lawyer argued that the suspension is also at variance with the Freedom of Information Act which seeks to expand information and access to it.\n\nNobel Laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka described Twitter suspension as unbecoming of a democratically elected President.\n\nAccording to the Nobel Laureate, if Buhari has a problem with the micro-blogging platform, he should sort it out between them personally, the way ex-US president Donald Trump did and not rope in the right to free expression of the Nigerian citizen as collateral damage.\n\nHe adds: \u201cIn any case, this is a technical problem. Nigerians should be able to work their way around. The field of free expression remains wide open, free of any dictatorial spasms!\u201d\n\nTweeps Prepare to Use Virtual Private Networks\n\nNigerian tweeps are already contemplating using Virtual Private Networks to have access to Twitter, as soon as the suspension of the social media platform\u2019s operation in Nigeria takes off.\n\nFor most of yesterday, Nigerians on Twitter expressed their displeasure at the federal government\u2019s ban and were suggesting alternative ways to continue the use of the platform.\n\nOne @itzbasito said, \u201cFG have suspended twitter in Nigeria, Please suggest some free VPNs you know jare, let\u2019s help ourselves.\u201d\n\n@UPGodwin shared a \u201clist of VPNs to download while Federal Government Suspension of Twitter in Nigeria lasts: 1. Windscribe 2. USA VPN 3. Nord 4. PIA 5. IPvanish.\u201d\n\n@FestusGreen said, \u201cMinister of Information, Alhaji Lai Mohammed has just announced the indefinite ban of Twitter in Nigeria. This ban/suspension can\u2019t be challenged in Court, because the courts are on strike. They\u2019d earlier banned security and development. Can they ban VPNs, and dozens others?\u201d\n\nPolitical activist, Deji Adeyanju said, \u201cBuhari has added another tyranny achievement to his record: Twitter suspension in Nigeria. Unrepentant tyrant.\u201d\n\nIn another post, he said, \u201cNo shaking I have VPN.\u201d\n\nTwitters\u2019 Reaction\n\nMicro-blogging site, Twitter, says the suspension of its operations in Nigeria is \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d.\n\nTwitter\u2019s Senior Policy Communications Manager for Europe, Middle East and Africa, Sarah Hart, stated this yesterday night.\n\n\u201cThe announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more,\u201d Hart said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022NPC confirms Baba as police boss\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday directed the newly confirmed Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, to take immediate steps towards reducing the myriad of security problems facing the nation to the barest minimum.\n\nThis was shortly after the Nigeria Police Council made up of the President, Vice President, 36 state governors, Ministers of Police Affairs, Interior and the Federal Capital Territory, confirmed Baba as IGP.\n\nBriefing newsmen at the end of the one and half hour meeting, chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Conference Hall of the First Lady at the StateHouse, Abuja, Minister of Police Affairs, Alhaji Maigari Dingyadi said Baba was unanimously confirmed by all Council members in attendance.\n\nPresident Buhari had on April 6, appointed Baba as acting Inspector General of Police.\n\nAccording to him, the main purpose of the meeting was to \u201cget the appointment of acting IG confirmed by the Council that is in keeping with section 205 of the 1999 constitution. It requires the confirmation by members of the Council before he is finally confirmed as the Inspector General of Police.\u201d\n\nHe said the meeting was also to x-tray the security situation in the country with a view to finding lasting solution to the challenges plaguing the country.\n\nDingyadi said: \u201cThe meeting started with the usual presentation of tactics by the inspector General which fortunately, because of his track record, was unanimously confirmed.\n\n\u201cMr. President used the opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment and called on him to ensure that this is worthy of the confidence reposed in him. He tasked him to rise to the challenge and ensure that the insecurity that the country is facing is brought to the barest minimum.\n\n\u201cThe IG assured Mr. President and Nigerians that he is going to work assiduously to ensure that the responsibilities assigned to him are brought to bear and executed to the best of his abilities and to the satisfaction of all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Baba said he briefed the Council on the threat to national security across the six geo-political zones emphasising on zones\u2019 peculiarities.\n\nThe new police boss also talked tough on the activities of the proscribed Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) and herders, saying his administration would checkmate their activities and rid the country of every other criminal activity.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are peculiarities, like I said before, in the South-east and South-south is the issue of secessionist agenda championed by IPOB. I also talked about terrorism and religious bigotry in the North-east. I also talked about the issue of kidnapping, armed robbery, banditry and cultism as it affects the North-central and North-west and South-west. I gave a synopsis in terms of what we are doing to address this situation. I also thanked Mr President for providing additional logistics in terms of carrying out our duties and responsibilities.\n\n\u201cIn collaboration with other security agencies, we try to checkmate other forms of lawlessness; criminality and unlawful agitation in order to ensure lives and property are safe and at the same time allow Nigerian citizens go about their lawful business.\n\n\u201cWhat is seriously worrisome in the South East, but it is gradually being checked and results are positive, are the attacks and killings of security agents and distruction of assets belonging to the federal government. Our ability to checkmate this lawlessness has improved and we are getting closer to something positive.\n\n\u201cWe also acknowledge the fact that there are some things that have been done by the federal government to improve police operations, ranging from the establishment of the Police Trust Fund, signing into law of the 2020 Police Act and several other intervention funds, necessary technology and intelligence-led policing will be a reality.\n\n\u201cI briefed Council on adding to our strengths in terms of recruitment for 2020 and 2021 as this will assist us. I also briefed the Council on community policing which has taken off in all the states and how the community police officers are assisting in providing security in their communities because, their operations are restricted to their immediate community.\n\n\u201cI briefed Council on the number of arrests we have made and recoveries in terms of firearms and weaponry that are being used lawlessly. I briefed Council on rescue of kidnapped victims and what we are doing to secure the school children that have been kidnapped and how we are going about securing those in schools.\u201d\n\nAsked if the police was ensuring that political thugs are not meted the same punishment as IPOB members in the South East, Baba said: \u201cHow do I differentiate between political thugs and IPOB? I don\u2019t even need to differentiate them. The issue is I\u2019m looking for anybody who has committed offence or anybody who belongs to a proscribed organisation. So, the issue is it all depends on the level of criminality or lawlessness that someone does to know what punishment will be meted on him. If a political thug commits crime, he is in for it as a principal offender. If someone is sponsoring him, either aiding or abetting him, conspiring with him, they will be taken together.\n\n\u201cThe issue is IPOB is a proscribed organisation and we expect nobody to belong to the IPOB. Thuggery is an offence and anyone will be dealt with according to the law. They are all offenders. It\u2019s just like me differentiating between an armed robber and a thug. It\u2019s the level of crime that matters. There is no way we can say this is IPOB or a thug. It all depends on the level of crime.\u201d\n\nOn the alarm raised by South-west leaders on invasion by foreign herdsmen, the Police boss said it was being taken seriously.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s a statement that will not be taken lightly. We are looking into it based on intelligence available to us. We will deal with the situation and those who are making the statement are also at liberty by national calling to substantiate to the nearest police station.\n\n\u201cIt is not today we have been hearing of foreigners coming in to commit one crime or the other and, in some instances; there are real incidence that some people that were arrested are not really Nigerians. It is not a new thing and whatever level of security we need to provide, we are doing it. We have border patrol police, immigration are doing their jobs in terms of checking illegal aliens. It is possible, but it is not as light as invasion, that word is very strong, we will look into it to determine if actually it is true.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Tegina parents: Kidnappers serious about threat to kill our children; sympathisers raise N11m for ransom\n\nFestus Akanbi in Lagos and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nThe latest mass abduction victims, 136 pupils kidnapped last Sunday from Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School in Tegina, Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State, are all children from poor homes, paying paltry N200 monthly as school fees.\n\nThe pupils, according to investigations, were deliberately targeted by the bandits in line with their new push for the seizure of the poor and vulnerable, following recent difficulties in abducting from the middle class and wealthy people, who have found better ways of protection.\n\nIn a related development, parents of the abducted Tegina pupils yesterday raised the alarm saying the bandits, based on telephone conversation with them last Thursday, are serious about killing their children if they fail to meet N200 million ransom. By yesterday, sympathisers had contributed N11 million towards the payment.\n\nThis trend of kidnapping from among the poor and vulnerable is evident in the series of abductions that have taken place in the last few months in Kaduna, Niger, Zamfara, Katsina and Sokoto states.\n\nIn the case of Tegina School, these pupils from poor homes, study in ramshackle buildings (with help of a charitable indigene), with no iota of security in the premises. So, they were easy prey.\n\nThe middle class and the rich in the listed trouble-states have apparently found a functional way of protecting themselves against abduction, thus forcing the bandits to switch to soft targets.\n\nA lot of abductions of the poor and vulnerable in Niger State are taking place in Shiroro, Munya, Rafi and Mariga local government areas.\n\nTwelve of such poor people were abducted at Malam Bako village, Mariga LG on June 1 and five others at Batati town, Lavun LG on May 29, both in Niger State.\n\nIn Kaduna State, the poor and vulnerable are being abducted in communities in Chikum, Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Kajuru and Giwa local government areas.\n\nIn Katsina State, a lot of abduction of the poor and vulnerable are occurring in communities in Batsari, Safana, Dutsin-Ma, Kankara, Kurfi, Dan- Musa, Jibia, Faskari and Sabuwa local government areas.\n\n\u2018Bandits Serious About Killing Our Children\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, parents of the abducted Tegina pupils yesterday raised the alarm saying the bandits, based on telephone conversation with them last Thursday, are serious about the threat to kill their children\n\nThe bandits have also increased their ransom demand to N200 million. Initially the bandits demanded for N110 million for the release of the victims, mostly girls, with a threat that if by Thursday the money was not delivered they (children) would be killed.\n\nHowever, the bandits reportedly got across to the parents last Thursday evening that the ransom had been increased to N200 million with the same threat after the deadline was not met.\n\nFather of five of the victims and a tipper driver, Malam Ali Mohammed, confirmed the latest development to THISDAY last Thursday night.\n\nMohammed, who was sobbing in the telephone conversation with THISDAY said: \u201cThe bandits are serious about killing our children if we cannot pay. We are poor people, we don\u2019t have such money we plead with the government to come to our assistance.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that public-spirited people in the community had been able to raise N11 million for the ransom demanded, a large chunk of which was by a top political office holder in the area.\n\nIt was also learnt that the mother of one of the victims whose name was not given died on Thursday as a result of trauma.\n\nThe remains of the deceased were interred in Tegina on Thursday evening according to Islamic injunction.\n\nThe state government insists it has set necessary machinery in motion to ensure the safe release of the school children but completely ruled out the payment of ransom to the kidnappers.\n\n\u2018\n\n\u2018Abducted Pupils are Toddlers Who Need Help\u2019\n\nParents and teachers of the abducted Tegina pupils yesterday painted a gory picture of the toddlers in the bush for the sixth day running.\n\nSome of the parents, who spoke on Arise TV, called for the immediate rescue of the kids \u201cbecause they are too tender for the harsh realities of kidnappers\u2019 den.\u201d\n\nThe parents lamented that some of the kidnapped pupils are between ages four, and 13, maintaining that the younger ones are vulnerable to sickness in the bush where they were kept for days without food and shelter.\n\nThe headmaster of the school, Alhaji Abubakar Alhassan, whose two children and a sister are among the abducted, said some of the victims were too young for the ordeals they are facing.\n\nHe also indicted both the federal and state governments for abandoning the school and the parents of the students in their moment of despair.\n\nAlhassan, popularly called Mallam by his community, in an emotion-laden interview, claimed there had been no sympathy from the government, and wondered why the federal government failed to provide the ransom demanded by the bandits.\n\nHe said it was a lie that the government had sent vehicles and motorcycles into the bush for the rescue operation.\n\n\u201cThere is no way people can be in the bush without the community getting wind of this. They can\u2019t be inside the office and begin to tell lies. It\u2019s only the local government official who has been with us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also denied the report that he had prior information of the attack.\n\nThe head teacher disclosed that the abduction had already led to the death of two parents of the victims, warning that more casualties may happen unless the students regained their freedom quickly.\n\nFighting back tears, Alhassan said: \u201cI have witnessed the funeral prayer of one of the parents here very close to the school. She died because she had just one child who is our student. She was not around when the incident happened. When she came back they told her and within 30 minutes, she collapsed and died. That was the day before yesterday.\n\n\u201cA day after the incident happened, another parent died. She had two children. One was sent to the town while the one with her was kidnapped. She died of a heart attack.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m talking to you now, my wife is down. She was put on a drip, she didn\u2019t cook, she didn\u2019t eat. My little child at home, who slept with me on my bed, woke up only to begin to shout the name of his elder sister, asking me \u201cBaba, when is she coming back?\n\n\u201cOne painful thing was that my sister called me before the last discussion with the bandits, crying. She swore that the children are sick, they cannot work. She told me they have removed their hijabs. They have unveiled them. They removed their shirts and they are left with only trousers.\n\n\u201cThere is no food. They gave them kulikuli (groundnut cake). How do you expect them to survive? They took them to unknown environments. I heard people saying they kept them on the floor. When you are talking about floors you are talking about classrooms or a house. No, they are kept in the bush. They are sleeping on the ground, no leaves, not mat. How do you expect them to live like that?\u201d\n\nAnother parent, a mother, Mrs. Hashimu said five of her children were initially kidnapped, but that the two toddlers among them, ages two and four were sent back home while the rest were taken away.\n\nGiving her account, she said, \u201cThe whole incident was terrifying because everything happened in my presence. I was hearing everything. I saw when the bandits were going away with these children but there was nothing I could do. Government is not helping matters at all saying this, saying that, yet we cannot see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Insecurity does not make Nigeria failed state, insists FG\n\n\u2022Presidency: Foreign magazine\u2019s opinion on Nigeria distorted, unfair\n\nBy Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Kayode Fasua in Abeokuta\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo yesterday expressed worry over the state of the nation and blamed bad leadership for the nation\u2019s woes.\n\nThe former president, while receiving a book titled, \u2018The Man, The General and The President,\u2019 written by Femmy Carrena, said in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, that even though the country is destined to be a land flowing with milk and honey, bad leadership has made it unachievable.\n\nAccording to him, the country is currently dripping with bitterness and sadness.\n\nBut despite the worsening insecurity, the federal government has said it is preposterous for anyone to declare Nigeria a failed state on the basis of the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) also said alleged plots by some Nigerians to bring down the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari would fail.\n\nObasanjo stated that although Nigeria is destined to lead the black race, failure of leadership has prevented the country from taking its rightful place in the comity of developed nations.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy prayer is that all of us will have something to contribute to making this country what God has created it to be \u2013 a land flowing with milk and honey.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is a land flowing with bitterness and sadness; that is not what God wants this country to be.\n\n\u201cWe must change the narrative; we must talk to ourselves in the civilised language.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere you go in this country that you will not see geniuses in any section of the country. So, why should we look down on ourselves?\u201d\n\nHe stated that over 14 million children were out of school, adding that if care is not taken, Nigeria would have more \u201cBoko Haram in future.\u201d\n\nObasanjo urged Nigerians to emulate some prominent citizens that are doing well at the international level.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have Akin Adesina running the African Development Bank (AfDB); we have Benedict Oramah running the Afrexim Bank; we have Mohammed Barkindo running the OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries); we have my sister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, running the WTO (World Trade Organisation), and we have Amina Mohammed who, I think celebrated her 60th birthday yesterday or the day before yesterday, who is number two in the United Nations (UN).\n\n\u201cThese are things that should give hope and encouragement for the future.\n\n\u201cAnd each of these people that I have mentioned, are doing fantastically well. We have even at the AU (African Union), Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, who had just taken over as the Commissioner for Political Affairs & Peace and Security (PAPS) of the AU.\n\n\u201cSo why are they doing well there and here we are not doing well? Something must be wrong! We should be interrogating this; we should ask then what should we do?\n\n\u201cWhat we should do is put our house in order, and we can put our house in order.\u201d\n\nThe book was reviewed by Professor Emeritus, Michael Abiola Omolewa, a former Chairperson of United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), and the review was read on his behalf by Ndidi Amaka-Okafor.\n\nInsecurity Does Not Make Nigeria Failed State, Insists FG\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has said it is preposterous for anyone to declare Nigeria a failed state due to the country\u2019s security challenges.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, stated this yesterday in response to a recent declaration by the Council on Foreign Affairs in the United States that \u201cNigeria is at a point of no return with all the signs of a failed nation.\u2019\u2019\n\nFormer US Ambassador to Nigeria and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. John Campbell, and the President Emeritus of World Peace Foundation, Mr. Robert Rotberg, had urged the United States to acknowledge that Nigeria is a failed state in the light of the many challenges plaguing the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s worldwide companions, particularly the USA, should acknowledge that Nigeria is now a failed state. In recognition of that truth, they need to deepen their engagement with the nation and search to carry the present administration accountable for its failures, while additionally working with it to supply safety and proper financial system,\u201d they had said in an article.\n\nBut Mohammed said in Abuja that \u201cNigeria is not and cannot be a failed state.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe stated that the declaration by the council did not represent an official US policy.\n\nMohammed said: \u201cThis declaration is merely the opinions of two persons, former US Ambassador to Nigeria and a Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, John Campbell, and the President Emeritus of World Peace Foundation, Robert Rotberg.\n\n\u201cDeclaring any nation a failed state is not done at the whims and caprices of one or two persons, no matter their status.\n\n\u201cJust because Nigeria is facing security challenges, which we have acknowledged and which we are tackling, does not automatically make the country a failed state.\n\n\u201cLike former US Senator Daniel Moynihan said, \u201cYou are entitled to your opinion but not your facts.\u201d\n\nMohammed said Nigeria did not meet the criteria for a nation to become a failed state.\n\nHe listed the criteria to include the inability to provide public service and inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community.\n\n\u201cYes, the non-state actors may be rampaging in some parts of the country; they have not and cannot overwhelm this government,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe minister said it was not the first time it was predicted that Nigeria would fail or break up.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe were even once told that Nigeria would break up in 2015. But their doomsday predictions have all failed and will fail again.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresidency: Foreign Magazine\u2019s Opinion on Nigeria Distorted, Unfair\n\nMeanwhile, the Presidency yesterday described as unfair and distorted an opinion in the latest article on Nigeria entitled \u2018The Giant of Africa Is Failing\u2019 published by the Foreign Affairs (Magazine).\n\nThe Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, made the condemnation in a reaction to the article.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the publishers of the magazine, the presidential spokesman took exception to the way and manner facts were being misrepresented to support distorted opinions.\n\nThe letter read in part: \u201cThe latest article on Nigeria in Foreign Affairs titled \u2018The Giant of Africa is Failing\u2019 is unfair both to a magazine with such an esteemed pedigree and to its readers.\n\n\u201cFormer United States Ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, has been predicting the collapse of Nigeria for several years. He is of course entitled to his opinions, even where events consistently prove him wrong.\n\n\u201cBut facts should not be bent to support distorted opinions.\n\n\u201cLet me give you one example.\n\n\u201cThe authors write:\n\n\u2018At an April meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Buhari reportedly requested that the headquarters of the U.S. Africa Command be moved from Germany to Nigeria so that it would be closer to the fight against jihadi groups in the country\u2019s north.\u2019\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari did not request that AFRICOM move to Nigeria. The transcript of the call with Secretary Blinken is available on the State Department\u2019s own website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of the invented addition of \u2018to Nigeria\u2019 with regard to AFRICOM. It sums up a piece that attempts \u2013 subtly but revealingly \u2013 to shift facts to suit an argument.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to Shehu, Nigeria faces multiple challenges, not least of which is the dissemination of fake news and prejudiced opinion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is something we have come to expect from partisan blogs and politically motivated lobbies.\n\n\u201cIt is still a surprise, and a disappointment, to see them joined by Foreign Affairs.\u2019\n\nPlots to Destroy Buhari\u2019s Govt will Fail, Says APC\n\nAlso yesterday, the ruling APC said plots by some Nigerians to bring down the administration of Buhari would fail.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said at an event organised by the APC Professionals Forum, in Abuja, that despite the challenges the party met on the ground, the president had recorded successes in the areas of infrastructural development, the fight against corruption and the reduction of poverty.\n\nAkpanudoedehe spoke on behalf of the Governor of Yobe State and Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Mr. Mai Mala Buni.\n\nHe said: \u201cPlans to bring down the government of President Muhammadu Buhari will fail; some disgruntled elements are trying to blackmail and discredit this government with the aim of bringing it down.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari will be judged by security and other achievements. We should not analyse the achievements of this government based on blackmail.\u201d\n\nHe added that despite misgivings in certain quarters, the benefit accruing to the nation through efforts being made by the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy was visible.\n\nAccording to him, the SIM card registration, which has drastically reduced the number of pre-registered sims available for use for criminal purposes has helped in improving the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cThose who are heating up the polity so that people will believe there is insecurity are organising to bring down the government of the APC. We will bring them to book Insha Allah,\u201d he said.\n\nAkpanudoedehe stated that the positive effects of the social intervention programmes among Nigeria\u2019s poor and the vulnerable were being underreported because most of the beneficiaries were neither party member nor did they share in the administration\u2019s vision.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

There must be zero tolerance for all those bent on destroying our country by promoting crime and insurrection!\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe President's Twitter account was reported by Nigerians who understood the last part of the thread as threats against the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its military wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN).\n\nMany reminded Buhari of the consequences of the Nigerian Civil War which lasted from 1967 to 1970, stating that such must not be repeated.\n\nOver 3 million Nigerians, mostly Igbo people, died during the war. Millions of people, especially children also starved to death.\n\nSocial media users likened President\u2019s statement to that of the former United States President Donald Trump which earned the latter a permanent suspension.\n\nTrump's Twitter account was \"permanently suspended... due to the risk of further incitement of violence,\" Twitter had said.\n\nTwitter said the decision was made \"after close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account\".\n\nTrump was locked out of his account for 12 hours after he called the people who stormed the US Capitol \"patriots\".\n\nHundreds of his supporters entered the complex as the US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election. The ensuing violence led to the deaths of four civilians and a police officer.\n\nTwitter warned then that it would ban Trump \"permanently\" if he breached the platform's rules again. Trump posted two tweets further that the company cited as the final straws.\n\nFollowing widespread condemnation of the tweet, Twitter deleted the message on Wednesday.\n\nThe platform said the message by the Nigerian President violated its rules.",
          "summary": "The Nigerian Government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria.\nThe development comes after Twitter deleted President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet where he threatened to treat Nigerians \u201cmisbehaving\u201d in \u201cthe language they understand\u201d.\nBuhari had in a tweet on Tuesday stated that his government will get \u201charder\u201d on those hell-bent on destroying the country.\nTrump's Twitter account was \"permanently suspended... due to the risk of further incitement of violence,\" Twitter had said.\nThe platform said the message by the Nigerian President violated its rules.",

That will be exacerbated in this case because of the strong political connections that earned Rufai a governmental appointment,\u201d Gorma said.\n\nDespite his alleged involvement in $350,000 fraud, Rufai said through his lawyer that he was a man of integrity.\n\nResponding to the government\u2019s appeal on why he should be released on bail, his lawyer, Lance Hester, told the court in Tacoma that his client has a good character, which facilitated his appointment as governor\u2019s aide.\n\nThe reply was filed on June 1, 2021.

See Also CRIME Suspended Governor Abiodun's Aide Faces 30 Years In United States Jail Over $350,000 Fraud\n\nRufai, who served as the Deputy Director-General of the Dapo Abiodun Campaign Organisation in the last governorship election in the state, was arrested on Friday at the JFK Airport in New York, the United States of America, on a criminal complaint of wire fraud for his scheme to steal over $350,000 in unemployment benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department, the acting US Attorney, Tessa M. Gorman, announced.\n\nRufai, aka Sandy Tang, 42, of Lekki, Lagos, made his initial appearance in court on Saturday, May 15, 2021, in New York.\n\n\"Since the first fraud reports to our office in April 2020, we have worked diligently with a federal law enforcement team to track down the criminals who stole funds designated for pandemic relief. This is the first, but will not be the last, significant arrest in our ongoing investigation of the ESD fraud,\" Gorman had said.\n\nThe criminal complaint alleges that Rufai used the stolen identities of more than 100 Washington residents to file fraudulent claims with the ESD for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.\n\nHe was alleged to have also filed fraudulent unemployment claims with Hawaii, Wyoming, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and Pennsylvania. He used variations of a single email address in a manner intended to evade automatic detection by fraud systems.\n\nUsing this practice, Rufai allegedly made it appear that each claim was connected with a different email account.\n\nThe US Department of Justice stated on its website that Rufai caused the fraud proceeds to be paid out to online payment accounts such as 'Green Dot' accounts or wired to bank accounts controlled by 'money mules'. Some of the proceeds were then mailed to the Jamaica, New York address of Rufai's relative.

          "text": "A Nigerian government that is overseeing the headquarters of global poverty, sky-high unemployment, rampant extrajudicial killings and an unabating insurgency has decided that its worst problem is the use of Twitter \u2013 and by extension, all media enabled by the internet \u2013 by its citizens.\n\nThat government, headed by a former military dictator, has rewinded Nigeria to the dark days of press crackdowns and a reign of fear that the world thought Nigeria had moved on from.\n\nIn 1984, Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s military government proclaimed Decree 4 to shutter newspapers, radio and television stations. It was a response to open criticism of government officials. It applied retroactively to journalists and citizens, punishable by jail time.\n\nUnder the same man\u2019s supposedly democratic reawakening a generation later, the biggest independent platform for citizens to bond over grievances, where they come together to pool medical, legal and educational aid, has come under his hammer.\n\nAn infamous ban\n\nAs of the morning of Saturday June 5, most people living in Nigeria could no longer access Twitter.\n\nTelecommunications providers like MTN, Airtel and 9Mobile have cut off access to the social media app and website. Some users say they still have access from some internet service providers, but VPNs have become the primary medium to stay on Twitter for most people.\n\nThe Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), a trade body for telcos in Nigeria, confirmed that they have implemented the Twitter ban:\n\n\u201cWe wish to confirm that our members have received formal instructions from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the industry regulator, to suspend access to Twitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the national interest provision in the Nigerian Communications Act, 2003, and within the license terms under which the industry operates; our members have acted in compliance with the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission\u2026\u201d\n\nThe rest of ALTON\u2019s statement tries to have it both ways: \u201c\u2026we endorse the position of the United Nations that the rights held by people offline must also be protected online. This includes respecting and protecting the rights of all people to communicate, to share information freely and responsibly\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat does that matter? Actions speak louder than endorsements.\n\nALTON confirms telcos have shut down Twitter in Nigeria\n\nBut of course the whole responsibility for Nigeria\u2019s Twitter darkness lies at the top.\n\nBuhari was disciplined on Twitter because his tweet breached sensible rules on threatening violence. In a response that smacks of a thin skin, he has summoned his ostensibly constitutional command of violence.\n\nHis ruse of protecting Nigeria from \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence\u201d rings hollow to everyone who has followed his government\u2019s faltering attempts at keeping Nigerians safe for six years.\n\nBut he did it because, in two elections, Nigerians decided he should. And if he can do this, what more is on the table?\n\nPrepare for the worst\n\nAnother look at yesterday\u2019s announcement should raise an ominous feeling.\n\n\u201cThe Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn effect, suspending Twitter is just the beginning, a taste of a very unpleasant menu that could be served soon.\n\nOver-the-top platforms include instant messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram; Netflix, Shomax and other streaming platforms. Basically, any media and communication service that uses data provided by internet service providers.\n\nBecause they are available over the internet, OTT platforms do not need cable or satellite infrastructure to be available to end users. The Nigerian Broadcasting Commission oversees TV and radio because TV and radio stations rely on national infrastructure and as such need licenses from regulators.\n\nNow, Nigeria wants to license OTTs indirectly through the ISPs that enable them.\n\nIt is not clear yet how this will be done. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram are end-to-end encrypted; will the government demand access to users\u2019 chats as part of licensing agreements?\n\nDon\u2019t say it is beyond the scope of imagination. By suspending Twitter, Nigeria has stepped into the internet control realm currently championed by China, Iran and India, a fellow democracy. Under this protocol, all is fair in love and war against government criticism.\n\nWill Nigeria step up censorship of Netflix by demanding more local content (like South Africa wants to do), or query Showmax for the behaviour of contestants when Big Brother Nigeria returns in a few months?\n\nAgain, nothing is off the table. If anything is off the table with this Twitter ban, it is the alternative means of livelihood with which many Nigerians put food on their tables.\n\nDown with the informal economy\n\n\u201cSocial media has been at the forefront of income generation for digital marketers,\u201d Wale Adetona, an influencer with 176,000 Twitter followers tells TechCabal.\n\nHe believes the Twitter ban will have a \u201cconsequential effect on brand communication.\u201d\n\nGenerally, we can expect brands to be fine. They will find other ways to reach audiences. But thousands of informal economy workers \u2013 food vendors, event planners, etc \u2013 who rely on finding customers on the TL will feel the brunt. They can migrate to Instagram but their posts can\u2019t go viral in the same way.\n\nIf Abuja factored these people in the decision to ban Twitter, it was ultimately decided that the informal part of the digital economy is necessary collateral damage. It was decided that they are dispensable. Maybe they will be referred to join TraderMoni or N-power, as palliatives.\n\nFor now, everyone has been marched through the barricades without distinction. As one suppressed people, united by a history of trauma in the Giant of Africa. One nation under Buhari\u2019s democratically reformed gun.",

          "text": "Twitter has reacted to the indefinite suspension of the social media site by the Nigerian government, expressing concern.\n\nA statement by a Twitter spokesperson to TechCabal said:\n\n\u201cThe announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning. We\u2019re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.\u201d\n\nWhile Twitter does not have physical offices in Nigeria, the platform is freely available in the country and has up to 2 million users, according to some estimates. The government\u2019s suspension as announced by Lai Mohammed, the Minister for Information and Culture, has been interpreted as a potential directive to Internet Service Providers to cut off users\u2019 access to the social media platform\n\nAs we have reported, the suspension is a culmination of a three-day drama. It started when Twitter deleted a tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari for violating its rules.\n\nA few hours after Twitter\u2019s action, Mohammed, the Information Minister, held a press conference in which he denounced the US social media company for having a suspicious agenda in Nigeria. He accused Twitter of enabling violence during #EndSARS protests in October 2020.\n\nIn the end, he justified his suspension of Twitter on the grounds of \u201cpersistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe suspension brings Twitter squarely into the heat of the debate about the intersection of democracy and internet freedom in Africa.\n\nWhen they announced that Ghana will be the location of their first Africa office, Twitter said it was because Ghana is \u201ca champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate.\u201d\n\nTwitter remains available in Nigeria at the time of publishing this \u2013 two and half hours after the announcement was posted on the Information Ministry\u2019s verified Twitter account. It remains to be seen when the suspension takes effect and what actions Twitter takes.\n\nUpdate: Twitter has now been shutdown in Nigeria.",

          "title": "5 Reasons Why You Should Consider A Loan from Page Financials",
          "text": "Personal loans are good for a variety of purposes\u2014from consolidating debt to solving a myriad of pressing issues. They are personal, which means your reasons are yours.\n\nDo you remember the first time you needed more money than you had? Borrowing money then was not as easy as it is now.\n\nYou probably would have run to family members or friends which usually meant nothing was certain, or apply for a bank loan, which was a very tedious process, hard to get \u2013 especially if you do not have an enviable collateral in choice locations, or know someone in top management position in the banks to stand as a guarantor.\n\nThe situation is completely different now. There are financial services providers like Page Financials who have changed the game entirely, they have not only disrupted the borrowing and lending ecosystem but have also shaped how even the banks respond to providing these services today.\n\nWith the intervention of Page Financials, a leading financial services provider, anybody with a verifiable and consistent income, that meets a few other criteria \u2013 like having a good credit history \u2013 can now easily get a personal loan from the comfort of their home.\n\nIf you are still thinking about whether or not to consider a personal loan, we have highlighted 5 reasons why customers usually resort to getting a personal loan.\n\nCash Emergencies\n\nIf you need money right away to cover bills, an emergency cost or something else that needs immediate attention, you can take out a personal loan. Page Financials provide online applications that allow you to complete application conveniently in minutes.\n\nYou could receive funding immediately as well, depending on your past credit history and the information you have provided. You can use a personal loan to cover emergencies like:\n\nPaying past-due home payments and utilities\n\nMedical bills\n\nFuneral expenses\n\nAn unexpected car repair or purchase\n\nWhat you can do with a personal loan is limitless, and as established earlier, it is personal to you.\n\nDebt Consolidation\n\nOne of the popular reasons to get a personal loan from Page is for debt consolidation.\n\nIf you have existing facilities with different lenders, you\u2019d agree that managing multiple loans from several lenders can prove to be challenging. Missing on payments can result in negatively impacting your credit score. Availing a personal loan in such a situation can save you from financial distress.\n\nAll you require to do is approach Page and state that you have some other loans elsewhere and would like to consolidate different payments into one debt with the help of a loan. This method offers several benefits that include enjoying an overall lower rate of interest which can help in reducing the timeframe required to pay-off your loan.\n\nRent, Home Improvement and Repairs\n\nWhether you want to renew your rent or looking to move to a more befitting neighborhood, or simply looking to upgrade your apartment and fix some repairs, a personal loan is a great way to cover the costs conveniently.\n\nThe urgencies that come with meeting these needs are usually unprecedented which is why a personal loan may be your surest way to meet up with the deadline.\n\nFailure to meet up with rent on time for example will lead to series of embarrassments from your landlord, and\u2026you don\u2019t what that. In the same vein, if you see a new apartment that you love and fail to make payment on time, the house goes to someone else that has cash at hand.\n\nThis is why speed and convenience are of essence when it comes to personal loans and part of the USPs at Page Financials, you can access a loan and get support anytime whether it\u2019s 2 am or 2 pm so you don\u2019t have to miss any opportunity again.\n\nVehicle Financing\n\nAuto loans are available if you\u2019re looking to buy or lease a car, but personal loans are also available to finance any need you may have \u2013 including a vehicle financing.\n\nAnother great reason why you should consider a personal loan rather than going for an Auto loans are secured loans and use your vehicle as collateral. If you\u2019re worried about missing payments and your car getting repossessed, a personal loan might be a better option for you.\n\nStarting/Expanding Your Business\n\nSide hustles are very popular these days, and are a great way to test the entrepreneurial waters. If you have one, or you are thinking of starting one, you are going to need some funds to run or expand it.\n\nChanneling extra funds into your side hustle can help you take it to the next level. But if you don\u2019t have the money you need now, taking out a personal loan for your side business may help.\n\nGetting an outright business loan would normally require some sort of security or collateral \u2013 which most startups don\u2019t have, which is why taking a personal loan as a salary earner \u2013 to fund your side business, would be a smart thing to do.\n\nPersonal loans may be well-suited for side hustles because they are often smaller than typical business loans and don\u2019t require a high level of collateral or profitability. All you need is a proven source of income \u2014 and that can come from your current day job.\n\nWhat To Consider When Considering A Personal Loan\n\nApplying for a Page Loan is super easy, everything happens online and you don\u2019t need to visit their office.\n\nTo begin the application, click here to visit the website as a private sector employee or click here to visit the application page for public sector employee.\n\nThe application process is in stages, at each stage, you\u2019ll supply relevant information that helps make a decision to approve your loan.\n\n(See requirements for each category below)\n\nYou can upload all the documents online while filling the form so you do not have to worry about carrying files from one office(er) to another.\n\nThe first stage you will encounter while filling the application form is the BVN and IPPIS verification phase. You will be required to provide these details to help us to verify your identity and financial standing.\n\nLoan Requirements for Private Sector Employees\n\nTo be considered eligible for a loan as a private sector employee, it is required that:\n\nYou earn a monthly salary (minimum 150k monthly) You have up to 6-months\u2019 salary account statement You live/work in Lagos or Ibadan (bankers nationwide can apply) You have a valid work ID from where you work or an evidence of employment or promotion You have a BVN that is actively connected to your working mobile number\n\nSome of the items above will be retrieved automatically when you begin the application, it usually takes customers less than 3 minutes to complete the application if they have the requirements ready.\n\nTo apply as a private sector employee click here\n\nLoan Requirements for Public Sector Employees\n\nTo be considered eligible for a loan as a Federal Government Civil Servant, it is required that:\n\nYou have your work ID You have a valid Government issued ID You have at least 3 months\u2019 payslips You will present a signed letter of authority to debit (the letter is available for download on our website)\n\nTo apply as a public sector employee, click here\n\nReasons to Avoid a Personal Loan\n\nWhile personal loans can be a saving grace in times of great need, there are some instances you should avoid borrowing money. Consider avoiding a personal loan if:\n\nYou can\u2019t afford it. Borrowing money in the short term is one thing, but remember you\u2019ll still need to pay it back. If you can\u2019t afford monthly payments for your new personal loan, consider skipping it.\n\nBorrowing money in the short term is one thing, but remember you\u2019ll still need to pay it back. If you can\u2019t afford monthly payments for your new personal loan, consider skipping it. You don\u2019t need it. If you\u2019re taking out a personal loan to cover the cost of something you don\u2019t need in the immediate future, think about putting it off until you have more cash on hand.\n\nThe Page customer service is available 24/7 to answer any questions you may have.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

That action had since been criticised by some government officials, and decisive action appears to have been taken.\n\nInterestingly, Facebook has also deleted the President\u2019s message on its platform. Could the hands of Nigerian law also fall heavily?\n\nOver the years, Twitter has become an important social media platform for Nigerians. Several humanitarian causes and protests have moved from hashtags to reality. #OccupyNigeria and #BringBackOurGirls are some notable ones.\n\nNigeria\u2019s latest suspension means that it could order telecom companies to block access to Twitter if this move is not fought against.\n\nRecall that there were fears of a possible Internet shutdown, or, at least of social media after Twitter aided in the #EndSARS campaign \u2014 a nationwide protest against police brutality. That led us to curate an informative piece on how to bypass an Internet shutdown in Nigeria.\n\nIt is then interesting that all it took this time was a deleted tweet, for the Nigerian government to take such drastic action.\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Culture has also ordered the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to start licensing other over-the-top (OTT) and social media platforms going forward.\n\nIt is probably safe to state that this suspension might not end with Twitter if the NBC implements the full provisions of its broadcast code. In 2019, Nigerian lawmakers passed a Social Media Bill through a second hearing in record time, and it took several human rights bodies to pause proceedings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, all signs point to the fact that the Social Media Bill could be very much alive.\n\nSadly, Nigeria has finally joined the ranks of African countries that have implemented some form of Internet censorship.\n\nTwitter\u2019s decision to open its first African office in Ghana, while advertising job roles meant for Nigeria might now be deemed a masterstroke.",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you <a href=\" \"> subscribe now </a>.\n\nGood day.\n\nBolu here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nWhatsApp\u2019s multi-device support\n\nBuilding Africa\u2019s Tesla\n\nTwitter launching Twitter Blue\n\nOne WhatsApp account, multiple devices\n\nInstant messaging app, WhatsApp, will soon allow users to simultaneously open one account across several devices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat took so long? Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, says it\u2019s been a real struggle getting the app to function properly across devices.\n\nAccording to WABetaInfo, on June 3, 2021, Zuckerberg said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a big technical challenge to get all your messages and content to sync properly across devices even when your phone battery dies, but we\u2019ve solved this and we\u2019re looking forward to getting it out soon!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not all that\u2019s coming to the app. The CEO also revealed a \u2018view once\u2019 feature which will let users send pictures and videos that disappear after they have been viewed.\n\nWhen are these features coming? Though there is no launch date for these features, Zuckerberg hints at some time within the next two months.\n\nTesla for Africa might be getting closer\n\nBe it self-driving or battery-powered, bringing an electric vehicle to African roads is a challenge for obvious reasons: the state of the roads and a lack of electricity. But some local entrepreneurs have not only actualised this but incorporated the continent\u2019s flair.\n\nFrom electric delivery tricycles used by Kibanda to Siltech\u2019s electric bikes and Jet Motor Company\u2019s cars, an African Tesla could be closer than we think.\n\nTechpoint Africa visited Tolulope Williams, a legal practitioner turned EV engineer, and he detailed his story on how a love for motorbikes gave birth to an EV assembly company.\n\nRead his engaging discussion with our Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter launches premium subscription service\n\nTwitter launched its premium subscription service, Twitter Blue, on June 3, 2021. According to the company\u2019s blog, the service is geared towards frequent users who desire a better experience on the platform.\n\nThe service provides \u201caccess to exclusive features and perks that will take their experience on Twitter to the next level.\u201d\n\nTwitter will roll out the payment service in Australia and Canada to get feedback, and users who subscribe to the service will get features such as Undo Tweet, Bookmark Folders, and Reader Mode.\n\nHow much will it cost?

          "text": "Kibanda TopUp, a Kenyan startup which aims at digitising the food supply chain for micro, small, and medium restaurants in Africa has closed a $460k pre-seed round to increase its customer base.\n\nThe round was led by US-based JAM Fund, with the participation of mPharma\u2019s CEO, Gregory Rockson; Flutterwave\u2019s CEO, Olugbenga GB Agboola; Alarko Ventures\u2019 Managing Partner, Cem Garih; and several angel investors.\n\nThe involvement of local investors like Rockson and Agboola continues a growing trend of African investment in early-stage startups.\n\nLaunched in February 2021 by Co-founders, Njavwa Mutambo and Emilie Blauwhoff, Kibanda delivers goods directly to restaurants via electric tricycles assembled in Nairobi by its partner, ARC Ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCustomers can order inventory such as grains, beverages, poultry, and beef via app or SMS and receive their order the next day.\n\nSince launch, the startup has reportedly served 130 restaurants \u2014 announcing restaurant 100 on May 31, 2021 \u2014 and plans to use the funding to hire critical team members in engineering and supply chain who will enable fast growth and development of additional products.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Tony Elumelu Foundation of which he is an alumnus, Mutambo revealed plans to expand to Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe are increasing restaurants\u2019 contributions to Africa\u2019s GDP by helping reduce cost with the supply chain. We are doubling down on our efforts in Kenya and our next location is Lagos \u2013 the reason being that we have to be where the majority of restaurants are, and Nigeria has a large number of these informal restaurants.\u201d says Mutambo\n\nKibanda faces the problem of solving issues around logistics and transport. To address the challenge of transportation costs, the company uses electric tricycles Kenya leading to a reduction in cost by 25%.\n\nWith plans to expand into other countries, this might pose a challenge of scalability especially in countries where it might not be able to use this to its advantage.\n\nMutambo is an experienced hand in the logistics space having served as CEO of Musanga Logistics \u2014 a Zambia-based Software as a Service (SaaS) platform connecting shippers and carriers in real time \u2014 and Global Lead for Product Operations at Lori Systems \u2014 an e-logistics company in Kenya.\n\nBased on Blauwhoff\u2019s skills in entrepreneurial digital strategy and project management, and Mutambo\u2019s experience in logistics, Rockson expresses confidence in the founders\u2019 vision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLocal informal restaurants are the heart of social commerce in African neighbourhoods. Kibanda TopUp has a great opportunity to drive a transformation of these businesses into a formal restaurant cooperative to maximise the economic potential. I am excited about the team behind this journey as they have the right experience and intent to build a huge business,\u201d says Rockson",

          "text": "No citizen of an African country made the list of 106 richest millennial billionaires in the world, analysis of the latest data on millennial billionaires published by Visual Capitalist shows.\n\nVisual Capitalist, which used data from Forbes, said, \u201cOf these ultra-wealthy individuals, just over 100 are millennials, born between the years 1981 and 1996. This young generation represents around 3.8% of all billionaires on a global basis.\u201d\n\nAfrica, whose countries have a combined gross domestic product to the tune of $2.6 trillion, is home to 1.31 billion individuals spread across 54 countries. From the list, no single individual among the youngest generation of billionaires worldwide is from Africa.\n\nNot that the entire continent is that poor, because some of the countries that produced these millennial billionaires are not as big as some African countries when ranked by GDP.\n\nFor instance, Hong Kong, Ireland, Denmark, Singapore and Colombia have their citizens on the list, but by gross domestic product, they are not as big as Nigeria and South Africa ranked by Worldometers as the 30th and 32nd biggest countries in the world.\n\n\u201cIt is basically about the environment and African countries have similar characteristics. It is about our education system, security, regulatory bodies, and leadership, among others,\u201d said Tomi Wale, creative director, Getupinc, a millennial-centric organisation.\n\n\u201cIf you plant a seed in the appropriate soil, it will sprout and blossom. That soil is not in Africa, particularly Nigeria. Due to the frustrating environment, Nigerian millennials have now made Canada their home,\u201d Wale said.\n\nRead Also: A financial operating system built for Africa by Africans is Appzone\u2019s vision- Emetarom\n\nThe 106 millennial billionaires have a combined wealth of $573.1 billion, with a median age of 35.6 years, and 71.6 percent of this wealth is concentrated in the United States of America and China. The youngest among them is Alexandra Andresen, a Norwegian, aged 24 years and worth $1.4 billion, whose investment interest is in diversified businesses, while the oldest are David Chen, a Singaporean worth $2.4 billion, who has interest in media and entertainment, and Paul Sciarra, an American worth $2.9 billion, who has interest in technology. Both Chen and Sciarra are each aged 40 years old.\n\nBy producing 33 millennial billionaires, the US accounts for $266.7 billion of the youngest billionaires\u2019 wealth, representing 46.5 percent of the total 106 millennial billionaires\u2019 wealth. China produces 22, with a combined wealth of $143.8 billion, representing 25.1 percent of the total wealth controlled by the individuals under study. The United States also has an edge over China in the sense that US millennial billionaires\u2019 average age is 35.6 years while China\u2019s is 36.9 years old.\n\nGermany produces eight millennial billionaires with a combined wealth of $11.7 billion, which represents 2 percent of the total wealth. Their average age is 35.1 years.\n\nBrazil, Russia and Sweden have five millennial billionaires each. The combined wealth of the youngest billionaires from Brazil is $24.7 billion, representing 4.3 percent of the total wealth. The five youngest billionaires from Russia control 6.4 percent of the total wealth which amounts to $36.8 billion, while Sweden\u2019s five millennial billionaires control 2.4 percent of the total wealth of the 106 millennial billionaires, amounting to $13.9 billion.\n\nBrazil\u2019s average age is 35.4 years old; Russia\u2019s average age is 35 years, while those from Sweden are aged 38 years on average.\n\nHong Kong and Norway have four millennial billionaires each, with a combined wealth of $9.9 billion and $9.8 billion, as well as an average age of 34.3 years and 28.3 years, respectively.\n\nAustralia, Canada, Denmark and India have three millennial billionaires each. With a median age of 33 years, the combined wealth of those from Australia is $5.2 billion, representing 0.9 percent of the total wealth. Canada\u2019s millennial billionaires have a median age of 36 years, with combined wealth of $6.8 billion, which amounts to 1.2 percent of the total wealth.\n\nDenmark\u2019s millennial billionaires made their fortunes from manufacturing, fashion and retail. With a median age of 34 years, their combined wealth is $11.3 billion, representing 2 percent of the total wealth.\n\nIndia\u2019s millennial billionaires are worth $4.8 billion, which represents 0.8 percent of the total wealth of the 106 millennial billionaires worldwide. Their median age is 38.7 years.\n\nIreland has two millennial billionaires with a combined worth of $6.4 billion, which represents 1.1 percent of the total wealth. Others such as Colombia, Finland, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom have one each.\n\nBy economic sectors, 34 of the 106 millennial billionaires made their wealth from technology, 15 from finance and investments, 10 from media and entertainment, eight from automotive, seven from fashion and retail, six each from diversified sectors, healthcare, and manufacturing, five from real estate, three from metals and mining, and two each from food and beverages, energy, and services.",

          "text": "At a time when high-yield investment assets are scarce, the non-conventional property sector is taking centre stage in the market, offering uncommon opportunities, while investors look for returns in more competitive environments.\n\nSome savvy investors are, however, taking position in the sector which includes student or young professional housing, healthcare and industrial facilities.\n\nRecently, Eris and International Finance Corporation (IFC) sealed a partnership deal for a new student accommodation platform.\n\nIFC intends to make a R150 million ($10 million) equity investment in Eris\u2019 South African Student Accommodation Impact Investments Proprietary Limited platform to help develop and operate accommodation for up to 15,000 students over the next five years.\n\nIn Nigeria, though investment in healthcare facilities is just gaining traction after the Covid-19 experience which exposed the gaps in that sector, investors are already making waves in student housing and industrial and logistics facilities.\n\nWhereas investment interest in student housing is driven by increasing student population and decaying hostel accommodation facilities in the universities, e-commerce and online trading are the major drivers of investment interest in industrial property.\n\nInvestors are confident that despite COVID-19, which has led some schools to adopt a hybrid of online and in-person learning, demand for affordable student accommodation remains high.\n\nLike Nigeria, where return in student housing is much higher than conventional property, initial returns for South African Student Accommodation projects that traded in 2019 ranged between 10-11.78 percent, according to research by JLL and the IFC.\n\nThese attractive double-digit figures are, clearly, more inviting than the typical single digits given by the conventional property sectors which, according to Olumide Osundolire, a real estate market analyst, range from 4 percent to 6 percent in Nigeria.\n\nAbayomi Onasanya, CEO, Student Accommod8, a developer and operator of purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA), told BusinessDay in an interview that student housing in Nigeria offers exciting returns of up to 22 percent annually, depending on the specification and location of the project.\n\n\u201cWe have already provided over 400 beds across three sites and plan to start construction on 2,500 beds across five sites. Our expectation is that in the next five years, we shall have provided 8,000 beds which, of course, is just a scratch of the surface,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting huge and growing student population for the rising demand for these assets, a recent report by Ubosi Eleh + Co estimates Nigeria\u2019s growing college population seeking alternative accommodation outside poor campus hostels at 70 percent.\n\nThe report quotes UNESCO as saying that there are over 100 million young adults studying courses in polytechnics, universities, and colleges of education across Africa and, out of this number, 15 million are in Nigeria.\n\nOn-campus hostels can provide accommodation for only 30 percent of the university students whose annual enrolment rate stands at 12 percent. This means the opportunity in this sector is huge, more so when enrolment number is expected to grow annually.\n\nFigures posted by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) show that 1.8 million candidates registered for the 2019 Unifi\u00aded Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), and 1.9 million candidates were registered in 2020, which is the highest number in the 41-year history of the board, according to Omorinsola Ipaye, CEO, K.Parkwood Property Services.\n\nNigeria has the biggest university system in sub-Saharan Africa. Though the country has seen a surge in students\u2019 enrolment over the years, that has not been matched by a corresponding growth in quality facilities for student accommodation.\n\n\u201cThere is a huge supply gap which translates into opportunities for investors,\u201d Onasanya said.\n\n\u201cReturn on investment (ROI) is inviting. It gives about 22 percent which is more than double what commercial real estate gives, not to talk of residential real estate which gives just 4-5 percent return per annum,\u201d he said.\n\nIn terms of rental yield, student housing offered about 15 percent in 2020, according to a K.Parkwood report which cited UAC Property Development Company (UPDC) that has the largest Real Estate Investments Trust (REIT) in West Africa with total assets under management (AUM) of N33.5 billion.\n\n\u201cIt has diversifi\u00aded investment in residential, commercial, retail, and industrial real estate, but its student housing project (Pearl Hostel) at the Pan-Atlantic University Campus in Ibeju-Lekki was its highest yielding asset in 2019 with a 6.60 percent rental yield,\u201d Ipaye noted.",

Fr. Fidelis Arhedo made the call while delivering a keynote address to audience at an event organized by the body in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of Edo State, to commemorate the 2021 Child Protection Day.\n\nHe described Child Protection as the safeguarding of children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect, adding that Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Right of the child provides for the protection of children in and out of schools and places of worship.\n\nThe clergyman also emphasized the need for leaders in the community to be supportive of children and families, just as he asked employers to provide family-friendly work environment.\n\nHe blamed lack of parenting skills, drug and alcohol use, poor parent-child relationship, difficulties in managing anger and stress, personal health issues, including low self-confidence, among others for the prevalence of child abuse in the society.\n\nRev.

It has become a source of livelihood for many, irrespective of their political affiliations or religious leanings. Nigerian youths and digital communications organisations earn a living from being able to use the platform to post communications on behalf of their clients,\u201d the governor added.\n\n\u201cOthers who may not have physical stores also rely on Twitter to give visibility to their products and services.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, I believe the Federal Government should be actively interested in how certain policies and actions will affect investor confidence. I, therefore, use this medium to appeal to the Federal Government to reverse this suspension for the greater good of Nigerians,\u201d Mr Makinde said.\n\nThe ban\n\nThe Nigeria government on Friday announced the indefinite suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations, saying its activities are \u201ccapable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe decision came barely 48 hours after Twitter deleted a controversial post by President Muhammadu Buhari referencing the country\u2019s civil war, and threatening those who attack government buildings \u201cwith the language they understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,\u201d Mr Buhari warned in the tweet that was taken down.\n\nAfter condemning the deletion of the post by Twitter, the government on Friday then announced the suspension of the social media platform in Nigeria.\n\nBy Saturday morning, the Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), an industry group, confirmed it had received a directive from the government to suspend access to Twitter across the country. ALTON said its members have implemented the directive.\n\nMany Nigerians and since condemned the government\u2019s action.\n\nTwitter said in a statement on Friday that it was investigating the \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d suspension of operations, and would \u201cprovide updates when we know more.\u201d",

          "text": "The challenges hitherto experienced by Importers and exporters at the nation\u2019s ports and borders may soon become a thing of the past as the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control NAFDAC and the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation GATF have commenced putting together strategies aimed at achieving standardization and harmonization of documents for export and import trade with a view to simplifying trade formalities and procedures and ultimately ensuring ease of doing business in Nigeria.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Director General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye at a virtual meeting with the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, Nigeria top officials led by its Project Lead, Mr. Bernard Traynor.\n\nThe project is being powered by the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation. It\u2019s an organization that is being hosted by the Centre for International Private Enterprise, International Chambers of Commerce, and the World Economic Forum. The project in Nigeria is being implemented by the German Technical Cooperation popularly known as GIZ. The alliance is supported by the governments of US, Canada, Germany, Denmark and government of Australia through their respective agencies.\n\nIn a statement by NAFDAC Resident Media Consultant, Sayo Akintola on Friday, June 4, 2021, Prof Adeyeye who was represented by Dr Abimbola Adegboye, Head of Trade and International Relations at the Agency reiterated measures that NAFDAC has already put in place to ensure that there\u2019s a seamless and more robust operational procedure with both export and import at the borders; and achieve cooperation amongst government agencies at the borders.\n\nShe said NAFDACs focus now is to ensure smooth trade facilitation and regulation, stressing that operations of regulators should not pose an hinderance to trade transactions but facilitate them. \u2019\u2019We are focused on making sure that there are not so many interferences between the users of our facilities and ourselves. So, we try as much as possible to remove both human interferences under the guise of consultants. Because more or less they do not facilitate trade. They tend to distort it\u2019\u2019.\n\nAccording to Prof. Adeyeye, trade should be on basis of safety and quality, noting that, that is the only way trade could be sustained. \u2018\u2019If quality is not put into your product, It gives the country a bad name. They blacklist the company involved. The consumers are the losers because they do not have value for money and their health is compromised\u2019\u2019.\n\nShe noted that these are the issues that the global alliance is trying to address, adding that \u2018\u2019what will make all these visible and possible is to ensure that operations at the borders are seamless.\n\nIf you have perishable items that are to be exported or that are to be allowed into the country and they are delayed unnecessarily, and they are not held at premium conditions such products could go bad, and quality and the integrity of such product would be compromised leading to health issues with the end-users.\n\nAnything that would make trade operations very easy both for inflow and outflow, that would make the whole process of regulation friendly, we are all for it\u2019\u2019.\n\nIn other not to make the whole process too cumbersome for exporters and importers, she stated that for ease of doing business the agency has ensured that all NAFDAC import licenses consisting of approvals, import and export permits have been made in electronic format which can be verified on the NAFDAC single window for trade portal. \u2018\u2019The import of this is that there is no need for any scanned documents when an importer needs to process form \u2018M\u2019.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn his submission, the Project Manager of Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation, Nigeria. Mr. David Okeku, the title for the project is Standardization and Harmonization of Trade formalities and procedures in Nigeria. He disclosed that his organization is being powered by the Centre for International Private Enterprise, International Chambers of Commerce, and the World Economic Forum.\n\nHe further explained that the project in Nigeria is being implemented by the German Technical Cooperation popularly known as GIZ and supported by the governments of US, Canada, Germany, Denmark and government of Australia through their respective agencies.\n\n\u2018\u2019Being an alliance, we also have critical private sector partners,. which we work with: BLM, BSM, DHL, Mascline, UPS and WALMART. On a global scale, we have series of projects which we are currently implementing in Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Zambia, Senegal, Uganda and Latin America, Asia and middle East countries\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019How we work in the alliance is that we partner with multinationals, local businesses because we believe strongly that they will bring in their expertise and also best practices; and also bring in supply-chain companies. We use them as our ambassadors globally and in-country. Local businesses also contribute in form of expertise and resources in kind towards the alliance\u2019\u2019\n\nIn Nigeria, he said the on-going project, Harmonization and Simplifying Trade Formalities and Procedures in Nigeria, seeks to support implementing three articles of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement. \u2018\u2019This speaks to article 10.1 which borders around formalities and documentary requirements, article 8 which talks about border agencies cooperation and article 2.2 which talks on consultation.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to him, the aim of the project is to simplify, standardize and harmonize export and import formalities and trade procedures in Nigeria, adding that it also aims at reducing the average release time and the associated costs, its documentary requirements and border compliance for exports and imports.\n\nHe further explained that the scope of the project is capacity building for border agencies, e.g., NAFDAC, Customs, SON, Quarantine, and other agencies on the ground. \u2018We are also working clearly on defining export data, documents and processes for the Nigeria Customs service, and other partner agencies.\n\nFor now, he said the project is focusing on the Cargo operations in Lagos, after which \u2018\u2019we would then take the lessons learnt and scale it up to Sea cargo operations subsequently\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019Our partners on the ground are the Nigeria Customs Service, FMITI and border agencies like NAFDAC, SON, NDLEA, FAAN while on the side of the private sector, we have the International Chamber of Commerce, Nigeria, MAN, LCCI, the Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents, the Nigeria Private sector alliance, and the Organization for Women in Internal Trade. Private sector companies like DHL, UPS, MARZK are our partners on the ground\u2019\u2019, he said.\n\nMr. Okeku said his organization had conducted a gender study to identify gender specific bottlenecks on air cargo trade, adding that \u2018\u2019We also worked out or defined mainstreaming approaches and series of targeted actives which are currently being incorporated into our work plan\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019In February we realized a memorandum of understanding with the Nigeria Customs as a lead agency for border operations in Nigeria. We had series of capacity buildings for the customs service with trade facilitation related topics. Last month we had an executive master class for the management of the Nigeria Customs Service on trade facilitation agreement issues in Nigeria\u2019\u2019.\n\nGoing forward, he said a policy steering group at the headquarters level which will be chaired by the Federal Ministry of Trade and Investment and the NCS would be set up with a similar group at the operational level on the ground at the Lagos Airport.\n\nHe said a baseline assessment at the Lagos airport would be conducted and agreed with stakeholders on target model and workplan. For the policy steering group and operational steering group, \u2018\u2019we would need a representation at the headquarters level that would be giving the management direct feedback\u2019\u2019, adding that the policy steering group would cut across all other agencies and private sector key partners. \u2018\u2019It would be in form of high-level group in Abuja for policy and decision-making purposes\u2019\u2019.\n\nFor the operational purposes in Lagos, he said there would be the operational group consisting of the clearing agents on the ground. \u2018\u2019NAFDAC\u2019s representative at the Airport with the key IT division would be representing NAFDAC at the Airport committee level\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2019We are having these two approaches for the purpose of fast-tracking our work and for ease of flow of information between the agencies. It\u2019s also a way of enforcing inter-agency cooperation and collaboration both at the high level in Abuja and on the ground in Lagos\u2019\u2019, he said, stressing that \u2018\u2019We strongly believe that this approach will help us in implementing our projects and ultimately help Nigeria achieve the three articles which we are looking at in helping Nigeria implement in Lagos\u2019\u2019.",
          "summary": "The project is being powered by the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation.\nShe said NAFDACs focus now is to ensure smooth trade facilitation and regulation, stressing that operations of regulators should not pose an hinderance to trade transactions but facilitate them.\n\u2018We are also working clearly on defining export data, documents and processes for the Nigeria Customs service, and other partner agencies.\n\u2018\u2019In February we realized a memorandum of understanding with the Nigeria Customs as a lead agency for border operations in Nigeria.\nLast month we had an executive master class for the management of the Nigeria Customs Service on trade facilitation agreement issues in Nigeria\u2019\u2019.",

It was diffident, conciliatory, even apologetic.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Nobel laureate, after much internal pressure, Buhari eventually visited the scene of slaughter in Benue but rather than threaten to \u201cshock the killers\u201d the President asked them to \u201clearn to live peacefully with your neighbours\u201d.\n\nHe said Buhari only later asked security agents to shoot criminals on sight after much pressure, a move which he said was belated.\n\nSoyinka argued that the world had moved on from the civil war and wondered why Buhari still spoke of it with nostalgia.\n\n\u201cThe evocation of the civil war, where millions of civilians perished, is an unworthy emotive ploy that has run its course. In any case \u2013 and this has been voiced all too often, and loudly \u2013 the nation is already at war, and of a far more potentially devastating dimension than it has ever known.\n\n\u201cEvery single occupant of this nation space called Nigeria has been declared potential casualty, children being pushed to the very battlefront, without a semblance of protective cover. We have betrayed the future. We need no breast-beating about past wars. The world has moved on, so have nations,\u201d he wrote",

It is obvious that the author of that malicious publication is uninformed, inert and ignorant of the workings in the NDDC.\n\n\u201cThe commission is well organised, standardised and a well structured parastatal run in accordance with the act setting up the agency in line with due diligence and international benchmark in the award of contract. All documents for award of contracts pass through due process and due diligence and are open for public scrutiny,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "*Say Nnamdi Kanu promised them a lot but failed to fulfill his promises\n\nThree dismissed soldiers who aided the training of over 4000 members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN) have narrated how the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, lured them to join the group, but failed to fulfill his promises.\n\nThree dismissed soldiers who aided the training of over 4000 members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN) have narrated how the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, lured them to join the group, but failed to fulfill his promises.\n\nAccording to the trio who were recently arrested by operatives of the Force Intelligence Response Team (IRT), they were promised heavy monthly pay, an all-expense paid trip abroad for further military training, and the post of generals when the Biafra state is actualised.\n\nThe suspects, Linus Owalo, Godswill Steven and Chinasa Orji, were arrested after operatives acted on intelligence from some members of the ESN, who were arrested during a raid of the group\u2019s hideouts in Imo, Anambra, Delta and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nThe Daily Times on Saturday gathered that the suspects trained 4000 men at an IPOB camp in Abia State, while another 400 were trained at a camp in Asaba.\n\nRecall that the ESN, known as the armed wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has been accused of attacking and killing security operatives, as well as burning of police stations across the South East and South South regions of the country.\n\nPreliminary investigations revealed that Owalo enlisted into the Nigeria Army in the year 2013 and was attached to 102 Guard Brigade Battalion, but was dismissed in 2019, while Orji and Steven, enlisted into the Nigeria Army in 2015 and 2017, respectively and were trained at the 133 Special Force Battalion, but dismissed in 2020.\n\nThe suspects had after their dismissal, joined the IPOB militia and gave them trainings on combat operations, ambush and use of fire arms.\n\nSpeaking on his role in the group, 32-year-old Owalo said that he and the other suspects pulled out of the group on realising that the IPOB leader could not fulfil his promises.\n\nThe father of two and a native of Layal Local Government Area of Cross Rivers State, said: \u201cI was enlisted into the Nigeria Army, in 2013. I was posted to the Guards Brigade Headquarters, FCT Abuja, but in the year 2019, I was absent on duty and the army authorities arrested me.\n\nI was charged and subsequently dismissed from the service. Since then I have been seeking for reinstatement and life have not been easy for my family.\n\n\u201cThere was this man I approached for a job and he linked me to one Mr. Williams, who he said could help me get a job. Mr. Williams told me about Biafra and their dream to achieve a sovereign state.\n\nHe invited me to their meeting and when I attended I was welcomed warmly and I was given a half bag of garri, five tubers of yam and they also a paid a visit to my wife and children.\n\nI then told them that I was making plans to get my reinstatement into the Nigeria Army and they told me that I should forget about it that their Supreme leader, Nnamdi Kanu, will make life better for me, if I train the IPOB militia known as ESN.\n\n\u201cThey also told me that I will be taken abroad after I have trained the militia for me to gain more military training and when Biafra is actualized that I will become a general in the Biafra Army.\n\nI took an oath, swearing my allegiance to Nnamdi Kanu and I also vowed that I will die if betray the Biafra struggle and I was given the sum of N100,000.\n\nI was then moved to a forest in Abia State, where over 4000 men who wanted to be trained were camped.\n\nThis was in October 2020 and I also met some other dismissed soldiers of the Nigeria Army who were there to train the men.\n\n\u201cWe commenced training the moment I arrived and we started with push-ups, moral training, then we moved to fire movement known as field craft.\n\nThere was no board and pen in the forest for us to write on but we trained them the way we could.\n\nThe people managing the camp refused to trust us and they don\u2019t involve us in their meetings.\n\nThree months into the training, they sent us to a camp in Delta State, we met a man known as Be-In-Spirit and he took us to the camp.\n\n\u201cThey told us that when we get to Delta that they will take care of us very well and when we got there we discovered that camp had been shut down.\n\nI couldn\u2019t talk to Nnamdi Kanu. I was just talking to his boys. I was used and brainwashed by IPOB.\n\nSince I have been arrested, I would make sure that IPOB must be swept out,\u201d he lamented.\n\nWhile also making confessional statement, Steven, aged 33, a native of Bende Local Government Area of Abia State, said: \u201c I joined the Nigeria Army in June 2017, and I was attached to the Special Force and I got my four months training in Katogora.\n\nI also went to Kaba Kogi State for another three months training, before I was sent to Takum Traba State for three more months training.\n\nAt the completion of my training, I was sent to 133 Battalion, where I sustained injury.\n\n\u201cI was posted to Maiduguri in 2018 and I fought at Garuda in Maiduguri.\n\nI survived the battle even with my injuries and I wanted to treat myself but the army authorities refused to allow me go for treatment.\n\nWhen the pain became too much, I left to treat myself and when I returned, I was arrested and locked up in a cell where I meet Chinasa Orji.\n\nWe became friends and while in the cell he told me that one of his friends called him from Senegal and informed him that Nnamdi Kanu was recruiting trained soldiers to train IPOB militia.\n\n\u201cHe said Nnamdi Kanu was ready to pay them twice the money they are earning as soldiers. He also told me that Nnamdi Kanu would also take the soldiers abroad and when Biafra is achieved he will make them generals in the Biafra.\n\nI accepted the offer and they paid us N100,000 each which was twice the salary I was receiving from the Nigeria Army. We then traveled to Abia State where we took oaths to be loyal to Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cWe were also taken into the camp where we gave volunteered militias trainings on combat and special forces maneuvering.\n\nAfter spending one month in their Abia State Camp, we were transferred to another Camp, where I spent three weeks training the militia I met there. I left the camp when it became clear that the promise they made to take us abroad for training wasn\u2019t realistic.",

Nigeria pilgrims would certainly experience divine encounter in Jordan as that was the first country where Christ began His Ministry with His baptism at River Jordan by John the Baptist,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NCPC Chief Executive further stressed that the Commission\u2019s pilgrimage to Israel would commence as soon as Israel\u2019s airspace is opened for international travels, stating that pilgrimage to Jordan is not the regular pilgrimage programme of the Commission, but a pilgrimage destination option.\n\n\u201cOne cannot separate pilgrimage and peace, without peace, pilgrimage will not strive.

Are you? I have always said that this Government has a very thin skin for criticism. It is a government that cannot take punches, but delights in always giving punches to adversaries, real or imaginary.\n\n\u201cThe Government knows that Nigerians now express their resentment and protest through Twitter, by telling the whole world how Nigeria has been turned into a corruption haven, and a sprawling field of butchery, extra-judicial executions and slaughtering.\n\nREAD ALSO: Senator Okorocha: Stop profiling Igbos as murderers\n\n\u201cThose in Government do not want the world to hear about their atrocities. So, they just gleefully tell the world that they have suspended Twitter and that they would soon license other OTT and social media operations.

Ifeanyi Okowa in Asaba.\n\nPanti said that the church would also partner with the state government in reintegrating returnees into the state.\n\nHe said that the delegation was in Delta to support the government\u2019s efforts in reintegrating returnees particularly in addressing issues of stigma and shame.\n\nHe said that the church\u2019s reintegration strategies would include the empowerment of about 20 returnees with materials worth millions of naira.\n\nPanti noted that Lutheran Church, founded in 1913, established the Symbols of Hope Nigeria project to contribute toward addressing illegal migration and human trafficking.\n\nHe added that activities of the organisation included awareness creation and advocacy against irregular migration and human trafficking.\n\nAccording to him, the organisation also provides psycho-social support for victims and provides medical care for returnees with illnesses.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the work that your government is doing to curtail irregular migration and human trafficking, and we are aware of your giant strides in ensuring security in Delta.\n\n\u201cAs a faith-based institution, we are proud to identify with your work in these areas, and we are in Delta to support and complement what your government is doing in ensuring that young people are well guided regarding decisions on migration within and outside the country.\n\n\u201cThe church will be empowering 20 returnee indigenes of Delta with items worth millions of naira including carpentry tools, sewing machines, hairdressing equipment, grinding machines, cooking gas, retail shop equipment, refrigerators and generating sets.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that this little initiative will assist the beneficiaries to regain self-confidence and work toward dignified lives,\u201d Panti said.\n\nResponding, the governor praised the church and described it as a worthy partner, adding that the government would partner it and other faith-based organisations to curb irregular migration and human trafficking.\n\nOkowa said that the voice of the church would be better heard than the voice of the government in such issues \u201cbecause the church has the capacity to school the heart far better than the government will do\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, people are likely to trust the voice of the church more than that of the government.\n\n\u201cWe are in very troubled times in our nation, and it requires the church to play its roles of praying to God to impact on our nation. l believe that it is the easiest route to achieving peace in this nation.\n\n\u201cThe voices of our elders and leaders in the church have a lot to do in trying to calm nerves that have been challenged.\n\n\u201cIt is very exciting for me because when the church goes beyond its natural role of preaching the gospel to begin to give hope to the people, it gives hope to humanity.\n\nOkowa said that sometimes it would not be enough to only preach the gospel.\n\n\u201cImpacting lives in several other ways will continue to attract people to the church of God.\n\n\u201cWe are glad that you are giving hope to our young ones by your effort in addressing the scourge of illegal migration and human trafficking in this country.\n\n\u201dIts quite a major problem and Delta is fully involved in this fight,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Nigerians can use Virtual Private Networks to access Twitter now that the social media platform\u2019s operations have been suspended in the nation.\n\nA virtual private network (VPN) is a network that extends a private network across a public network. It allows users to send and receive data through shared or public networks as though they were linked directly to the private network.\n\nOn Friday, the Nigerian government announced the suspension of Twitter through Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture.\n\nThis came after the microblogging service removed \u201cgenocidal\u201d tweets from President Muhammadu Buhari on the 1967-1970 Biafran War, in which many people died.\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Culture made the news in a statement, citing the \u201cconsistent use of the platform for actions that are capable of damaging Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d as the cause.\n\nThe Nigerian government then ordered the National Broadcasting Commission to begin licensing all OTT and social media businesses in the country right away.\n\nThe platform is no longer active in Nigeria, according to a review by SaharaReporters in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nThis article explains how to use a VPN to get around the government\u2019s Twitter ban.\n\nWhen using public networks, a VPN connection allows users to establish a secure network connection.\n\nIt is critical in assisting users in protecting their internet traffic and maintaining their online identities.\n\nWhen you connect to a secure VPN server, for example, your internet traffic is sent through an encrypted tunnel that no one, including hackers, governments, or your internet service provider, can see.\n\nThe ability to alter your IP address is one of the advantages of utilizing a VPN. This means that if you get a new IP address \u2014 which can be from any nation \u2014 you can use Twitter as if you\u2019re in that nation without any restrictions.\n\nBelow are a list of VPNs to download:\n\nNordVPN: it is fast, reliable, top-security, has a thirty-day money-back guarantee, and is used to access worldwide locations.\n\nSurfshark: it does not have an internet limit, cost-effective, great security features, and great unblocking features.\n\nExpressVPN: excelling in unblocking different content, fast, reliable, great streaming features, efficient applications, and excellent customer support.\n\nCyberGhost: fast, secure, consistent connections and great security.\n\nIPVanish: uses a maximum of ten devices and offers excellent services for Amazon Fire TV and Kodi.\n\nPrivateVPN: fast, reliable, and secure when streaming different Netflix content",

          "text": "\u2026It\u2019s a threat to nation\u2019s corporate existence \u2013 CDS \u2018\u20266,145,000 illegal arms with civilian non-state actors\u2019\n\n\u2026Increases insecurity, deaths \u2013 Ex-head of state\n\n\u2026Drives increasing violence rate in Nigeria \u2013 Oxfam\n\n\u2026Land borders, maritime routes poorly manned \u2013 Experts\n\nDespite the efforts being made by security agencies to tackle the myriads of security challenges confronting the country, insecurity is on the increase and experts have attributed it to the proliferation of weapons. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report takes a second look at the issues amidst citizens\u2019 growing concerns.\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor, recently decried the proliferation of illegal arms in Nigeria, saying it was a threat to the country\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nIrabor stated this in Asaba, the Delta state capital, while addressing journalists after a courtesy visit to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, adding that the presidential directive to shoot-on-sight anyone illegally bearing an AK-47 rifle was very clear and must be enforced. While saying Nigeria as a country forbade illegal bearing of arms, he warned that anyone found with such weapons was an enemy of the state and would be treated as such.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe mandate of the president for dealing with everyone holding AK-47 illegally is a mandate that must be enforced because we are a state that does not condone illegal bearing of arms.\n\n\u201cThe armed forces and other security agencies are the only institutions that are mandated to carry arms in the course of their duties. So, anyone who is carrying an AK-47 or any other weapon, for that matter, is considered a threat to the existence of the state.\u201d\n\nStatistics\n\nAccording This Day Newspapers, a March 2017 research report by Oxfam estimated that Nigeria had two million small and light arms in the hands of non-state actors. Also, in October 2020, an Africa-focused geo-political research firm, SBM Intelligence, also raised the alarm that the proliferation of small arms and ammunition was driving the increasing rate of violence in Nigeria.\n\nIn the report, the firm noted that \u201cthe number of small arms in circulation in Nigeria, in the hands of civilian non-state actors is estimated at 6,145,000, while the armed forces and law enforcement collectively account for 586,600 firearms.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the trend of arms proliferation in Nigeria has had an impact on Nigeria\u2019s internal security, which has led to violence and the deaths and injury of thousands of innocent citizens.\n\nA further testament to the harm arms proliferation was doing to Nigeria was the Global Terrorism Index 2020 report, which ranked it the third most terrorised country in the world due to insecurity.\n\nAbdulsalami\u2019s alarm\n\nSimilarly, Nigeria\u2019s former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (retd.), recently expressed concerns over the proliferation of all calibres of weapons in the country.\n\nAbubakar, who spoke during a dialogue session of the Committee with stakeholders in Abuja, lamented the state of affairs in the country, acknowledging that the proliferation of weapons has heightened insecurity and led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) across the country.\n\n\u201cThe proliferation of all calibres of weapons in Nigeria is worrying. It is estimated that there are over six million of such weapons in circulation in the country. This certainly exacerbated the insecurity that led to over 80,000 deaths and close to three million internally displaced persons.\n\n\u201cWe believe Nigeria must find a way out of these problems. Our hope is that perhaps among us, by listening to your different perspectives, we can begin to build up confidence among our people so that we can hold together. So, our hope is that we shall not only share our collective lamentations about the current situation, but propose some concrete suggestions that can point the way forward, suggestions that can inspire more confidence among our people and ensure that our country remains one,\u201d Abubakar, who is also the chairman of the National Peace Committee (NPC), said.\n\nPorous borders\n\nExperts who spoke with Blueprint noted that the increase in cases of banditry, kidnapping, ethnic conflicts, cult clashes, among others, is as a result of Nigeria\u2019s porous borders.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), in 2014, through its then comptroller-general, David Parradang, revealed that although the country had 84 approved borders, there were over 1,400 illegal routes.\n\nParradang, who made the disclosure while addressing the National Conference Committee on Immigration, cited the examples of Ogun and Adamawa states, with 83 and 80 illegal posts, respectively.\n\nA security expert, Dr. Don Belema, in his view, blamed it on the lack of harmonious relationships among security agencies in arms proliferation and poor border management.\n\nHe stressed that the federal government should ensure it builds intelligence gathering for the security apparatus in order to tackle the menace.\n\nHe said, \u201cMost of the arms that filtered into the country came in through most of our neighbouring countries that have suffered some kind of armed conflict in the form of insurgency, rebellion, civil war, and so on. Places like Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Libya, worsen the situation.\n\n\u201cNow, we should begin to ask ourselves: What has been the problem with Nigeria\u2019s security architecture? If we are talking about the security architecture in Nigeria, we should learn to incorporate our entire sister agencies, other than the armed forces and the police. Then we talk about roles, responsibilities and the porous areas, from where these arms come into the country.\n\n\u201cWe have had Customs confiscate rifles that were shipped into the country. We have had them impound 12 cartridges. But those in the security sector will tell you that the problem of the Nigerian security is not such arms like compaction rifles and the double barrels and single barrels because they are firing gauge 12 cartridges, and by law, actually are not prohibited arms. However, they are supposed to be licensable.\u201d\n\nIsa Alkali, a security analyst, said Nigeria\u2019s land borders, particularly in the northern regions, and maritime routes were being poorly manned by those responsible for the tasks. He charged the federal government to revisit the firearms regulations and make it effective.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have porous borders, where many weapons are being brought illegally. There are people hiding arms and ammunition and smuggling into the country. The government needs to look again at the firearms regulations in this country. The law is old; it is a colonial law. We need to look at it and see how to move regulations that could control small arms in the country.\n\n\u201cThere is a committee of federal government bodies that are in charge of small arms proliferation and prevention. The agency should be able to be well-funded in order to do their jobs.\u201d\n\nBorder security\n\nA security/international relations expert and chief executive officer of X-Ray Systems, Mr. Abraham Etukudo, in a chat with this reporter, called on the government to re-strategise and come up with innovative approaches on how to tackle the porous nature of our border.\n\nHe said, \u201cA country is rated by the way it protects its borders from intruders. Nigeria is perennially at the mercy of gunrunning syndicates, smugglers and pastoral herdsmen. The Buhari regime needs to re-strategise quickly on the issue of security in border communities.\n\n\u201cA holistic, innovative approach to achieving operational control of the border is sorely needed now. It is time to re-jig our national patrol strategy. With just a workforce of 22,300 in 2014, the NIS staff strength might need to be re-examined.\n\n\u201cThe allocation of resources, manpower and material, should be based on detailed threats and risk assessments of the borders. Rapid border intervention teams, surveillance systems, radar, satellite and helicopters should be deployed. In the United States, electronic sensors are placed at strategic locations along the nearly 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and over 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must strive to maximise the available resources and apply appropriate prosecutorial pressure and punishment in order to discourage illegal entry into the country.\u201d\n\nInsecurity\n\nIn his view, Dr. Belema said it has posed security and development challenges and resulted in the deaths of thousands of people every year.\n\n\u201cNowadays, if bandits are not attacking communities and kidnapping helpless residents, including students, Boko Haram terrorists or \u2018unknown gunmen,\u2019 usually armed to the teeth, will be attacking security personnel and facilities, carting away every weapon they can lay their hands on in the process\n\n\u201cArms proliferation is enabling the bandits to defy a long list of militancy operations aimed at dislodging them. The bandits have continued to intensify their terrorist operations with recent high profile mass abduction events in Kankara, Katsina state, Jangebe Niger state, Zamfara state, Afaka, Kaduna state and more tragically Greenfield University Kaduna state where five students were executed.\n\n\u201cSecession rhetoric is becoming violent in the South-east and South-west. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) recently attacked the Owerri Prison, freed over 1,800 persons and torched the facility. It also attacked Police Headquarters in Owerri. Many police personnel have been shot dead in the East, and their service weapon seized, further proliferating weapons.\n\n\u201cKiller Fulani herdsmen who have been declared the fourth most deadly terrorist group in the world have also been able to take over whole communities in the Middle Belt and the Southwest by the force of arms ejecting the inhabitants from their ancestral land.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s action, battles\n\nIn a bid to tackle the challenges posed by arms proliferation, President Muhammadu Buhari recently established the National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) and appointed Maj.-Gen. A.M. Dikko (retd.) as its pioneer coordinator.\n\nThe NCCSALW is domiciled in the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) and replaces the defunct Presidential Committee on Small Arms and Light Weapons (PCSALW). It will serve as the institutional mechanism for policy guidance, research and monitoring of all aspects of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in Nigeria and forms part of the ongoing restructuring of the nation\u2019s security architecture.\n\nAmong others, it is expected to help address emerging threats and strengthen the regional mechanism for the control, prevention and regulation of SALW.\n\nIn a statement, the ONSA while announcing the centre, said it was one of the measures to help tackle the general insecurity in the country as it would \u201cBe fulfilling the requirements of the ECOWAS Moratorium on Import, Export and Manufacture of Light Weapons, as well as the UN Plan of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW.\n\n\u201cThe NCCSALW will serve as the National Focal Point on SALW in Nigeria and lead a multi-stakeholder process involving Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs) and the civil society in implementing all national, UN and ECOWAS plans of action on the control of SALW.\n\n\u201cThe centre will maintain international cooperation and also operate zonal offices in the six geopolitical zones to ensure quick response and effective mobilisation of resources.\u201d\n\nBeyond the centre\n\nReacting on the creation of the centre, Etukudo said it was just the beginning of the battle against arms proliferation, adding that what Nigerians want to see is results.\n\n\u201cAlthough we are averse to the creation of new agencies, which often than not do not add much value to the country as it rather increases the cost of governance, I support anything that will help to address the insecurity situation in the country.\n\n\u201cHowever, it must be noted that the creation of the centre is just the beginning of the battle. It must be made to work so that Nigerians can see results. The centre should hit the ground running; working in synergy with the police, military, Department of State Services (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA), immigration and other paramilitary groups towards meeting set goals.\n\n\u201cStakeholders, especially those that man the borders \u2013 land, air and water \u2013 must not allow pecuniary benefits to continue to put Nigeria at risk. They should reduce the volume of the corrupt practices within their ranks that allows the inflow of SALW into the country in the first place.\n\n\u201cThey should work and share intelligence not only with relevant national security agencies, but also neighbouring countries and regional organs like ECOWAS. The centre is coming on board at a very critical time in the nation\u2019s history and it should ensure that it makes the necessary impact,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

They use the platform to complain, argue and give feedback to government and its agencies who in turn, use these to improve policies.\u201d\n\nAccording to the governor, this is a fundamental point that should be kept in mind as we debate the necessity of this suspension.\n\nHe called on the Federal Government to show an active interest in how certain their policies and actions affect investor confidence.\n\nTwitter Suspension\n\nSeyi Makide\u2019s statement is in reaction to the announcement by the Federal Government of Nigeria suspension of Twitter in the country.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed,\n\nannounced the suspension in a statement issued by his office in Abuja.\n\nHe cited the persistent use of the platform for activities that are \u201ccapable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.",

          "title": "\u2018There is Stuff\u2019: Enduring Mysteries Trail US Report on UFOs",
          "text": "The blob, captured on distant, fuzzy video by Navy pilots, seems to skitter just above the ocean waves at improbable speed, with no discernible means of propulsion or lift. \u201cOh my gosh, man,\u201d one aviator says to another as they laugh at the oddity. \u201cWhat\u2026 is it?\u201d\n\nIs it a bird? A plane? Super drone? An extraterrestrial something?\n\nThe U.S. government has been taking a hard look at unidentified flying objects like this one. A report summarizing what the U.S. knows about \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena\u201d \u2014 better known as UFOs \u2014 is expected to be made public this month.\n\nThere won\u2019t be an alien unmasking. Two officials briefed on the report say it found no extraterrestrial link to the sightings reported and captured on video. The report won\u2019t rule out a link to another country, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss it.\n\nWhile the broad conclusions have now been reported, the full report may still present a broader picture of what the government knows. The anticipation surrounding the report shows how a topic normally confined to science fiction and a small, often dismissed group of researchers has hit the mainstream.\n\nWorried about national security threats from adversaries, lawmakers ordered an investigation and public accounting of phenomena that the government has been loath to talk about for generations.\n\n\u201cThere is stuff flying in our airspace,\u201d Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, one of the senators who pressed for the probe, recently told Fox News. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what it is. We need to find out.\u201d\n\nCongress late last year instructed the director of national intelligence to provide \u201ca detailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data\u201d from multiple agencies and report in 180 days. That time is about up. The intelligence office wouldn\u2019t say this past week when the full document will be out.\n\nThe bill passed by Congress asks the intelligence director for \u201cany incidents or patterns that indicate a potential adversary may have achieved breakthrough aerospace capabilities that could put United States strategic or conventional forces at risk.\u201d\n\nThe chief concern is whether hostile countries are fielding aerial technology so advanced and weird that it befuddles and threatens the world\u2019s largest military power. But when lawmakers talk about it, they tend to leave themselves a little wiggle room in case it\u2019s something else \u2014 whether more prosaic than a military rival or, you know, more cosmic.\n\n\u201cRight now there are a lot of unanswered questions,\u201d Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California told NBC this week. \u201cIf other nations have capabilities that we don\u2019t know of, we want to find out. If there\u2019s some explanation other than that, we want to learn that, too.\u201d\n\nLuis Elizondo, former head of the Pentagon\u2019s Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, said he didn\u2019t believe that the sightings were of a foreign power\u2019s technology in part because it would have been nearly impossible to keep that secret. Elizondo has accused the Defense Department of trying to discredit him and says there\u2019s much more information that the U.S. has kept classified.\n\n\u201cWe live in an incredible universe,\u201d Elizondo said. \u201cThere are all sorts of hypotheses that suggest that the three-dimensional universe which we live in isn\u2019t quite so easy to explain.\u201d\n\nBut Michael Shermer, editor of Skeptic magazine, is sceptical.\n\nThe science historian, a longtime analyst of UFO theories and other phenomena, said he\u2019s seen too many blurry images of supposed alien encounters to be convinced by still more blurry footage of blobs from aeroplanes. This is a time, he notes, when several billion people worldwide have smartphones that take crisp images and satellites precisely render detail on the ground.\n\n\u201cShow me the body, show me the spacecraft, or show me the really high-quality videos and photographs,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll believe.\u201d\n\nMick West, a prominent researcher of unexplained phenomena and debunker of conspiracy theories, said it was right for the government to investigate and report on the potential national security implications of sightings captured in now-declassified videos.\n\n\u201cAny time there is some kind of unidentified object coming through military airspace, that\u2019s a real issue that needs to be looked into,\u201d he told AP.\n\n\u201cBut the videos, even though they\u2019re showing unidentified objects, they\u2019re not showing amazing unidentified objects.\u201d\n\nPilots and sky-watchers have long reported sporadic sightings of UFOs in U.S. airspace, seemingly at unusual speeds or trajectories. In most cases, those mysteries evaporate under examination.\n\nIn 1960, the CIA said 6,500 objects had been reported to the U.S. Air Force over the prior 13 years. The Air Force concluded there was no evidence those sightings were \u201cinimical or hostile\u201d or related to \u201cinterplanetary space ships,\u201d the CIA said.\n\nReports of UFOs have, of course, persisted since then. Some people who study the topic argue investigations have been limited by the stigma of being linked to conspiracy theories or talk of little green men storming Earth. They note that the government has a history of stonewalling and lying about the unexplained.\n\nIt took 50 years for the government to offer what it hoped was a full debunking of claims that alien bodies were recovered at a crash site in New Mexico in 1947. In 1997, the Air Force said the Roswell \u201cbodies\u2033 were dummies used in parachute tests, recent ancestors of the car-crash dummies of today.\n\nRetired Air Force Col. Richard Weaver, who wrote one of the official reports on the Roswell rumours, tried to assure the public that the government isn\u2019t competent enough to cover up a genuine alien sighting. \u201cWe have a hard time keeping a secret,\u201d he said, \u201clet alone putting together a decent conspiracy.\u201d\n\nA recent turning point came in December 2017, when The New York Times revealed a five-year Pentagon program to investigate UFOs. The Pentagon subsequently released videos, leaked earlier, of military pilots encountering shadowy objects they couldn\u2019t identify.\n\nOne was the video clip of the aviators tracking the blob above the ocean off the U.S. coast in 2015, dubbed Go fast. In another from that year, labelled Gimbal, an unexplained object is tracked as it soars high along with the clouds, travelling against the wind. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole fleet of them,\u201d one naval aviator tells another, though only one indistinct object is shown. \u201cIt\u2019s rotating.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, the Navy announced it would create a formal process for its pilots to report unidentified aerial phenomena or UAPs. Last August, the Defense Department created a task force dedicated to the matter. The mission was to \u201cdetect, analyze and catalogue UAPs\u201d that could endanger the U.S.\n\nIn an era of increasingly sophisticated drone aircraft, now seen as a risk to sensitive domestic military sites such as nuclear missile bases, the focus has been more on foreign rivals than on any supposed visitors from another planet. Yet the formation of the task force stood as a rare acknowledgement from the government that UFOs posed a potential national security concern.\n\nMore recently, a story on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d featured the declassified videos and raised questions about what intelligence the U.S. government has.\n\nRubio, top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and its former chairman, said it is important for investigators to follow up on the reports of its pilots and make the findings public. \u201cI am going off what our military men and their radars and their eyesight is telling them,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThere are multiple highly trained, highly competent people.\u201d\n\nYet things in the sky are very often not what they seem. Shermer rattles off examples of how phenomena that appear otherworldly may be tedious of this Earth.\n\n\u201cNinety to 95% of all UFO sightings,\u201d he said, \u201ccan be explained as weather balloons, flares, sky lanterns, planes flying in formation, secret military aircraft, birds reflecting the sun, planes reflecting the sun, blimps, helicopters, the planets Venus or Mars, meteors or meteorite space junk, satellites, swamp gas \u2026 ball lightning, ice crystals reflecting light off clouds, lights on the ground or lights reflected on a cockpit window, temperature inversions, punch clouds.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor any of these things to be real, we need something more than these grainy videos and blurry photographs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need really some hard evidence, extraordinary evidence because this would be one of the most extraordinary claims ever if it was true.\u201d\n\nAP",

The international community needs to really step up, including through the provision of money.\u201d\n\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, winner of the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, ordered a ground and air military operation in Tigray in early November 2020 after accusing the northern region\u2019s then-ruling party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), of orchestrating attacks on federal army camps.\n\nThe six-month-old Tigray conflict is blamed for the deaths of thousands of people and atrocities including rape, extrajudicial killings and forced evictions, according to local authorities and aid groups.\n\nEritrea teamed up with neighbouring Ethiopia in the conflict.\n\n\u201cThe conflict has destroyed livelihoods and infrastructure \u2026 brought about mass killings, abductions and sexual violence,\u201d Lowcock told Al Jazeera before adding that there was evidence pointing towards Eritrea using \u201cstarvation as a weapon of war\u201d, a violation and breach of humanitarian law.\n\n\u201cThere are now hundreds of thousands of people in northern Ethiopia in famine conditions.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst famine problem the world has seen for a decade. There is now a risk of a loss of life running into the hundreds of thousands or worse.\u201d\n\nHe added there are more than a million people in places controlled by Tigrayan opposition forces and \u201cthere have been deliberate, repeated, sustained attempts to prevent them getting food\u201d.\n\nIn addition, there are places controlled by the Eritreans and other places controlled by militia groups where it is extremely difficult to deliver aid, he said.\n\n\u201cThe access for aid workers is not there because of what men with guns and bombs are doing and what their political masters are telling them to do,\u201d the undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs said.\n\nLowcock said all the blockages need to be rolled back and the Eritreans, \u201cwho are responsible for a lot of this need to withdraw\u201d so aid can get through to those facing famine.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Abiy Ahmed needs to do what he said he was going to do and force the Eritreans to leave Ethiopia,\u201d he said.\n\nLowcock said leaders of the seven major industrialised nations \u2013 the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, Italy and Canada \u2013 need to put the humanitarian crisis and threat of widespread famine in northern Ethiopia on the agenda of their summit from June 11-13 in Cornwall, England.",

          "text": "The Catholic Church must take responsibility for its role in running many of Canada\u2019s residential schools for indigenous children, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday, after the discovery of the remains of 215 children at one former school last month.\n\n\u201cAs a Catholic, I am deeply disappointed by the position the Catholic Church has taken now and over the past many years,\u201d Trudeau told reporters. \u201cWe expect the Church to step up and take responsibility for its role in this.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBetween 1831 and 1996, Canada\u2019s residential school system forcibly separated about 150,000 children from their homes. Many were subjected to abuse, rape and malnutrition in what the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 called \u201ccultural genocide\u201d.\n\nRun by the government and church groups \u2013 the majority of them Catholic \u2013 the schools\u2019 stated aim was to assimilate indigenous children.\n\nThe discovery this week of the remains of the children at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia, which closed in 1978, has reopened old wounds and is fueling outrage about a persistent lack of information and accountability.\n\nFrom 1893 to 1969, a Catholic congregation called the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate ran the Kamloops school, which was once Canada\u2019s largest.\n\nOn Friday, Tk\u0313eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc Chief Rosanne Casimir, on whose land the Kamloops school still stands, told reporters the nation has not received any records from the Oblates of Mary Immaculate that would help identify the children.\n\n\u201cWe do want an apology\u201d from the Catholic Church, Casimir said. \u201cA public apology. Not just for us, but for the world.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, the Canadian government formally apologized for the system. Trudeau said many are \u201cwondering why the Catholic Church in Canada is silent, is not stepping up.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBefore we have to start taking the Catholic Church to court, I am very hopeful that religious leaders will understand this is something they need to participate in and not hide from.\u201d\n\nTrudeau has not directed such pointed comments at the Catholic Church over the residential schools since taking office in 2015.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vancouver Archbishop J. Michael Miller said on Twitter \u201cthe Church was unquestionably wrong\u201d and his archdiocese would be transparent with its archives and records regarding residential schools.\n\nThe Conference said on its website that each diocese is separate and responsible for its own actions.\n\n\u201cThe Catholic Church as a whole in Canada was not associated with the residential schools, nor was the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops,\u201d it said.\n\nSeparately, United Nations human rights experts on Friday called on both Canada and the Vatican to further investigate the deaths of the children found in Kamloops.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable that Canada and the Holy See would leave such heinous crimes unaccounted for and without full redress,\u201d they said in a statement.",
