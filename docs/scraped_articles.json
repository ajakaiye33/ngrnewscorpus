          "title": "Djokovic eyes 20th Slam against heavyweight Berrettini in Wimbledon final",
          "text": "Novak Djokovic admits \u201cit will mean everything\u201d to capture a sixth Wimbledon title and record-equalling 20th Grand Slam on Sunday but he will have to overcome Matteo Berrettini, the Italian slugger with the build of a heavyweight boxer.\n\nDjokovic will move level with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal on career majors with victory and also go three-quarters of the way to the first calendar Slam in more than half a century.\n\nThe 34-year-old is in his seventh Wimbledon final and 30th at the Slams.\n\nOnly Federer, with 31, has appeared in more championship matches at the majors but the fading Swiss star is more than five years older.\n\n\u201cIt would mean everything. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. That\u2019s why I\u2019m playing,\u201d said Djokovic who has already captured a ninth Australian Open and second French Open in 2021.\n\nThe victory in Paris made him just the third man to win all four majors more than once.\n\n\u201cI imagined myself being in a position to fight for another Grand Slam trophy prior to coming to London.\n\n\u201cI put myself in a very good position. Anything is possible in the finals. Obviously experience is on my side.\u201d\n\nDjokovic needed all that experience and famed iron will to see off Denis Shapovalov in the semi-finals where he saved 10 of 11 break points.\n\nShapovalov was so distraught at the failure of his all-out assault that had pushed Djokovic to the brink that he left Centre Court in tears.\n\n\u201cThere is no holding back once you step out on the court, particularly in the later stages of an event that I always dreamt of winning,\u201d said Djokovic after a 20th successive grass court win.\n\n\u2013 \u2018It\u2019s crazy\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cThe dream keeps going. I am trying to take out the maximum of my own abilities every single match and see what happens. Giving up is never an option.\u201d\n\nDjokovic can also win an 85th career title on Sunday while his on-court earnings break through the $150 million mark.\n\nBerrettini, the 25-year-old world number nine, is the first Italian ever to make a singles final at Wimbledon.\n\nVictory will make him Italy\u2019s first male Slam champion since Adriano Panatta at the 1976 French Open.\n\nHe has lost both his previous encounters with Djokovic, including the quarter-finals at Roland Garros last month.\n\nBut he is on a run of 11-0 this season on grass having won the Queen\u2019s Club event on the eve of Wimbledon.\n\nAt the All England Club, he has blasted his way to the final on the back of a tournament-leading 101 aces.\n\nBerrettini also boasts the second fastest serve so far, 223.7kmh in his first round win over Guido Pella of Argentina.\n\nWeighing in at 95kg \u2014 the same as a heavyweight boxer \u2014 Berrettini has also unleashed 254 winners so far to Djokovic\u2019s 190.\n\nHowever, his unforced error count is 167 compared to the Serb\u2019s 126.\n\nThe two men have only dropped serve five times each.\n\nSunday\u2019s final may not be a showreel of shot-making \u2014 rallies for both players are at an average of under four strokes.\n\nBerrettini, meanwhile, has not served and volleyed once in his six matches.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great atmosphere. My first final in Wimbledon, it\u2019s just crazy to think about it,\u201d said Berrettini.\n\nA shock victory on Sunday could be the first part of a sporting double for Italy in London with the country\u2019s football team taking on England in the Euro 2020 final.\n\n\u201cObviously for Italian people in general, but it\u2019s going to be tough Sunday,\u201d he said.\n\nBerrettini is likely to have the majority of the 15,000 fans inside Centre Court behind him.\n\nDjokovic has become familiar with such scenarios.\n\n\u201cPeople also like to see someone win who is an underdog or is not maybe expected to win, is not the favourite to win,\u201d admitted Djokovic.\n\n\u201cBut hopefully people can also recognise also the importance of this match for me, the history that is on the line.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m prepared for anything really that is going to happen in terms of the crowd support on Sunday.\u201d\n\nSeven-time major champion John McEnroe believes the Italian\u2019s only hope is all-out assault.\n\n\u201cBerrettini has a puncher\u2019s chance,\u201d the American told the BBC.\n\n\u201cHe has a huge serve and a huge forehand, but it is about whether he can execute and take it to Djokovic enough. If he can get Djokovic on his heels often enough then it could be competitive.\u201d\n\n(AFP)",

          "title": "Flight delays: Airlines list conditions for 100% airfares refund to passengers",
          "text": "Following the pronouncement of the Federal Government that airline operators must refund the full cost of travel tickets to passengers after a two-hour delay, commercial airlines have listed the conditions for such reimbursement.\n\nThe airline operators made this known in separate interviews with Sunday PUNCH.\n\nThe Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, had, on Thursday at the weekly State House Briefing in Aso Villa, Abuja, read out some of the rights of air passengers as enshrined in Part 19 of the Consumer Protection Regulations of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Regulations (2015) and charged them to demand their rights whenever they were being trampled upon by airlines.\n\n\u201cOn domestic flights, for delay beyond one hour, carrier should provide refreshment, and one telephone call, or one SMS, or one e-mail. They should send you an SMS or email or call you to say, \u2018I am sorry, I am delaying for one hour\u2019.\n\n\u201cFor delay for two hours and beyond, the carrier shall reimburse passengers the full volume of their tickets.\n\n\u201cFor delay between 10pm and 4am, carrier shall provide hotel accommodation, refreshment, meal, two free calls, SMS, email and transport to-and-fro airport,\u201d Sirika had said, adding that the same rules applied for international flights.\n\nThe minister, who said his ministry had started sanctioning some airlines who defaulted on consumer rights, however, urged passengers not to be unruly at airports.\n\nIn recent times, air transportation has become the darling of travellers in Nigeria, no thanks to the rising cases of robbery attacks, kidnappings and killings on highways across the country. According to the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, there are over 20 airports spread across Nigeria, with at least three airports in each of the six geopolitical zones of the country, making almost every part of the country accessible by air.\n\nBut as the aviation sector enjoys patronage, flight cancellations and delays have characterised inter-city air transportation in the country.\n\nAccording to recent statistics obtained by Sunday PUNCH from the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, there are 19 international airlines and nine local carriers currently operating within the country. The local airlines include Azman Air, Overland Airways, Max Air, Ibom Air, Air Peace, Aero Contractors, Dana Air, Arik Air and United Nigeria Airlines.\n\nThe NCAA data showed that 1,871 international flights have been recorded within the country\u2019s airspace from January to March 2021 but 562 of those flights were delayed while nine were cancelled.\n\nThe regulator\u2019s data also showed that 14,662 local flights were recorded in Nigeria between January and March 2021. However, 7,554 of those flights were delayed while 149 were cancelled.\n\nOperators of airlines in the country had justified the delay and cancellations of domestic flights recently.\n\nThe operators, led by the Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, had, on Tuesday before the Senate Committee on Aviation chaired by Senator Smart Adeyemi, hinged the reason on non-availability and rising cost of aviation fuel, also known as JetA1 and inadequate parking spaces at airports.\n\nOther reasons cited by the operators were non-availability of forex for spare parts and maintenance, sudden change of weather, delay due to VIP movement, inefficient passenger access and facilitation, delayed clearance of spare parts from Customs and inadequate screening and exit points at departure.\n\nEfforts to get the Air Peace Chairman\u2019s comment on the recent statement of the minister proved abortive as he neither took our correspondent\u2019s calls nor responded to text messages sent to his line as of the time of filing this report.\n\nHowever, speaking with Sunday PUNCH, Air Peace\u2019s spokesman, Stanley Olisa, said the airline does refund passengers whenever there is flight cancellation due to weather or technical glitches.\n\nResponding to a question by our correspondent, he said, \u201cYes, we refund our customers based on the terms and conditions of our tickets. Refund can be voluntary, where the customer is refunded 75 per cent of the fare and this occurs when they no longer wish to fly on the service paid for. It is involuntary when we cancel the flight and the passenger is refunded the full fare. The refund process takes three to four weeks.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman for Dana Air, Kingsley Ezenwa, said what the minister read at the presidential briefing was not new but that airlines would rather delay or cancel flights and ensure the safety of their passengers than fly when it is technically unsafe to do so.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat he said is not new, it has been in existence in the Nigerian Civil Aviation Regulations 2015. We refund when passengers request for refund, we provide accommodation when flight is cancelled in the night. We transport passengers from the airports to the hotel and bring them back in the morning. We also compensate where necessary after providing all these things.\n\n\u201cFlight delay is a peculiarity of the industry and these issues come up once in a while. No airline can say it has not had one or two hours delay due to bad weather, technical issues, documentation and other factors.\n\n\u201cNo airline will delay deliberately but when it has to do with safety and best standard practices, we will rather do the right thing and take the bashing. We need to ensure the safety of our passengers at all times.\n\n\u201cIt is quite understandable when passengers are angry because they have paid. It is understandable because they have commitments and appointments but there are times when we just have to do the right thing and these may cause delay in take-off.\u201d\n\nEzenwa agreed with the minister that when there were issues that necessitated flight cancellations and or delay beyond scheduled time, timely communication and engagement with the passengers could make the difference.\n\nAlso speaking with Sunday PUNCH, an official of Aero Contractors who did not want to be named said the airline had been complying with the regulations of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that Aero is going to comply with the standard procedure based on regulatory and government policies and based on the new comment the minister made yesterday (Thursday). When there is AOG (aircraft on ground) due to technical faults, we cancel the flight. When there is weather issue, we cancel the flight. Passengers are either refunded or if they are willing, they can reschedule to fly again without any penalty or additional cost. That has been the normal procedure,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked of the conditions for refund, he said, \u201cIt depends on the circumstances. If they pay cash, they will get cash; if it is PoS, their funds will be transferred to them.\u201d\n\nThe official, however, did not give the duration of refund which he said \u201cit is not cast in iron\u201d.\n\nWhen contacted, Arik Air\u2019s Public Relations and Communications Manager, Banji Ola, kept mum on the matter. \u201cI don\u2019t have any comment to make,\u201d he told our correspondent over the phone.\n\nAlso, one of the new entrants into the space, United Nigeria Airlines, told our correspondent that the operator would make its position known soon.\n\n\u201cThe company will make its official position known. There are different issues between regulatory authorities and ministerial pronouncements,\u201d spokesman for the airline, Achielieus Uchegbu, told Sunday PUNCH.\n\nEfforts to get the Chief Executive Officer of Azman Air, Yunusa Sarina, proved abortive as of the time of filing this report as he did not take calls put across to his line by our correspondent.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Meteorological Agency in its weather forecast outlook on Friday, said thunderstorms were expected over parts of Sokoto, Kebbi, Katsina, Kaduna, Kano, Jigawa, Bauchi, Gombe, Adamawa, Taraba, Yobe and Borno States while other parts of the northern region would be under cloudy skies.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Osy Prestige\u2019s death), Social Democratic Party, one, and Zenith Labour Party, ZLP, one.\n\nThe number of APC members in the House now gives them four short of the required two-thirds (240) to exert overwhelming influence on every legislative subject.\n\nA member of the House of Representatives, Rimamnde Shawulu, has meanwhile, on the National Chairman of the PDP, Uche Secondus, to resign with immediate effect for failing to stem the flow of defections from the party.\n\nThe lawmaker urged Secondus to throw in the towel before the 2023 general elections.\n\nIn a letter he wrote to party chair, entitled, \u2018In the Interest of our Party, Democracy and the People of Nigeria: Time To Do The Needful\u2019, Shawulu pointedly told the Chairman to resign.\n\n\u201cI plead with you sir to show leadership today and in the interest of the party, your good name, and the future of Nigeria to resign immediately as National Chairman\u201d, he wrote.\n\n\u201cToday, not unexpectedly, four members of the House of Representatives from Zamfara State denounced the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and defected to the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC). \u201cUnlike other times, when leaders of the party in the House (both the Minority Caucus Leadership and the House PDP Caucus Leadership), put up some form of protest, not a whisper was heard or a hand raised in protest against the decamping!\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, history calls and beckons on you to do the needful, not to die but to live for the party by surrendering leadership, in order for reconciliation and repositioning of the party to begin in earnest for a fresh start.\n\n\u201cYou, and indeed, all members of the National Working Committee should make such a sacrifice in the interest of the PDP, Nigeria and democracy. I plead with you sir to show leadership today and in the interest of the party, your good name, and the future of Nigeria to resign immediately as National Chairman.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 elections are just two years away, with a few off-cycle governorship elections in a few states getting underway in a few months, the party needs time to reorganize, reconcile feuding members and prepare to campaign with well-prepared and articulated programmes to rescue Nigeria from the present morass. It bears restating that time is not on our side. You and the current national working committee members will be unable to lead the reconciliation process because you are unfortunately enmeshed in several current controversies.\n\n\u201cMy Chairman, sir, I come in peace, and do know that God will lead you aright if you ask him to!\u201d\n\nThough the Chairman of the PDP Caucus in the House, Rep. Kingsley Chinda (PDP-Rivers) didn\u2019t pick or return calls, a chat with Rep. Shawulu later revealed that any members of PDP were disposed to the ouster of Secondus.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t sit as a caucus to decide that Secondus should go, but I know that many people are with me.

Some members have even derailed from understanding the primary aim and objective that brought us to the House.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, their suspension is in tandem with the rules and regulations guiding the House\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, one of the affected lawmakers and member representing Ikeduru state constituency, Uche Ogbuagu, has challenged the Speaker, Paul Emeziem, to explain to the whole world what he meant by \u201cunparliamentary conduct\u201d.\n\nHe said that the Speaker should not use ambiguous words to further confuse the people.\n\nIn his words, \u201cthe people deserve to know the truth. So, let the Speaker come out and tell the people the truth.\n\n\u201cEver since he removed me as the Majority Leader of the House, without reason, he does not allow me to speak in plenary.\n\n\u201cI am the only house member without a committee. He disapproved of all my people-oriented motions, but I know the God I serve.\n\n\u201cGod brought me to Imo State House of Assembly to speak for Ikeduru and the masses. Nobody can quench the light of God in me. Heaven and Earth shall pass away but His words must surely come to fruition.\n\n\u201cMy suspension was a true manifestation of the Speaker\u2019s hatred towards him. Outside this, he has no other reason for suspending me,\u201d he revealed.\n\nThe lawmaker added that he was yet to come to terms with his offence and those of the other affected lawmakers.",

          "text": "A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, Chief Taofeek Adegboyega Adegoke, has advised the National Assembly to harmonise grey areas embedded in the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB).\n\nAdegoke, who is the Ajia Balogun of Ibadanland, noted that the need to harmonise the grey areas was necessary in order to avoid unnecessary litigations after the bill has been assented to by the President.\n\nOur correspondent recalls that both the Senate and the House of Representatives had earlier passed the PIB.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that the House of Representatives approved 5% for host communities, while the Senate approved 3% for host communities.\n\nAdegoke has however advised the Senate, House of Representatives and the executive arm of government to quickly use political solutions to resolve the pending issues in the Bill.\n\nAdegoke, who spoke shortly after he received an award of excellence given to him by the Inner Wheel Club District 913-Nigeria during the investiture of IWM Ojoele-Ayoola Sherifat Bolatito as the 35th District Chairman, said that part of the grey areas to resolve is the 30% of the NNPC profit earmarked to be spent on frontier basin for oil and gas exploration.\n\nOur correspondent reports that other awardees at the event attended by Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Engineer Rauf Olaniyan, and Barrister Sharafaden Alli included Senator Teslim Kolawole Folarin, who was represented by Barrister Lowo Obisesan, Chief Funso Omokurolue and Evangelist Toun Soetan.\n\nAdegoke, while speaking disclosed that part of the grey areas that needed to be resolved before the PIB becomes law include 5% recommendation by the House of Representatives, 3% recommendation by the Senate to the host communities as well as the 30% of the NNPC profit to be spent on frontier basin for oil and gas exploration.\n\nAdegoke, who is a Director of OES Energy Services Limited, while hailing the National Assembly for the passage of the Bill, described it as a welcome development.\n\nHe said, \u201cFirst of all, it is a welcome development because we have been on it for several years, 17 years for that matter, but now we have been able to do something. I want to add that non-passing of the PIB has led to reduction in investment in the Oil & Gas sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is the same Oil and Gas globally, so if one country is not serious, you will take your money to other countries and that\u2019s what has been happening in Nigeria. Now it is one step forward but there are lots of grey areas in the bill to be addressed.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for the House of Representatives and the Senate to meet to harmonise some grey areas. The House of Representatives recommended 5% while the Senate recommended 3% allocation for the host communities.\n\n\u201cAnother grey area is the recommendation of 30% profit of the NNPC to be spent on frontier basins, which are mainly in the Northern part of the country. This implies that 30% of the NNPC funds will be channelled into looking for oil and gas in those areas.\n\n\u201cTo me it looks somehow in this era of borrowing from China, and that the little NNPC is making 30% of it they will be spending on oil & gas exploration we are not sure of, even if we get oil from those basins, it cannot be in commercial quantity.\n\n\u201cThis money is supposed to be spent on infrastructure, supporting the Niger Delta where the oil is coming from. But all in all we need political solutions to all these grey areas.\u201d",

          "text": "By Alao Abiodun\n\nPopular singer Olanrewaju Fasasi aka Sound Sultan is dead after a long battle with cancer.\n\nHe is regarded as one of the pioneers of hip-hop music in Nigeria.\n\nMore than 20 years after he launched his music career, the 44-year-old musician remained relevant in the industry until his demise.\n\nHis death was announced in a statement Sunday morning by his family.\n\nAccording to the family, Sound Sultan died of Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChecks by The Nation shows that Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a group of related malignancies (cancers) that affect the lymphatic system (lymphomas).\n\nAccording to National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), the lymphatic system functions as part of the immune system and helps to protect the body against infection and disease.\n\nThe exact, underlying cause of AITL is unknown. It is believed that a dysfunctional immune system response to an unknown antigen ultimately leads to the development of the disorder.\n\nA key and differentiating aspect of AITL is dysfunction of the immune system, which can lead to a variety of symptoms.\n\nRead Also: 12 memorable facts about Sound Sultan\n\nAffected individuals may develop a rash, persistent fever, unintended weight loss, tissue swelling due to the accumulation of fluid (edema) and additional symptoms.\n\nIn May, reports had claimed the musician was flown abroad to commence chemotherapy following his throat cancer diagnosis.\n\nHis elder brother, Baba Dee, debunked the rumour he had brother throat cancer and was being treated in the United States.\n\nBut many fans and well-wishers prayed for his speedy recovery through social media posts.\n\nReacting, Sound Sultan had express gratitude to his well-wishers, insisting he would tell the story of his struggles himself.\n\nHe said: \u201cI must not ignore the massive show of love. Thank you all. I will tell you my story myself it will be true THEN not false.\u201d\n\nSound Sultan, has been married to his long-time girlfriend, Chichi Morah, since October 1, 2009 with whom he had three children",

I told him that his methods are wrong.\n\n\u201cBut God has used him in the agitation for Yoruba Nation. He has played his own role and he will still play more roles. We should not let him be killed or persecuted.\n\n\u201cHe should caution his talkative followers so that they won\u2019t put him into trouble. I told him some time ago that those people surrounding him are agents of a politician in Lagos.\n\n\u201cI told him it is better to train your trusted soldiers than to hire mercenaries who will later go for the highest bidder.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cause more damage to this freedom fight. Let the elders wade in. Even if any Oba or leader talks against you, don\u2019t abuse them.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s begin to preach our gospel to win more souls. You said you wanted to go and open the borders. That will be the beginning of war. You don\u2019t need to say that. It will be counterproductive.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have war materials, you were molesting the Army. You said if 1,000 policemen visited your house, 100 would hardly return safely. You don\u2019t need all that. Propaganda should not be too much in self-determination.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe added: \u201cI beg the Ooni of Ife, the Alake of Egba and all other Yoruba leaders.\n\n\u201cIf a son offends his father, the father will forgive him. Let us unite to use another method for our liberation. We are not saying we should adopt Sunday Igboho\u2019s method.\n\n\u201cAs the Aare Onakakanfo, I am begging you. Assuming he and his followers had not insulted me before, you will say that is why I\u2019m saying this. But a leader without the spirit of forgiveness is an enemy of God. I beg the governors too.\n\n\u201cAt this position I am now, I can\u2019t be jumping up and down like him. But any statement I issue is more powerful than that in 10 years.\n\n\u201cI sit on a strategic institution in the entire Yoruba and I must be conscious of my behaviour so that I will not disappoint the institution.\n\n\u201cThe institution has been in existence in the past 500 years.

          "text": "By Damilola Fatunmise\n\nTall, black and beautiful actress, Abiola Adekunle popularly known as Asake Oni Bread in the movie industry, has been acting for over a decade under the umbrella of iconic thespian, Odunlade Adekola.\n\nIn this chat, Biola, who has acted more than 50 movies, opens up on her sojourn in Nollywood. Excerpts:\n\nTell us about yourself and how you came into acting.\n\nMy name is Abiola Adekunle Balogun popularly known as Asake Oni Bread or Sade Pepper\u2019. I am a wife and mother of two kids. I had my OND in Banking and Finance from the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro. I got my HND in Accounting at Moshood Abiola Polytechnic. I came into acting in 2008 under the tutelage of Odunlade Adekola of Ibi Aloye caucus, Abeokuta.\n\nWhat were the challenges you faced at the initial stage of your career?\n\nInitially, there were some challenges, but you have to be very calm and try to endure and encourage yourself because you might not be getting good roles and you might be discouraged by your colleagues, but don\u2019t ever give up. Be focused.\n\nIs movie making paying your bills or you have other hustles?\n\nDefinitely, movie making is paying my bills because I passed through some challenges while training, but since I\u2019m getting good jobs and good roles with good fees, definitely it\u2019s paying my bills. But then, I have other businesses aside acting.\n\nWhat type of business is that?\n\nIt\u2019s buying and selling.\n\nMost of your contemporaries in the Yoruba movie sector are light-skinned, how have you been able to overcome the temptation of bleaching?\n\nWe all have different tastes and how we see ourselves also matters a lot. I\u2019m chocolate and I\u2019m proud of my skin colour. As we all know, black don\u2019t crack. Only if you are insecure and you don\u2019t see the uniqueness of God\u2019s art in your body, that\u2019s when you feel inferior about yourself. I can never be tempted to bleach my skin simply because others are light complexioned. I\u2019m very much fine and sweet with how God has designed me. My chocolate skin is the sweetest colour God gave me.\n\nTwo years ago, you broke the Internet with the arrival of your first child, would you like to share the waiting moments with us?\n\nIt\u2019s an amazing grace and experience to witness God\u2019s promise and fulfillment in one\u2019s life. It was a tough journey waiting on the Lord for the fruit of the womb after five years of marriage, but God came through and the rest is history. All I can say is that it\u2019s grace and mercy of God because man can only try, but God did it.\n\nWhat do you have to say to people looking up to you?\n\nMy only advice to them is to be real, focused and hopeful. Life will definitely test your faith, but never give up on your dreams. Whatever you wish to do in life, go for it; never be discouraged, there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nHow are you coping with marriage and acting?\n\nMarriage is sweet when you marry your best friend and someone that understands you. There\u2019s no problem between my home and my career, my husband has been supporting my career even before we got married. It\u2019s not new to him, so everything is fine.\n\nCan responsibilities of marriage take you away from acting?\n\nMarriage and my career are two different things. My career is like my job and I\u2019m married to someone who takes my career so serious than myself. Sometimes when I\u2019m having issues in my career, he\u2019ll always cheer me up and give me strength to move on. My marriage has contributed to my career a lot.\n\nYou remain ever beautiful, what\u2019s your beauty routine?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing serious about my beauty routine; I\u2019m just me. I don\u2019t expose my body to anything that\u2019s different from natural products. I\u2019m not that extravagant. I am just natural and simple.\n\nWhat part of your body do you cherish the most?\n\nI cherish every part of my body and there\u2019s no part of my body that I don\u2019t like. God made everything beautiful and I\u2019m grateful.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest amount you\u2019ve ever been paid for a movie?\n\nThat\u2019s personal. I\u2019m sorry because it\u2019s not a stable thing. It all depends on the role I\u2019m playing.\n\nWhat\u2019s your most embarrassing moment as an actress?\n\nI can\u2019t really remember, but sometimes actors are meant to experience embarrassing moments, it\u2019s normal. Sometimes we\u2019ll be called for a show and the organisers may not get us a convenient place or good hospitality, then we get stuck. Sometimes when people meet you on the road, they start shouting your name. Some will even pull your shirt. I have experienced lots of embarrassing moments, but it\u2019s something we just have to overlook because most people don\u2019t understand that we are humans too.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By Daniel Kanu\n\nErudite scholar and two-time minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Prof Ihechukwu Madubuike, in this encounter with Sunday Sun speaks on Nigeria\u2019s condition and the problem, the security challenge, the feasibility of Igbo president in 2023, unlearned lessons of June 12, and why Ebubeagu, the Southeast security outfit is not roaring, among other national issues. Excerpt:\n\nIPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has been forcefully brought back to the country by the Federal Government. How do you view the entire scenario?\n\nI think it\u2019s early for me to comment on the issue. Let\u2019s watch first and see the pattern it\u2019s taking. Nigeria has laws, let\u2019s see how the laws will be put to test, let\u2019s see how justice and rule of law will play out. Then you come for my comment.\n\nWhat is your take concerning the security challenges in the country and why the violence does not seem to abate, but escalates by the day?\n\nThe act of keeping peace within the boundaries of a sovereign state is one of the perquisites of nationhood. Without its national laws internal security will be compromised, cannot function properly, jeopardizing property and life as well as the orderly functions of the polity. Intelligence gathering and its judicious application are the executive functions used to douse tensions and threats. The government must know how to apply all that is needed properly.\n\nSome commentators say that the Southeast is under serious siege\u2026?\n\n(Cuts in) The Southeast zone has been under siege for decades now going by the number of security operatives in the region, especially when compared with other sections of the country. You cannot routinely drive through our major roads without being confronted with roadblocks manned by policemen, sometimes by the military and other members of our paramilitary agencies, posted at short intervals on the same road. These blockades through which a lot of money is siphoned into the itchy hands of the operatives, cause a lot of delay, frustrations, and impede business. Furthermore, they inflict heavy psychological blows on the citizens. Southeast has been treated like a conquered zone and the treatments, insouciantly inflicted on the inhabitants, hurt. They enhance the siege mentality, a paranoid attitude or belief that the authority is out to get you. It has also given vent to unintended explosions and violence. What is wrong in the Southeast is the Federal Government\u2019s vindictive policy towards the citizens. There are no factories, nor industries, limited avenues to employ the teeming youths that come out of Nigerian institutions in their numbers, leading to manpower and capital flights from the region. All the industries that used to blossom in the East have all been allowed to wither. No new ones have been built, leading to youth anger and frustrations. An idle hand is the devil\u2019s workshop is an aphorism that has remained constant as time itself. The refusal of the Federal Government to implement the 3Rs agreed after the civil war in 1970, a declared and systemic policy of exclusion, a shared feeling of victimization by most of the inhabitants because the people\u2019s fathers were forced into a war of unequalled partners in which three million died, are all parts of the fault lines.\n\nWhere in your view is the problem with Nigeria?\n\nThe problem with Nigeria is a leadership that is largely myopic, a leadership that has failed to see the country as one and has failed to build bridges of common identity. These have led to the establishment of fissiparous tendencies and forces that have enthroned a mediocre leadership that cannot think out of the box, but is desperately hanging on mediocrity and revisionism \u2014 steps that are ante-diluvium and backward prone.\n\n2023 is fast approaching, do you think that the call for the president of Igbo extraction is feasible in 2023?\n\nOrdinarily, the presidency of an Igbo from the Southeast should be a win-win situation and applauded by every section of the polity, if we are truly democrats and believe in justice, equity and fair play. Nobody should begrudge Ndigbo of this epicenter of power. Politics is the art of the possible and I am optimistic of the possibility of an Igbo president emerging in 2023 if a fair and credible election system is enthroned. The Igbo believes that we can run better if we run together. Igbo have right to power, not a privilege.\n\nYou picked holes with the attitude of Southeast governors on the running of Ebubeagu, the Southeast Security Network. What faults do you see on why Ebubeagu is not roaring as expected?\n\nYes. I picked holes with the formation of Ebubeagu, a hastily put together security outfit by our governors to cater for the security needs of the Southeast. When you see a champion you should know it. Ebubeagu as presently constituted is an abstraction of the ideal, not a winning formula. It\u2019s like a masquerade without followers, all sounds and fury signifying little. Ambition, says Shakespeare, should be made of a sterner stuff.\n\nJune 12 has come and gone again, do you think we have learnt useful lessons in view of the way the country is being piloted by its leadership in recent times?\n\nI am not sure June 12 as conceived is meant to teach us a lesson. When the civil war was launched, the slogan was to teach the Igbo a lesson. Unfortunately, that lesson is still being taught because of a flawed curriculum which has become historic. If we had a curriculum, based on international rules of engagement we would be making progress and teaching our children globalized norms and values. Ditto for June 12, a progressive ideology that would address the challenges and the present situation of anomie all over the country. Replacing June 12 with a new form of anarchy and dictatorial tendencies would not be the outcome of a salubrious policy objectives, for a lesson properly assimilated. What have we done to stop the shenanigans that made 12 June possible? What have we done about our flawed electoral processes? What have we done about voter apathy; and what have we done to make our votes count?. What about the suspended electoral bill? No. We must not be deceived by names which have been elevated to abstractions. Let us not turn history to hysteria or to a farce.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Diplomatic Community Meets, Writes N\u2019Assembly over Draft Electoral Law",
          "text": "\u2022Urges caution, need to deepen democracy\n\n\u2022Lawmaker alleges 20 illegal insertions to rig 2023 election\n\nChuks Okocha and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nA recent alleged attempt to tamper with the country\u2019s draft electoral law might have attracted the attention of the diplomatic community, which met last week with the leadership of the National Assembly and followed up with a private letter appealing to the lawmakers to do all within their powers to deepen democracy through the current effort at amending the Electoral Act.\n\nThis development followed an uproar generated by reports that there was an attempt by a section of the National Assembly leadership to smuggle certain clauses into the draft electoral law banning electronic transfer of election results, even though the same section agreed to an electronic voting system.\n\nA meeting between the National Assembly leadership and a group of five foreign envoys, including the European Union, led by the United Kingdom held last week. The foreign missions expressed concerns over the electoral law review and urged the lawmakers to do their best to ensure that the gains of the over two decades of democratic experience were not wasted.\n\nTo further register their concern and the readiness to assist in the democratic process, the diplomatic community, allegedly, followed up with a letter, where some of the concerns expressed at the meeting were put in black and white.\n\nAccording to National Assembly sources privy to the meeting as well as the letter, the countries, included the United Kingdom, France, United States, and the European Union. They noted that they did not intend to interfere with Nigeria\u2019s electoral system, but were genuinely concerned about the possibility of losing the gains of the past.\n\nWhile urging the National Assembly leadership to bequeath to the country a legacy of strong and sound electoral system, they contended that it was not in the interest of the country and their foreign allies to lag behind in the collective effort to entrench a solid culture of democracy.\n\nSpecifically, the EU was said to have noted at the meeting that the support they give to Nigeria over the years was to ensure the entrenchment of a lasting democratic culture. It cited such support to include logistics and trainings.\n\nThe EU explained that the idea was to deepen the country\u2019s democratic process and not shut it down, adding that the amendment process is expected to advance the electoral system.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been different theories on those likely to be behind the attempt to tamper with the electoral law, just as the move has already begun to divide the political class, including the lawmakers. Many federal legislators have denied knowledge of the illegal insertion of anti-people clauses.\n\nBut fingers are being pointed at the leadership of the National Assembly. Many of National Assembly members are believed to be readying to seek election in other capacities in 2023.\n\nSupporters of a popular politician in the South-west are also believed to be divided over the matter, making the issue one of the most sensitive political concerns at the moment.\n\nSources hinted that while some politicians believed that the electronic transfer of results could undercut their chances in the election, there were those who held the view that it was the only way to put their traducers in check since the road to 2023 appears to be rough lready.\n\nAnother party source, who was opposed to the controversial insertions, said the excuses being pushed against electronic transfer of results did not hold water. This, he said, was because if network was the issue, INEC had since assured that where the network failed and voting had been done, the results would automatically download once network came on.\n\nContending that electronic transfer of results would be the best thing to happen to the country\u2019s electoral system, the source maintained that Nigeria would be better off dealing with the failure of the initiative than sticking with the analogue mode of transferring election results, which is generally believed to be prone to manipulation.\n\nLawmaker Alleges 20 Illegal Insertions to Rig 2023 Election\n\nA member of the House of Representatives from Benue State, Hon. Mark Terseer Gbillah, alleged that the Senate made 20 illegal insertions into the 2021 Electoral Bill under consideration in the National Assembly. Gbillah said the insertions were part of a larger scheme to rig the 2023 general election.\n\nThe lawmaker who was chairman of the House committee involved in the harmonisation of the bill, and who was deputy chairman of the House Committee on Petroleum (Upstream), also condemned the three per cent allocation to oil producing communities by the Senate in the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), describing it as \u201cunfortunate and ridiculous\u201d. He rejected the 30 per cent clause in the PIB for \u201cfrontier exploration\u201d, which he said was an invitation to corruption and remained unacceptable.\n\nSpeaking on Arise TV, Gbillah insisted that the Senate inserted 20 clauses that were not originally part of the Electoral Bill in the Senate version after harmonisation by the two chambers.\n\nGbillah stated, \u201cLet me go to the issue of Electoral Act. Chairman of the committee in the house mentioned and told our colleagues that she was not aware of any changes for the initial harmonised act of both chambers.\n\n\u201cObviously, there is an insertion. I can confirm that about 20 clauses have been inserted and it is alleged that it was inserted from the senate version. I want to say that we are at a point in the country, where you should not be playing politics with this issue in this country.\n\n\u201cI wonder why people think that they are going to stay in power in perpetuity. Tomorrow, it will be somebody else; we need to leave a legacy for our country. We need to leave a legacy for our nation. The world is moving forward and we are still deliberating on electronic transmission, when it is something that is a forgone issue in other nations.\n\n\u201cWe in the opposition are insisting that the issue of electronic transmission is sacrosanct and we suspect that those insertions were intentional, premeditated so that this Electoral Act will be contentious and won\u2019t be passed so that in the upcoming elections, the ability to rig and manipulate the result of the election will be possible.\n\n\u201cThis is unfortunate. This is something we are going to resist. We call on Nigerians to rise up, for this is the time, when they should take responsibility for the people they have elected to represent them. The servants cannot dictate to the owners.\n\n\u201cNigerians, you need to rise up and make your voices heard and some of us are there to support your position and to pursue what is best for this country.\u201d\n\nOn the three per cent allocation to the oil producing communities and 30 per cent provision for frontier exploration in the PIB, to which Niger Delta governors and stakeholders have objected, Gbillah said, \u201cThe issue of PIB percentages, these are all issues we believe need to be looked at. We are not immediately affected by the production now but the Benue trough is one of the initial siting of oil. We believe in equity and we believe in justice, the people of the Niger Delta have been saddled with this issue for several decades.\n\n\u201cThe environment has been destroyed. Three per cent is inadequate and the senate even made it much worse, which in my opinion is unfortunate and ridiculous. The 30 per cent for frontier exploration is unacceptable.

          "text": "\u2022Earlier date wasn\u2019t sacrosanct, says Akpanudoedehe\n\n\u2022Tinubu, other presidential hopefuls now in suspense\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe much-awaited congresses of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), earlier scheduled to commence July 10, may not hold, as the leadership of the party has written to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) demanding the immediate postponement of the exercise\n\nIn the letter dated July 6, 2021, with reference number APC/NHDQ/INEC/19/021/39, and addressed to Chairman of the electoral body, the ruling party did not state any reason for the indefinite postponement of the congresses.\n\nBut National Secretary of APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, said the party did not intend a postponement of the congresses but to cure legal landmines since the earlier date was not sacrosanct.\n\nUnfortunately, by the development, the 2023 permutations by one of the national leaders of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as well as other contenders, may have been put in suspense.\n\nThe letter, which was signed by National Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, and Akpanudoedehe, stated that the postponement served as a formal notification pursuant to the provisions of Section 85 of the Electoral Act (2010), as amended.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cWe refer to our letter reference number APC/NHDQ/INEC/19/012/20 dated 10th June, 2021 on the above subject and wish to inform the Commission that the party has rescheduled its Congresses and National Convention to a later date, which will be communicated to you.\n\n\u201cThis serves as a formal notification pursuant to the provisions of Section 85 of the Electoral Act (2010) as amended. While hoping to receive your cooperation, please accept the assurances of my highest esteem.\u201d\n\nThe timetable and schedule of activities released by the party\u2019s Director of Organisation, Professor Al-Mustapha Medaner, showed that the congresses would commence with the sale of nomination forms for the ward congress between July 1 and July 7. The party also fixed the inauguration of Ward/Local Government Area Congress Screening/Screening Appeal Committees for July 10, 2021; Ward Congress was billed for July 24, local government congress was slated for August 14, and the state congress was to hold on the September 18, 2021.\n\nTHISDAY investigation revealed that the inability of the national secretariat of the party to distribute the nomination forms for all the congresses to the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) led to the postponement.\n\nWhile the party has started taking delivery of the materials for the congresses in batches, as of the close of work on Friday, no state had taken possession of the nomination forms for any of the congresses.\n\nThe APC national secretary said, \u201cThe above document in circulation did not intend a postponement of the ccongresses. How it leaked from INEC is strange. It is to cure the legal landmine occasioned by Section 85 of the Electoral Act on the issuance of 21 days notice to INEC, bearing in mind that the earlier date we released was not sacrosanct.\u201d\n\nApart from logistics challenges that caused delay in the distribution of the forms, some states were still in crisis over membership registration and as a result, some members were allegedly denied registration. It was against this background that the leadership of the party, last week, approved the continuation of the party\u2019s membership registration revalidation and update exercise in Imo, Kwara, Ogun, and Rivers states.\n\nAkpanudoedehe had in a statement said the approval followed the recommendation of the membership registration appeals committee.\n\nHe said, \u201cWith this approval, the membership registration, revalidation and register update exercise in the four states will continue for two weeks.\n\n\u201cThose who have not been registered in these states can purchase forms for congresses, party office elections and convention. For congresses in Rivers State, all those who have purchased forms in the past will be allowed to participate in the congresses on the presentation of the bank teller as proof of payment.\u201d\n\nThe national secretary warned, \u201cAny attempt to deprive intending registrants would be dealt with accordingly in line with the provisions of the APC constitution and guidelines for the exercise.\u201d\n\nA group, Concerned APC Stakeholders, while reacting, decried the postponement as another scheme by the committee to perpetuate itself in office. The spokesperson of the group, Mr. Abdulahi Dauda, said the excuse they heard was that materials were being printed. But he alleged that the chairman did not carry other members of the caretaker committee along when the timetable for the congresses was issued.\n\nDauda stated, \u201cThe postponement is another scheme to perpetually remain in office, even though they are occupying such offices illegally. The excuse we heard was that the materials were being printed and the chairman did not carry along other members of the caretaker committee in issuing the last statement as regards the congresses through Director of Organisation.\n\n\u201cWe are reliably informed that CTC will meet next Tuesday to issue a statement on the new date. However, Buni and co should tread softly and not lead the party to destruction due to greed and inordinate ambition.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the indefinite postponement has not only altered calculations in the camps of presidential hopefuls, but also the national chairmanship aspirants, like Saliu Mustapha, George Akume, Al Makura, and Abduallahi Adamu.\n\nThe postponement, according to political analysts, may have put the permutations of potential presidential contenders in suspense. Among those who had been drumming for an early convention are the many supporters of the presidential aspiration of Tinubu, who see the election of new principal officers of the party as a first step in their bid for the presidential ticket.\n\nThe development is bound to unsettle the TIinubu camp as it has thrown their projections into confusion.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Gusau agog as PDP supporters welcome deputy governor\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Innocent Onuminya in Zamfara\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s defection of Zamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle from the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the National Working Committee (NWC) of the former has approved a legal team led by a former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Godwin Kanu-Agabi, to challenge the defection.\n\nBut a massive crowd of PDP supporters yesterday treated Zamfara State Deputy Governor Mahdi Gusau, who remained in the party, to a tumultuous welcome in the state capital, Gusau.\n\nThe legal action, THISDAY gathered, was not limited to Matawalle, as it would also challenge the legality of the defection of members of the national and state assemblies from Zamfara State.\n\nKanu-Agabi would lead a team of lawyers, including Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN), when the suit challenging the defections would be filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja this week.\n\nA PDP source said, \u201cA combined reading of Section 221 of the 1999 Constitution and the pronouncements of the Supreme Court in Faleke v. INEC (2016) are clear in holding that it is the political party that stands for election, that votes scored in election belong to the political party, and that the candidate nominated to contest at an election by his party acts only as the agent of his party.\u201d\n\nSection 221 of the 1999 Constitution states, \u201cNo association, other than a political party, shall canvass for votes for any candidate at any election or contribute to the funds of any political party or to the election expenses of any candidate at an election.\u201d\n\nThe legal team would also be relying on Sections 179 and 181 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, and their implications and status in law, taking into account the Supreme Court judgement of June 2019 that brought in Matawella as the Zamfara State governor.\n\nPDP would seek the interpretation of the entire Section 68 of the constitution as regards members of the National and State assemblies, who also defected from PDP to the APC with Matawalle.\n\nSection 68 states, \u201c(1) A member of the Senate or of the House of Representatives shall vacate his seat in the House of which he is a member if \u2013\n\n\u201c(a) He becomes a member of another legislative house.\n\n\u201c(b) Any other circumstances arise that, if he were not a member of the Senate or the House of Representatives, would cause him to be disqualified for election as a member\u2026\n\n\u201c(e) Save as otherwise prescribed by this Constitution, he becomes a member of a commission or other body established by this Constitution or by any other law\u2026\n\n\u201c(f) Without just cause he is absent from meetings of the House of which he is a member for a period amounting in the aggregate to more than one-third of the total number of days during which the House meets in any one year;\n\n\u201c(g) Being a person whose election to the House was sponsored by a political party, he becomes a member of another political party before the expiration of the period for which that House was elected; Provided that his membership of the latter political party is not as a result of a division in the political party of which he was previously a member or of a merger of two or more political parties or factions by one of which he was previously sponsored.\u201d\n\nWhile some senior lawyers insist that no law prevents an elected governor from leaving for another party, some argue that the governor should relinquish his mandate on account of the platform with which he came into office.\n\nMeanwhile, PDP supporters, who came out in large numbers to welcome Gusau, carried placards with the inscriptions, such as: \u201cAPC is prohibited for us, we remain in PDP,\u201d \u201cWith Mahdi new Zamfara is possible,\u201d \u201cZamfara is PDP, PDP is Zamfara.\u201d\n\nThe PDP supporters blocked the Tsafe-Funtua road.\n\nThose who accompanied the deputy governor included his father, Gen Aliyu Gusau, and PDP caretaker committee members.\n\nAddressing the party faithful at his residence, Gusau enjoined them to remain calm, stressing that the defection of the governor would not affect the chances of the party in future elections. He maintained that as the highest political office holder in the party, he had become the leader of the party in the state.\n\nThe deputy governor explained that he would do everything possible to reposition the party in the state, even as he solicited the cooperation of members of the party.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the recent political happening in the state, as the leader of the party, I would not relent in my effort in rebuilding the party,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe commiserated with the people of the state especially, the people of Maradun Local Government Area, where gunmen suspected to be bandits killed about 49 people last Thursday. The deputy governor condemned the killing, calling the act barbaric and inhumane.\n\nA PDP caretaker committee member and former publicity secretary of the party, Alhaji Faruku Ahmad Gusau, who spoke to THISDAY said, the large crowd that came out in solidarity with the party showed that PDP was on ground in the state. He stated that no amount of intimidation would make them defect to APC, saying people should watch, as PDP would soon bounce back in the state.\n\nThe former publicity secretary dispelled insinuations that all the state House of Assembly members had moved to APC with the governor.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures",
          "text": "On April 29, Mayowa, 32, was distraught when he couldn\u2019t pay for a 19km Uber ride he had taken to visit a friend in Park View Estate, a well known residential community in the highbrow area of Ikoyi, Lagos. His orange branded Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) app had not launched as he tried severally to make a transfer from his current account to the empty savings account linked to the debit card on his Uber app.\n\nThinking his MTN data service was the problem, he tried punching his bank\u2019s *737# short code to make the transfer but he got an unresponsive code message.\n\nHe tried again, and again and again without success. Frustrated, he made a last attempt accessing his account through GTB\u2019s mobile website, but it took forever to load. To make matters worse, Mayowa\u2019s buddy was away from home, at a dragging management meeting and wouldn\u2019t pick up his frantic calls.\n\n\u201cTen minutes had passed by now. The Uber driver was looking at me funny. It was embarrassing. I had to plead with him to have some patience,\u201d a laughing Mayowa shared.\n\nOut of Service\n\nMayowa is one of many GTB customers who suffered embarrassment, inconvenience or loss of opportunity, as downtimes on the bank\u2019s USSD or mobile banking services became frequent in the first half of 2021, sometimes stretching days on end.\n\n@gtbank why is your bank frustrating customers? I have not been able to access my GT Mobile App for days now. And when money is sent to my account I don't receive alert be it SMS or Email alert.\n\nI recharged 1k few days ago I was debited, but my phone wasn't credited. \u2014 Precious Oye (@BarrypOye) April 30, 2021\n\nWhat is going on @gtbank_help. I am fed up with you guys @gtbank. Everything is stressful.\n\nWhy have I been experiencing this all evening \ud83d\ude29? Now it's CT11, no more E150.\n\nI am starting to tire of your channels pic.twitter.com/cmLjiiaiEL \u2014 Dr. Ameena (@amkmusty) March 22, 2021\n\nAn employee explained that the E105 and CT11 error codes pop up when a partner firm Clickatell\u2019s server is down or GTB\u2019s API is unreachable to initiate the transaction\n\nBuying airtime on @gtbank app is just pure scam, they would deduct the money n not deliver the airtime and I\u2019m just tired of complaining. \u2014 Abbie \ud83d\udc3e (@Abigailsluvv) June 16, 2021\n\nHow can GTB be silent at a time like this? I know they can see the complaints. Do traditional Nigerian banks no longer care about proving quality customer support & help? Tomorrow, they will still charge us a silly \u2018convenience\u2019 fee \ud83e\udd22 \u2014 Koromone Koroye (@Koromone_K) April 29, 2021\n\nA comparative analysis conducted by TC Insights, of customer complaints on Twitter about the mobile app and USSD services between the first half of 2020 and 2021, showed a 54% spike.\n\nA customer representative with the company explained under anonymity that most of the complaints this year have been about the USSD platform, mobile application, unexplainable SMS charges and lately, One Time Password (OTP) issues.\n\n\u201cThese are the recurring problems and complaints. Just ask any GTB customer. They will share some bitter experiences,\u201d she said.\n\nSeven years ago, Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigeria\u2019s third-largest lender, increased the popularity of mobile banking with its *737# USSD service in Nigeria, introducing a new level of ease to customers.\n\nToday, other banks have adopted it and an estimated 40 million Nigerians use USSD services for mobile banking. According to the GTB\u2019s financial report, its revenue from USSD fees was \u20a62.13 billion ($5.3m) in 2019, a significant 34% increase from the \u20a61.58 billion ($3.9m) made in 2018.\n\nGTB didn\u2019t reveal its USSD revenue for 2020 but it disclosed that the total amount it processed via USSD was \u20a63.89 trillion, a 9.4% increase from the \u20a63.55 trillion processed in 2019. Its mobile app also has over a million downloads on the Google play store alone.\n\nStaff churn and delayed promotions\n\nTechCabal has learnt, from interviews with 19 former and current employees of the bank\u2019s IT division, that the division has suffered a spike in attrition within the last six months. It has resulted in technical gaps and work overload for current employees.\n\nAccording to these sources, the absence of promotions in 2020 for already overworked employees who felt they were deserving triggered the first wave of exits into the labour market which had attractive offers for their talent. The shortage in talent began compounding into increased workload and mounting pressure for remaining IT employees.\n\nAt least ten team members resigned this year from the application development team, a unit which often consists of 20 members, according to a former software developer with the bank .\n\n\u201cI was handling one application then it doubled as a result,\u201d Stanley* said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a particular team where three members left in the space of one month. Now, four people\u2019s responsibilities are being juggled by one person,\u201d another employee, at the time of the interview in May, shared.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is crazy. One person is doing three people\u2019s jobs all in the name of efficiency. That\u2019s why our cost to income ratio will always be the lowest in the industry,\u201d Michael*, an ex-employee exclaimed.\n\nGTB\u2019s operating expense increased by \u20a616.5bn from its 2019 figure (\u20a6131bn) due to additional investment in technology to enable staff to work from home and costs associated with implementing safety procedures as well as COVID 19 protocols.\n\nThe frequent loss of experienced talents without a commensurate hiring rate resulted in gaps in technical capabilities, a source explained.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe application I am managing was handled by two people, but my partner has gone to join another team. If I\u2019m leaving now, a new person can\u2019t cram and get a good grip of everything in my handover note within 3 weeks. We simply need more people on the team!\u201d\n\nThis gap is often reflected when there is a service downtime towards the end of the month caused by server overload. During this period, transaction volume increases due to salary payments and other month-end payments, leading to more pressure on existing resources.\n\nAccording to sources, towards the end of the month, experienced hands would usually be proactive in tracking certain metrics and moving different applications across servers to ensure there\u2019s space for the surge. But in the absence of such hands, performance management and quality control suffer.\n\nTechCabal contacted Guaranty Trust Bank for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough\n\nThe bank appears to have taken some steps to solve at least part of the problem that have caused recurring transaction problems this year.\n\nOn June 2nd, 2021 about 900 staff of GTB received a long overdue announcement: they had been promoted. It offered some consolation to many who had been expecting for a while.\n\nHowever, a software developer who was promoted made it clear that this promotion won\u2019t serve as a solution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still understaffed. The App development team is almost half of what it was at the beginning of the year. They haven\u2019t replaced people. Some people even got promoted but left because they don\u2019t want the stress again,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu*, a mid-level associate disclosed that complaints have been made to line managers who encouraged the units and explained that recruitments are ongoing for entry-level and experienced hands who will begin resuming from July.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 let\u2019s wait and see\u201d, he said.\n\n*Name changed to protect the source\u2019s identity.\n\n$1 = \u20a6 400\n\nWritten by Staff Writer Daniel Adeyemi and Editor-in-Chief Adegoke Oyeniyi\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "title": "Peter Njonjo wants to change the way food moves in Africa",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nPeter Njonjo started his first business in high school. He noticed a problem; the school canteen was too far from the dormitories.\n\nEvery day, he and his classmates made the tiresome journey from their beds to the canteen to buy bread. Peter\u2019s solution was simple \u2013 buy all of the bread in the canteen, bring it to the dormitories, sell to customers from the comfort of their beds and charge a small fee for this convenience.\n\n\u201cI built a very successful franchise because there were many dormitories so I couldn\u2019t do it alone,\u201d he said to me during our call.\n\nToday, he is solving a similar problem on a much larger scale. He is the CEO and co-founder of Twiga Foods, a company that is taking fresh and processed foods from over 4,000 farmers and manufacturers who are often far away and delivering to more than 35,000 vendors across Kenya \u2013 while charging a small fee for this convenience.\n\nFrom having an incomplete MBA to heading Coca-Cola\u2019s operations across 33 African countries, his story is one of a man who is passionate about making the lives of people just a little easier.\n\nHis name is Peter Njonjo and this is his life in tech.\n\nPeter Njonjo and the case of the incomplete MBA\n\nIf you scroll down to the Education section of Peter Njonjo\u2019s LinkedIn page today you would find an entry for an MBA in Strategic Management from the year 2000 and right below it are the words \u201cMasters Incomplete\u201d.\n\nDuring our call, Peter tells me that he completed the coursework required to get the MBA. The incompleteness would boil down to his final MBA paper and the professor who was in charge of it. Put simply, they were not very cooperative.\n\n\u201cThey were very fussy, they were always changing their minds. And I was very busy.\u201d\n\nYou may ask what could have made a 21-year old Peter too busy to focus all his time on placating his professor \u2013 his job at Coca-Cola.\n\nAround the time when he applied for his master\u2019s program, Peter was also starting a job as an accountant in Coca-Cola with his newly minted degree in finance \u2013 which he had gotten in nine months.\n\n\u201cSo many people have stories of growing up in university and all the partying. For me, it just passed so quickly and I was always in the library.\u201d\n\nDuring the typical two-year window between high school and university, Peter decided to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). In that time he made considerable progress. He chose to attend the United States International University Africa (USIUA), a private university in Nairobi.\n\n\u201cBecause of all the work I\u2019d done during my CPA, my undergraduate lasted nine months.\u201d\n\nHis fizzy rise to the top at Coca-Cola\n\nIn 1998, Peter Njonjo was one of the youngest CPAs in the entire country. He joined Coca-Cola as an accountant in that same year and his first task on the job was to reconcile some accounts that just wouldn\u2019t balance.\n\n\u201cI spent very very long hours trying to figure that out.\u201d\n\nBut that was only the start of his 18-year career at the company.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a lot of people who worked in Coca-Cola, the tenures are very long. It\u2019s a company where if your DNA matches that of the company, there are a lot of opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nAnd Peter was taking as many of these opportunities as he could. For him, it was a case of being an entrepreneur within an existing organisation and owning processes. He was, as he puts it, \u201cusing other people\u2019s money to create value\u201d. This approach endeared him to a lot of people early on and helped to advance him through the ranks so that by the time he turned 31, after 10 years in the company, he became country manager for Kenya.\n\nThree years later, he would be in charge of Coca-Cola\u2019s operations in six countries across East Africa: Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Mozambique. In this time, he would put together deals worth more than a billion dollars in CapEx (Capital Expenditure).\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t slowing down. During his time as general manager of Coca-Cola East Africa, he started his own company with his co-founder and friend Grant Brooke.\n\nTwiga Foods was not the first business they would try to run together. Their first had been a business that involved felling timber and replenishing the plantation where they got the timber from. The business did not work out.\n\nSometime later, Grant came to Peter with an idea. He wanted them to sell bananas.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I was like \u2018Oh God, this doesn\u2019t sound like one of those things I want to be involved in for the long term. But let me just listen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd listen he did.\n\nGoing bananas and starting Twiga\n\nA fun fact that would help Peter Njonjo take the leap into the world of bananas is that bananas are one of the biggest traded commodities in the world.\n\nSo the plan was to export bananas. But that was far from a walk in the park.\n\n\u201cWe realised that the supply chains were so broken and there were so many challenges out there. It was not going to be as straightforward as we thought.\u201d\n\nWhen they were unable to sell even one container outside of Kenya, Peter felt it was time for them to sell the bananas locally. But even there, they met broken supply chains that made it hard for them to create any value as many parts of the retail industry was fragmented and informal.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to formalise something that\u2019s informal, you\u2019ll encounter all sorts of challenges.\u201d\n\nOne of those challenges was the absence of a standard for packaging produce. This made it hard for a business like theirs to calculate their gross profit margin per unit because, effectively, the concept of a unit in the market was foreign.\n\n\u201cSo we had to introduce bananas with crates and teach people that you can actually by bananas in crates and buy them ripened instead of buying them and ripening yourself and losing half of it.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of tweaking Twiga\u2019s business model and figuring out the best way to create value, Grant ran the business while Peter sat on the board and helped direct the business. He also continued to rise through the ranks at Coca-Cola, eventually becoming President of Coca-Cola West and Central Africa overseeing 33 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. He would leave this role in 2019 to become CEO of Twiga Foods.\n\n\u201cI had discussed with Grant that if the business ever became too big, then I would be happy to step in. Because, for me, it was a major investment.\u201d\n\nIt was such a big investment for him that while they made attempts to raise more capital for the business, he and his wife decided to sell the home they had built to finance the business in the meantime.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my wife\u2019s idea. We had a term sheet from the lead investor but the due diligence was taking time and I was afraid the company would run out of money before the round closed.\u201d\n\nBut according to Peter, they were fairly confident about where the business was going and so it made sense for them. They would eventually close a $1.75 million seed round.\n\n\u201cAnd I think one of the things you can learn is don\u2019t get too attached to material assets. Instead, focus on legacy and the things you need to build.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa, play Legacy by Jay-Z\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m turning 45 this year. I was born and bred in Nairobi, Kenya. I\u2019m the firstborn of four children.\u201d\n\nThat is how Peter Njonjo starts his story on our call. He and his siblings were born to their mother, a retired accountant who is now involved in the family business, and their father, an engineer who is still active in the real estate market.\n\nPeter and his wife Tina have four children. When I ask him about what personal plans he has for him and his family he said, \u201cEnsuring that I\u2019m there for my kids as they grow up and enjoying my marriage with my wife and figuring out things we can pursue that are tied to our passions; be it philanthropy or angel investing.\u201d\n\nFor Twiga, big plans abound as well. In September the company plans to commission the largest standalone banana ripening facility in Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a good amount of time fine-tuning our business here in Kenya so that should help us scale fast. In the next five years, we want to be in 12 countries on the continent, serving about 100,000 customers a day.\u201d\n\nWith the success it has already recorded in Kenya, Twiga Foods is well on its way to achieving these goals.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on Thursday said it has directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) And MultiChoice Africa (MCA), in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nMultiChoice Group is a South African entertainment giant and owner of the popular DStv and GOtv services. Its operations in more than 20 other African countries contribute up to a third of the company\u2019s revenues, with Nigeria being the largest market.\n\nA statement issued by the Director of Communications and Liaison Department of FIRS, Abdullahi Ahmad, accused the company of persistently breaching all agreements and undertakings with the tax agency. MultiChoice also allegedly denied access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\n\u201cThe companies would not promptly respond to correspondences, they lacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records,\u201d the executive chair of FIRS, Muhammad Nami, was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThe companies are involved in the under-remittance of taxes which necessitated a critical review of the tax-compliance level of the company. Particularly, [MultiChoice Nigeria Limited] has avoided giving the FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income,\u201d he said.\n\nNami revealed that the revenue service has now instructed banks to sweep the balances in MultiChoice Africa and MultiChioce Nigeria\u2019s accounts before carrying out any other transaction on behalf of the companies. \u201cIt is further requested that the FIRS be informed of any transactions before execution on the account, especially transfers of funds to any of their subsidiaries.\u201d\n\nThe MultiChoice Group reports revenues in primarily two segments \u2013 South Africa and the rest of Africa. According to the FIRS chair, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, MultiChoice\u2019s latest results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nThe Group, in a statement responding to the accusations, said it had not been formally notified about the matter and the case appeared to be based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d that MultiChoice Nigeria had not fully disclosed all its existing subscribers to the authorities.\n\n\u201cWe have engaged openly with FIRS and the engagements are ongoing in a transparent and constructive manner,\u201d it said, adding that it believed the issue could be amicably resolved.\n\nMultiChoice is the latest South African firm involved in a huge tax scandal in Nigeria. In 2018, the Nigerian unit of MTN Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes relating to the importation of equipment and payments to foreign suppliers from 2007 to 2017. Though the tax demand was eventually dropped.\n\nBeing one of DStv\u2019s biggest markets, the tax dispute in Nigeria could significantly disrupt the operations of MultiChoice if it is not resolved quickly.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "Daystar Power, a provider of hybrid solar power solutions to businesses in West Africa, has secured a facility of $20 million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to fund its project pipeline in Nigeria.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sunrah Ventures, Daystar Power is an off-grid power service provider whose solutions, \u201cSolar-as-a-Service\u201d and \u201cPower-as-a-Service\u201d provide clean and reliable power while significantly reducing overall power costs for clients.\n\nThe $20 million facility takes Daystar\u2019s total raised funding to $62 million this year. It comes on the back of a $38 million Series-B fundraise in January to expand across West Africa and a $4 million financing for its Ghanaian subsidiary.\n\nThe company, which started out in Nigeria, is now currently active in Ghana, Senegal, and Togo as well, with a representative office in Ivory Coast.\n\nThe IFC investment is split into two equal tranches. Daystar Power will receive a $10 million local currency loan from IFC, which will be provided to its Nigerian subsidiary, Daybreak Power Solutions.\n\nWith the fundraising, the company will invest in hybrid renewable energy systems in Nigeria, where it currently manages and operates 150 power installations.\n\nAnother $10 million subordinated loan will be provided by the Canada-IFC Renewable Energy Program for Africa. Daystar Power is working with the Canadian-funded IFC program, Energy2Equal, to close gender gaps and increase women\u2019s participation in the renewable energy sector.\n\nDaystar Power has 29 megawatts (MW) of installed solar power capacity to date. It plans to expand that capacity to 140MW by 2024, as well as grow its client base in the financial services, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The IFC investment is important to this ambition.\n\n\u201cThe funds will allow us to grow our installed capacity of solar projects and serve more Nigerian businesses in need of clean and affordable power,\u201d said Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, CEO and Co-founder of Daystar Power.\n\nHardenberg adds that Daystar Power gains \u201cmore than just capital\u201d from the IFC investment. This, according to him, is because the corporation brings a wealth of in-depth knowledge of renewable energy projects and project finance in emerging markets.\n\nThe IFC has financed more than 50 gigawatts of power generation to date, according to information on its website. In terms of renewable energy, the corporation has funded low-cost renewable energy projects with a generation capacity of more than 8 gigawatts in hydropower, 4 gigawatts in wind energy, and 5 gigawatts in solar energy.\n\nMore fundraising news is expected from Daystar Power as it looks to power businesses in West Africa, a region where the rate of access to electricity is 52% on average and power cuts of up to 80 hours are recorded per month, per a World Bank report.\n\nThe company had earlier revealed plans to raise $100 million in the next three years to finance its expansion across the region. The funds, which is a debt, will be raised through five rounds of $20 million each.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article? Please fill out this survey.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

Existing investors like Khosla Impact, ValueStream Ventures, Beta.Ventures, 500 Startups, and Story Ventures participated. New VCs like LocalGlobe, Intercept Ventures, and Future Africa also took part in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn total, Smile Identity has raised $11 million from investors with this latest funding round. In 2019, it raised $4 million in seed funding.\n\nWhat does Smile Identity do? Founded by Mark Straub and Willliam Bares in 2017, Smile Identity provides identity verification and KYC compliance tools to help African banks, telecom companies, financial service providers, and ride-sharing businesses better engage their customers.\n\nExpansion so far? Following the co-founders\u2019 arrival in Africa, the business has made key strides in its activities, such as the establishment of a local presence in six African countries: Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Rwanda, and Uganda.\n\nInterestingly, the company claims to connect to over 15 different identity authorities, while its ID validation covers over 250 million identities on the continent.\n\nThe new investment will allow the company to offer even better services and grow in new markets. It will also support more ID types and hire more engineers and staff on the continent.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nSafaricom increases the cost of airtime\n\nKenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta, has accepted the Kenyan Parliamentary Committee\u2019s additional taxes proposal.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the Kenyan Parliamentary Committee\u2019s recent call for new taxes on airtime and data service prices. Finally, the bill has been passed into law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of recent changes to the taxation of telephone and Internet data services, Safaricom, one of Kenya\u2019s top telecom companies, has adjusted the pricing of its products and services.\n\nWhat does this mean for Safaricom\u2019s subscribers? Calls made between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. will now cost Sh4.87 per minute, while calls made between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. will only cost Sh2.50 per minute.\n\nThe cost of Safaricom home fibre for the lowest package will rise to Sh2,999 from Sh2,900, while the silver package increases to Sh4,100 from Sh3,999.\n\nThe gold and diamond packages \u2014 up from Sh5,699 and Sh11,499 \u2014 will now cost Sh6,299 and Sh12,499, respectively.\n\nAdditional fees were also introduced for roaming and international calls. The cost to send a single short message is now Sh1.20.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of browsing via airtime (without bundles) will increase at a similar rate to voice calls.\n\nSimilar? Mobile network operators, including Airtel Kenya and Telkom Kenya, have also adjusted their calling charges. The two telecom companies have raised the rate of calls to Sh2.78 per minute. Also, the price of Telkom Kenya\u2019s SMS message has increased to Sh1.15.\n\nMarketForce raises $2 million pre-Series A round\n\nFeatured Image Credit: TechCrunch\n\nAnother funding? Yes. Kenyan B2B retail platform, MarketForce, has raised $2 million pre-Series A to focus on its business-to-business (B2B) retail marketplace, RajeRaje.\n\nWho participated in the round? P1 Ventures, Y Combinator, Launch Africa, V8 Capital, Future Africa, GreenHouse Capital, Rebel Fund, Remapped Ventures, and other unnamed investors.\n\nBefore now, the retail distribution platform raised $350,000 in seed round and a $150,000 cheque from Y Combinator as part of the accelerator\u2019s Summer 2020 batch. This round brings the funds raised by the company to $2.5 million.\n\nThe retail distribution platform got into Y Combinator accelerator\u2019s Summer batch 2020, and upon graduation, they decided to attempt the RejaReja model.\n\nRajeRaje is a B2B e-commerce marketplace for merchants and was launched in 2020 to assist informal retail merchants purchase and sell FMCGs and digital financial services.\n\nWith RejaReja, it\u2019s interesting to see MarketForce joining other supply chain revamp startups like TradeDepot and Sokowatch to fix Africa\u2019s unorganised retail supply chains.\n\nRejaReja has more than 15,000 retail customers in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania who use the platform to process thousands of orders daily.\n\nExpansion plans? It\u2019s planning on expanding to Nigeria with the new funds and expanding its product across East Africa.\n\nIncredibly, the founders \u2014 Tesh Mbaabu, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and Mesongo Sibuti, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) \u2014 are computer science graduates with little experience in retail distribution, eCommerce, and fintech.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nNigeria to block MultiChoice Nigeria and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts\n\nDStv dish.

Yesterday, Thursday, July 8, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) announced that it had directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) and MultiChoice Africa (MCA) in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nWhy did it happen? Abdullahi Ahmad, the Director of Communications and Liaison Department, said the company has continuously violated all contracts and agreements with the tax agency.\n\nBesides, MultiChoice allegedly denied the FIRS access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\nMuhammed Nami, Executive Chairman, FIRS, said that the companies have failed to provide relevant and timely responses to correspondences, and their records are not accurate and accessible.\n\nSo, the banks that handle business for MultiChoice Africa and MultiChoice Nigeria were instructed to perform a balanced search on their accounts before undertaking any other transaction on their behalf.\n\nNonetheless, MultiChoice believes that the case is based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d because they were not formally notified on the matter. Also, they said they had not given authorities full access to their subscribers\u2019 information.\n\nMultichoice told Reuters that they had previously engaged in an open, transparent, and constructive dialogue with FIRS, and they hoped that issue could be resolved amicably.\n\nSimilar? In 2018, MTN Nigeria Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes on imports and other payments from 2007 to 2017. However, the demand was later withdrawn.\n\nIf this controversy isn\u2019t resolved soon, it could have an adverse effect on DStv\u2019s operations in Nigeria.

They did not promptly respond to correspondences and lacked data integrity and transparency. It also added that the group\u2019s performance did not reflect in their tax obligations and compliance level in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReferring to the group\u2019s Nigerian subsidiary, the tax authority said MCN \u201chas avoided giving FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mohammed Nami, Executive Chairman FIRS, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nHowever, per TechCabal, MultiChoice\u2019s results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nAccording to Reuters, MultiChoice Group makes a third of its business elsewhere on the continent outside South Africa. From the company\u2019s annual report, Nigeria is its biggest market in that segment.\n\nInterestingly, at the close of business yesterday, MultiChoice stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange were down 7.38% from the previous day. The fall reached levels that have not been seen since October 2020.\n\nNigeria\u2019s tax to GDP ratio has steadily declined between 2001 to 2020, reaching a record low of 6.3% in July 2020\n\nWith such an abysmal tax to GDP ratio \u2014 one of the lowest in the world \u2014 the country has tried to increase its tax base. In 2017, it introduced the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS), from which the government claimed to have raised \u20a670 billion\n\nIn 2019, it also increased its Value Added Tax from 5% to 7.5%, generating \u20a61.53 trillion in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiChoice becomes the second South African company to face a crackdown from Nigerian authorities. MTN has been the subject of several penalties, the most recent which occurred in 2018 involved a $2 billion tax bill for payments to foreign suppliers. The bill was later withdrawn.\n\nIn an official reply, MCN said it had not received any notification from FIRS yet. It has however indicated that it is willing to engage the tax authority transparently and constructively. It also said its operations in Nigeria are continuing.\n\nThe company says it has been and is currently discussing with FIRS regarding their concerns and believes they can resolve the matter amicably.\n\nIt remains to be seen if these words will ring true in the coming days.",

          "title": "Don\u2019t elevate injustice to statecraft, Nigerians tell Buhari",
          "text": "Many Nigerians are increasingly getting disturbed about the style of governance of the Muhammadu Buhari administration. The administration appears to have two definitions of citizenship and who a citizen actually is.\n\nThe President thus deals with individuals, groups, zones, and states depending on his own definition of who a citizen is. This, many believe, has been the major trouble with Nigeria.\n\nNigeria is often in the news for the wrong reasons. From being rated among the most corrupt countries, the most populous African nation is also sitting well among the world\u2019s poorest countries, amid growing crime rate and high level of insecurity.\n\nIn recent times, the level of injustice in the country is said to have become unprecedented.\n\nToday, Nigerians point to obvious cases of \u2018robbing Peter to pay Paul\u2019. The concern for many people is that the alleged injustice is being elevated to a statecraft.\n\nThe general belief in the country today is that the President, unlike his \u201cI belong to nobody\u201d claim, really \u201cbelongs to some people.\u201d\n\nRecall that during his inaugural speech in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari had promised that his administration would uphold the rule of law, take the interest of all sections of the country into consideration in decision making.\n\nBuhari had emerged victorious, became the first opposition candidate to defeat a sitting president in a landmark election earlier that year, he had equally vowed to lead an administration committed to the needs of over 200 million Nigerians.\n\n\u201cHaving just a few minutes ago sworn on the Holy Book, I intend to keep my oath and serve as President to all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI belong to everybody and I belong to nobody. A few people have privately voiced fears that on coming back to office I shall go after them. These fears are groundless. There will be no paying off old scores. The past is prologue,\u201d Buhari had said.\n\nHowever, six years down the line the reverse appears to be the case. Observers say Nigeria is on the verge of collapse, if urgent steps are not taken to correct the glaring division arising from the non-inclusive style of the Buhari administration.\n\nConcerns have continued to grow in Nigeria in recent years over the leadership style of President Buhari.\n\nAttention of the Presidency and the President has constantly been drawn to obvious government\u2019s double standard on issues affecting Nigerians, but they have always explained things away.\n\nPresently, there is general belief that the country is divided as never before, while the policies, conduct, programmes of President Buhari have fueled hatred among the different ethnic groups.\n\nBuhari\u2019s perceived loyalty to a section of the country is never in doubt; this is amid the spate of insecurity and rising impunity across Nigeria.\n\nOne such instance is the insistence by the President to give approval to the return of open grazing practised during the First Republic where herdsmen used designated grazing routes to move cattle to several parts of the country.\n\nSpeaking in an interview recently, the President said he had asked the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami to begin the process of recovering land from persons who have converted cattle grazing routes for their personal use.\n\nHis comment came despite the daily criminal and violent crimes committed by herdsmen across the country and had generated outcry among Nigerians.\n\nUnfortunately, the President does not consider the huge disruption such an exercise would cause in society, just to please a group of people.\n\nIkedy Isiguzo, a public affairs commentator, said: \u201cBuhari is not thinking of conflicts that would result from demolishing new communities that have sprouted since the abandonment of the grazing routes.\n\n\u201cHas anyone wondered what would happen in routes government property obstructs? New routes would be found at the expense of ordinary Nigerians. The consistent reference to government property suggests that places like Abuja would pave ways for the routes, possibly through the city centre.\u201d\n\nIsiguzo wondered: \u201cWhat can Buhari not do for cattle? Without clarity about the contributions of cattle to the economy, Buhari uses public funds to promote cattle rearing, a private business. The mute National Assembly is impressed.\n\n\u201cBuhari\u2019s cattle policies are escalating insecurity in Nigeria. His brazen partiality for Fulani herdsmen creates more enemies for the otherwise peaceful herdsmen now emboldened by the knowledge that Buhari knows and approves their lawlessness.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in 2017, there was a revelation by the President of the World Bank, Jim Kim, that President Buhari directed the financial institution to focus development in the Northern part of the country.\n\nAlthough the Presidency had denied Kim\u2019s revelation, many Nigerians believed every word about it going by Buhari\u2019s style.\n\nThe administration makes no pretences about its dalliance with certain groups and has constantly shown that it was out to promote the interest of such groups above that of the country.\n\nOn numerous occasions, there has been criticism from ethnic nationalities and political leaders; they say that the fury over Buhari\u2019s handling of the nation\u2019s diversity has increased secessionist agitations in the country, while describing him as a sectional leader.\n\n\u201cHis action actually makes people begin to think that there is no basis for staying together. How many years will he stay as a President? He has only two years to go. I would suggest that we allow him to just stay and leave rather than divide the country when we can fix it,\u201d Monday Ubani, former vice president of the NBA, said.\n\nAccording to Ubani, \u201cHis actions have called for more agitation. The point is that if we need a country that would function for all of us, we need to restructure Nigeria. If we are united and manage this country well, Nigeria is one of the best countries in the world.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the only solution to the country\u2019s problems and injustice in the Buhari\u2019s administration is for Nigeria to practise true federalism.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf we restore the country in such a manner that we operate a proper federal system of government, where the federating units would possess devolution of powers. The powers should be taken from the centre and given to federating units where everyone would move at its own speed.\n\n\u201cIf we fail to restructure the agitations would continue and we would never have peace. Only true federalism can guarantee peace in the country.\u201d\n\nKunle Okunade, a political analyst, said the only solution was for the government to change its leadership style by running inclusive government, adding that it was obvious that the administration had polarised the country and was responsible for the present agitations for divisions.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe leadership of the Nigerian state in its governance attitude encourages state injustice and so, this breeds the various agitations we are experiencing in the southern part of the country. It is obvious that issues raised by these agitators both in the Southwest and the Southeast had colouration of social injustice which many believe can be avoided.\n\n\u201cThe approaches deployed by the Federal government in addressing the challenges have made many analysts conclude that clamping down on southern agitators violently, using state apparatus and deployment of subtle approaches on bandits and terrorists in the North, further polarise or rather divide the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nOkunade further noted that \u201cThe challenges facing the country can only be resolved if the central government displays a leadership act of cohesion rather than sectionalism. And this can only show through the policies and body-language of the President\u201d.\n\nAs Umoh Edem, an Eket, Akwa Ibom indigene describes it, injustice is the cankerworm that has eaten honesty and hard-work in the Nigerian society.\n\nThe Petroleum Engineer graduate from the University of Port Harcourt regrets that he couldn\u2019t get a job at Mobil in Eket, his home town, while those less-qualified than him and from far places are living large from the natural resources in his domain.\n\nA few years ago, a female journalist from Calabari in Rivers State, got angry with her father, a high chief, who couldn\u2019t get her job at the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) at Eleme.\n\nThe argument of the father had always been that Rivers State has exhausted its quota, but the female journalist, who is tired of her less-paying media job, would always retort, but there is no quota in stealing our oil and gas.\n\nToday, she has relocated to Michigan in the United States of America as she couldn\u2019t understand why those from far north are occupying positions in establishments in her hometown, while indigenes rot in joblessness.\n\nGoing to the root, Omololu Fadaka, a senior lecturer at a Lagos private university, decried that the quota system, which was included in the Constitution in 1979, killed merit and upheld injustice.\n\nFrom education, employment, appointment, promotion, award of contracts, among others, quota system, according to Fadaka, flagged off the injustice that has grown out of hand in the country today.\n\n\u201cWith merit at 45 percent, catchment area at 35 percent, and 20 percent to educationally-less developed states, which are mostly situated in the northern part of the country, injustice was enshrined in the Nigerian constitution long ago\u201d, Fadaka said.\n\nIt would be recalled that at the conferment of the Nigerian National Order of Merit Award in 2016 on Omowunmi Sadiq and Tanure Ojaide, two professors, Yemi Osinbajo, vice president, said the nation had placed quota before merit which \u201cwe know does not work\u201d.\n\nIn other words, injustice is reigning. It is also believed that the situation has become worse in the last six years.\n\nThe southern part of the country seems more unjustly treated by the government.\n\nObservers have been crying foul over the injustice as well. Currently, agitators from the Southern part of the country are being prosecuted for daring to ask for better opportunities and equal treatment for their people.\n\nThere have been arguments on why Nnamdi Kanu is arrested, while the government beg to negotiate with bandits, why Sunday Igboho is molested for fighting off herders on his farmland, while killer herdsmen still roam the forests freely.\n\nMoreover, the regular meetings of southern governors are becoming a concern for the government, while the meetings of northern governors, which have been on for ages have not given the government sleepless night.\n\nAs Abidemi Oniga, a Lagos-based economist rightly pointed out, resources in the southern part of the country are commonwealth of the nation and have been used to develop the entire country while the north reserve theirs.\n\n\u201cWe all know the crisis in Zamfara is because of the gold being mined illegally there. The government knows and nothing is being done, but illegal refineries are being destroyed in Niger Delta. Are both not our natural resources, just because the oil is in the south?\u201d he said.\n\nHe is angered over the slashing of the percent given to oil producing areas in the recently passed Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) by the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt is laughable that the eyes of the north have been on the small percentage given to oil producing areas whose environment has been destroyed by the exploration activities over the years. If the oil had been in the north, I don\u2019t think it would be shared by all the country. It is injustice\u201d, he lamented.\n\nOniga suggested that the solution is to go back to the root and to the drawing table once again to write a constitution that will protect the interest of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe need a better constitution that will serve and protect all interests; a constitution that will ensure that a killer dies no matter who kills, who is killed or where he comes from,\u201d Oniga said.\n\nEdem thinks that the government should force all oil companies to relocate their headquarters to Niger Delta, and offer jobs to the region\u2019s indigenes on merit.\n\nOn his part, Fadaka thinks that the quota system should be abolished, while Southern governors should keep the pressure on government to balance the equation across all areas of injustice in the country.\n\nThe recent decisions by the Southern governors on a number of national issues, truly explain how frustrated the state chief executive officers have become under the current administration.\n\nAlthough a number of them are in the same party with the President, they do not believe things are being done the right way in the country, at the moment.\n\nIt was the frustration that led to the meeting in Asaba, Delta State in May where a decision was taken to end the open grazing by herdsmen.\n\nAgain, it was the same frustration that resulted in the Lagos meeting last Monday, where they also frowned at other likely policies that lend themselves to injustice.\n\nOn the now passed Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) Law, the governors commended the National Assembly for the progress so far made. The governors rejected outright the proposed 3percent and supported the 5percent share of the oil revenue to the host community as recommended by the House of Representatives;\n\nThey also rejected the proposed 30percent share of profit for the exploration of oil and gas in the basins, rejecting however, \u201cthe ownership structure of the proposed Nigeria National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC).\u201d\n\nThe Southern governors disagree that the company be vested in the Federal Ministry of Finance but should be held in trust by Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) since all tiers of Government have stakes in that vehicle.\n\nLast week, following the re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of IPOB, Governors Nyesom Wike and Samuel Ortom of Rivers and Benue States, respectively, upbraided Abuja, challenging the President to show same energy in arresting the killer Fulani herdsmen, Boko Haram and bandits terrorising Nigerians.\n\nAlthough they did not support Kanu, insisting that the law must take its course, the governors noted that it was hypocritical on the part of the President to shield his people while going brutal against others that commit same offence.\n\nWike, for instance, said the Federal Government must demonstrate its resolve to address insecurity crisis facing the country, and must deploy the same dragnet with which government re-arrested Kanu to urgently clamp down on bandits and Miyetti Allah militias terrorising the country.\n\n\u201cWe must not make hullabaloo about the prosecution of Nnamdi Kanu. I don\u2019t agree with his principle. I have come out and said you (Kanu) cannot annex my state to be your own. But that does not mean that you\u2019ll not allow the law to take its course,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot afford to discriminate at this point. You cannot say because Nnamdi Kanu is from a particular area, let us prosecute him. The same thing must apply to all other people, the bandits, Miyetti Allah,\u201d Wike further said.\n\nAbubakar Umar, a retired colonel and former Military Administrator of Kaduna State, a few days ago, blamed President Buhari and the Federal Government for separatist agitations threatening national unity.\n\nUmar pointedly said that the current administration, has failed to unite the country.\n\nHe lambasted the government for what he described as undue attention to threats of separatist movements in contrast to the more daunting threats posed by bandits, kidnappers and insurgents in the North West, some parts of North Central and North East.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday titled: \u2018Nigeria; A Nation Challenged,\u2019 the former MILAD said the best way to unite a diverse and fragile nation like Nigeria was through justice, fairness and equity.\n\nHe stated the current administration has so far exhibited poor skills management of national diversities despite availability of great examples by past administrations and statesmen.\n\nSpeaking on challenges he considers more daunting than the threats of separatists agitations, Umar said: \u201cIt is quite strange and disturbing the Federal Government is according undue attention to the threats of separatist movements in contrast to the more daunting ones posed by bandits, kidnappers and insurgents in the North West, some parts of North Central and North East.\n\n\u201cActivities of those criminals have resulted in the evacuation of over 20 percent of the villages in NW and NE. Hundreds are being murdered and maimed every week. Many more are kidnapped for ransom.\n\n\u201cMillions have been rendered internally displaced, facing disease and starvation. Over one thousand school children were abducted in the past 8 months with over 300 still in the hands of the bandits and kidnappers demanding humongous ransom payments.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that \u201cRape of women and young girls has become a daily occurrence. Most economic activities, particularly farming, which is the mainstay of the people in these areas, are now all but impossible.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s earlier claim of having technically defeated the BH insurgency in the NE has turned out to be empty propaganda. Contrary to this claim, the enemy has morphed into a more determined and deadly force, threatening to overrun the whole of the NE.\n\n\u201cFor the average Northerner living in these zones, who is barely aware of the activities of separatists, banditry, kidnappings and insurgency are of greater threat and concern to him. The arrest of Nnamdi Kanu is of no serious consequence, since it does nothing to ameliorate his harsh and brutal condition.\u201d",

          "text": "John C. Maxwell, an American author and speaker, is a widely acknowledged thought leader. Maxwell asserts in one of his most famous quotes, which encapsulates the true essence of leadership, \u201cThe pessimist complains about the wind. The optimist expects it to change. The leader adjusts the sails\u201d.\n\nFidelity Bank CEO, Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe is leading the financial institution through a significant evolution of business culture with the primary objective of improving operational efficiency and expanding market share. Mrs. Onyeali-Ikpe is adjusting \u201cthe sails\u201d to ensure that her colleagues at Fidelity Bank have the wind at their backs as they work toward common goals and individual successes.\n\nCurrently, Nneka has her sights fixed on positioning the bank as one of Nigeria\u2019s leading financial institutions, which leverages automation and robotics to replace manual and repetitive processes. The global lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was a messenger unlike any other, signaling that Nigeria\u2019s traditional and over-the-counter banking systems are no longer viable.\n\nSince assuming office in January 1 2021, the bank\u2019s first female CEO and MD, has outlined a seven-point agenda to move the bank further in its quest to become a tier-1 bank that is well-positioned to outlive the competition and serve well into the future.\n\nOverview and timeline\n\nFidelity Bank\u2019s seven-point agenda focuses on brand architecture, brand building and refresh, talent development and transformation, product and service delivery, agility and performance discipline, digital transformation, and regulatory compliance.\n\nIn accordance with this, here are the bank\u2019s strategies for ensuring that it attains its objectives:\n\n1. The bank intends to embark on an Innovation Drive through the implementation of new processes, techniques. The bank is also executing fresh ideas to ensure continuous process improvement, reduce cost to serve, increase competitiveness, improve brand recognition and value, build new partnerships and relationships, drive turnover, and increase profitability.\n\n2. Brand refresh with the aim to increase top-of-mind awareness of the Fidelity brand by external and internal stakeholders.\n\n3. Workforce Transformation to create a future readily supported by a high performing and empowered workforce. This will be achieved by deepening the skills and competencies of staff across the bank, entrenching a culture of high performance, and embedding new ways of working in the bank. So far, the commencement of capacity building training for staff and senior management training are some of the initiatives implemented.\n\n4. Service Excellence which is intended to build brand loyalty through personalized and seamless customer experience delivery. This is already underway with the award-winning virtual assistant IVY. This revolutionary chatbot handles simple tasks like account opening to complex tasks such as complaint resolution, bill payment, transferring users to a live agent, loans, fixed deposit applications, and answering random questions.\n\n5. Digital Transformation involves an end-to-end digitization across all facets of the business. In line with this, the bank has launched a novel digital service \u2014Pay Yourself \u2014which revolutionized payday for salary earners and SMEs.\n\n6. Performance Discipline to ensure focus on strong fundamentals, asset quality, and strategic cost management. Initiatives already carried out in this regard include;\n\n\u2013 The Policy Familiarization Program \u2014a capacity-building project geared towards building a knowledgeable and versatile staff network/raising subject matter experts in all business areas that kicked off in March.\n\n\u2013 The One Culture Project- which was initiated to reinforce enabling behaviours and value systems towards fulfilling the bank\u2019s goals\n\n\u2013 Project Alpha- aimed at helping the bank develop a robust and holistic learning and development framework for all staff.\n\n7. Accelerated Growth which will drive aggressive market penetration and business diversification. This will be achieved through deeper penetration in key retail markets.\n\nOther initiatives geared towards deepening growth include; accelerated play in the SME segment, renewal of institutional banking, and drive for transaction-based propositions in corporate banking.\n\nWith this seven pronged agenda, Fidelity Bank is well on its way to leading the sector while revolutionizing Nigeria\u2019s financial landscape.",

          "text": "Dr. Muda Yusuf, the immediate past Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), has expressed worry about excess borrowing by the Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government in the midst of dwindling revenue.\n\nYusuf noted that a large portion of the domestic borrowing was through ways and means which has serious implications for inflation.\n\nWays and means is a mechanism for the government to borrow from the Central Bank under specified credit policy which, most times, entails printing money.\n\nYusuf who spoke at the Bi-Monthly Forum of the Finance Correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN) held at its national secretariat in Lagos on Thursday, as part of its capacity building programme, said that the borrowing spree of the Federal Government was hurting the economy as it escalates the already high rate of inflation in the country.\n\nHe disclosed that the facility usually comes at a huge cost to the taxpayer as the government paid N480 billion interest on the N1.8 trillion facility granted to it through the ways and means window between January and May 2021.\n\nHe expressed concern that government\u2019s excess borrowing has put pressure on the apex bank to exceed the \u201c5 percent ceiling of actual government revenue for the preceding year\u201d, specified in the CBN Act.\n\nAccording to him, the fast rate of money supply has adverse effects on the people\u2019s standard of living which has become a source of worry to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt has inflationary implications; it is not healthy for the economy because inflation erodes the value of people\u2019s income and affects their standard of living. The value of a currency has a lot to do with poverty and welfare. We must be worried about the fast rate of money supply because inflation triggers poverty,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that \u201cInflationary environment elevates production costs with adverse impact on corporate profitability, thereby making it increasingly difficult for businesses and corporates to meet their debt obligations to lending institutions. This translates into a significant increase in credit loss provisions with adverse impact on banks\u2019 profitability.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to caution the government against being too dependent on the CBN for financing deficits because of the high inflationary impact. Inflation is a terrible thing. When people complain about hunger and poverty, it is because the money they have in their hands cannot buy anything much.\u201d\n\nDr Yusuf advised the government to prioritize its borrowing in the light of dwindling revenue, noting that up to 90 percent of the nation\u2019s revenue is committed to debt servicing which he said should be a major concern to the Nigerians.\n\nHe suggested rationalisation of spending as a way out of excess borrowing, noting that borrowing to fund recurrent expenditure is inimical to economic development.\n\nHe also advised the government to consider private partnership in funding projects that require huge capital outlay as well as selling idle assets to raise funds for building infrastructure.\n\nOn foreign exchange volatility, the immediate past LCCI boss noted that the foreign exchange market faced liquidity constraints in the first half of 2021, and that forex was inadequate to meet rising demand.\n\n\u201cThe supply of foreign exchange was inadequate to meet rising demand. The rate premium between the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate (NAFEX) and the parallel market rate averaged around 20 percent.\n\n\u201cSeveral businesses and corporates encountered difficulties in sourcing foreign exchange at the formal segment of the market and were forced to source the greenback at the parallel market.\n\n\u201cForeign exchange illiquidity aggravates investment risk which could negatively impact asset quality in the banking system. Foreign currency-denominated loans account for about between 30 percent and 35 percent of bank\u2019s loan book. Foreign exchange volatility is associated with risks relating to asset quality and financial stability.\u201d\n\nHe said that financial service institutions need a conducive business climate to create more avenues for investment and that more profitable asset classes are needed for profitable investments to take place.\n\nHe further stressed the need to address the structural, policy, institutional, and regulatory constraints in the business environment which would also result in a reduction in non-performing loans in the banking sector.\n\nDr Yusuf recalled that the banking industry demonstrated resilience amid disruptions associated with the pandemic, attributable to the policy intervention of the CBN.\n\n\u201cGoing by key ratios, the banking industry is financially stable and sound with industry capital adequacy and liquidity ratios above regulatory threshold while non-performing loan ratios is slightly above the five percent prudential guideline.\n\n\u201cCash reserve requirement remained elevated at 27.5 percent. A high CRR constrains banks from deploying funds into several profitable and productive ventures, thereby impacting their liquidity position.\u201d\n\nHe said that the current CRR environment negates policy that mandates banks to lend at least 65 percent of customer deposits to the real sector and advocating for a flexible CRR policy that would reflect the actual level of a bank\u2019s deposit at any time.\n\nHe projects a stable environment for banks and businesses in general in the second half of the year with recent developments such as the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill by the Ninth National Assembly after years of neglect.\n\n\u201cAlso, the National Assembly has passed the 2021 supplementary budget. The budget makes provision for vaccine procurement and security-related expenditures. Lawmakers have endorsed the move to raise $6.1 billion via the issuance of Eurobonds.\n\n\u201cImprovement in current vaccination rate is expected to improve economic and business activities in the country, which is positive for the sustenance of growth recovery.\n\n\u201cInflation is expected to decelerate in the second half of the year on account of base effects and expectations of modest harvest, barring further exchange rate adjustment.\n\n\u201cWith the deceleration in inflation rate, monetary policymakers would be further encouraged to keep policy parameters at current levels. Relative stability is anticipated in the foreign exchange market as CBN sustains its intervention efforts,\u201d he said.",

It is a business corporation that provides armed and unarmed security services to private and public clients in the country.\n\nIn a chat at the weekend with the managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of Strict Guard Security company, Mr Borne Efozien, he discloses that he has been in the security business for many years now and sees the business as a passion.\n\nSteps To Starting\n\nCertain steps and conditions, he says must be met before one can set up a security company.\n\nOne of such steps include: a business plan, even as such outfit must be certified. He says staff of such outfit must acquire training, while the location of a security firm must be strategically located and accessible to clients.\n\nOne must also get the necessary tools like: belts, guns , digital display systems, vehicle tracking, CCTV surveillance, guard dogs, baton, pepper spray, hand gloves, tear gas, among others.\n\nHe noted that getting a comprehensive insurance for himself and his staff was vital as the work of protecting people, involves risks.\n\nImportance Of A Security Outfit\n\nEfozien also stated that despite Nigeria being a major player in global affairs and a leading nation in Africa, it has had its fair share of insecurity emanating or arising from diverse sources such as; insurgency, recurring violent religious crises, ethnic and poverty-induced militancy as well as crisis occasioned by clamour for self-determination.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore evident from the history of Nigeria in the last 55 years that the issue of security remains in the front burner of national discourse. Developments around the world and specifically in Nigeria in the last five years have raised the stakes.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned incidents of domestic violence arising from chieftaincy conflicts, growing cases of sophisticated armed robberies, economic-induced kidnappings, incessant oil bunkering, sea piracy, rival cult groups\u2019 killings and ritual-related murders/killings were the major challenges facing the Security business in Nigeria.\n\nAnd security business is necessary to tackle the reality that thefts and other crimes can occur on business premises.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome businesses such as convenience stores, banks and retail stores, may be more of a target for criminals and petty thieves than other types. However, a wide variety of businesses choose to hire security guards which they can be used to prevent crime, maintain security and assist customers and employees.\n\n\u201cBusiness owners should assess the benefits of hiring a security guard before making the decision to bring one on board,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nProfitability\n\nSales estimates project a revenue of N45 million in the first year while operators say annual revenue could rise to N90 million in the second and third year of operations.",

          "text": "Dr. Sule Lamido, a former Governor of Jigawa State and a PDP chieftain, has stated that President Muhammadu Buhari will not allow Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to succeed him as President of Nigeria.\n\nIn an interview with the Sunday Telegraph in Kano on Wednesday, Lamido claimed that because Buhari has created a cult following in the North, the president and those around him would not want another person with a large personality to succeed him.\n\nIf Tinubu wins the election, Lamido believes he will overshadow and discredit Buhari\u2019s tenure in power with his own accomplishments. According to Lamido, Tinubu is the only person in his constituency who has a similar following to Buhari but is more focused and results-oriented. Indeed, he claimed that those close to the president are envious of Tinubu, and that this is why the National Leader is having political difficulties.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnybody with Tinubu\u2019s personality, they will not allow him to succeed Buhari. That is why they will not allow Tinubu to succeed him because they don\u2019t want Tinubu to bury Buhari\u2019s personality.\n\nThat is why Tinubu is having some problems. If you put Tinubu there, he will bury Buhari\u2019s personality and presidency.\n\nHe will bury Buhari\u2019s political history because Tinubu is focused; he is a leader; he breeds and nurtures people. He knows the economy. I mean, he has so much going for him that they envy him.\n\n\u201cTherefore, they will never allow him see the light of the day with his aspiration.\n\nLeave all these Muslim-Muslim kind of thing. \u201cI mean, the personality. They will not allow him get to the presidency because if he gets there, his achievement there will simply bury Buhari and make nonsense of Buhari\u2019s presidency. I mean, they will not allow him.\u201d\n\nLamido also added that so many people in the APC would be disappointed by Buhari, whom he said, would be aloof and would not help even his own party, APC.\n\nHe said: \u201cNone of them in APC has the appeal, stature, aura, personality or the charm of Buhari. They are just a company around him. The only person, who can stand on his own against Buhari is Tinubu. Buhari would not allow him. Tinubu is rich, he is a politician, he understands Nigeria and he has a large constituency that will vote for him.\n\n\u201cIt means these small, small persons, these creations of office are hovering around Buhari, hoping he will allow them; they are in for a very, very huge disappointment.\n\n\u201cIn the election of 2023, Buhari may not be relevant but he has a hold on the north, especially all the Mallams, who portray him as so pious; that he wears only one cloth since 2015, that in his house, he couldn\u2019t change his chairs and his house has been invaded by rodents; that he wears the same cap and gown since 1998 because he is so God fearing and pious.\n\n\u201cIn 2023, he will become aloof, totally indifferent but he would not want to bury his own history. What I know is that he doesn\u2019t want to have anybody standing on his own two feet after him.\n\nHe is a Fulani man. I know the mentality of the Fulani man. When they want to be bad, they will be really very bad. When they want to be good, they will be extremely good.\u201d\n\nLamido, who claimed that the Buhari government\u2019s \u201cfailure\u201d began with the president\u2019s victory in the 2015 election, said Nigeria would have lost its unity even if former President Goodluck Jonathan had won. That was because, rather than focusing on issues impacting the country, the 2015 election was about Jonathan and Buhari\u2019s personalities, according to him. Nigeria, he maintained, was not a part of the campaign at the time.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, the APC used the culture of lies to blackmail the PDP. After eight years, they have done only the opposite. In 2023, the PDP will only ask Nigerians if they have fared better. Under PDP, we were more prosperous, more secured and more Nigerian. Nigerians will choose between a two page historyone is PDP, one is APC.\n\n\u201cToday, because of Buhari, everything has been lost because the elections of 2015 were personalized. It was not about insecurity; it was not about the economy. It was about Jonathan has failed.\n\nThe PDP has not done anything in 15 years. There were no issues. I said then at a campaign in Abuja that whoever wins this election, Nigeria lost. Buhari came and said subsidy was a fraud, that PDP was behind Boko Haram and that the Central Bank was issuing money on mere piece of paper.\n\nThe intensity of the heat of the campaign made Nigerians lose some of their values. That is what is happening today- the killings, both North and South of human beings- the agitations, the (Sunday) Igbohos, the Nnamdi Kanus. They are all there. \u201cToday, how do you remain sane in this country?\n\nIt is about a government that came to power by lies. We are supposed to be an inspiration to the black race? Are we inspiring them now?\n\n\u201cThe system of 2014 brought up some kind of leaders, who are mere creations of the office. None of these people talking today was known for anything in nation building or anything like that. But it is the office that is now promoting their personalities.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the governor of Yobe, who is now the face of the APC; in saner societies, people will run away from him, where he is sitting because they will ask him, in his own state, is the state safe? The answer is no! Is his state, in terms of economy, is his state okay?\n\nAsk him of education and everything that makes a good state. Everything there has collapsed. Everything is gone. \u201cBut today, he will go to a PDP governor and invite him to the APC and the governor will follow him. And I ask, this our governor, is he normal?\n\nIf I am to follow a governor, I will ask him, Mr Governor, what is the appeal for me in your own state?\n\nTell me the appeal. What is the source of inspiration to me that will make me follow you? In terms of security, is your state safe? Imagine him going to the governor of Oyo to join APC? In terms of poverty, are people in Yobe State better?\n\nWhat is the incentive? But because they tell the governors, \u2018come, Buhari will see you,\u2019 they go. It is the same personality thing.\n\nOtherwise, in a saner society, how can somebody, who is the governor of Yobe, which symbolizes total failure, where everything has collapsed, go to a PDP governor and he follows him?\u201d",
          "summary": "If Tinubu wins the election, Lamido believes he will overshadow and discredit Buhari\u2019s tenure in power with his own accomplishments.\nAccording to Lamido, Tinubu is the only person in his constituency who has a similar following to Buhari but is more focused and results-oriented.\nThat is why they will not allow Tinubu to succeed him because they don\u2019t want Tinubu to bury Buhari\u2019s personality.\nIf you put Tinubu there, he will bury Buhari\u2019s personality and presidency.\n\u201cBut today, he will go to a PDP governor and invite him to the APC and the governor will follow him.",

The thing has not been working because those who are supposed to ensure that it runs well have not played their part.\n\n\u201cThey claim that they are being owed money for the subscription,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked to explain how the subscription works, the CP said the police had not paid the fees since 2015 and the police had had to rely on the DSS.\n\nHe added, \u201cFrom what I gathered, subscription fees are meant to be paid yearly but you won\u2019t believe that the police have not paid since 2015. Initially, the company gave us a grace period but they have now cut off the police completely. We now rely solely on DSS and NSA office. It\u2019s a terrible situation and it has worsened the insecurity in the country. The Police Trust Fund promised to help but we have not seen any action yet.\u201d\n\nAnother police commissioner confirmed the development but said efforts were being made to restore the equipment.\n\nThe police commissioner added that the platform was undergoing a system upgrade which would soon be completed.\n\nHe added, \u201cYou know this thing is technology just like computer so we do upgrades from time to time. A lot of people on the field don\u2019t even understand how it works. It is undergoing an upgrade because you have new features coming in from time to time. There are new technologies that you have to update to enhance their capacity.\n\n\u201cWe have some new equipment which we need to adjust so they can link together. Some are still working. It is not as if all components are shut. That is what is happening.\u201d",

Judges should not have to endure the most poignant financial worries,\u201d it said.\n\nBeyond the disparity between the remuneration of judges and political office holders, SERAP\u2019s suit is also based on the impact of the increase in cost of living and the importance of the roles played by judges, a role it considers as second to none with regard to providing justice and protecting human rights.\n\n\u201cAs a safeguard of judicial independence, the budget of the judiciary ought to be prepared in collaboration with the judiciary having regard to the peculiar needs and requirements of judicial administration,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe remuneration and pensions of judges must be secured by law at an adequate level that is consistent with their status and is sufficient to safeguard against conflict of interest and corruption.\u201d\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "title": "Wife of Assassinated Haitian President Moise Speaks Out, Says Body Was Riddled with Bullets",
          "text": "The wife of assassinated Haitian President Jovenel Moise has spoken for the first time since gunmen stormed the couple\u2019s home in Port-au-Prince, saying the attack that killed her husband happened \u201cin the blink of an eye\u201d.\n\nIn an audio message posted on her official Twitter account on Saturday, Martine Moise called on Haiti not to \u201close its way\u201d after the attack that left her critically injured.\n\n\u201cI am alive, thanks to God,\u201d Martine Moise said in Creole in the audio message, which Haiti\u2019s minister of culture and communications, Pradel Henriquez, confirmed to the AFP news agency as being authentic.\n\n\u201cI am alive but I have lost my husband Jovenel,\u201d she added.\n\nJovenel Moise, 53, was killed by armed gunmen in the early hours of Wednesday in what Haitian authorities said was \u201ca highly coordinated attack by a highly trained and heavily armed group\u201d.\n\nHaiti declared a 15-day \u201cstate of siege\u201d in the immediate aftermath of his killing, pledging to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nHaitian authorities say an armed commando of 28 men \u2013 26 Colombians and two Haitian-Americans \u2013 burst in and opened fire on the couple in their home. Seventeen people have been arrested so far and at least three suspects were killed, but no motive has been made public.\n\nMartine Moise was transported to a Haitian hospital after the attack and was later evacuated to Miami, Florida, for more treatment.\n\n\u201cIn the blink of an eye, the mercenaries entered my home and riddled my husband with bullets \u2026 without even giving him a chance to say a word,\u201d she said in the audio message.\n\nShe also said the mercenaries were sent to kill her husband \u201cbecause of roads, water, electricity and referendum as well as elections at the end of the year so that there is no transition in the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am crying, it is true, but we cannot let the country lose its way,\u201d Martine Moise said. \u201cWe cannot let his blood \u2026 have been spilled in vain.\u201d\n\nJovenel Moise served as president since 2017 amid rising gang violence that has displaced thousands of people across the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, in recent weeks, and that also saw a journalist and prominent political activist fatally shot.\n\nIn recent months, the country had been rocked by large protests at which Haitians urged Moise to step down, saying his five-year term expired in February \u2013 a view shared by top jurists, civil society groups and the country\u2019s political opposition.\n\nBut Moise insisted his presidency expired next year.\n\nHis death has thrown Haiti, which suffers from widespread poverty, into increased political instability \u2013 especially since before his death, Moise had been ruling by decree and was accused of stripping several key institutions of their ability to function.\n\nOn Friday, a group of legislators announced they had recognised Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti\u2019s dismantled Senate, as provisional president in a direct challenge to the interim government headed by Prime Minister Claude Joseph.\n\nThey also recognised as prime minister Ariel Henry, whom Moise had selected to replace Joseph a day before he was killed but who had not yet taken office or formed a government.\n\n\u201cAfter the president\u2019s assassination, I became the highest, legal and regular authority because there was a decree nominating me,\u201d Henry told the Reuters news agency in a phone interview late on Friday.\n\nJoseph, who assumed leadership with the backing of police and the military, said he was \u201cnot interested in a power struggle\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one way people can become president in Haiti. And that\u2019s through elections,\u201d he said.\n\nJoseph, who was named interim prime minister in April after the resignation of Joseph Jouthe, has taken the reins of power since the Moise\u2019s death, spearheading the government\u2019s response to the assassination, appealing to the United States to send in troops and declaring a 15-day \u201cstate of siege\u201d.\n\nThe Biden administration has said it has no immediate plans to send in the military, but would deploy FBI and Homeland Security officials to help with the investigation.\n\nElections Minister Mathias Pierre said Joseph would keep his role until presidential and legislative elections are held on September 26.\n\nUnder Haiti\u2019s 1987 constitution, the head of the Supreme Court should take over as interim president.\n\nBut amendments that are not unanimously recognised state that it be the prime minister, or, in the last year of a president\u2019s mandate \u2013 as was the case with Moise \u2013 that parliament should elect a president.\n\nFurther complicating the situation, the head of the Supreme Court died last month after contracting COVID-19 amid a surge in infections. There is also no sitting parliament as legislative elections scheduled for late 2019 were postponed amid political unrest.\n\nPeople react outside a police station where suspects in President Jovenel Moise\u2019s killing were being held, in Port-au-Prince, on July 8 [File: Estailove St-Val/Reuters]\n\nAndre Michel, a Haitian lawyer and political opposition leader, said on Friday night that \u201cthe solution to the political crisis must be Haitian and largely concerted between the political class, civil society, the Diaspora and grassroots groups\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny other process is unhealthy and dead on arrival,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the country\u2019s most powerful gang leaders on Saturday urged his men to take to the streets to protest against Moise\u2019s assassination, threatening to throw the country into further chaos.\n\nJimmy Cherizier, an ex-cop known as Barbecue who heads the so-called \u201cG9\u201d federation of nine gangs, railed against police and opposition politicians whom he accused of colluding with the \u201cstinking bourgeoisie\u201d to \u201csacrifice\u201d Moise.\n\n\u201cIt was a national and international conspiracy against the Haitian people,\u201d he said in a video address, dressed in khaki military fatigues and seated in front of a Haitian flag. \u201cWe tell all bases to mobilise, to mobilise and take to the streets for light to be shed on the president\u2019s assassination.\u201d",

But he was quiet throughout and uncharacteristically missed a golden opportunity to wrap the game up with two minutes remaining.\n\nWhen the final whistle went, Argentina TV declared \u201cArgentina Champions, Lionel Messi Champion!\u201d\n\nThe victory was Argentina\u2019s 15th Copa America triumph and means they draw level with Uruguay as the all-time leading winners.\n\nTheir win extended their sequence of undefeated matches to 20 under Lionel Scaloni and handed Brazil their first competitive defeat since they lost to Belgium in the quarter-finals of the 2018 World Cup.",

          "text": "Ethiopia\u2019s ruling Prosperity Party has won the most seats in the country\u2019s parliamentary election, according to official results, a victory that assures Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed a second five-year term in office.\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter on Saturday, Abiy hailed the June 21 vote as a historically inclusive election.\n\n\u201cOur party is also happy that it has been chosen by the will of the people to administer the country,\u201d he added.\n\nThe election marked the first time Abiy faced voters since he was appointed prime minister in 2018 following several years of anti-government protests.\n\nBut an opposition boycott, war in the northern region of Tigray, ethnic violence and logistical challenges in some areas overshadowed the poll.\n\nVoting did not take place at all in three of Ethiopia\u2019s 10 regions.\n\nAbiy\u2019s Prosperity Party won 410 seats in the federal parliament out of 436 where elections were held, according to results issued by the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE), which said there would be a rerun in 10 constituencies.\n\nThe leader of the main opposition Ethiopian Citizens for Social Justice party, Birhanu Nega, lost while the opposition parties Ezema and the National Movement of Amhara (NAMA) each won less than 10 seats.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Catherine Soi, reporting from the Ethiopian capital, said the Prosperity Party\u2019s win came as \u201cno surprise\u201d.\n\n\u201cAbiy\u2019s Prosperity Party has been leading from the very start,\u201d she said from Addis Ababa. \u201cBut some analysts we\u2019ve been talking to say they are very worried now that parliament is dominated by the prime minister\u2019s party.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard for the parliament members to properly hold the prime minister and his government to account, to ask the tough questions. They are saying what we might see going forward is more opposition from outside parliament.\u201d\n\nThe election was the first test of voter support for Abiy, who promised political and economic reforms when he was appointed prime minister by the governing coalition in 2018.\n\nWithin months of taking office, Abiy lifted a ban on opposition parties, released tens of thousands of political prisoners and took steps to open up the Ethiopian economy.\n\nHe now faces international pressure over the war in Tigray and accusations from rights groups that his government is rolling back some new freedoms, which it denies.\n\nJune\u2019s election, which had been postponed twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic and logistical issues, was largely peaceful, but the United States has called the vote \u201csignificantly flawed\u201d, citing the detention of some opposition figures and insecurity in parts of the country.\n\nIn Abiy\u2019s native Oromia region, Ethiopia\u2019s largest, two of the most prominent opposition parties \u2013 the Oromo Federalist Congress and the Oromo Liberation Front \u2013 pulled out entirely, saying their candidates had been arrested and offices vandalised.\n\nThat meant the ruling party ran alone in several dozen constituencies.\n\nIn the wake of the election, the Ethiopian Citizens for Social Justice party filed 207 complaints with the electoral body over the vote.\n\nVoting in the Harar and Somali regions has meanwhile been delayed until September over security concerns and problems with ballot papers.\n\nNo date has been set for voting in Tigray, where the military has been battling forces loyal to the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), the region\u2019s former ruling party, since November.\n\nThe fighting has displaced two million people, and the United Nations has warned of famine conditions in parts of the region.\n\nBirtukan Mideksa, the head of the electoral board, said the vote was held at a time when Ethiopia was experiencing challenges, \u201cbut this voting process has guaranteed that people will be governed through their votes\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want to confirm that we have managed to conduct a credible election,\u201d she added.\n\nVoter turnout was just more than 90 percent among the more than 37 million people who had been registered to vote.\n\nThe Prosperity Party was formed after the dismantling of Ethiopia\u2019s former ruling coalition, which had been dominated by Tigray politicians.\n\nDisagreements over that decision signalled the first tensions between Abiy and Tigray leaders that eventually led to the conflict in the region in November.\n\nThough Abiy hinted in 2018 that Ethiopia will limit a prime minister\u2019s terms to two, it is not clear whether he will act on that.\n\nTegbaru Yared, a researcher with the Institute for Security Studies, wrote this week that there remained \u201cdeep political cleavages\u201d in Ethiopia.\n\nThe Prosperity Party \u201cshould focus on stabilising the country, stopping intercommunal conflicts, managing inflation, engaging the opposition and initiating an all-inclusive national dialogue,\u201d Tegbaru wrote. \u201cThis could earn it popular legitimacy.\u201d",
