It said the incident was being investigated to determine its factuality, and warned against any hasty reaction by the public to a viral cruel video of the said killings being circulated on social media.\n\nOwing to the worsening security situation in the state, the governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo, yesterday, placed eight local government areas under curfew.\n\nAs the spate of killings and violent criminal activities continued in different parts of the country, Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, yesterday, confirmed that Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters killed 32 persons during an attack on a village in the troubled state.\n\nSimilarly, yesterday, suspected terrorists attacked St. Patrick\u2019s Catholic Church in Gidan Maikambu, Marabar Kanya, Kafur Local Government Area of Katsina State, and kidnapped Reverend Father Stephen Ojapa and Reverend Oliver Okpara.\n\nThe police in Katsina State also confirmed that the marauding terrorists kidnapped one Reverend Ibrahim Garba of Evangelical Church Wining All (ECWA) at Gidan Garba, in Kafur Local Government Area, where the state governor, Alhaji Aminu Masari, hails from, last Monday, \u201cand the clergyman is still in captivity\u201d.\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) was suspected to have killed the woman, her four children, and six other northerners in Anambra State on Sunday. This occurred few days after a member of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Dr. Okechukwu Okoye, was beheaded, as allegations mounted about murders by IPOB.\n\nThe presidency, in the statement issued yesterday by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, warned the perpetrators of the dastardly acts to expect appropriate response from the military and the security agencies. It also cautioned against any knee-jerk reactions, the creation of panic, disruption of lives and livelihoods, or even retaliatory violence following the viral videos of the alleged killings of non-indigenes by the Eastern Security Network (ESN) and its mother group, IPOB.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWhile expert agencies are now verifying the factuality and veracity of the claims that accompany the horrid pictures being circulated, we call on all citizens to avoid hasty steps or conclusions that could exacerbate the situation, and, on the contrary, keep to a line of conduct that will help the law to take its proper course.\n\n\u201cThe presidency also cautions the public against the indiscriminate sharing of posts on social media so as to deny vested interests, who seek to divide us and create disturbance, the chance to do so.\n\n\u201cIn the issuance of his very strong condemnation of these \u2018wild, barbarous and wanton killings of innocent people\u2019 in the South-east as well as the other parts of the country, which he described as \u2018deeply distressing,\u2019 President Muhammadu Buhari warns the perpetrators of these acts to expect tough response from the security forces.\u201d\n\nBuhari, who also reacted to the killings in Borno and his own home state of Katsina, said Nigerians must unite to fight terrorism in all forms. He said the country was in a mourning mood over the \u201csenseless loss of lives seen in Borno State and Katsina State over the last 48 hours\u201d.\n\nIn a release Wednesday by Shehu, Buhari assured that the perpetrators of the killings would be brought to justice. The president disclosed that 56,000 Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists had surrendered to the authorities in one year.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat these terrorists and bandits have been reduced to scavenging from our artisanal miners and farmers for survival is evidence that they are backed into a corner.\n\n\u201cThis will be small comfort to the family members and loved ones of those murdered this week. But it is in times like these that we must be at our strongest.\n\n\u201cNow, more than ever, Nigerians must come together, in proud defiance of those who would seek, through terror and violence, to divide us along religious, political or ethnic lines.\n\n\u201cAnd so while we are in mourning for those we have lost, let us face these cowards already fading in strength, number and willpower as one.\n\n\u201cLet us show them that Nigerians will not be swayed by terror. Let us show them that Nigerians will not be divided. Let us show them we will not be defeated.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Osinbajo, in a statement by his media assistant, Laolu Akande, said the killing of the woman and her children was callous, brutal and demeaning, and capable of creating ethnic conflict across the country. He said the cruel act must be condemned by all.\n\nAccording to the vice president, \u201cWhat took place in Anambra with the killing of a woman and her children demeans us all. It is such a callous act and so brutal. And I think that we must be very careful, as a people, with this type of killings that are going on, especially where it is obviously to create horror, annoyance and create a situation where we begin to have ethnic conflicts again, and all that.\n\n\u201cAnd I think we must all be careful and condemn it in the strongest possible terms, there is no excuse for it whatsoever. We must not allow a situation where we get to the point where we even countenance individuals who can do this sort of thing.\n\n\u201cHow does anyone kill a woman and her children? I think it is such a terrible tragedy condemnable by all. Mr President has spoken about it and I just want to join my voice with those of others who are completely outraged by it.\u201d\n\nSoludo Declares Curfew in Eight LGAs of Anambra\n\nSoludo declared curfew in eight local government areas of the state due to the heightening insecurity. The former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), in a statewide broadcast, yesterday, enjoined the people of the state to join hands with his administration to achieve his dream of making Anambra a prosperous homeland.\n\nWith regard to the criminal gangs, Soludo said, \u201cThe tiny but vicious gangs that have invaded our state and (are) terrorising us are mostly in eight local governments in Anambra and three neighbouring local governments in Imo State.\n\n\u201cThey are in our forests, communities, and houses owned by individuals. They don\u2019t come from the air, and, hence, are not \u2018unknown\u2019 gunmen. They are known. You know them, but are either too scared to speak up or out of indifference. But for how long will you be silent while our people continue to be killed in cruel and barbaric manner?\n\n\u201cThe security agencies will continue to do their part, but we, the people, must proclaim that \u2018Enough is Enough\u2019 and demonstrate full ownership.\u201d\n\nAs part of efforts to curb the menace, Soludo unveiled more phone numbers to be used by residents of the state to report suspected cases of crime.\n\nHe added, \u201cWith effect from tomorrow, Thursday, 26th May, 2022, a 6pm to 6am curfew is hereby placed on motorcycles (okada), tricycles (keke), and shuttle buses in Aguata, Ihiala, Ekwusigo, Nnewi North, Nnewi South, Ogbaru, Orumba North, and Orumba South local governments until further notice.\n\n\u201cUntil further notice also, motorcycles, keke and shuttle buses are banned from operating in these local governments on Mondays until the sit-at-home completely stops. The youths of every community in the zone are hereby enjoined to assist the security agencies in the implementation of this policy and are mandated to seize any such motorcycle or tricycle on the spot.\n\n\u201cLocal vigilantes should report such motorcycles or tricycles (keke) immediately, and they will be confiscated by government and the owner prosecuted. The okada, keke, and shuttle bus union leaders must take responsibility to report their members who are involved in criminal activities.\n\n\u201cWe shall review this after two weeks, and if members of these unions continue to be involved in criminal activities, the government will have no choice but to either disband the unions and/or ban them out rightly in the state.\u201d\n\nThe governor said no part of Anambra State would be used as camps for criminals, adding that anyone with a gun would be considered a criminal in Anambra State, and the government and people would work with security agencies to flush them out.\n\nHe added that the state government would revoke the occupancy and acquire any land found to be used in harbouring criminals, saying every community is required to provide information on any part of their land occupied by criminals as camps. He said if the community failed to do so, the government would take over such land. The same applies to buildings that harbour kidnappers and murderers, the governor stated.\n\nSoludo added that while hotels were to find a way to get the identities of lodgers seeking their accommodation, filling stations were to install CCTV cameras, and keep their recordings, which would be produced once demanded by the security agencies during crime investigations.\n\nCAN Condemns Anambra Killings\n\nCAN condemned the gruesome murder of Lady Fatima and her four innocent children. While demanding justice for the victims, the association urged security agencies to fish out those responsible for the wicked act in order to stop the senseless killings in the country.\n\nA statement signed by Special Assistant to CAN President, Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, said the criminality was totally unacceptable, unjustifiable, and reprehensible to CAN and all right thinking people.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWe call on the security operatives to wake up to their responsibilities. The criminals are now operating with impunity while those who are expected to stop or apprehend them appear powerless.\n\n\u201cThis cannot be the dream country of those who fought for her independence from the colonial masters.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening and unfortunate that nowhere is safe again in the country, as killers, bandits, terrorists, and kidnappers are on rampage in every nook and cranny of the country and all the government is able to do is to issue periodic statements condemning them without any decisive action to bring culprits to book.\u201d\n\nCAN charged the leadership of IPOB to stop the criminalities in the pretext of fighting for freedom. It stated, \u201cAre they fighting for a country for the dead or the living? They should know that their criminalities are not helping the case of their leader, Nnamdi Kanu. They should not turn the South-east to a \u2018No Man\u2019s Land\u2019 in the interest of the founding fathers of this country, who hailed from the zone.\n\n\u201cTheir actions are not only giving Ndigbo bad name but they are creating an atmosphere for ethno-religious wars. Will a reasonable group be committing crimes like this?\n\n\u201cWe call on the political elite, religious leaders, and the traditional rulers of Ndigbo extraction to prevail on the violent groups in the eastern part of the country to stop needless bloodshed and tension they are causing for economic prosperity and wellbeing of the region.\n\n\u201cCAN commiserates with all the bereaved of the senseless killings, especially the immediate family of Lady Fatima and the recently murdered member of Anambra State House of Assembly, Okechukwu Okoye. May God console and comfort them as He pours healing balm on their wounds, in Jesus name.\u201d\n\nNEF: IPOB Targeted Killings May Trigger National, Inter-communal Crisis\n\nNEF alleged that targeted killings by IPOB were intended to inflame passions and trigger national or inter-communal crises.\n\nDirector, Publicity and Advocacy of the forum, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a statement yesterday, lamented that in the last few weeks, gruesome killings of people in states of the South-east had escalated to a point which suggested that some factions of IPOB/ESN were now operating with unfettered freedom to wrought mayhem.\n\nThe forum noted that there had never been a better time than now for the leadership of Ndigbo, in particular, and other leaders to unite in openly condemning these atrocities.\n\nNEF stated, \u201cIn addition to killings of soldiers, policemen, public servants, and other citizens, these killers are now embarking on targeted killings clearly intended to inflame passions and trigger national or inter-communal crises.\n\n\u201cShocking images of murder of northerners, including children, are being deliberately circulated by the very people who murder them, to provoke widespread anger.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cThis forum condemns this barbarism in the strongest terms available, and demands that those who have responsibility to bring these outrageous provocations to an end, must do so.\u201d\n\nThe forum stressed that there was no acceptable excuse for murder, saying those who have both responsibility and capacity must step up and protect local citizenry, including northerners. The forum also called on northern leaders and elders to raise their voices against what it stressed was targeted atrocities, and take responsible steps to calm nerves.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe forum advises against any temptation to resort to violence under the impression that revenge is a solution to the targeting of particular groups. Northerners in the South-east should take all lawful steps to remain safe.\n\n\u201cThe forum invites the attention of President Muhammadu Buhari and leaders in the South-east to note that there are dark forces at play to destroy the country under their watch.\n\n\u201cHistory and circumstances have placed them in the position to exercise leadership to stop the current slide to irretrievable disaster. They do not have the luxury of indifference or inaction.\u201d\n\nZulum Confirms 32 Persons Killed by Boko Haram in Kala-Balge\n\nZulum confirmed that 32 persons were killed by Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters in an attack on a village in the state. A statement by his spokesman, Mallam Isa Gusau, yesterday, said the 32 persons were killed last weekend by Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters around Mudu village, some 45 kilometres away from Rann, headquarters of Kala-Balge Local Government Area of the state.\n\nGusau, while confirming the number of deaths in an update released to journalists in Maiduguri, also disclosed that six persons were injured while two escaped the attack unhurt.\n\nGusau stated, \u201cGovernor Babagana Umara Zulum is very disturbed by the unfortunate killing of fellow citizens at the weekend.\n\n\u201cPending a full report, the governor was briefed by the Majority Leader of Borno State House of Assembly, Mohammed Dige, who represents Kala-Balge where the victims hailed from.\n\n\u201cFrom the lawmaker\u2019s briefing, a total of 32 youths are believed to have been killed by the insurgents. The youths were not farmers but highly enterprising young men engaged in gathering metals, popularly called \u2018Kayan Ajaokuta\u2019, which are sold as raw materials for steel production.\n\n\u201cThe victims were said to have gone to a deserted Mudu village, 45 kilometres away from Dikwa, in search of the raw materials. In the process, they were unfortunately ambushed by the insurgents. Six persons were injured during the ambush while two escaped unhurt.\u201d\n\nGusau further said, \u201cA team of soldiers, alongside the Chairman of Kala-Balge LGA, on Tuesday, recovered 14 bodies of victims who were apparently tied and shot at close range.\n\n\u201cGovernor Zulum shares deeply the pains of bereaved families and the good people of Kala-Balge and is awaiting full report by the end of today before necessary measures.\u201d\n\nTerrorists Attack Masari\u2019s Council, Abduct Two Catholic Priests, ECWA Pastor, Others\n\nSuspected terrorists attacked St. Patrick\u2019s Catholic Church in Gidan Maikambu, Marabar Kanya, Kafur Local Government Area of Katsina State and kidnapped Reverend Father Stephen Ojapa and Reverend Oliver Okpara. The hoodlums, who invaded the Catholic pastorium in the wee hours of Wednesday, also abducted the priests\u2019 two assistants after shooting sporadically to scare the victims who were said to be observing their mid-week prayers.\n\nConfirming the incident to THISDAY yesterday, the secretary of the state chapter of CAN, Dr. Musa Danladi Danmalan, said the suspected terrorists invaded the parish in large number, riding on motorcycles.\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Gambo Isah, also confirmed the abduction of the clergymen, saying the Commissioner of Police, Idris Dabban, has given a matching order to his men to rescue the captives unhurt.\n\nKafur had enjoyed relative peace, but recently, terrorist activities seem to be surfacing in the area.\n\nDanmalan added that the marauding terrorists also kidnapped one Reverend Ibrahim Garba of ECWA at Gidan Garba, in Kafur Local Government Area last Monday \u201cand the clergyman is still in captivity\u201d.\n\nDanmalan stated, \u201cLast week, Monday, one Reverend Ibrahim Garba of ECWA, Gidan Garba in Kafur Local Government Area was kidnapped alongside two of his members at the pastorium in the night.\n\n\u201cEarly this (Tuesday) morning, Reverend Father Stephen Ojapa and Reverend Oliver Okpara of St. Patrick\u2019s Catholic Church Gidan Maikambu, Marabar Kanya, Kafur Local Government Area of Katsina State, were also kidnapped by the bandits.\n\n\u201cAnd a day before yesterday, one Suleiman Ibrahim of Gidan Kanawa village of Kankara local government was also kidnapped. He is still with the bandits, and they are yet to contact the church or the family.\u201d\n\nDanmalan noted that the abductors of the clergymen were yet to contact their family members, adding, however, that security personnel were working to secure their freedom.\n\nHe reiterated that the terrorists had of recent abducted the pastor of Anglican Church in Kadanyar Baushi, Bakori Local Government Area of the state, Venerable Yohanna, but he was released after the payment of an undisclosed ransom.\n\nHe, therefore, called on Christians in the state to be vigilant and report any suspicious movement of persons or activities to the security agencies and pray vehemently for the abductees to regain freedom.\n\nOwing to the killings in Borno State, President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, yesterday, put off all his political engagements to mourn the farmers killed by terrorists in the state.\n\nLawan had already scheduled some engagements for Wednesday, one of which was to meet with leaders and delegates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Borno State.\n\nHe was also scheduled to go to Gombe to meet party leaders and, particularly, the delegates to canvas support for his presidential bid ahead of the upcoming primaries of APC.\n\nLawan decided to put off all his political engagements for the day on account of the tragic incidents and proceeded to Maiduguri on a condolence visit.\n\nAFBA Expresses Concern Over Killings in Nigeria, Others\n\nWorried by the rise in human rights abuses by government forces in various parts of Africa, the African Bar Association (AFBA) is to organise a training workshop for military lawyers, senior military officers, and other security agencies on legal boundaries of counter-terrorism. President of the association, Hannibal Uwaifo, disclosed this yesterday in Lagos, at a media briefing on insecurity in Africa and its effects on civil liberty.\n\nUwaifo, who is also President, South-east, South-south Professionals of Nigeria (SESSPN), expressed shock at the rate of anarchy being unleashed in the eastern part of Nigeria by armed criminal gangs.\n\nHe said, \u201cWith deep sadness, shock and awe, the SESSPN has continued to watch the unfolding anarchy being unleashed in the eastern part of Nigeria by armed criminal gangs seeking to achieve what no right thinking mind can decipher.\n\n\u201cThe terrible nature of these crimes in outright killings and beheading of innocent people predominantly of the South-east is not only unfortunate but calls for deep resignation.\n\n\u201cAs if arson, kidnapping, rape and molestation of innocent citizens were not enough, these angels of darkness and despair have continued to carry on unchecked and have become a law unto themselves such that the eastern part of Nigeria has become very famous for bad news and serious criminality.\u201d\n\nUwaifo stated that Nnamdi Kanu, who is presently standing trial, brought terror to his people rather than peace and progress, which they deserved.\n\nHe added, \u201cIf, however, the gentleman never intended this, the authorities holding him must grant him the permission to make a public statement condemning this carnage and dissociating the proscribed IPOB from these heinous crimes.\n\n\u201cHe can do this by recorded broadcast on the electronic media and he can order a stop to all these atrocities just as he ordered the activities of IPOB. This is the only way to clear his name in the face of history in the making.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further on the workshop, Uwaifo said it would deal essentially with building operational capacities for military lawyers and senior military officers who hold command and administrative positions.\n\nThe workshop, which is in collaboration with Defence Headquarters, would hold on June 8 to 10, 2022, at the Nigerian Air Force Conference Centre, Abuja.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Adamu: No Decision on Zoning Till After Screening APC Presidential Hopefuls",
          "text": "\u2022Says aspirants will be scrutinised according to party\u2019s guidelines\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\n\n\nThe National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdulahi Adamu, yesterday, said that the ruling party would take decision on zoning after all the presidential aspirants had been screened.\n\nIn an interview with select Hausa Service media organisations, Adamu also said the presidential aspirants would be scrutinised in accordance with the party\u2019s guidelines for the 2023 elections\n\nThe guidelines of the party provides three ways of choosing the party\u2019s candidate for an election, which include direct, indirect and consensus.\n\nBaring his mind on the zoning arrangement, Adamu said no decision would be taken until the aspirants were screened.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe have not produced our candidate for the presidency yet. We have to screen the aspirants to know the way forward. We have aspirants from across the country in the race. We will take the decision when we get there.\u201d\n\nOn likely consensus arrangement, Adamu noted that party members could not be denied the right to contest for president.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop our party stalwart from contesting elections or aspiring for the presidency. It is their right and we are happy for them. There is nothing wrong for anybody aspiring for the exalted seat of the presidency. It is God that decides who gets what. Once God makes up His mind and says this is who He wants, that is what we are praying for.\n\n\u201cWe have 28 aspirants for the presidential ticket and everybody knows that all of them cannot get the ticket. If it\u2019s God\u2019s wish, they all can even be president of the country one after the other. Our goal is to ensure justice in the choice of who emerges as the candidate of the party. That does not mean we are perfect. But we pray we do the right thing,\u201d he stated.\n\nAsked if the party was considering adopting the type of consensus arrangement that produced him as the chairman of the party, Adamu said the chairmanship position was not the same as the position of the president.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere is no truth in what you said. Reason is that the chairmanship seat is not the same as that of the tussle for the presidency of the country. You can\u2019t even compare the two of them. That question does not arise.\n\n\u201cHowever, the party has laid down its rules and regulations for the aspirants. We would scrutinize all of them based on our guidelines to be sure we pick the right candidate for the party.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if having such a high number of aspirants was not a subtle ploy to extend President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tenure, Adamu said such insinuation was also not true, because the president sought no extension of tenure.\n\nHe said, \u201cI can only say God will deal with those behind such insinuations. President Buhari had since 2019 declared that he would not seek tenure extension. He told everybody and swore with the Qur\u2019an that he would not breach constitutional provision on his two terms tenure.\n\n\u201cThe issue does not even arise. The president while performing the lesser hajj reiterated this position. If there is truth in such talks, none of the aspirants would have procured expression of interest form.\u201d\n\nOn the allegations that aspirants were sharing money to delegates, Adamu said he had no evidence to that effect.\n\n\u201cFor now, no law is against aspirants talking campaign to delegates. I don\u2019t have evidence that aspirants are sharing money to delegates. For me, it\u2019s the delegates that are selling their conscience, which is not proper. Our delegates should know that anybody sharing money to them can\u2019t be the right candidate for the party. He doesn\u2019t mean well for the country. I don\u2019t have a solution for the problem.\u201d\n\nWith 145 governorship aspirants and 25 presidential aspirants, Adamu noted that the reason was because APC was the government in power and those that matter in the country were in the party.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know the reason, it\u2019s because that is where those that matter in the country are. It didn\u2019t start today. We are the government in power today. In spite of all the insults, the APC has the advantages far ahead of the other parties. A sign of a powerful man is the one that is full blooded and fat.\n\n\u201cToday, the APC is the biggest party in Nigeria. It\u2019s natural that the APC will attract more Nigerians than any other party. This is where it is happening. Any right thinking politician would naturally gravitate towards the APC. Of course, we have our problems, but today we are the cynosure of all Nigerians and I am hopeful, God-willing, we will retain power at the general election.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Citing Inflationary Concerns, CBN Raises MPR to 13%, First Increase in 30 Months",
          "text": "\u2022Says action aimed at supporting economic growth, price stability\n\nJames Emejo and Nume Ekeghe in Abuja\n\n\n\nAfter holding the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) constant at 11.5 per cent for about two and a half years, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), yesterday, raised the benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 13 per cent in response to global inflationary pressures, which had continued to hurt economies around the world.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the apex bank lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of funds in the economy.\n\nThe MPC, however, left other monetary policy parameters, including the apex bank\u2019s Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) and the Liquidity Ratio (LR), unchanged at 27.5 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively.\n\nAddressing journalists at the end of a two-day meeting of the MPC, CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, admitted that the hike in MPR would increase cost of borrowing, especially in non-priority sectors of the economy.\n\nEmefiele, however added that lending to key priority sectors, which had been identified to boost growth and generate employment, would remain at single-digit interest rate of nine per cent.\n\nThe central bank governor pointed out that the decision to raise interest rate was the last resort and a difficult one for the MPC, which had been crafting policies to stimulate economic growth as well as achieve financial stability. He said the CBN had adopted a contractionary monetary policy stance in view of the aggressive rise in inflation in recent times, which had led to high food and commodity prices in the country.\n\nEmefiele noted that CBN\u2019s action was aimed at curbing inflation, on the one hand, and supporting growth of the economy, on the other. He said the MPC was in a dilemma in arriving at a decision to raise the lending rate. As a result, the apex bank governor explained, a drastic measure such as raising the benchmark lending rate was required to reduce monetary expansion in order to tame inflation.\n\nHe assured that though inflation was expected to maintain an aggressive acceleration in the coming months, the central bank would not hesitate to return to its accommodative stance whenever it saw a reduction in the headline index.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cThe concerns about the global rise in inflation and price levels; you all would have seen that the price of crude quite unexpectedly has been above $100 per barrel. In fact, Nigeria\u2019s Bonny light yesterday, when we started the meeting, was about $116 per barrel.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that the standard pricing indicator; yes, whereas crude prices have gone up per barrel, at the same time the cost of refining and ultimate pump price at the station would naturally have gone up.\n\n\u201cThis is a global phenomenon and I was watching the CNN a few days ago and one of the analysts was talking about an incredible distortion to financial markets in the United States, and I said, yes, we are all welcome to a situation where inflation is rising to unprecedented levels in the US and other economies, growth is also coming down.\n\n\u201cAnd if you must tackle inflation, prices, and at the same time you want growth, then you know that you are faced with some compelling dilemma as to what to do.\n\n\u201cYou like to see inflation come down but at the same time you want growth to go up. But to achieve that, you have to take two decisions that are in opposite directions and that brings to bear what type of skills you have put in place to ensure you are able to manage these two in a way that you maintain a balance when you see a moderation in inflation and at the same time you grow your economy.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cFor us in Nigeria, you would have observed that in the last two and a half years, what we have been doing is that we want to pursue a policy of price stability that is conducive to growth and that\u2019s why somehow we have used our development finance intervention facilities, we have actually yielded positive results and helped to drive growth in our economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used that to drive growth while at the same time we try as much as possible to maintain a hold position while looking at the optimum level of liquidity in the industry to be able to moderate inflation at a level that does not hurt the growth and economy of our country.\n\n\u201cBut with what we have seen globally either in the areas of the supply chain, increases in prices of petroleum products, and the rest of them, we have seen aggressive growth in inflation in Nigeria between March and April of 2022.\n\n\u201cAnd the forecast from our statisticians, including the NBS and CBN as well as our colleagues in research and monetary policy, is that unless something drastic or significant actions are taken, it will be difficult for us to really rein in inflation if we don\u2019t do something immediately.\n\n\u201cThis decision has been taken because we felt that there may continue in the next couple of months to be an aggressive acceleration in inflation and we think there is a need to take some drastic actions to reverse it.\n\n\u201cIf we are able to see a reversal, perhaps, we can say we are returning to what we can call the normal period, when we are looking at using CRR to moderate inflation and at the same time using our development finance to really push for growth.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said the broad outlook for both the global and domestic economies in the medium-term remained clouded with uncertainties arising from the lingering war between Russia and Ukraine, the unfolding impact of the extensive sanctions imposed by several countries on Russia, and the downside risks from the continued spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe added that global growth was confronted with significant headwinds, which might derail the current projection further, adding that the continuing rise in inflation is also set to undermine the recovery of output growth due to the associated build-up of uncertainties around the cost of inventory and other production inputs.\n\nThe CBN governor said the rise in global debt was also an unfolding dilemma, which policymakers must carefully evaluate and address to avert a near-term global financial crisis.\n\nIn summary, he said, while global aggregate demand remained strong and growing, the numerous supply-side constraints would continue to undermine the recovery effort, at least in the short to medium term.\n\nIn the domestic economy, the CBN governor noted that data on key macroeconomic variables indicated that the recovery of output growth will continue, probably at a more subdued pace, considering the unfolding domestic and external shocks to the economy.\n\nHe said domestic price development was, however, expected to maintain an upward pressure in light of the build-up of spending related to the 2023 general election.\n\nThe MPC noted the risks confronting the global economy involved not only inflation and prices, but also included risks associated with weakening growth prospects across the world.\n\nThe committee observed that whereas post-pandemic policy support remained broadly expansionary, at least, from a fiscal standpoint, the sharp rise in inflation across both the advanced and emerging markets economies had generated growing concern among central banks, as the progressive rise in inflation, driven by rising aggregate demand and wage growth, was putting unsustainable upward pressure on price levels.\n\nConsequently, Emefiele said, major central banks, such as the US Fed, Bank of England, European Central Bank, and Bank of Canada, had provided strong guidance for a progressive shift away from monetary policy accommodation to drive market interest rate upward, which may ultimately impact capital flow away from Emerging Market Economies.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn another hand, MPC noted that the war between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in significant disruption of the global supply chain, at a time when the global economy is still confronted with downside risks to growth associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to this, global trade has been impacted by the series of restrictions imposed by NATO countries and its allies against trade with Russia.\n\n\u201cThis has increasingly fragmented the global economy, imposing huge strains on the tepid post-pandemic recovery. Only recently, China, the USA, and South Africa are seeing a renewed spike in COVID-19 infections.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the Chinese government recently re-introduced lockdown in major industrial cities, to forestall the spread of the pandemic, further disrupting the supply chain crisis. In the view of the MPC, these two risks pose great challenges to rising inflation globally.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, the CBN governor said on the decision on whether to hold, tighten or loosen, the MPC felt that loosening in the face of the rising policy rates in advanced economies might result in a sharp rise in capital outflow and faster dry-up of foreign credit lines.\n\nEmefiele stated, \u201cMPC also feels that loosening could lead to further liquidity surfeit and inflationary pressure. So as to whether to hold, MPC feels its stance would strengthen the perception that the CBN has abandoned its primary mandate of taming inflation.\n\n\u201cOn the need to tighten, MPC feels that tightening would help moderate the inflationary trade-off from the steady growth recovery so far. MPC also feels that tightening would help rein in inflation before it assumes a galloping trend, considering the progressive increase in headline inflation (m-o-m), particularly with the sharp 90 basis point increase in April 2022.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cFurthermore, MPC feels that tightening would narrow the negative real interest rate margin, improve market sentiment, and restore investor confidence.\n\n\u201cEqually, members believe tightening would moderate inflationary pressure pass-through to exchange rate depreciation and moderate the speed of capital flow reversal, provide incentives for foreign capital inflows, and sustain remittances.\n\n\u201cLastly, tightening could moderate government domestic borrowing, as government debt servicing to revenue ratio increased significantly in recent times, threatening debt sustainability.\u201d\n\nHe said MPC members expressed deep concern about the continued uptrend of inflationary pressure, despite the gradual improvement in output growth.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cThe committee noted that the current rise in inflation may be inimical to growth and, thus, hinder the full recovery of the economy. While the MPC identified several supply-side factors, which may be contributing to inflationary pressure, emerging evidence shows that money demand pressure is on the rise and is unlikely to abate until the 2023 general elections are concluded.\n\n\u201cThe dilemma confronting the committee at this meeting, therefore, is how best to drive down domestic prices while continuing to support the fragile recovery.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAfter carefully reviewing the developments of the last two months and the outlook for both the domestic and global economies, as well as the benefits and downsides of each policy option, the committee decided to raise the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to rein in the current rise in inflation, as members were of the view that the continued uptrend would adversely affect growth.\u201d\n\nAnalysts React to MPR Hike\n\nCommenting on the MPR adjustment by the CBN, Investment Analyst, Ayodeji Ebo, noted that the rate hike came as a surprise considering the magnitude and a major drift from the previous stance of the CBN. According to him, raising MPR will not necessarily translate to increased foreign portfolio investments due to the foreign exchange challenges.\n\nEbo told THISDAY, \u201cThis will lead to the high cost of borrowing for firms and the government. As a result, lead to a higher cost of production and a higher inflation rate. This will make the stock market less attractive, leading to a downtrend. Also, the fixed income market will be bearish in the interim, as traders try to minimise losses on their portfolios.\u201d\n\nFounder and Chief Executive of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), an economic and business advocacy think tank, Dr. Muda Yusuf, explained that while the hike in MPR by 150 basis points to 13 per cent by the MPC was understandable, \u201cwhether this would significantly impact on the inflation is a different matter.\u201d\n\nYusuf said, \u201cAlready, bank lending has been constrained by the high CRR (many operators in the sector claim that effective CRR is as high as 50 per cent or more for many banks), the discretionary debits by the apex bank, the 65 per cent Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) and liquidity ratio of 30 per cent. The lending situation in the economy is already very tight.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy is not a credit-driven economy, unlike what obtains in many advanced economies, which have much higher levels of financial inclusion, robust consumer credit framework and strong correlation between interest rate and aggregate demand.\n\n\u201cThe level of financial inclusion in the Nigerian economy is still quite low, access to credit by households and MSMEs is still very challenging, and the informal sector accounts for close to 50 per cent of the economy.\u201d\n\nYusuf added, \u201cThe transmission effects of monetary policy on the economy are, therefore, still very weak. In the Nigerian context, price levels are not interest-sensitive. Supply-side issues are much more profound drivers of inflation. What the recent rate hike means for the economy is that the cost of credit to the few beneficiaries of the bank credits will increase, which will impact their operating costs, prices of their products and profit margins. Investors in the fixed income instruments may also benefit from the hike. There would be some adverse effects on the equities market.\u201d\n\nHead, Financial Institutions Ratings at Agusto & Co, Mr. Ayokunle Olubunmi, said the hike was not surprising, considering the rising inflation as well as the tilting of members of the MPC in favour of a hike in rates in previous meetings.\n\nAccording to Olubunmi, \u201cIf you have been following the communiqu\u00e9 of individual members, you would notice that gradually over the last couple of months, most members have moved from maintaining to an increase. At the last meeting, it was just a narrow decision for them to maintain it.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising and if looked at in the context of what is happening globally, interest rates are rising and one of the major ways the CBN can actually make Nigeria look a bit more competitive is for them to raise rates.\n\n\u201cGlobally, inflation rate is also increasing and in Nigeria, while there are other factors that contribute to rising inflation, one of the ways of combating that is to also raise rates.\n\n\u201cAlso, with electioneering, there would be a significant increase in money in circulation and one of the ways to try reduce the effect of that transmitting to higher inflation is to actually raise rates.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says power shift against democratic principles, zoning a lazy argument\n\n\u2022Declares \u2018I\u2019m going in to win, my message has resonated well\u2019\n\n\u2022Reveals Abiola invested almost 25 years of goodwill across the country\n\n\u2022Believes anyone who wants to be president should work hard, build alliances\n\nObinna Chima, Goddy Egene and Peter Uzoho\n\n\n\nFormer Managing Director of FSB International Bank Plc., and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential hopeful, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, has said if the main opposition party is able to get its act together in terms of organisation and envisaging the antics of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), PDP would win the 2023 general election.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to THISDAY in a presidential interview series, Hayatu-Deen, punctured arguments in favour of zoning or power shift. He said it was unreasonable for the country to be bogged down by power shift clamour and debate, stressing that the argument for zoning is not only lazy but also against democratic principles.\n\nHe said if he had been asked the question on zoning some weeks back, he would have loved to spend some quality time on the subject. But PDP had already deferred to wisdom by throwing its presidential ticket open, he stated.\n\nAnalysing the chances of PDP in next year\u2019s general election, Hayatu-Deen, who explained the rationale behind the proposed consensus northern candidate and why it failed, said, \u201cLet me say that the reason for putting in place that framework for producing a consensus candidate from the northern part of the country was informed by two or three reasons.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, the field was getting large both in the north and in the south to the point where it would become difficult to manage at the convention.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the election of 2023 is PDP\u2019s to lose and if caution is not exercised, APC may actually snatch victory from the jaws of defeat if we have an acrimonious convention.\n\n\u201cThirdly was that the consensus arrangement was actually going to happen in stages. That the north should reduce the field to one person or maximum of two and, second, that this particular message should actually also be taken to the southern part of the country. At the time, we knew more people were going to come out, but only Pius Anyim had come out as at the time.\n\n\u201cLo and behold, after a few weeks, there were far more contestants in the southern part of the country than the north. So, we now started going to various parts of the country, preaching to the governors of the PDP to do other things in their powers to actually shrink the field in the south so that when we go to the convention, we\u2019ll have few people to narrow this process.\n\n\u201cTo answer your question, the consensus arrangement in the north fell apart simply because the candidates felt that the basis for it existed no more and, therefore, it was better for each person to actually run their own independent campaign. In so doing, taking cognisance of two things: that we would be able to establish very good relationships among ourselves.\n\n\u201cAlso, it provided a teaching moment as we go to the convention to begin to put together some kind of framework even before the convention as to how these things will coalesce and still have a very successful convention and produce a candidate. So, those were the reasons.\u201d\n\nDismissing the idea of zoning, Hayatu-Deen stated, \u201cThis issue has been up in the air and travelling at just 1000 miles per hour, it\u2019s now an open and shut case that has gone to the highest policymaking body of the party and they decided to open it up for all. Let me tell you this, first, in 1999, beginning from preparations in 1998, this is now almost 23 to 24 years, there was a major event that took place during MKO Abiola\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cFollowed by a lot of commotion from many places, leading up to 1998, it was decided by the party bigwigs that given what had happened, it was important for us to stabilise this country, to hand over power to somebody from the South-west to compensate the denial of Abiola\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cThere was no constitutional provision, there was no referendum taken among the south, and this is how the world works. It was an open contest. People like Abubakar Rimi, Philip Asiodu, and others ran to me and contested about that. That was a private arrangement that was done. So, we were able to organise to shift the votes to Obasanjo. Secondly, it\u2019s now almost a generation and after 23 years, we are still bogged down with power shift. I think it\u2019s unreasonable.\n\n\u201cThirdly, it goes against the principles of democracy as far as I\u2019m concerned. You cannot shut anyone out under a democratic contest. Anybody who is eligible that meets the criteria to either vote for somebody or be voted for, let him go on. I refuse to accept the lazy argument that this thing should be zoned and given to a particular zone.\n\n\u201cAbiola invested almost 20 to 25 years of goodwill across the country. Tofa, who was a very popular person in Kano, lost Kano to Abiola. Anybody from the South-east or South-south or the north, who wants to become president, should go and do that hard work and build alliances. Nigerians are good people. If you show them that you actually have their back and you are waiting for them, you will be amazed.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated further, \u201cIn 1999, a large section of the northern establishment, over 80 per cent of them, who were military were backing Alex Ekwueme for the presidency. As journalists, I will encourage you to send messages to people to actually go out there and build friendship and relationships and sow the seeds.\n\n\u201cYou will be surprised that an Ibibio or an Igbo guy or Ijaw man can easily get elected president, because the democratic space is very free and very open, and it\u2019s all about relationships. That investment has to happen. There is no reason why Mohammed Hayatu-Deen should be prevented from exercising his own democratic and human rights. That\u2019s my answer to that question.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his chances at the PDP presidential primary this weekend, Hayatu-Deen said, \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t go into anything without actually reflecting very carefully about it. Secondly, the reason why I went in is not because I want anything out of it personally for myself, my family or my friends.\n\n\u201cI see this country standing on a brink, almost approaching a failed state. All the sounds and stress are there for who wants to see; the structural holes, the cracks are there for anybody to see. I don\u2019t want to be a bystander watching what is going on, only for my conscience to say, if something terrible happens, what were you doing then? That you decided to stay in your private comfort and you refused to get into the murky waters of politics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my children to hold me accountable down the road and say, \u2018daddy, what were you doing?\u2019 Or ordinary Nigerians to say, \u2018we know this guy, he has so much to offer, he\u2019s sitting down, because he doesn\u2019t want any mud on his face.\u2019 I think the time for courageous people in civil society space, in the private space has come.\n\n\u201cThere is no better time than now for us to enrich the pool of politicians in this country and get many men and women of quality and distinction, who are going to be there not because they are going to help themselves, not because they are going to help their friends and families, but because they believe they have something they can give.\u201d\n\nThe former banker added, \u201cI have done my maths very carefully and I\u2019m going in to win and my message has resonated very well with all of the delegates that I have actually visited. And it\u2019s a competitive race, I know there are many competitors there, but we have grand deals worked out and I\u2019m confident that I will put up a very good showing at the primaries coming up this week.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

Stella Oduah was mobilized for youth service in 1982 and served in the Lagos orientation camp but then concluded that she \u2018absconded\u2019 and was not issued a certificate of discharge,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cThat reckless statement which we consider grossly irresponsible no doubt suggests that it was procured from you for political considerations in favour of Sen. Oduah\u2019s political detractors. We are shocked that you condescended so low to make such false and unverified conclusions which is damaging to her character and image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Sen. Oduah\u2019s NYSC place of primary assignment was the popular Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA). When a similar allegation was made by her political contenders in 2017, NECA issued a letter dated 11th January 2017 Ref No: NECA/SELA/H4 confirming that she carried out her NYSC primary assignment with them. Find attached a copy of that letter for reference as well as a photograph of our client as a youth corper.\n\n\u201cThat issue also attended litigation and she has a court judgment in her favour in the case of Chinedu Emmanuel Emeka v. Princess Stella Oduah , EPT/AWK/SEN/13/2019\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, one needs not be bothered about any other similar allegations in the light of the aforesaid judgment and the fact that NYSC is not a constitutional qualification to hold any public office in Nigeria, but your statement has to a large extent defamed her.\n\n\u201cIn your exact words, \u2018after the orientation course, she absconded\u2019 It is curious how a person who had participated in all NYSC activities at the Orientation Camp can be said to have \u201cabsconded\u201d because she left for her place of primary assignment as it was routine. It is either you chose to ignore your record or your office has failed to keep proper records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou are by this letter given 48 hours to retract your statement failing which legal actions shall be commenced against you.\u201d",

Stella Oduah was mobilized for youth service in 1982 and served in the Lagos orientation camp but then concluded that she \u2018absconded\u2019 and was not issued a certificate of discharge,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cThat reckless statement which we consider grossly irresponsible no doubt suggests that it was procured from you for political considerations in favour of Sen. Oduah\u2019s political detractors. We are shocked that you condescended so low to make such false and unverified conclusions which is damaging to her character and image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Sen. Oduah\u2019s NYSC place of primary assignment was the popular Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA). When a similar allegation was made by her political contenders in 2017, NECA issued a letter dated 11th January 2017 Ref No: NECA/SELA/H4 confirming that she carried out her NYSC primary assignment with them. Find attached a copy of that letter for reference as well as a photograph of our client as a youth corper.\n\n\u201cThat issue also attended litigation and she has a court judgment in her favour in the case of Chinedu Emmanuel Emeka v. Princess Stella Oduah , EPT/AWK/SEN/13/2019\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, one needs not be bothered about any other similar allegations in the light of the aforesaid judgment and the fact that NYSC is not a constitutional qualification to hold any public office in Nigeria, but your statement has to a large extent defamed her.\n\n\u201cIn your exact words, \u2018after the orientation course, she absconded\u2019 It is curious how a person who had participated in all NYSC activities at the Orientation Camp can be said to have \u201cabsconded\u201d because she left for her place of primary assignment as it was routine. It is either you chose to ignore your record or your office has failed to keep proper records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou are by this letter given 48 hours to retract your statement failing which legal actions shall be commenced against you.\u201d",

It was true. There was potash difficulty. About 30 per cent of the world\u2019s potash comes from Russia and Belarus. So, when the crisis started there was a blockade, there were sanctions and all kinds of issues, and we couldn\u2019t get potash,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut now, I\u2019m glad to report that we have solved the potash problem.

We have a food crisis, and there are agencies of government who are now involved in ensuring that people release what they have. We are going to unleash a whole bunch of supply.

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

Nigeria\u2019s deal with DAG is one such cloud-based IP solution.\n\nAccording to the agreement, the partnership will also see the launch of a nationwide wallet where Nigerians can collect royalties or payments\u2014in form of digital tokens or cryptocurrencies\u2014on any intellectual property rights they upload on the platform.\n\nThe Developing Africa Group (DAG), a UK-based IPR commercialisation group, has also announced that it will build the crypto-based platform on the Algorand Blockchain; while the tokenisation technology\u2014which includes the wallet and a stable coin-pegged token\u2014will be handled by Koibanx, an Argentina-based software company. Both Koibanx and Algorand have been involved in several similar crypto-based projects in Latin America including a national blockchain-based citizens ID and information programme in Colombia, and El Salvador\u2019s National Registration platform.\n\nIntellectual property in Nigeria\n\nIntellectual property rights (IPR) are the exclusive rights creators have over their works. Under IP laws, creators have the right to sell (assign) their work or permit others (license) to use or re-create their work. Intellectual Property also includes the rights of production, stocking, reproduction, adaptation, translation, and performance. They include the rights to sell (assign) their work or permit others (license) to use their works. They also include the rights of production, stocking, reproduction, adaptation, translation, and performance.\n\nIn Nigeria, intellectual property is divided into copyright, patents, trademarks and industrial designs, all governed by 4 different Acts. The country\u2019s Copyright Act governs the intellectual property rights of literary, artistic, musical works, broadcasting, recorded, and cinematographic works. Its Patent and Designs Act metes out laws guiding inventions, and industrial designs such as product designs. Its Trade Marks Act, and Merchandise Mark Act oversee the registration and regulation of trademarks like logos.\n\nJust like you have the freedom of movement or the freedom to post freely on social media, creators\u2014photographers, writers, painters, designers, and even scientists\u2014also have the rights to sell or rent out whatever unique things they create, subject to a few conditions.\n\nThis partnership between the Nigerian government and DAG will help Nigerian creators to benefit from their inventions and creators.\n\nNigeria\u2019s history with cryptocurrency\n\nThe deal brings into question Nigeria\u2019s shaky history with cryptocurrency.\n\nIts implementation will see crypto used in at least 2 ways: the building of the platform and wallet which will be on a blockchain network, and the use of a digital token\u2014which will be pegged to the naira. It\u2019s also possible that the deal could drive the usage of the CBN-backed e-naira.\n\nThese plans conflict with Nigeria\u2019s stance on crypto. In February 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) restricted all commercial banks and crypto exchange platforms from crypto trading and has subsequently sanctioned erring platforms.\n\nIt subsequently launched its central bank digital currency (CBDC) months later with over 35,000 transactions recorded since its launch.\n\nMore recently, in May 2022, the country\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published new rules regulating the issuance, offering platforms, and custody of digital assets A.K.A cryptocurrencies which some experts say fails to address problems facing Nigeria\u2019s crypto industry.\n\nCommercialised IP rights for everyday Nigerians\n\nFor Nigeria\u2019s blooming creator economy, the partnership means more visibility and income.\n\nA platform like this would allow anyone who identifies as a digital creator to sell their intellectual properties. Celebrities like Osita Iheme could sell rights to soundbites; photographers like Fati Abubakar could list rights to their photos, and even software engineers and product designers can sell rights to unique processes or designs (including logos) that are registered under Nigeria\u2019s patent law. The Nigerian film industry\u2014Nollywood\u2014could also raise funds by selling some of its features.\n\nWhen the deal comes to fruition, Nigeria\u2019s Copyright Commission (NCC) should see a rise in registration from Nigerians looking to make money selling their IP rights.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on WhatsApp, Twitter, Telegram, Facebook, and LinkedIn\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "American ride-hailing giant Uber recently announced that it has completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nThe company first launched in Africa in 2013, establishing a presence in Johannesburg, South Africa. Since then, it has expanded to operate in 7 other countries: Egypt, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Ivory Coast, with UberEats, its food delivery arm, available in several South African cities as well as Nairobi, Kenya. In 2018, it launched an intercity bus service in Egypt to connect cities together.\n\nTo mark this milestone, the company also shared that the most popular time users requested Uber rides is 2 PM, and that Friday was the most popular day users requested rides.\n\nUberX emerged the most popular ride options among ride options such as Uber Moto, Uber Boda, and Uber Poa.The average trip time recorded on Uber is 24 minutes, and the longest recorded trip was over 492 km.The most popular drop-off destination is the OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\n\u201cSince entering the market in 2013, we have created over 6 million economic opportunities in over 50 cities across SSA that we are present in,\u201d said Lorraine Onduru, the company\u2019s spokesperson and head of comms for East and West Africa, in a statement shared with TechCrunch.\n\nWithin the past year, Uber expanded to over 30 cities across its major markets: 21 in South Africa, 4 cities each in Kenya and Nigeria, and 2 in Ghana.\n\nAlongside its ride-hailing unit, it expanded UberEats across a few South African cities and Nairobi, Kenya. UberEats, which launched in 2016 in South Africa with just 1,000 restaurants, now serves over 8,000 merchants across 36 cities in South Africa and Kenya.\n\nDespite the success Uber has recorded in Africa, the ride-hailing company has also had to weather a few hurdles. Uber faces stiff competition from Bolt\u2014Uber\u2019s main competitor\u2014and other mobility tech companies.\n\nWhile Uber has focused on only operating in major cities across Africa, Bolt has taken the path of using an expansion strategy that\u2019s focused on not only operating in major cities across Africa but expanding to smaller cities and now operates in more African cities than Uber.\n\nUber has also had to deal with increasing its fare prices to cope with rising operating costs in Lagos and deal with backlash and lawsuits from unhappy drivers in Kenya.\n\nGlobally, in response to the downturn in the public markets, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said earlier this month that the company will now treat corporate hiring as a \u201cprivilege,\u201d hinting that Uber will freeze hiring or reduce its staff size. Khosrowshahi added that Uber will focus on achieving profitability on a free cash flow basis rather than adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA)\n\nIn its 2022 first-quarter earnings report, Uber reported a $5.9 billion loss despite revenue doubling to $6.9 billion from the same quarter last year. The losses were driven by a $5.6 billion headwind related to the company\u2019s equity investments, including unrealised losses related to Uber\u2019s stakes in Grab, Aurora, and Didi.\n\nDespite a bumpy first quarter, Uber expects to post \u201cmeaningful positive cash flows\u201d for the full-year 2022, which will be a first.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Dear healthtech startups, Jumia is coming for your bread!",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, May 17, 2022, Nigerian eCommerce giant, Jumia released its financial report for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nCo-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec shared that orders, revenue, and gross merchandise value (GMV) saw significant growth compared to the last nine quarters. Comparing Q1 2021 with Q1 2022, orders grew from 6.6 million to 9.3 million, GMV grew from $198.9 million to $252.7 million, while revenue went from $33 million to $47.6 million.\n\nEven with this growth, it\u2019s not all rosy for the company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss was $53 million. On a call with TechCrunch, Poignonnec shared that the company plans to keep EBITDA loss below the $70 million it recorded in Q1 2021.\n\nNow to some good and potentially exciting developments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJumiaPay, its fintech product, has secured a payment service solution provider (PSSP) licence, which will allow it to process payments for third-party businesses in Nigeria. This development puts it in direct competition with Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita. It also provides another revenue stream when it desperately needs to increase revenues.\n\nPSSPs usually make their money by charging a transaction fee for every transaction they facilitate, and these fees often vary depending on the transaction\u2019s value. Per the report, 34% of orders placed on Jumia were completed using JumiaPay, and with its licence, JumiaPay\u2019s numbers could significantly increase in the coming quarters.\n\nHealthcare at the drop of a hat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: AMISOM via Iwaria\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the developments shared in the report is Jumia\u2019s decision to venture into the healthcare space. Via a partnership with Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, the company is testing a service that will allow users to access doctors with a monthly subscription of $1.\n\nViewed in isolation, this is a great move that could see Jumia tap into its existing customer base and infrastructure. It also represents a more formidable competitor for existing healthcare startups.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 1 doctor per 600 people in a country, but Nigeria has 1 doctor for 5,000 people. Furthermore, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria, while the healthtech industry in Africa is projected to be worth $259 billion by 2030.\n\nAlthough little detail was provided about the move, its foray into an area that is notoriously difficult in Africa and is not remotely related to its core business warrants some questions.\n\nExisting telehealth startups in the country include CribMD, iWello, and WellaHealth. As private companies, their records are often not in the public domain, but in a 2021 interview with Techpoint Africa, iWello reported that it had 140 clients, with CribMD reportedly serving 2,800 patients as of 2021. WellaHealth\u2019s CEO also shared that the company hit 10,000 unique users in 2017, with thousands on its waitlist.\n\nThese companies are significantly less funded than Jumia, with Africa\u2019s healthcare sector raising $392 million in 2021. However, these companies have to combat low Internet penetration, dwindling household incomes, and cultural norms to get paying customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, Jumia has no expertise operating in the healthcare sector and would likely have to go through a learning curve for this venture to succeed. Even with the option of hiring experienced professionals, things will probably not go their way immediately.\n\nThe fragmented nature of the healthcare space is another challenge that existing players face. For example, there are only a handful of hospitals with digitised records and even fewer still that share this information. This makes it imperative that healthtech startups build solutions for this purpose.\n\nBuilding partnerships for effective healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these could pose challenges to Jumia\u2019s healthtech plans, Yomi Kazeem, Senior Consultant, Salient Advisory, believes that Jumia has what it takes to succeed, especially if it goes the partnership route.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he said, \u201cJumia can potentially build out its healthtech play through more partnerships to facilitate diagnostics. It can also partner with pharmacies, leverage its logistics network, and pair medication delivery with its telemedicine service, so patients are not only speaking to doctors remotely but also receiving needed medication seamlessly.\n\n\u201cThis approach is important because, ultimately, providing access to consultations is only one part of healthcare. With more of these companies emerging, user acquisition becomes more competitive. In essence, third-party partnerships that facilitate access to patients on a larger scale are vital.\u201d\n\nUnlike existing healthtech players, Jumia has an established logistics service that could help it deliver medications faster than startups that have to depend on third-party providers. While this means Jumia could potentially cut into their market, it also presents an opportunity to expand healthtech services in the country while unlocking one more revenue stream for Jumia.\n\nHealthtech startups, for example, can provide faster and more efficient services by partnering with Jumia. Such partnerships could also expose them to Jumia\u2019s considerably larger customer base.\n\nAn example of such a partnership is Airtel Kenya\u2019s partnership with MyDawa, an online pharmacy in Kenya that allows Airtel\u2019s customers log into the MyDawa website without incurring data costs while MyDawa provides an option to pay for products with Airtel Money.\n\nDespite being boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, healthtech startups are still a long way from meeting Africa\u2019s healthcare needs. However, partnerships such as this could be key going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOl\u00e1,\n\nYou\u2019ve missed out if you haven\u2019t been listening to the Techpoint Africa Podcast, dear reader! Ask around and tell me what other people are saying.\n\nToday\u2019s episode is a lot of fun to listen to! The editorial team made me laugh; Bolu\u2019s story was one of the stories that drew me in.\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? The Central African Republic announced plans to launch SANGO, a bitcoin investment hub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis follows a warning from the Banking Commission of Central Africa (COBAC) prohibiting banks in the region from collaborating with digital payment platforms. Why? The CAR adopted bitcoin as a reference currency.\n\nAlso, a Nigerian, Chidi Nwaubani, launched the \u201cLooty\u201d project to reclaim African artefacts stolen by European colonists.\n\nThe project will create 3D images of these artefacts, sell them as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and use the proceeds to support young African artists.\n\nPlease listen to the podcast to hear these gists in particular. Bolu spoke last, so you\u2019ll have to listen till the end.\n\nYou can find today\u2019s episode here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow Traction wants to stop fake alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7m seed\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\nTraction wants to stop fake alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction Founders: Dolapo Adejuyigbe and Mayowa Alli (L-R)\n\nOn Monday, I had to use a PoS kiosk because I had problems with one of my banks. Currently, I have two active accounts, but only one has an ATM card.\n\nThat was intentional. I had no idea the other ATM card would come in handy. I have, however, learnt my lesson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, at the kiosk where I was supposed to transfer money to get cash, I asked if they accept mobile transfers, and the attendant took a long look at me before responding reluctantly in the affirmative.\n\nWith her response, I knew they don\u2019t accept mobile transfers. But, because I am someone she knows, she reluctantly agreed.\n\nOf course, the attendant isn\u2019t the only one who has reservations about accepting mobile transfers. In fact, there are small business owners in my neighbourhood who refuse to accept mobile transfers.\n\nSo, before I went there, I mumbled some incantations because I had no money. \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude39 I\u2019m kidding. But that money was urgently needed, though.\n\nAlthough the transfer was successful, she did not give me my money until she saw and confirmed the alert. I was slightly vexed, but I understood why.\n\nReceiving fake alerts isn\u2019t new for merchants in my neighbourhood, so they\u2019d rather you give them cash for every item you buy over making a mobile transfer.\n\nI waited about 15 minutes before she gave me my money. Fear of fake alerts cost me 15 minutes of my time! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22 I\u2019m not crying, but I believe this is a problem.\n\nI\u2019m sure you know someone or have heard of someone who has been a victim of receiving fake alerts. Consider a merchant receiving fake alerts for every item they sell or service they render. That\u2019s cruel, in my opinion.\n\nHowever, there appears to be a solution. What is it? Traction! The Nigeria-based fintech startup believes its proprietary solution can solve this problem.\n\nHow? It has a unique feature that allows merchants to confirm that every alert is real. Isn\u2019t this interesting?\n\nBusiness owners can use the app to accept payments, generate invoices, manage inventory, and track payments. It also enables merchant employees to confirm payments without calling their boss. Aren\u2019t you curious now?\n\nIf you are, please read Ogheneruemu\u2019s story to learn more about the startup: Traction is building an ecosystem for Nigerian small businesses, starting with stopping fake credit alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R, Pascal Ntsama, Canza Finance CEO and Co-Founder and Oyedeji Oluwole, Canza Finance CTO and Co-Founder.\n\nWith the volatility of cryptocurrency, I won\u2019t even look at you twice if you ask me to buy, not to think of launching a crypto business with you.\n\nIt\u2019s simply too risky, if you ask me. It\u2019s high today, low tomorrow; please don\u2019t give me a heart attack. \ud83d\ude0f\n\nThis reminds me of something that happened last Monday. Please accept my apologies if you are a crypto trader or investor. But, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing when the guy next to me on the bus was glued to his screen, checking his crypto app. \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude02\n\nSincerely, this guy didn\u2019t even close the app for a second. He was just staring. His expression was sad. That could be due to the drop in cryptocurrency that week.\n\nToday\u2019s story, on the other hand, features two Co-founders, Pascal Ntsama and Oyedeji Oluwoye, who began working together after Oluwoye advised Ntsama to buy cryptocurrency. That was bold, if you ask me.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t convinced initially, but after seeing Oluwoye\u2019s success with cryptocurrency two years later, he agreed.\n\nThat\u2019s when the pair realised there was more to cryptocurrency than just trading. They established Coincentrix in 2017 and received a grant from the Zcash Foundation in 2018.\n\nThen, in 2019, they launched Canza Finance, a crypto neobank that connects African businesses to the global economy.\n\nIn other words, the startup makes cryptocurrency transactions easier. It also allows for payments and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions within the country. Besides, it intends to include treasury management in its suite of services.\n\nChimgozirin described the startup\u2019s journey in detail here: Canza Finance is a neobank enabling decentralised cross-border payments for Africans\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to mental health, there is a common misconception that only people suffering from mental disorders see therapists. This is because some of us mistake mental health for a mental illness, which it is not.\n\nMental health is more than just the absence of a mental disorder. It includes how you think, feel, and act.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re having trouble thinking clearly, stressed, or feeling depressed, it can affect your productivity at school, work, or at home, indicating poor mental health.\n\nConsequently, it would help if you spoke with a trusted person who can keep your information confidential while also providing a safe space to express your emotions and possibly offer advice. You can also talk with someone who is trained in counselling or psychiatry.\n\nMoreover, due to the stigma surrounding mental health, most people are afraid of physically going to a centre to see a therapist or psychiatrist\n\nIn Egypt, Fadi Doss, Founder and CEO of Esaal, launched a platform that connects users to experts, allowing them to receive personalised and genuine answers to health concerns straightforwardly and smoothly.\n\nAnd yesterday, Esaal \u2014 an online health and wellness consultation platform \u2014 announced a $1.7 million seed round, led by Egypt-based A15.\n\nEsaal claims that it has over 350 consultants. Also, the company offers consultations on a wide range of topics, like anxiety, physiotherapy, paediatrics, and nutrition.\n\nUsers use an app to access these services via texting, video/voice calls, and in-person visits. They can pay with cash, credit cards, Vodafone, and Fawry.\n\nPer the CEO, the services are available in seven other countries across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries: Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Palestine, and Iraq.\n\nThe funding will be used to expand across MENA, invest in product and brand development, and hire more people. Between 2021 and 2025, Esaal anticipates a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50-60%.\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce retail platform, JABU, announced a $15 million Series A round yesterday, Wednesday,May 25, 2022.\n\nThe round was led by Tiger Global and saw participation from Box Group, Knollwood, D Global Ventures, Afore Capital, Oldslip and FJ Labs.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nWhat\u2019s new? Akinin stated that JABU intends to build around its Jwallet, a wallet system that is currently available as a standalone product. It enables Southern African merchants to use their physical flows to provide cash withdrawal and deposit services to their customers.\n\nIs this similar? Yes. It\u2019s identical to agency banking, a branchless banking system in Nigeria and West Africa where human agents serve as ATMs to provide financial services in outlying areas. And in Morocco, Chari provides a similar service.\n\nJABU will use the Series A funding to expand its presence in Southern Africa and enter new markets like Botswana and Eswatini later this year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills.

Today we talked about the Kenyan government\u2019s plans to roll out a telemedicine programme. But that\u2019s not all we talked about, so let\u2019s not put the cart before the horse.\n\nFor one, the news of Uber reaching a billion rides in Africa warranted a mention, albeit brief. Oluwanifemi had some interesting tidbits concerning the length of time it took them to get this milestone on the continent, compared to India, South Asia, and the UK.\n\nBut it also made a nice segue into the African Mobility Conference organised by GIG Mobility which will hold on June 2, 2022, at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. With the theme, \u201cPathways to the future of mobility in Africa,\u201d there should be quite a lot to unpack, especially as regards shaping the mobility narrative on the continent. Register to attend here.\n\nFrom there, we moved on to discussions on the Kenyan government\u2019s plans to roll out a telemedicine programme. Thankfully, there were no debates like last week, but that was probably the calm before the storm.\n\nAnother topic on the discussion table was the Central African Republic\u2019s decision to launch an official crypto hub named Sango. You may recall the country revealing its plan to make Bitcoin a reference currency a few weeks ago. You can listen to the episode where we discussed it here.\n\nWhile we are not sure how the name is pronounced, we \u2014 read Bolu \u2014 had some fun coming up with different variations.\n\nAnd then came the storm. A Nigerian named Chidi Nwaubani has launched a project called \u201cLooty\u201d to reclaim artefacts stolen by European colonisers by creating 3D images and selling them as NFTs.\n\nIf you wonder why there was a storm, you might want to listen till the end of today\u2019s podcast, where Emmanuel, Oluwanifemi, and Chimgozirim hash out some questions you might have.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to send us your feedback at podcast@techpoint.africa and tweet at us with the #TechpointAfricaPodcast.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading digital identity and consumer analytics technology company, VerifyMe Nigeria, has launched a digital plate number verification service that verifies motor vehicle and motor owner data instantly via plate numbers.\n\nWith products such as license plate verification, VerifyMe continues to bring relevant products to market to help power growth in the fintech, insurance, and services industries. These industry-enabling products are made possible by continued digitalization in government agencies such as FRSC and their continued mandate to enable growth in the digital economy.\n\nAccording to Esigie Aguele, Co-founder/CEO, VerifyMe Nigeria, the plate number verification service is designed to fill the need for trusted real-time data within Nigeria\u2019s burgeoning vehicle and asset verification market. It will also enable insurance companies to instantly onboard customers while also maintaining full compliance and security.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are enthusiastic about the possibilities Plate Number Verification service offers in opening new opportunities for the insurance sector. This initiative, supported by the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) will ensure trust in the system as the parties in a transaction can confirm the particulars of a vehicle real time and mitigate future issues and delays during claims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA) estimates that the auto-insurance sector has a N50 billion premium growth opportunity while about 77 percent of cars in the country are currently uninsured. This situation is exacerbated by the high number of unregistered vehicles and vehicles with fake registration licenses on the roads which significantly stunts motor-insurance penetration in the country.\n\nAdditionally, about 95 percent of the Nigerian auto market falls within the used car segment making it critical to verify the details of a vehicle for end-to-end transaction trust. The country also accounts for about 15% of Africa\u2019s ride-hailing app customers. The Vehicle License Number API will facilitate the seamless sale and purchasing of vehicles, boost consumer lending and enhance security within the space.\n\nRecognized as a leading African startup leveraging practical technology to solve Africa\u2019s problems, VerifyMe is noted for its innovative products and transformational leadership within the digital identity and open finance infrastructure space. The company was voted as a Notable Ecosystem Champion in Nigeria in the StartupBlink 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "title": "Investors to exit stocks for fixed income on rate hike",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) recent hawkish approach no doubt was informed by the need to dampen inflationary pressures to ensure price stability but the decision has its consequence on several of the nation\u2019s assets classes which are expected to be disrupted.\n\nExpectedly, bond yields would increase leading to lower prices, stocks valuation would decrease, leading to selloffs, while in the foreign exchange (FX) market, Naira appreciation is not expected until the oil sector recovers from recession. Also, the yield earned from investing in liquid, short-term debt securities like Treasury Bills (T-Bills) with less than one year maturity will increase.\n\nThe implication is that Nigeria\u2019s stock market which appears to have been exempted from global market rout with a positive year-to-date (YtD) return of 23.12percent as at Wednesday will begin to see a dip as investors go for higher yields.\n\n\u201cWe expect the hawkish tone to cause significant disruptions across all asset classes,\u201d according to United Capital research analysts in their post-MPC note to investors. They see scope for a surge in money market and bond yields in the coming months.\n\nIn addition, they expect a negative reaction in the equities market \u201cas investors selloff equity exposures in response to rising yields.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, we expect companies with solid half-year (H1) 2022 earnings performance will remain attractive to investors particularly in July. For the next MPC meeting in July, we expect the MPC to revert to a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach to gauge the impact of the recent hike on inflation and other key parameter objectives,\u201d United Capital analysts added.\n\nThey also believe that despite being unsurprising, \u201cthe Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s anti-inflationary tilt represents a sharp reversal from the prior pro-growth tone at previous meetings where the primary driver of inflation was believed to be solely structural inefficiencies and supply-side disruptions.\u201d\n\nRead also: Business Day, NGX hosts 7th Nigerian Investor Value Awards\n\nThough following a record N519billion loss on Tuesday, the Nigerian stock market took a surprising twist on Wednesday, May 25, rising by 1.24percent or recouping about N346billion. The market\u2019s performance indicators \u2013 the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalisation increased from 51,949.64 points and N28.006trillion respectively to 52,591.41 points and N28.352trillion.\n\nElizabeth Ebi, Group Managing Director, Futureview Group believes that the 13 percent nominal anchor \u201cwas a bit devastating\u201d, adding that it will lead to massive sell-off on the Capital Market \u201cas speculators would always look for an asset class with prospects of superior returns\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the new MPR would be a bit devastating on all Financial Assets. Bond yields would increase, leading to lower bond prices, stocks valuation would decrease, leading to selloffs and lower values for a limited period.\n\n\u201cThis new rate would force investors to readjust, take profits, and enter back into the market at a later date, causing value stocks and stocks with strong fundamentals to rebound in another couple of months,\u201d she noted.\n\n\u201cFrom a macro perspective, we expect the rate hike to result in an upward repricing of yields in the fixed income (FI) market, especially on the long end of the curve. In the equities market, higher interest rates suggest stock valuations could be discounted at higher interest rates, leading to lower target prices and profit-taking.\n\n\u201cIn the foreign exchange (FX) market, we do not expect appreciation in the Naira until the oil sector recovers from recession. Instead, we expect increased election-related pressure on the Naira in the near term,\u201d according to Ibukun Omoyeni and Angela Onotu, both analysts at Lagos-based Vetiva in their note to investors tagged \u2018At last, the hawks carry the day\u2019.\n\nRead also: Leading economists say to expect lower wages, rising inflation and food crisis\n\n\u201cNigeria joins other African economies like Egypt and Ghana in raising interest rates to curb inflation. On a comparative basis, however, Nigeria\u2019s negative real rate of return is still above Egypt\u2019s and South Africa\u2019s levels.\n\nIf there were no capital controls, the MPR needs to rise to 15percent -15.5percent to match the current real rate of return in Egypt and South Africa, respectively,\u201d Vetiva analysts said.\n\nAlso, Tajudeen Olayinka, Chief Executive Officer, Wyoming Capital and Partners who believes that the hawkish approach was not unusual and the impact being temporary on the Capital Market, noted that a securities market had self-correcting mechanism that would ultimately lead to an equilibrium between the money market and the capital market.\n\n\u201cThe impacts on the capital market will be temporary. The market will correct itself after the initial sharp reaction. One of the initial fallouts is how the quoted companies shall adjust to the cost implications of the increase on MPR. But later, the money market and capital market shall come into equilibrium. There is nothing to worry about,\u201d Olayinka added.",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) says it will begin to invest in new commercial-ready technologies that can meet energy needs and help fight climate change impacts, a development that signals opportunities for clean energy investors.\n\nMargareth Okadigbo, chairman of the NNPC, in a speech at the 28th World Gas Conference in the Republic of Korea, on Wednesday, unveiled the corporation\u2019s plan to decarbonise its gas operations.\n\nOkadigbo said the corporation plans new projects for carbon reduction, and increasing efficiencies, while maintaining some degree of flexibility to adapt technologies to geographical and social, cultural realities.\n\n\u201cWe are taking a deeper look into commercial-ready technologies that can be leveraged to meet both energy needs and climate-smart developments such as low carbon fuels, hydrogen, methanol, carbon capture, and biofuels,\u201d she said.\n\nOver the past five years, the clamour to cut emissions in oil production to halt the rampaging impacts of climate change is forcing energy producers to rethink their strategies as pressure from their shareholders mounts.\n\nOil majors such as Shell and Total are no longer willing to be known as just oil and gas companies; they are rebranding into integrated energy companies and matching the strategic shift by announcing net-zero targets.\n\nNet-zero is used to describe the state in which the greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere are balanced by removal from the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, we began the biggest transformation in our company\u2019s history that spans more than 110 years,\u201d Federica Berra, senior vice president, integrated gas and power at BP, said during a panel session at the event.\n\n\u201cWe now have a new purpose to reimagine energy for our people and our planet, and we have a new ambition to get to net-zero by 2050 or sooner and help the world get there,\u201d she said.\n\nThis new sense of purpose shared by major oil companies which the NNPC is committing to could open up the space for clean and new energy models and investments in Nigeria, as has been true across the world.\n\nIn the case of the NNPC, Okadigbo said the corporation is road mapping for the future, to make sustainability a key consideration in all future projects.\n\nAccording to researchers at London-based data, insights, and consulting firm, Kantar, sustainability is a huge commercial opportunity.\n\n\u201cTrends in sustainable behaviour and living have gathered momentum at the turn of this decade and are now becoming the focal point for businesses,\u201d analysts at Kantar said.\n\nTrends show this is now the case in the energy sector where investments are shifting to new energy sources like hydrogen.\n\nFrancesco La Camera, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency, a 180-member country intergovernmental organisation mandated to facilitate cooperation and advance knowledge and adoption of renewable energy, said hydrogen could prove to be a missing link to a climate-safe energy future.\n\nLa Camera said in a recent release that hydrogen was clearly riding on the renewable energy revolution with green hydrogen emerging as a game-changer for achieving climate neutrality without compromising industrial growth and social development.\n\n\u201cBut hydrogen is not a new oil. And the transition is not a fuel replacement but a shift to a new system with political, technical, environmental, and economic disruptions,\u201d said La Camera.\n\nOkadigbo alluded to NNPC\u2019s quest for new energy forms and selecting low-hanging fruit projects, such as converting industry from raw energy to climate-smart technologies.\n\n\u201cWe are also determining what can be done in-house with local technology champions to deepen the desire for climate-smart technologies,\u201d she said.\n\nClimate-smart technologies (CSTs) and practices are activities that help farmers adapt to the effects of climate change. CSTs help farmers address climate change issues such as extreme drought, extreme precipitation, and changes in seasonal timing.\n\nIn parts of East Africa, CSTs interventions have come in the form of new approaches to soil management, drought-tolerant maize, dairy development, innovative ways to farming catfish, carbon finance to restore crop fields, and waste-reducing rice thresher, rainfall forecasts, and incentive system for low-carbon agriculture.\n\nThis is important because, as Okadigbo said, the NNPC is planning for carbon offsets from agricultural and biomass energy projects to be considered as part of the future planning kit for their decarbonising effort.\n\nCarbon offsets are considered evidence of an activity that avoids, reduces or removes quantifiable volumes of greenhouse emissions from the atmosphere and offsets can therefore be bought and sold as legal ownership of that emissions reduction is tradable allowing it to be transferred and used to balance out offset omissions generated elsewhere, she explained.\n\nShe said: \u201cOur view at NNPC is that carbon offsetting is effective, but it is more effective if it is done in addition to carbon reduction, and not just a stand-alone.\n\n\u201cOnce the strategies are in place, carbon offsets can be employed as a faster way to ensure reductions in carbon emissions. So for example, renewable energy and aviation offsets are a good start to any effective clean energy strategy.\u201d\n\nLast year, Nigeria earned one million euros from cutting carbon emissions in its oil and gas production in joint projects between TotalEnergies and the National Petroleum Investment Management Services, an NNPC subsidiary.\n\nCarbon credits are earned when a project is registered as a Clean Development Mechanism project under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, earning the nation carbon credits that can be cashed with the World Bank or through the European Union Emissions Trading Systems (EU ETS).\n\nSet up in 2005, the EU ETS is the world\u2019s first international emissions trading system. It has since continued to inspire the development of emissions trading in other countries and regions.\n\nThe EU supports these efforts through knowledge exchange and capacity-building activities. The EU also considers opportunities to link the EU ETS with other compatible systems.\n\nThis follows the agreement reached by 196 countries at the COP 21 in Paris commonly called the Paris Agreement in 2015, where they committed to cut back on carbon emissions.\n\nRead also: How Carbon Limits Nigeria is championing fresh ideas in Nigeria\u2019s carbon neutrality\n\nOkadigbo said cutting emissions from the source is more effective, adding, \u201cCarbon offsets can play a great role in helping to fund environmental projects if they are properly certified in accordance with recognized practice by competent organisations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a reason why the promise of carbon offsets as a tradable tool for funding environmental projects, especially in Africa is challenging. Nevertheless, we see a strong future for offsets, especially as tradable certificates for heavy industry and aviation,\u201d she said.\n\nInvestors who leverage CSTs in agriculture and partner with the NNPC will see value through trading carbon credits as well as helping to ensure food security in Nigeria.\n\nOkadigbo also said the corporation would help to declutter the regulatory landscape by supporting regulations that encourage clean technologies.\n\n\u201cWe are also embracing digitalization for asset and pollution monitoring, metering, data measurement, and integrity performance,\u201d she said.\n\nWithin the last five years, industries and governments are taking the responsibility to support the call for an energy transition to more climate-smart technologies.\n\nThis responsibility has changed the way governments plan investments in energy, and infrastructure, with some countries, especially in Europe before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, having developed clear policies to fight climate change.\n\n\u201cFor us the NNPC, our partners, and the government, this means taking up sustainability and decarbonisation efforts to new levels,\u201d Okadigbo said.",

          "text": "Barely a month after the end of the pension industry recapitalisation, which led to the successful emergence of 20 players, another wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is brewing in the sector.\n\nThe recapitalisation that ended on April 21, 2022 required Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) to increase their capital from N1 billion to N5 billion.\n\nAccess Holdings, owners of Access Pension Fund Custodian (PFC), last week announced the sale of its custodial business to First Pension Custodians. It also announced another plan to acquire a majority stake in First Guarantee Pension PFA.\n\nAccess Holdings said in a statement that it had entered into a definitive agreement with First Guarantee Pension Limited regarding the potential acquisition of a majority equity stake in the company.\n\n\u201cThis transaction is a natural evolution for us. Over the last 20 years, we set our sights on and delivered ambitious plans to transform the African financial services landscape focusing on banking and have created the African leading bank and largest bank by customer base,\u201d Herbert Wigwe, group CEO of Access Corporation, said.\n\nHe said the National Pension Commission and the Central Bank of Nigeria had given their \u201cno objection\u201d to the transactions, the completion of which is subject to the receipt of all required regulatory approvals.\n\nAccess Holdings had earlier announced plans by Access Bank to divest from its pension custody subsidiary.\n\nAccording to a statement, Access Bank has entered into a definitive agreement with First Pension Custodian Nigeria Limited, a subsidiary of FBN Holdings Plc.\n\nThe agreement is regarding a proposed purchase by First Pensions of the entire share capital of Access Pension Fund Custodian Limited held by Access Bank Plc.\n\nExperts in the pension industry had predicted another wave of M&A that would follow the last recapitalisation exercise, and snowball into major consolidation for the industry.\n\nRead also: Recapitalisation for PFAs and the welfare of Nigerian pensioners\n\nDave Uduanu, managing director/CEO of Sigma Pension Limited, said: \u201cI think it is a good thing that there are 20 PFAs standing, but I think it is still early days and I believe there will be more consolidations in this space.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the pension industry, it is still very fragmented. Beyond Stanbic IBTC Pension that controls around 40 percent of the market share, there are a lot of fringe players; so there would be more consolidations in the space.\u201d\n\nUduanu described the entry of banks into the pension industry as a good development.\n\n\u201cI think they will bring more capital, more resources, more infrastructure in terms of branch network, technology, and just the aggression the banks have used to do their banking businesses. But more importantly, they will be a very formidable competitor to the number-one player. So, I think it is good news,\u201d he said.\n\nPius Apere, chairman/CEO of Achor Actuarial Services Limited, said the regulatory recapitalisation was expected to lead to stronger PFAs with improved capacity for more efficient service delivery.\n\n\u201cIt is likely to create a level playing field in the pension sector where all PFAs would have the necessary funds to deploy adequate technology and embark on human capital development required to achieve efficient service delivery, e.g. enhancing the transfer window,\u201d he said.\n\nApere said competition within the industry would mainly be based on efficient service delivery, rather than capital.\n\n\u201cHowever, the operators will still have different levels of capital and size of assets under management, which will remain a key competitive tool despite the regulatory recapitalization requirement,\u201d he added.",

Already, Edo has about 120,000 hectares of oil palm plantation under development.\n\nOther investors and stakeholders who visited the Raedial Farms facility in Iguomokhua village, Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State include Boston Advisory, CAGL Global, United Capital & United Bank of Africa (UBA). They were received by the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mr. Uwadiale Agenmonmen.\n\nAgenmonmen said work is in top gear to supply crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO) to the market through the current expansion programme of its palm plantation and mill.\n\nHe stated that there was no better time to invest in palm oil cultivation and production in Nigeria other than now, particularly against the backdrop of the recent ban on the exportation of palm oil and oil palm produced by the Indonesian government.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe business environment is interesting. There may be ups and downs but lately, the palm oil value chain has been the best in a while, fostered by Indonesia shutting down their export recently and thereby putting the pressure back home.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, people that normally import can no longer import palm oil and other products from Indonesia. So, the prices are going up and it is good for the farmers that actually cultivate and sell. In a nutshell, right now, the business environment is okay.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the financial support towards the growth of the industry, he stated that the major obstacle militating the success of farmers in the oil palm industry is largely occasioned by the set of conditions or evaluation commercial banks give to those who want to access the funds provided by CBN.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe farm sits on 1,509 hectares of land and has currently cultivated 700 hectares while another 500 hectares would be cultivated this year. The oil mill in the farm currently has the capacity of producing 16 tons of red oil every day and from palm kernel oil, it can produce 27 tons every day when there is a full stock of raw materials.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to bring our current investors and bankers here to physically see what we are doing because there is a difference when you talk to people about what you do on paper and phone calls.

We have been able to grow our economy to align with its potential. We are addressing a whole lot of issues, particularly security and healthcare to sort out the economy.\n\n\u201cWe are working to fire our economy to the extent that we utilize the economy to the benefit of our people, and one key driver for us is agriculture; food. The number one pressing issue in Nigeria today is food availability.\n\n\u201cWe are going to make sure we focus on food production and economic growth. We are engaging with our young people and trying to position them to take advantage of the opportunities in culture and technology globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to be competitive economically, the key asset you need are your people; the key driver they need is education. They have to be educated. We are emphasizing education, particularly basic education,\u201d he added.\n\nReaffirming his government\u2019s commitment to ending the menace of human trafficking and illegal migration in Edo, Obaseki further noted, \u201cWe realized that it is that lack of hope and poor education that fuels irregular migration, and we have tried as much as we can to curtail that menace of irregular migration by creating hope for them; nobody wants to leave home if the home is comfortable.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the success recorded by his administration in the health sector, the governor said the state partnered with the Association of Nigeria Physicians in the Americas (ANPA) to provide free medical outreach to Edo people.\n\nHe said, \u201cA couple of weeks ago, we received 67 medical practitioners in our state and they worked with our personnel on ground to improve quality healthcare delivery to our people. For us, with healthcare, it\u2019s about the foundation. If we have the basic health footprint right, as well as the training of community healthcare heads, then it will not be too challenging dealing with diseases such as malaria and distributing vaccines.\u201d\n\nOn culture, Obaseki added, \u201cFor us as government, our goal is to position Edo for the subcontinent. We are working with the European Government in the areas of storage and preservation facilities and the Nigeria Government, to strengthen the national museum monuments\u2019 facilities.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to working with the Royal Palace in building a royal collection and the whole idea is to build the Edo Museum of West Africa Art (EMOWAA) where you will have a lot to see when you come in.\u201d\n\nEarlier in her speech, the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Leonard, saluted the government for its anti-trafficking laws, noting that they have helped in curbing irregular migration among young people in the state.\n\nWhile reassuring the support of the United States, she further hailed the Obaseki-led government for its various programmes to positively engage Edo youths.\n\nLeonard further revealed that museums in the United States of America are intensifying efforts to repatriate Benin artifacts in their possession.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Stella Oduah, former aviation minister and senator representing Anambra north, has threatened to sue the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) if does not retract its allegation that she failed to complete her youth service.\n\nIn a May 24 letter, the NYSC had claimed that Oduah did not complete the mandatory national youth service.\n\nShuaibu Ibrahim, NYSC director-general, had said Oduah was mobilised for national service in 1982/83 and was deployed to Lagos, but absconded after the orientation.\n\nIn a reply to the request by the Concerned Anambra North Peoples Democratic Party Stakeholders, seeking to validate the claim by the Senator that she lost her NYSC certificate, the Director-General of the service said that even though Oduah was mobilised for national service in 1982/83 service year and was deployed to Lagos State, she absconded after the orientation and never completed the service.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe consequence of this is that she is not qualified for the issuance of the certificate of national service.\u201d\n\nIn a letter signed by Ezennia Nonso Chukwudebe, Oduah\u2019s media director, the senator described the allegation as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cscandalous\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur attention has been called to your scandalous letter referenced above in which you acknowledged that Sen. Stella Oduah was mobilized for youth service in 1982 and served in the Lagos orientation camp but then concluded that she \u2018absconded\u2019 and was not issued a certificate of discharge,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cThat reckless statement which we consider grossly irresponsible no doubt suggests that it was procured from you for political considerations in favour of Sen. Oduah\u2019s political detractors. We are shocked that you condescended so low to make such false and unverified conclusions which is damaging to her character and image.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Sen. Oduah\u2019s NYSC place of primary assignment was the popular Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA). When a similar allegation was made by her political contenders in 2017, NECA issued a letter dated 11th January 2017 Ref No: NECA/SELA/H4 confirming that she carried out her NYSC primary assignment with them. Find attached a copy of that letter for reference as well as a photograph of our client as a youth corper.\n\n\u201cThat issue also attended litigation and she has a court judgment in her favour in the case of Chinedu Emmanuel Emeka v. Princess Stella Oduah , EPT/AWK/SEN/13/2019\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, one needs not be bothered about any other similar allegations in the light of the aforesaid judgment and the fact that NYSC is not a constitutional qualification to hold any public office in Nigeria, but your statement has to a large extent defamed her.\n\n\u201cIn your exact words, \u2018after the orientation course, she absconded\u2019 It is curious how a person who had participated in all NYSC activities at the Orientation Camp can be said to have \u201cabsconded\u201d because she left for her place of primary assignment as it was routine. It is either you chose to ignore your record or your office has failed to keep proper records.\n\n\u201cYou are by this letter given 48 hours to retract your statement failing which legal actions shall be commenced against you.\u201d",

          "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has noted that the Identity Management System being developed by the capital market would tackle the lingering identity management issues while allowing room for scalability as technology evolves.\n\nThis was stated by the Director General of the SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda when he received members of the Committee on Identity Management for the Capital Market in Abuja weekend.\n\nYuguda described identity theft as a fraudulent practice of using another person\u2019s name and personal information to obtain shares, credit and loans, among others adding that the Commission decided to engage relevant stakeholders in a bid to resolve issues of identity management to tackle the problem of unclaimed dividends.\n\nAccording to him, the problem of unclaimed dividends had to do with identity management, hence the Commission is currently engaging stakeholders to harmonize various databases of investors and facilitate data accuracy in the market as well as increasing investors\u2019 education to stem the trend.\n\nThe SEC DG who expressed satisfaction with the work of the Committee so far, added that stakeholder engagements would commence in earnest to ensure success of the project.\n\nWhile thanking the members of the Committee for lending their support and resources to the Project, the SEC DG also expressed confidence in the success of the Project that it would build a greater Nigeria and impact unborn generations.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede commended the Commission on the recent release of Rules on Issuance, Offering Platforms and Custody of Digital Assets saying that it was a step in the right direction.\n\nMr. Aig-Imoukhuede said the Committee\u2019s work had exposed the need for standardization of systems within the Nigerian Capital Market that would support Open Finance which the SEC can drive, adding that the SEC could leverage on the Committee to develop the framework for the Nigerian capital market.\n\nAccording to Mr. Aig-Imoukhuede \u201cThe Committee had clearly defined the task ahead in a Road Map and also identified that the Project would be carried out in stages supported by a consultant with recourse to the SEC on a regular basis. The Committee is committed to ensuring that the customer journey for investors is such that would cause a revolution in the Nigerian capital market, thereby making our market attractive to the tech savvy and younger generation\u201d.\n\nThe Nigerian Capital Market has been on a journey of innovation to drive an efficient Capital Market that would greatly impact the Nigerian economy. The SEC had identified that lack of a proper identity management system for the Nigerian Capital was a plague in attaining its goal of efficiency and reducing the lingering issues surrounding identity management such as unclaimed dividends and cumbersome customer journeys. In order to proffer a lasting solution that would ensure competitiveness of the Capital Market through processes and practices that improve efficiency, enhance participation of both domestic and foreign investors and resolve the protracted issue of unclaimed dividend, the Committee on Identity Management for the Capital Market was constituted by the SEC on June 30, 2021.\n\nMembership was drawn across the Capital Market, banking, payment system and technology/innovation enabler with the SEC as the secretariat. The Committee is chaired by Mr. Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede. Members include Mr. Bayo Olugbemi, Mr. Haruna Jalo-Waziri, Mr. Oladele Sotubo, Mr. Saheed Bashir, Mr. Herbert Wigwe, Mr. Premier Oiwoh and Mr. Adedeji Olowe. It is tasked with a high level Terms of Reference (ToR) that would address legacy issues caused by lack of proper identity management system for the Nigerian Capital Market. It is also to facilitate data accuracy and ease of participation in the capital market",

          "text": "Cash-strapped banks borrowed N338.5billion from the Central Bank of Nigeria in January to bridge their funding gap, according to the banking data.\n\nFigures from the CBN\u2019s monthly report for January on \u2018Standing facilities window operation\u2019 showed that the banks continued to utilise the Standing Lending Facility and Deposit Lending Facility in the sector.\n\n\u201cActivities at the standing facility window during the period reflected improved banking system liquidity.\n\n\u201cTotal Standing Lending Facility contracted considerably by 52.4 per cent to N338.4bn from N711.54bn in December 2021, fallout of the improved banking system liquidity in the period.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the activity at the inter-bank call segment contributed to the significant decline in SLF.\n\n\u201cTransactions at the Standing Deposit Facility increased by 7.0 per cent to N246.21bn from N230.22bn in the preceding month, further buttressing liquidity condition in the market.\u201d\n\nThe Director, Corporate Communications, CBN, Mr Osita Nwanisobi, did not pick calls or respond to text messages seeking comments.\n\nAlso, banks officials declined comments on the development.\n\nHowever, industry expert and the Managing Director, Lancelot Ventures Limited, Adebayo Adeleke, said the public cannot go and deposit money or withdraw money from the CBN.\n\n\u201cThe CBN is the bank of last resort, it is the only one authorised to print naira. The only bank that should not run dry is CBN. They also control the banks by ensuring that the banks maintain some levels of deposits with CBN.\n\n\u201cThe CBN technically speaking is bankers\u2019 bank. All the banks bank with CBN, they deposit money and also bank with the CBN and that is why the CBN is able to control the influx of the naira into the economy, regulate the interest rates, increasing Monetary Policy Rate and others.\n\n\u201cSo they set the temple for the control of money. The CBN is the bankers\u2019 bank, the bank of the last resort and the bank of the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nThe Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Cowry Asset Management Limited, Mr Johnson Chukwu, said, \u201cThe banks borrow from the CBN to meet their funding gap. The SDR and SLR also move regularly. But remember that the banks also keep money in the Central Bank.\u201d\n\nA former President, Association of National Accountants of Nigeria, Dr Sam Nzekwe, said, \u201cThe banks have to take from the CBN because it is the bank of the last resort. CBN is also keeping part of their money which they cannot lend.\n\n\u201cThey borrow money from the CBN when they don\u2019t have where to borrow money from and they are short of cash. They borrow from the CBN and pay back.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the loans obtained by the information, communication and technology firms from banks rose from N952.06bn in January 2022 to N982.87bn in March 2022, according to data from the CBN.\n\nThe CBN sectoral analysis of credit report shows that the loans was N952.06bn in January, N973.51bn in February, and N982.87bn in March.\n\nThis increase occurred after a three month decline between November 2021 and January 2022.\n\nIn January, the Governor of the CBN, Godwin Emefiele, said the banking sector would increase access to finance and credit for households and businesses in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe policy focus of the bank for 2022 is with a pledge to sustain improved access to finance and credit for households and businesses, mobilise investment to boost domestic productivity, enable faster growth of non-oil exports, and support employment generating activities,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that the country had been able to contain some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy.\n\nHe stressed the need for all stakeholders to work to build a more resilient economy that would be better able to contain external shocks, while supporting growth and wealth creation in key sectors of our economy.",

The reason is that the chairmanship seat is not the same as that of the tussle for the Presidency of the country. You can\u2019t even compare the two of them.

          "text": "The former Minister of Aviation and the Senator representing Anambra North Senatorial District, Stella Oduah has directed the National Youth Service Corps ,NYSC, to retract the allegation that she did not complete her national service within 48 hours.\n\nIn the letter addressed to the Director General, National Youth Service Corps and titled, \u201c48 Hours Notice to Retract Your Statement as Contained in Your Letter Dated 24th May 2022 Ref No. NYSC/DHQ/PPRU/783/VOL 111\u201d, the Senator stated, \u201cOur attention has been called to your scandalous letter referenced above in which you acknowledged that Senator Stella Oduah was mobilized for youth service in 1982 and served in the Lagos orientation camp but then concluded that she \u201cabsconded\u201d and was not issued a certificate of discharge.\u201d\n\nThe letter, signed by Ezennia Nonso Chukwudebe, Director, Media/Publicity for Senator, Stella Oduah, described the allegation as reckless and stated, \u201cThat reckless statement which we consider grossly irresponsible no doubt suggests that it was procured from you for political considerations in favour of Sen. Oduah\u2019s political detractors. We are shocked that you condescended so low to make such false and unverified conclusions which is damaging to her character and image\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, Sen. Oduah\u2019s NYSC place of primary assignment was the popular Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA). When a similar allegation was made by her political contenders in 2017, NECA issued a letter dated 11th January 2017 Ref No: NECA/SELA/H4 confirming that she carried out her NYSC primary assignment with them. Find attached a copy of that letter for reference as well as a photograph of our client as a youth corper \u201c\n\n\u201cThat issue also attended litigation and she has a court judgment in her favour in the case of Chinedu Emmanuel Emeka v. Princess Stella Oduah , EPT/AWK/SEN/13/2019\u2033\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, one needs not be bothered about any other similar allegations in the light of the aforesaid judgment and the fact that NYSC is not a constitutional qualification to hold any public office in Nigeria, but your statement has to a large extent defamed her\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your exact words, \u2018after the orientation course, she absconded\u2019 It is curious how a person who had participated in all NYSC activities at the Orientation Camp can be said to have \u201cabsconded\u201d because she left for her place of primary assignment as it was routine. It is either you chose to ignore your record or your office has failed to keep proper records.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are by this letter given 48 hours to retract your statement failing which legal actions shall be commenced against you.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo reinforce the fact the distinguished Senator completed her NYSC, her picture where she was in her NYSC regalia was attached and a letter from NECA confirming that she served with the association.\n\n\u201cIn fact, NECA wrote a letter dated January 11, 2017 with Ref: NECA/SELA/H4, signed by the Director General, O. A. Oshinowo and stated, \u201cWe hereby confirm that you carried out your NYSC primary assignment with NECA in 1982 during the tenure of Mr. Gabriel Okogwa (now of blessed memory). Our investigation did reveal that you were diligent and steadfast in the place of your duty.\u201d",

          "text": "Ahead of the All Progressive Congress (APC) presidential primaries scheduled for Sunday, the party\u2019s leadership Wednesday said consensus arrangement on its choice candidate is not on the table for now.\n\nAPC National Chairman Senator Abdullah Adamu revealed this while speaking to some select journalists in Abuja.\n\nThe party leader, who reiterated his commitment to ensuring level\n\nEchoes of consensus\n\nThere have been some calls for consensus by some APC stakeholders to pick its presidential candidate.\n\nSpecifically, there were permutations by party faithful that the leadership at the national level would galvanise the 25 APC aspirants to forge a consensus in the same manner they did during their last national convention to elect party executives.\n\nFor instance, seven South-east presidential aspirants on the party\u2019s platform resolved last Sunday to support any aspirant from the region who gets the parties ticket for the 2023 general election.\n\nAlso, two presidential aspirants namely former Speaker House of Representatives Dimeji Bankole and former Minister of State for Education Emeka Nwajiuba also lent their voices for a consensus arrangement.\n\nOn the contrary, however, No Alternative To Tunubu 2023 (NATT2023) \u2013 a support group of APC national leader and presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, kicked against consensus arrangement, saying it put limits to several available choices.\n\nBut the APC consensus became necessary against the backdrop that the PDP, the major opposition party, had thrown its presidential race open to all the regions of the country.\n\nThe consensus if formed would help nip in the bud the rancorous and acrimonious situation likely to arise in the aftermath of the party primaries.\n\nParty\u2019s stand\n\nBut speaking in an interview Wednesday at the party\u2019s national secretariat, the APC national chairman, Senator Adamu, said \u201cthe party has its own rules and strategies, which I will not expose now. What I can say for now is, all the aspirants would be assessed to measure their competence during the primary.\u201d\n\nHe added that, \u201cit is normal that you can\u2019t stop many people from aspiring for a position, and it is ecstatic for us that they are aspiring for the position under the platform of our great party. We thank God, we also thank them. Aspiring for a political position is not an offense, but victory is the will of God. Everybody can contest, but you should know that, when God chooses the winner, those who are faithful to God, will succumb and even work for the final victor.\n\n\u201cSo, what I want to point out here is, even a mad man knows that twenty eight aspirants cannot be president at the same time. Only one will! Therefore, what we can do as the leaders of the party, is to be just to all of them. We know that we are not saints, we are not perfect, but we pray for God to help us do justice to everybody.\u201d\n\nWhen further pressed on whether at the party level, they would have any arrangement to produce a \u2018unity candidate\u2019 as it happened during election of party executives last March, 2022, he said: \u201cContesting for the position of a party chairman or any party executive position is not the same as the position of the president. The enthusiasm and desire to acquire the position of a party chairman is not as strong as that of a president\u2019s seat. It is incomparable!\u201d\n\nLawal halts consultation\n\nMeanwhile, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan has put off all his political engagements for Wednesday to mourn the farmers killed by the terrorists in Borno state Sunday.\n\nMore than 50 farmers were reportedly killed at the outskirts of Kala Balge local government area by terrorists suspected to be Boko Haram and ISWAP.\n\nLawan had already scheduled some engagements for Wednesday one of which was to meet with the APC leaders and delegates in Borno state.\n\nHe was also scheduled to proceed from Maiduguri to Gombe also to meet party leaders and particularly, the delegates to canvas support for his presidential bid ahead of the upcoming primaries but decided to put off all his political engagements for the day on account of the tragic incident and instead proceeded to Maiduguri only on a condolence visit.\n\nWhile in Maiduguri, the Senate President met with Governor Babagana Umara Zulum and the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai to commiserate with the government and people of Borno state.\n\nAt the Palace of Shehu of Borno, Lawan said: \u201cWe are in Maiduguri for a very solemn event. We had wanted to come to meet with the delegates in continuation of the campaign for the flag of our Party, the APC, for the Presidential race.\n\n\u201cBecause of the sad event that took place in Kala Balge where over 50 of our people were killed, we felt that it was only appropriate to come to Borno to condole with the Government and people of Borno state.\n\n\u201cWe pray that Almighty Allah will forgive their sins and Aljannah Firdaus be their final resting place.\u201d\n\nEarlier at the Borno state Government House, the Senate President told the Governor that all his political engagements for Wednesday had been put off in honour of the farmers who were killed by the terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore here to condole with you, the government and people of Borno state for this loss. This is a time for sympathy and empathy. This is not time for politics.\n\n\u201cSo we have come to condole with you and of course we have put off the political engagements in honour of our citizens who were killed by Boko Haram ISWAP.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, let me commend you for everything that you have been doing in Borno state and particularly your concern in ensuring that you continue to partner with the Federal government to fight the insurgency here and also ensure that all the IDPs are back into their communities.\u201d\n\nResponding, Governor Zulum thanked the Senate President and his entourage for the gesture.\n\nHe said Borno and Yobe, the home state of the Senate President were one and prayed that the existing relationship between the two states \u201cwill never be soured.\u201d\n\nObi dumps PDP\n\nAnd barely 72 hours to the PDP National Convention to elect its 2023 presidential candidate, an aspirant and former governor of Anambra state, Peter Obi has dumped the party.\n\nObi announced this in a letter addressed to the party\u2019s National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, dated 24th May 2022 titled \u201cResignation From Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Withdrawal From the Presidential Contest said his decision has been conveyed to the Chairman of Agulu Ward 2. Anaocha LGA Anambra since Friday 20 May 2022.\n\nThe letter obtained by Blueprint, Wednesday, signed by Obi partly read \u201cConsequently, I am by this letter informing you of my withdrawal for the PDP Presidential Primaries.\n\n\u201cIt has been a great honour to contribute to nation-building efforts through our party. Unfortunately, recent developments within our party make it practically impossible to continue participating and making such constructive contributions.\n\n\u201cOur national challenges are deep-seated and require that we each make profound sacrifices towards rescuing our country. My commitment to rescuing Nigeria remains firm, even if the route differs.\n\n\u201cI wish to thank you personally for your graciousness and leadership. I wish you well and best of luck in the service of country\u201d.\n\nAddressing journalists in Abuja, a former aide to ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo and Director-General Peter Obi Campaign Organisation, Dr Doyin Okupe, assured that the former governor\u2019s name would be on the 2023 ballot.\n\nHe said \u201d You recall that consistently, former governor Peter Obi has repeatedly stated that his not desperate to be President, but he is desperate to cause a change, to cause a redirection to change the way the government of Nigeria is being run.\n\n\u201cAnd to offer solutions to various problems of Nigeria, it is for these reasons he entered into the race. But the various development within the PDP makes it virtually impossible for him.\n\n\u201cThis is not to say that all hopes all lost. I can say on his behalf that Nigerians must not give up, we must never give up. Hope is on its way and help is coming\u201d.\n\nOn Obi\u2019s next line of action is, Okupke said: \u201cAll options are on the table. By the grace of Almighty God, Peter Obi will be on the ballot for the 2023 Presidency.\u201d\n\nBlueprint gathered that Obi may likely join the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) led by former Kano state governor, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso.\n\nSources in the former Anambra State governor\u2019s camp also hinted that he was considering Labour Party.\n\n\u201cNNPP would have been an option, but Kwankwaso is already a candidate, so LP is an option. He will announce soon.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "With less than a week to the presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abuja, top contenders are putting finishing touches to their strategies to emerge as the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nWith former Anambra state Governor Peter Obi pulling out of the party, fourteen party chieftains are now left in the race for the PDP presidential ticket.\n\nThey are former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Bauchi state Governor Bala Mohammed, Sokoto state Governor Aminu Tambuwal; former President of the Senate Bukola Saraki, erstwhile Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and former President of the Senate Anyim Pius Anyim; Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike and Akwa Ibom state Governor Udom Emmanuel.\n\nThe rest are former Ekiti state Governor Ayodele Fayose; celebrated publisher, Mr Dele Momodu; renowned banker and economist, Mr Mohammed Hayatu-Deen; ex-president of Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN), Mr Sam Ohuabunwa; Mr Charles Ugwu, Hon Chikwendu Kalu and Mr Tareila Diana.\n\nAs a demonstration of their readiness, some of the aspirants had traversed the length and breadth of the country soliciting support from party stakeholders, including the delegates.\n\nBut as things stand and the stakes getting higher, the contest, according to Blueprint\u2019s findings, may have been narrowed to Atiku, Bala Mohammed, Wike, Obi, Udom, Saraki and to some extent, Tambuwal.\n\nA quick look at the frontrunners shows four from the north and 3 from the south.\n\nWith the party\u2019s decision to jettison zoning for an open contest, it has become a straight contest between the north and the south.\n\nThe frontrunners, it was gathered, are now in the \u201cfinal push for endorsement by party delegates.\u201d\n\nHow they stand\n\nBut with the decision of an open contest by the party hierarchy, there are strong indications that the party\u2019s leadership is favourably disposed to having a candidate of northern extraction, particularly the North-east geopolitical zone, which throws up Atiku, Mohammed and Hayatu-Deen.\n\nA top party source said: \u201cThis position was informed by priority the party accords to winning the election over zoning.\u201d\n\nBefore now, four out of the five presidential aspirants from the North namely, Saraki, Tambuwal, Mohammed and Hayatu-Deen, had initially met and opted for consensus among themselves.\n\nThe quartet were moving from one part of the country to the other with a message of consensus on the front burner. .\n\nFormer VP Atiku was never part of the arrangement because of \u201chis political structure and financial muscle to pick the PDP ticket.\u201d\n\nThe effort yielded some results as Governor Mohammed and Saraki came top in a shadow poll conducted by the General Ibrahim Babangida-led Northern Elders, as joint northern presidential consensus aspirants. But the duo and Tambuwal and Hayatou-deen kicked.\n\nBauchi gov\n\nAnd notwithstanding the seeming disagreement, there are strong indications that certain odds appear to be favour of the Bauchi state governor and seen \u201cas being rightly positioned to cause an upset as his ambition has continued to gain traction ahead of the primary election.\u201d\n\nA top party source said: \u201cGovernor Mohammed is being considered by most PDP stakeholders on the basis of his education, experience in both the legislative and executive arms of government.\n\n\u201cBesides experience, acceptability is the most significant factor being considered by party stakeholders, who are insisting on Governor Mohammed\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cThe Bauchi State governor is well accepted by the various parts of the country, a factor which cannot be overlooked by the PDP we are serious about winning election.\u201d\n\nBlueprint further gathered that delegates were swayed by what they described as \u201cGovernor Mohammed\u2019s excellent performance during his visits to the states to engage stakeholders and prospective delegates in candid discussions over the state of the country.\n\n\u201cLoyalty to the party is also said to be another factor going for the Bauchi State governor. His financial support to keep the party afloat cannot be overemphasised.\u201d\n\nObi\n\nAnother aspirant who enjoyed a reasonable level of support was Obi, who recently dumped the party, owing to some \u201cirreconcilable differences.\u201d He is seeking to realise his ambition on a yet-to-be disclosed platform.\n\nTambuwal and Saraki\n\nFor the duo of Tambuwal and Saraki, both of whom have requisite legislative and executive experience, they are also in good stead to pick the ticket.\n\nBut a party chieftain said: \u201cYes, they have needed legislative experience, but the party cannot forget in a hurry their role in the event leading to the near breakup of the party in the build-up to the 2015 general elections.\n\n\u201cBesides, Governor Mohammed\u2019s legislative experience as senator combined with his stint as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), which gave him the opportunity of being a member of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), are, in no small way, a great edge over others.\u201d\n\nAtiku\n\nThe former VP is yet another strong contender for the office as he is considered an experienced politician with huge war chest.\n\n\u201cAtiku is a leader of the party and a respected one at that. But like Saraki and Tambuwal, he was , at different times, in and out of the party. Further to this, the age consideration is one thing the party leadership and its youth wing are looking at. Nigeria is yearning for young leadership to bail the nation out of the many woes presently facing the people.\u201d\n\nDespite all the seeming challenges, the trio of Atiku, Saraki and Tambuwal are upbeat as they continue to intensify consultations with major stakeholders.\n\nTambuwal\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Tambuwal has continued his consultation with an appeal to the 811 delegates to vote right and ensure their votes count.\n\nThe former Speaker House of Representatives said he has all that is required to tackle all the terrifying challenges in the country in all sectors.\n\nSpokesperson of the Tambuwal Presidential Campaign Organisation, Prince Daniel made the appeal Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nHe noted that the PDP required a candidate \u201cthat is indisputably fit, acceptable and someone with the right temperament.\u201d\n\nHe said the political trend took a new dimension recently with the overwhelming number of candidates vying for the presidential seat on the PDP and those of other political parties.\n\n\u201cHowever, while the large number of political gladiators in the presidential race may be unprecedented and could be overwhelming for delegates across the board, the wheat can be separated from the chaff by the assessment of their evidence-based track record and undefiled antecedent as well as the will power to act, he stated.\n\nThe campaign team said: \u201cWe are living witnesses to the daunting challenges facing our nation. It is needless to start mentioning them because Nigerians are wearing the shoe and they know where it pinches. Also, the solutions to these challenges are well known and some are even documented in blueprints of various Ministries, Departments and (MDAs) of government at all levels. The only missing link is the political will to act.\n\n\u201cAnother campaign cycle is upon us, the PDP, having lost two consecutive presidential elections in the last seven years, now has another opportunity to elect a qualified candidate who knows his onions to face the ruling party in the contest and deliver victory to the main opposition party, hence the popular choice of His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal.\n\n\u201cI plead with us to vote with nobility remembering that we have no other country than Nigeria and we are all in this ship together. The choice you make at the primaries will determine if the ship successfully sails to shore or sinks in the deep seas.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s fate is pinned on you to present a credible and detribalized candidate. We are counting on your patriotism to vote right and ensure your votes count.\n\n\u201cWith our aggravated challenges, bringing our country back from the brink is an economic, moral, political and social imperative. Nigeria is at a crossroads and needs to make effective decisions on its next political and governance steps and we believe that the Mutawallen Sokoto is capable to deliver,\u201d the team further stated.\n\nEkweremadu withdraws from primaries\n\nIn a related development, former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu, has withdrawn from the PDP governorship primaries.\n\nThe lawmaker announced his withdrawal Wednesday through the Director-General of Ikeoha Campaign Organisation (ICO) Charles Asogwa in a statement.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe wish to inform our supporters and Nigeria that the former deputy president of the senate and foremost governorship aspirant in Enugu State, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, will not be participating in the PDP governorship primary election scheduled for this Wednesday, May 25, 2022,\u201d Asogwa said.\n\nThe withdrawal was announced just few hours to Wednesday\u2019s governorship primaries of the party in the state.\n\nThe statement was however silent on reasons behind his withdrawal from the contest.\n\nHowever, Blueprint reports that the decision might not be unconnected with the friction between Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and the leadership of the state chapter of the PDP over the battle for the party\u2019s governorship ticket in the state.\n\nRecent alleged moves to dump PDP\n\nThe lawmaker reportedly met with the state leadership of All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) over a possible switch to the opposition party in the state.\n\nThe details of the meeting with APGA are still sketchy, but Premium Times gathered that the meeting ended in a stalemate as the both parties could not reach any agreement.\n\nAlso, earlier on Tuesday, indications emerged that Mr Ekweremadu might defect to the All Progressive Congress (APC) to contest the party\u2019s governorship ticket for the 2023 general elections.\n\nLate the same day, Ekweremadu was spotted at the campaign office of the chairman of Abuja chapter of the APC holding talks in what appeared to be a last-minute effort to join forces with the APC to unseat PDP in the 2023 general election in the state.\n\nAbaribe withdraws from Abia PDP guber primaries\n\nSimilarly, Senate Minority Leader Enyinnaya Abaribe also withdrew from the PDP governorship primaries in Abia state, less than 24 hours to the exercise.\n\nAbaribe disclosed this in a statement Tuesday.\n\nAbaribe regretted that his attempts to emancipate the state from what he termed \u201cthe drudgery of imposition and godfatherism\u201d have been frustrated by the selfish ambition of unnamed persons to maintain \u201cwicked governance\u201d in the state.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, I, Senator Enyinnaya Harcourt Abaribe, will not be part of this charade. I am therefore withdrawing from the exercise, which means that I will not be part of the PDP governorship election that holds in Abia State,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker explained that going ahead to participate in the primaries would amount to \u201cendorsement of an illegality that is already being challenged in the courts.\u201d\n\nThe senate minority leader, who described the implication of the party\u2019s position as grave, however, urged his supporters to be calm in the face of the development.\n\n\u201cI therefore, ask all our people, our teeming supporters and Ndigbo to remain calm, keep the faith and wait for the new direction, which will be announced soon,\u201d Abaribe added.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

the farmer\u2019s Anchor Borrower Programme that just witnessed first of its kind of rice pyramid a few months ago.\n\n\u201cWhen Godwin Emefiele assumed office as the 10th indigenous Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria on June 3, 2014, he promised to build a resilient financial system that can serve the growth and development needs of the Nigeria economy.\n\n\u201cToday, even the blind, deaf and dump can attest to the fact that the Apex Bank\u2019s policies and programmes have been so designed in such a way that jobs are being created and fostering inclusive growth.\n\n\u201cIn addition, to key macroeconomic concerns such as inflation and exchange rate stability in the country.\n\n\u201cHe has been able to mobilize the private sector and salvage the situation, despite the harsh financial state of the country, he also introduced several policies to support the poor; the farmer\u2019s Anchor Borrower Programme that just witnessed first of its kind of rice pyramid a few months ago.\n\n\u201cThrough his people based policies, Nigerians have been offered numerous interventions and support for Small Medium Enterprises, SMEs and others.\n\n\u201cAnd this has created support base for local companies to be competitive, and evidently, this support culminated in the commissioning of the Dangote Fertilizer Company, and these are aimed at supporting Nigerian farmers to produce more food and also create jobs.\n\n\u201cUnder his watch in CBN for the first time, he ensured diversification of the source of the economy from the oil sector to the non-oil sector.\n\n\u201cWe can go on and on about Emefiele\u2019s professional policy formulation that has been so all encompassing and not leaving any segment of Nigerians behind, but has carried Nigerians along with the policies and programmes of the CBN.\u201d\n\nHowever, the group in its address unanimously called on the Nigerian Policy Force to arrest those who have reported and spread fake news about the purported sack of the CBN Governor on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe condemn those who just woke up from their mischief to relay fake news about the alleged sack of the CBN Governor on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis is handiwork of some politicians who have nothing to offer because they have run out of steam and are only out to blackmail the CBN Governor with such sponsored fake news.\n\n\u201cWe want to call on the Nigerian Police Force, and other relevant security agencies to go after and arrest those who are behind this fake news, and should be dealt with accordingly because this is not good for the image of our revered Apex Bank\u201d, the group added.",

          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

We shall review this after two weeks, and if members of these unions continue to be involved in criminal activities, the government will have no choice but to either disband the Unions and/or ban them out rightly in the state.\u201d\n\nSee the full speech by Professor Solido below:\n\nBeing Press Statement by Professor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, CFR (Governor of Anambra State) at a News conference: Awka, Wednesday, 25th May 2022\n\nUmu nnem, Ndi Anambra!\n\nYou employed me to lead the process of building a livable and prosperous homeland. After swearing-in on the 17th March, 2022, I worked for 8 hours and 45 minutes that day and have kept working hard every day to make you proud. A lot is ongoing, and we will report to you in due course. However, we recognized from the first minute that restoring peace and security will be foundational to our larger agenda as a people. We devoted several paragraphs in our inaugural speech to underscore the grave security challenges we inherited (with the deadly criminal gangs largely in the occupation of 8 local governments). You may recall that I was attacked by so-called \u201cunknown gunmen\u201d while addressing youths at a rally in March 2021 leaving three policemen dead, and indeed hardly any candidate could campaign freely in the seven local governments of the south senatorial zone in 2021. I knew the grave situation and was determined to confront it. I met with the state security council for three and half hours on the first day and there was a consensus to deploy both kinetic and non-kinetic approaches.\n\nWhile the security agencies have been doing their best with limited resources, we are convinced that sustainable peace and security cannot be achieved without the cooperation and solidarity of the people. Consequently, we went to work to mobilize our people and address the wider socio-economic and legacy issues fueling agitations and insecurity.\n\nWe consulted and collaborated with the South East Joint Body of Bishops and traditional rulers; issuing joint statements, with the Joint body of bishops organizing prayers sessions in the entire South East on 4th April 2022, with the goal of ending the Sit-at-home and ensuring enduring peace and security in the southeast;\n\nWe organized Anambra Peace and Security Dialogue, with the leadership of the Christian denominations, town unions, traditional rulers, youth organizations, women, market, and transport unions, as well as political leaders and non-indigenes on XX with a Communique calling for an end to the Sit- at home\u2014and peace and security in the South East on 2nd April 2022;\n\nWe offered the Olive branch to all the armed youths in the forests to come out, surrender their guns and with the commitment that our government would help to retrain and empower them to contribute positively to our development. Our government has, in our proposed revised budget, provided handsomely for youth empowerment.\n\nThe official leadership of IPOB also repeatedly issued statements dissociating itself from the senseless and destructive Sit- at home on Mondays etc as well as the kidnappings and criminal actions of gangs in the state and the southeast;\n\nWe set up the Truth, Justice, and Peace Committee, with the goal of getting to the remote and immediate causes of the agitation and criminality, with a view to proffering systematic and lasting solutions;\n\nWe have severally again met with town union leaders and traditional rulers; landlords etc, all in the mobilization of the people for lasting peace and security;\n\nTrue to our commitment to engage with ALL state and non-state actors relevant to the search for lasting peace and security, we visited Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, and he reiterated that he never authorized the senseless Sit at Home, and absolved his organization, IPOB, from the crass criminality especially the barbaric enforcement of the Sit at home and the kidnappings and spilling of blood. Mazi Kanu expressed his willingness to personally address the press to charge his followers to keep the peace. Subsequently, his lawyer issued an official statement confirming this position and his associate also addressed the media in the same vein;\n\nWe have also had Town Hall meetings with Ndi Anambra in Lagos and Abuja, and our people are united in their condemnation of the criminality going on in the state and environs and demonstrated their commitment to join hands with us in solving it.\n\nThe list of the public engagements is long (with even a longer list of backroom plans and actions).\n\nDespite the above, the criminal gangs are unrelenting in their desperation to maintain their very lucrative criminal enterprise and expand their other agenda of domination. When the security agencies rooted them out of two of their numerous camps, their reprisals were to burn down the secretariats of two local governments and attack police stations, police and soldiers. Routinely they kidnap for ransom, rape, and murder their victims as well as burn houses and properties. They relish in shooting soft targets, including recently a poor woman frying akara in front of her house on a Monday.\n\nOver the past one week, Ndi Anambra and indeed the nation have been treated to the gory stories of the kidnapping and subsequent beheading of Hon Okechukwu Okoye (member of the State House of Assembly) and his aide, Cyril Chiegboka (both from my community, Isuofia) as well as the brutal murder Mrs Harirat Jubril from Adamawa state and her four children and three other northerners. Anambra people have been in shock. This is not who we are. Our deepest condolences are with the families of the various victims. We are working round the clock with the security agencies and the perpetrators must be brought to book.\n\nLet us be very clear. These criminals causing mayhem in Anambra, albeit of disparate groups and gangs, are Igbos (dominantly from other southeast states) whose real objective is lucrative criminality and foisting their idolatrous religion on the region. Unfortunately, every criminal gang (including cult groups) claims to be a \u201cliberation movement\u201d, making it difficult to differentiate between any genuine agitators from criminals. Unfortunately, also, criminals now dominate the space. Anambra is the prime target because that is the most lucrative location for kidnapping for ransom in the South East.\n\nWith their immense propaganda machine funded largely by their sponsors abroad, they have tried everything to indoctrinate the people with all kinds of false emotive narratives, and divert attention from their real objectives. They claim to be \u201cfighting for the people\u201d, and yet randomly kill the same people, destroying their livelihood, and stopping their children from going to school.\n\nWhat has agitation to do with kidnappings including the kidnapping of priests of God, invasion of churches, and tabernacles including desecration of the Alters of God? Why is it that everywhere they gather and in every camp they operate, there is a Deity/idol to which they routinely offer blood in sacrifice? From accounts of those kidnapped and later freed the stench of dead bodies in the camps to cry up to heaven. We see videos of them and their idol worship; we note their threats to priests and bishops, including threatening to take over some churches?\n\nThe truth is that this tiny minority (certainly far less than 0.1% of us), is bent upon challenging the foundation of the things that make us who we are:\n\nEnterprise: We are known for our enterprise but these people are bent on killing our businesses through the forceful Sit at home; kidnapping for ransom; forceful taxation of communities, businesses, and individuals; etc;\n\nChristianity: The people of the South East, especially Anambra, are predominantly Christians. But with this gang, idolatry is back with vengeance. They forcefully try to convert people, especially the young ones to idolatry by initiating them into cults, swearing oaths to their Deities, etc with the promise of invincibility. Consequently, these youths join them as members and informants.\n\nDesecration of our culture: Spilling of the blood of the innocent is considered an abomination by our culture and by our Christian religion. We understand that they kill and harvest human organs for rituals and human sacrifice in their so-called camps.\n\nWith their new religion of idolatry and deadly weapons which they use to kill at random, they have tried to create a culture of fear and silence. More recently, the people have begun to question their propaganda, motive and means and they know that they have lost the sympathy of the people.\n\nThat explains why they desperately tried to ignite a national inter-ethnic crisis by killing some innocent northerners who have lived peacefully in our state for decades to divert attention from their criminality and then seek to re-brand themselves as \u201cdefenders of the people\u201d. They have failed and will continue to fail. Millions of our people live in the North and other parts of Nigeria, and the Anambra people are known for their uncommon hospitality.\n\nIn most homes in Anambra, non-indigenes live happily as tenants or as landlords, pursuing their legitimate businesses and this won\u2019t change. We pride ourselves as the Light of the Nation, and Anambra will continue to be a land of opportunity for every Nigerian as well as non-Nigerians. We will continue to work hard with security agencies to ensure the security of life and property in our state.\n\nUmu nnem, Ndi Anambra!\n\nThe hour has come for us to step up our game, and take back our state. The tiny but vicious gangs that have invaded our state and terrorize us are mostly in eight local governments in Anambra and three neighboring local governments in Imo State. They are in our forests, communities, and houses owned by individuals. They don\u2019t come from the air, and hence are not \u201cunknown\u201d gunmen. They are known. You know them, but are either too scared to speak up or out of indifference. But for how long will you be silent while our people continue to be killed in the most cruel and barbaric manner?\n\nIt is because we have remained ambivalent, opting to sit on the fence rather than take a stand against an obvious evil, that has made a minor sore to fester so cancerously. The hour has now come, and we must rise up to take our destiny in our hands. Everyone, indeed, everyone has a role to play. While we continue to commit Anambra unto the hands of God, we as a people must rise up to clean and cleanse our land. The security agencies will continue to do their part, but we the people, must proclaim that Enough is Enough and demonstrate full ownership. Consequently, as complementary measures to the efforts of the security agencies, our government has decided on the following immediate steps:\n\nOnce again, we are releasing several telephone numbers for the public to report any criminality or suspicious conducts. These phone numbers are managed in my office (in strictest confidentiality). Call us, or text (SMS or WhatsApp), and we will respond expeditiously. The phone numbers are:\n\n09017280990\n\n07039896429\n\n09167514891\n\n09076237441\n\n09168041120\n\n08093175528\n\n08124153139\n\nIn addition to the N10 million cash reward we placed on those who gruesomely murdered Hon Okechukwu Okoye and his aide, we are also offering a cash reward of AT LEAST One Million (N1,000,000) to anyone who provides useful information leading to the arrest of any of the leaders or members of these criminal gangs including those who support them financially or in kind, and all those enforcing the illegal Sit-at-Home order, or anyone involved in the kidnapping, murder, and arson, or access to the camps where the criminals operate from. The bounty will depend upon the profile of the criminal: their leaders will attract higher amounts. Similar bounty will be paid to anyone who gives information about anyone or location where hard drugs (especially \u201cMkpulu mmili\u201d) are manufactured in the state. The State Government hereby assures any informant of confidentiality in this process and would not disclose your identities or contact.\n\nWith effect from tomorrow, Friday, 26th May, 2022, a 6pm to 6am curfew is hereby placed on motorcycles (okada), tricycles (keke), and shuttle buses in Aguata, Ihiala, Ekwusigo, Nnewi North, Nnewi South, Ogbaru, Orumba North and Orumba South Local Governments until further notice. Until further notice also, motorcycles, keke and shuttle buses are banned from operating in these local governments on Mondays until the Sit-at-Home completely stops. The youths of every community in the zone are hereby enjoined to assist the security agencies in the implementation of this policy and are mandated to seize any such motorcycle or tricycle on the spot. Local Vigilantes should report such motorcycles or tricycles (keke) immediately, and they will be confiscated by the government and the owner prosecuted. The Okada, Keke, and shuttle bus union leaders must take responsibility to report their members who are involved in criminal activities. We shall review this after two weeks, and if members of these unions continue to be involved in criminal activities, the government will have no choice but to either disband the Unions and/or ban them out rightly in the state.\n\nNo part of Anambra State (house, bush or forest) shall be used as camps for these criminals. Anyone with a gun in a camp is considered a criminal in Anambra State, and the government and people will work with security agencies to flush them out. The State Government shall pursuant to its powers under the Land Use Act revoke and acquire any land found to be harbouring these criminals, for public purpose. Henceforth, every community is required to provide information on any part of their land occupied by these criminals as camps. If the community fails to do so, the government will take over such land.\n\nAll communities are hereby charged to take over their communities completely and through the leadership of their Town Unions and Traditional Rulers give weekly security reports (submitted every Friday) to the State Government on the state of security in their communities. The cooperation of the youths in that regard is now imperative. I charge the vigilantes of each community to rise to the occasion and contend with these criminals in your locality whether they are in your bush or the houses in your community. The State Government expects the report of any progress made in this regard and shall support and reward you accordingly.\n\nAny buildings found to be harbouring these kidnappers and murderers who have laid siege on our State will, as provided by Criminal Code (Amendment No.3) Law 2013, be forfeited to the State Government. To that extent, all landlords are hereby directed to proceed with \u201cOperation Know Your Tenant\u201d by keeping appropriate records of their tenants and reporting anyone suspected of being involved in criminal activities. Each community leadership must keep a full register of all tenants in their communities, their occupation, etc and keep an eye on their activities. The State Government shall as an emergency measure, disband the leadership of any community which fails to report criminal activities in their communities or immediately respond to the requests contained in this address.\n\nAll market leaders and stakeholders are hereby charged to join the communities in taking back their territory and monitoring the activities in their markets. They are all required to return weekly security reports to the State Government.\n\nEverybody who either in person or through telephone calls demands cash support or ransom from anyone in furtherance of any criminal activities or groups should immediately be reported to the government via the telephone lines provided.\n\nAll transporters, i.e, bus drivers, shuttle drivers, tricycle (keke) and motorcycle (okada) riders must immediately report any suspicious passengers. Because it has come to the knowledge of the State Government that over 80% of transport operators use fake plate numbers and identities, all transport operators must henceforth re-register their vehicles, tricycles and motorcycles with their valid means of identification and their biometrics captured. This exercise shall immediately be commenced and anyone who defaults in doing that after four weeks from today would be treated as a suspect and adequate measures taken against him or her.\n\nAll hotels are directed to obtain the means of identification of their guests and keep an inventory of all guests in their hotels. The management of the hotels should immediately report any suspicious persons or group of persons checking into or converging in their hotels. Immediate sanctions would attend any dereliction in that regard, including possibly shutting down or demolition of such hotels.\n\nAll fuel stations are hereby directed to, within 4 weeks from today, place surveillance cameras in their stations and keep the records generated by those cameras in order to assist the State Government, when required, in tracking these criminals who inevitably fuel their vehicles at fuel stations.\n\nFinally, let me urge our people to remain calm. This season shall pass. The God of Anambra assures that we shall overcome the forces of darkness. Indeed, this tough beginning foretells of a more glorious future. We thank all the stakeholders in the Anambra project, and particularly thank the security agencies for their determination and sacrifice. We enjoin our religious leaders to continue to lift up the state in prayers and to also mobilize our people as they fight evil in our land. Together, we shall take back our state and make it the true Light of the Nation.\n\nGod bless you all,\n\nGod bless Anambra State,\n\nGod bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria",

          "text": "One of the presidential aspirants on the platform of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen says it is a miracle Nigeria is still standing.\n\nThe seasoned economist disclosed this on TVC News programme, Journalist Hangout.\n\nThe aspirant pointed out the reason for the drastic devaluation of naira in Nigeria, and he proposed some solutions that will be implemented if he is elected as Nigerian president.\n\nHe also emphasized that Nigeria needs a strong leader that knows his onions, and can harness the potential of Nigerians\n\n\u201cI think i am thoroughly groomed, i have the intellectual background, the corporate and career experience that has prepared me for over four decades to seek the office of the President, I went to very good schools and University and advanced programmes, I am a thorough bred Economist and beyond that i have had a long and distinguished corporate career that has enabled me to actually transform major institutions in this country and beyond that i have also served in and out of Government not as a permanent employee but as someone who has passion to provide service to Nigerians as a patriot. I have served as a member of three Presidential Advisory committees and i have also served in government in many other capacities. i have served in the Civic space as chairman of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group.\n\n\u201cI served as a member of the Vision 2010 committee and a s Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Buhari administration Transition Committee in 2015, i am very widely travelled within Nigeria and Outside the world, i have lived and worked in Lagos for a period of over 32 years, i have a pretty much cosmopolitan outlook.\n\n\u201cBoth within the country and outside the country and I believe that I am now properly groomed and ready to contest the highest position the land at a very critical moment in the nations\u2019 evolution, i believe i am the right person to face the pressures Nigeria currently faces.\u201d\n\nMr Hayatu-deen also stated that if elected President he would unite the country and tackle insecurity, which he says is caused by some part of the country feeling isolated.\n\nDuring the highlights of his plans, which borders largely on economy revitalization, he promised to stimulate production, encourage more exportation, in-house capital development, and agricultural reformation.\n\nI have a very deep knowledge about the problems facing us as a nation from all perspectives, what i will do is to create a governance infrastructure that will seek to completely reform the public service so that it can render effective service that will be able to deal with all the issues we currently face. I need to unite the country because the country is deeply divided not only a case of trust deficit between the government and the people but between all Nigerians, Nigerians are deeply divided and we need to bridge this and trust.\n\n\u201cI will ensure full accountability by all public servants and officials whether those are elected or technocrats within the government, we need very strong governance and accountability to make it work, we need to reform public institutions, the Judiciary and all Other enablers of Public Service.\n\nSpeaking from an economic perspective, Mr Mohammed said attention needs to be paid to a number of critical pillars in the economy, \u201cWe need to make Industries more sophisticated, revamping and expanding industrial output and also creating incentive for industry. Giving the Private sector the space to demonstrate its creativity and imagination. Remove the bottlenecks and all those things which stand in the way of industry and business. To improve the way in which government allows government to function, we will pay more attention to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, to provide them with financing and Business support.\u201d\n\nThe presidential hopeful stated further that adequate attention will be paid to Agriculture and Agri Business financing which will in turn help toll restore Nigeria\u2019s position to the time when Agriculture was actually booming and thriving in this country.\n\nHe highlights steps to be taken to include:\n\ni. Taking those steps that enables farmers to have access to all the things and tools that they need\n\nii To create an integrated rural economy whereby all of the components that is needed for rural people to actually function and produce goods and service and supply them to various markets are restored, and ensure that our farmers have all year round farming by using all of the water resources in this country and enable irrigation year in year out and to be export driven and create a value chain that will enable us to move from Agriculture to Agro-Allied industries through various value creation mechanisms.\n\nMr Mohammed said there is urgent need to create a digital Economy because it remains the frontier of the future by devising certain steps or mechanisms that will allow us to have a digital ecosystem in this country and be in tandem with what obtains across the world.\n\nSpeaking on tourism, the PDP Presidential aspirant said tourism remains the epicenter of the development of this country. He promised, if elected, to link Nigerians in the Diaspora so that there can have an integrated manner in which capital is moved into the country and also participate in the Micro Economy and ensure efficient use of talent.\n\nWhile speaking on social orientation, Mr Mohammed said Nigeria\u2019s value system have been degraded tremendously, He promised to create a platform where the government can re-orientate Nigerians about our culture, heritage, social and cultural institutions. Mr Mohammed said social reorientation is required as a bedrock of development. \u201cWe need to educate our children, our youth and to do those things that are required for women to thrive and become very active social and change agents aso that women of all ages are able to fulfil their dreams and shoot for the stars.\u201d\n\nOne of the major problems facing the country now is insecurity, This is a presidential hopeful on the platform of the People\u2019s Democratic Part, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, said he will upgrade the armed forces, skills acquisition, deployment of software and Drones for Intelligence, re-arming and retraining them for combat readiness.\n\nHe however said \u201cnone of all of these is actually important as empowering Nigerians Economically and Socially unless we able to deal with these issues, the level of insecurity will not change a lot, we will work to ensure that we are able to use diplomatic tools for our youth to realise that their is something to gain if you belong to the mainstream of the society and also lose if you are on the wrong side of the societal divide.\n\nEconomically, Mr Mohammed said the naira is a commodity and it is a function of demand and supply. \u201cWe first need to interrogate what the problems are, we do not have a balanced Macro Economic environment making it difficult to actually put in place a very competent Micro economic management system.\n\n\u201cOur Fiscal and Monetary policy imbalances are creating all other imbalances in the system, one is inflation, such as exchange rate, our economy noyt operating optimally and we have too many subsidies in the system.\n\n\u201cThe exchange rate and interest rate are subsidised because our current interest rate is 4% and who is actually taking this monies at that only few do.\n\n\u201cOur growth is subsidising our exchange and interest rate, a lot of the funds being raised to finance consumption not production, we need to move to have a unified exchange rate, multiple rates help to encourage round tripping and arbitrage into the system.\n\n\u201cWe need to create a condition for Macro economic stability and minimise subsidies, i do not personally agree that their should be petroleum subsidy because the people who are carting away the difference are not the hundred of millions of Nigerians who actually are not benefitting from it, it is the elites that are benefitting from it, i will create a series of palliatives to cushion the efect by spending the money on Education and Other social services.\n\n\u201cI will say all of our problems in the final analysis have their roots in an economy that is dysfunctional at this point, we need to rebuild our economy from the scratch, given sufficient oxygen and traction, policies that are well informed and managers at the level of the ministry of the ministries and parastatals who actually are well informed and have deep seated knowledge and experience and the right mix to fix a system that is broken and headed south rapidly. it is important to understand that the Public Sector does not alone make the society, the public, private and civic society all come to gather to create a situation where output are raised, they will form partnerships and alliances and do what is proper and reduce the tension to the barest minimum, have a predictable set of exchange and interest rates so that the real quality of life of the average Nigerian is enhanced and push back the frontiers of terrorism and restore Nigeria to what it was, we are a peace loving people.\n\n\u201cOur people have lost hope in the country and are disillusioned and they cannot see what they expect, safety, security and prosperity, what i want to offer the delegates is that the Nigerian people if am given the opportunity will go about this mission in a methodical and systematic manner so that Nigeria can return to the map as a Tiger and take our people to prosperity.\n\n\u201cThe reasons why we are where we are today is more of leadership, nothing is wrong with the Nigerian people, our people are enterprising. The issue is that we need a leadership that puts the people at the epicenter of everything they do. What I want to offer our delegates and the people is for them to think long and hard where we were 40 years ago, 15 years ago and where we are today and where we are headed, I cannot remember when all through my life when we have faced so much challenges like we have today. The primaries happening in the next three days is very critical for the delegates and the Nigerian electorate including the general election cycle, we need to think hard especially our unborn generation.\n\n\u201cWe need to get this right now before we fall into deeper trouble, there\u2019s no one whom you actually talk to today who will accept the current situation of our country. I offer them hope and optimism in place of fear and despair, I offer them action and vigorous action backed by a bundle of energy to take us to where we should be for this generation and others to come, my character and everything I stand for, I am placing on the line for Nigeria to get better.\n\nBut Mr Mohammed is not oblivious of the pandemic called corruption, So he highlights how he will tackle corruption differently from the present administration.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe fight against corruption will be vigorous, it is a cankerworm that has been there for decades, scarcity breeds corruption and elites are a problem. We breed and foster corruption because people like taking the shortcut to any situation. We like bending the rules. when people fleece money from the treasury at will, the accountant general of the federation is being investigated for carting away 83 billion Naira, this is nauseating that is the FAAC for Oyo state for 2 years and for Edo, 2 and half years. I hope it is not true and he will prove himself innocent. We hear these stories from time to time, Under my government Law and Order will be given teeth to sanction people for abuses under my government. I intend to deal with this problem by revamping and retooling the public service and I cannot even be thinking that my ministers and public servants will deal alone with this problem without ensuring that we are able to reinvent and innovate the entire public service delivery mechanisms because those are the set of vehicles required to actually deliver public service to the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cWhat is important to me is the revamping of the public service, i know the public servants enough to be there champion and the second thing is to carry out major reforms within our national security architecture to reposition them for the demands of the 21st century by declaring a state of emergency doing the kind of thing we did during the Vision 2010 programme in 1996 where we got 210 people together for a period of 1 year representing all the various stakeholders in this country, that blueprint is a document for all time, it is a blueprint to figure out what is wrong with Nigeria and see how we can make things better for a period of 15 years.\n\n\u201cThe work done for Muhammadu Buhari during his transition under the chairmanship of Alhaji Ahamd Joda where I served a the chairman of the Finance committee will also be a very useful document.\n\n\u201cWe need to stop these cycle of boom and bust by relying oin commodities for our foreign earnings, we need to diversify our revenue base by looking more closely into agriculture by developing the value chain, all is what we need to do, we are a very rich, their is no reason why we cannot develop into a powerhouse of African industry, Mr Mohammed said.",

It was held at the Lekan Salami Sports Complex (Tennis Courts Pavillion).\n\nTrouble started after the reporter in company of other colleagues were returning to the venue after they had gone to monitor situation from the main venue.\n\nOn approaching the entrance gate, the reporters were again asked to identify themselves to which they complied.\n\nThe reporters were asked to stay by the side on the allegation that there were too many journalists covering the event.\n\nAfter staying aside, the security operatives were however overpowered by many of the delegates at the entrance due to their delay.\n\nNoticing that The Nation reporter had gained entrance, the visibly enraged officer pounced on Adeniran, ordering other officers to \u2018throw\u2019 him out.\n\nAfter about five officers, armed with riffles attacked the reporter who was only armed with a jotter and phone, they succeeded in man-handling and tearing his shirt.\n\nNot done, the officer, Niyi went back to collect tear gas can from one of his colleagues and sprayed it directly into the eyes, nose and mouth of The Nation reporter after he had been thrown out of the venue.\n\nThe quick intervention of other colleagues including the Oyo NUJ Chairman; chairman of the State Correspondents\u2019 Chapel, Oluseye Ojo, leadership and members of the Oyo State Government House Press Crew saved the situation from becoming a full blown crisis.\n\nWith the development, the journalists at the event threatened a boycott but were impressed upon by some government functionaries.",

          "text": "The world\u2019s food crisis could last until 2024 unless safe corridors are created to move Ukrainian food stocks currently blockaded by Russia, Director General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has warned.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on policy outlook for trade and food at the on-going World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, she explained: \u201cThe food crisis, if we don\u2019t get these safe corridors out, is going to last another year or two, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres was engaged with the issue.\n\n\u201cHe formed a crisis group composed of key UN agencies and related agencies. WTO is part of it, to look at the food, energy and finance aspects of the crisis.\n\n\u201cOne issue is the creation of safe corridors and looking at alternative means to evacuate Ukrainian grain. Rail could take one or two million tonnes, but it\u2019s very difficult so we really need the Black Sea.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that some work is going behind (the scenes) to see if we can get a solution. So the secretary general is involved,\u201d the WTO DG stressed.\n\nTrade, she pointed out, was part of the solutions to the simultaneous crises gripping the world, adding that the world faces the security crisis, the pandemic, the climate crisis, food crisis, all at same time.\n\n\u201cThey have one thing in common \u2014 one country can\u2019t solve them, needs multinational approach,\u201d she further said.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala explained that the WTO recently revised down its projections for trade growth this year from 4.7 per cent to three per cent.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of uncertainties \u2013 many on the downside. There are lots of downside risks. If you don\u2019t have trade, you can\u2019t move food to where it is needed, she pointed out.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer has announced that it would supply all its current and future patent-protected medicines and vaccines on a not-for-profit basis to 45 lower-income countries, saying it was talking to other big drug-makers about similar steps.\n\nAnnouncing an \u201caccord for a healthier world\u201d at the WEF annual meeting in Davos, the New York-based pharma firm pledged to provide all its products that are available in the US and Europe on a cost basis to 1.2 billion people in all 27 low-income countries such as Afghanistan and Ethiopia, plus 18 lower-middle-income countries including Ghana.\n\nPfizer had previously been accused of, \u201cpandemic profiteering\u201d over the huge profits it has generated from coronavirus-related medicines over the past two years. It made almost $15 billion in sales in only three months from the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with Germany\u2019s BioNTech and its new Covid pill for people who are at high risk of severe disease.\n\n\u201cWe are living in a time where science is increasingly demonstrating the ability to take on the world\u2019s most devastating diseases,\u201d Albert Bourla, Pfizer\u2019s chief executive, said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there exists a tremendous health equity gap in our world that determines which of us can use these innovations and which of us cannot.\u201d\n\nHe told the WEF gathering in Switzerland: \u201cI\u2019m certain that the other pharmaceutical companies will follow. I\u2019ve spoken to several of the CEOs and they want to be part of it.\n\n\u201cSo medicines will be available I hope but it\u2019s not going to be enough. We need to also work on the ground for diagnosis, treatments, and for that we need the help of WHO, Doctors without Borders and many other organisations.\u201d\n\nJayasree Iyer, the chief executive of the Netherlands-based independent group Access to Medicine Foundation, said: \u201cBased on our research, Pfizer\u2019s commitment covers the right products by looking across the entire portfolio of patented products, the right countries by focusing on the poorest countries and the right partnerships by working with governments and international health organisations.\n\n\u201cBut we need to see how it pans out; the commitment needs to move us forward, from vaccine to vaccination, from medicine to treatment.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Davos on Wednesday, a nurse from Liberia, George Poe Williams, staged a, \u201cclap for pharma profits\u201d in protest at the profits made by drugmakers, some of which, including Pfizer, refuse to waive patents on Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nWilliams said: \u201cIf I wanted to earn what Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla made last year, I would have to work every single day until 6100 AD. But what makes me really furious is that Bourla and many of his billionaire buddies here at WEF are doing all they can to block our demands for a patent waiver \u2013 just so they can make even more money.\u201d\n\nUnder its new initiative, Pfizer is working closely with healthcare officials in Rwanda, Ghana, Malawi, Senegal and Uganda to provide expertise to support diagnosis, education and training of doctors and nurses and improvements to infrastructure to ensure all medicines and vaccines can reach those in need.\n\nPfizer is working with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop new products such as vaccines to prevent the deadly Group B streptococcus, and for respiratory syncytial virus, which can be serious for children and older people.\n\nAlso on the panel, Bill Gates said: \u201cThis type of accord is a very good model, it\u2019s going to get medicines out \u2026 Global health equity has made progress; we saw with Covid, we\u2019re not there.\u201d",

          "title": "No Decision on Zoning Till After Screening of APC Presidential Hopefuls, Says Party Chairman Adamu",
          "text": "The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, on Wednesday, said that the ruling party would take decision on zoning after all the presidential aspirants had been screened.\n\nIn an interview with select Hausa Service media organisations, Adamu also said the presidential aspirants would be scrutinised in accordance with the party\u2019s guidelines for the 2023 elections\n\nThe guidelines of the party provides three ways of choosing the party\u2019s candidate for an election, which include direct, indirect and consensus.\n\nBaring his mind on the zoning arrangement, Adamu said no decision would be taken until the aspirants were screened.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe have not produced our candidate for the presidency yet. We have to screen the aspirants to know the way forward. We have aspirants from across the country in the race. We will take the decision when we get there.\u201d\n\nOn likely consensus arrangement, Adamu noted that party members could not be denied the right to contest for president.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop our party stalwart from contesting elections or aspiring for the presidency. It is their right and we are happy for them. There is nothing wrong for anybody aspiring for the exalted seat of the presidency. It is God that decides who gets what. Once God makes up His mind and says this is who He wants, that is what we are praying for.\n\n\u201cWe have 28 aspirants for the presidential ticket and everybody knows that all of them cannot get the ticket. If it\u2019s God\u2019s wish, they all can even be president of the country one after the other. Our goal is to ensure justice in the choice of who emerges as the candidate of the party. That does not mean we are perfect. But we pray we do the right thing,\u201d he stated.\n\nAsked if the party was considering adopting the type of consensus arrangement that produced him as the chairman of the party, Adamu said the chairmanship position was not the same as the position of the president.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere is no truth in what you said. Reason is that the chairmanship seat is not the same as that of the tussle for the presidency of the country. You can\u2019t even compare the two of them. That question does not arise.\n\n\u201cHowever, the party has laid down its rules and regulations for the aspirants. We would scrutinize all of them based on our guidelines to be sure we pick the right candidate for the party.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if having such a high number of aspirants was not a subtle ploy to extend President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tenure, Adamu said such insinuation was also not true, because the president sought no extension of tenure.\n\nHe said, \u201cI can only say God will deal with those behind such insinuations. President Buhari had since 2019 declared that he would not seek tenure extension. He told everybody and swore with the Qur\u2019an that he would not breach constitutional provision on his two terms tenure.\n\n\u201cThe issue does not even arise. The president while performing the lesser hajj reiterated this position. If there is truth in such talks, none of the aspirants would have procured expression of interest form.\u201d\n\nOn the allegations that aspirants were sharing money to delegates, Adamu said he had no evidence to that effect.\n\n\u201cFor now, no law is against aspirants talking campaign to delegates. I don\u2019t have evidence that aspirants are sharing money to delegates. For me, it\u2019s the delegates that are selling their conscience, which is not proper. Our delegates should know that anybody sharing money to them can\u2019t be the right candidate for the party. He doesn\u2019t mean well for the country. I don\u2019t have a solution for the problem.\u201d\n\nWith 145 governorship aspirants and 25 presidential aspirants, Adamu noted that the reason was because APC was the government in power and those that matter in the country were in the party.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know the reason, it\u2019s because that is where those that matter in the country are. It didn\u2019t start today. We are the government in power today. In spite of all the insults, the APC has the advantages far ahead of the other parties. A sign of a powerful man is the one that is full blooded and fat.\n\n\u201cToday, the APC is the biggest party in Nigeria. It\u2019s natural that the APC will attract more Nigerians than any other party. This is where it is happening. Any right thinking politician would naturally gravitate towards the APC. Of course, we have our problems, but today we are the cynosure of all Nigerians and I am hopeful, God-willing, we will retain power at the general election.\u201d",
