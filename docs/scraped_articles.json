          "title": "Refrain from violent campaigns, Oyetola warns challengers",
          "text": "Ahead of the Osun State governorship election, the state Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, has warned his challengers and opposition political parties in the state to desist from violent campaigns that could disrupt the peace being enjoyed across Osun.\n\nHe warned members of the opposition parties to be cautious, saying campaign and election are not about violence.\n\nThe governor sounded the warning while addressing All Progressives Congress loyalists at the St. Thomas, Otan-Ayegbaju, in Boluwaduro Local Government Area of Osun.\n\nThis was contained in statement issued on Saturday by the Chief Press Secretary the the governor, Ismail Omipidan, titled, \u2018You deserve second term, Osun monarchs tell Oyetola\u2019.\n\nOyetola who expressed surprise at the attack on the members of the press and loyalists of the party shortly after his campaign at Gbongan, said it was unfortunate that the opposition had resulted to violence.\n\nHe appealed to the members of the party not to panic just as he called on the security operatives to go after the perpetrators and bring them to justice.\n\n\u201cI am surprised at the attack that occurred shortly after I left the venue of the campaign. I am appealing to the people to remain calm and unperturbed as we are doing everything possible to maintain peace and order.\n\n\u201cWe have charged the security agencies to go after the perpetrators. Osun is known for peace and we will continue to maintain that status no matter what.\n\n\u201cViolence will not help any one or take anyone anywhere. I have been tested and trusted. We are sure of victory, and in a free and fair contest, I will win by the grace of God\u201d, Oyetola added.\n\nMeanwhile, the traditional rulers in Boluwaduro LGA have reaffirmed their support for Oyetola, saying they would do all within their powers to get him re-elected.\n\nThe traditional rulers led by the Owa of Otan-Ayegbaju, Oba Lukman Fadipe and the Oluresi of Iresi, Oba Sikiru Adeseun, said the modest achievements of the governor had earned him second term, insisting that any attempt for the state to decide otherwise would be suicidal to the future of Osun.\n\nAccording to him, the governor maintained that his campaign strategy would continue to be issue based and development driven so as to consolidate on the gains recorded so far and set the State to the path of socioeconomic rejuvenation.\n\nSpeaking in his palace before other traditional rulers, Oba Fadipe, said the indelible imprints of the governor would speak for his re-election becase, according to him, Oyetola has performed creditably well to transform the State.\n\nWhile describing the administration of Oyetola as unprecedented, the monarch said he has been tested and trusted and is therefore qualified for a second term so that he can take the State to enviable heights.\n\nHe said, \u201cPlease continue with your good works. We are satisfied with what God has made you to do within three and a half years. You have convinced us beyond reasonable doubt and done so much beyond expectations.\n\n\u201cYour style of governance is unique. You have been running an all-inclusive and people-oriented governance.\n\n\u201cYou are a calm, cool, collected and calculative man who has been silently achieving great things and squeezing water out of solid rocks.\n\n\u201cWe know what is accruable to the state in terms of resources but despite this obvious reality, your government has not disappointed us or left anyone in doubt of your capacity to achieve great with little.\n\n\u201cYou have proved that it is only an empty barrel that makes noise. Your campaign slogan is speaking for you already. That is why your achievement knows no bounds.\n\n\u201cAs traditional rulers, we are good assessors. We have assessed your achievements and we are satisfied with all you have done.\n\n\u201cWe have seen integrity personified in you. We have seen Omoluabi ethos par excellence in you, and your calmness and integrity have endeared you to many.\n\n\u201cI am appealing to you all to support him wholeheartedly because he deserves to be re-elected.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "A presidential aspirant under the umbrella of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Mohammed Hayatu-Deen has stepped down from the race, describing the primary election contest as \u201cobscenely monetised\u201d.\n\nHe announced his withdrawal in a letter addressed to the PDP National Chairman Iyorchia Ayo, the day the main opposition party is holding its presidential primary election.\n\n\u201cI have been a keen observer of Nigerian politics for so many decades, but have not been opportuned to actively participate in party politics due to my engagements in managing critical public and private institutions, among others,\u201d he said in the letter dated May 27th.\n\n\u201cI have observed with great concern and sorrow the recent rapid deterioration of all aspects of our national life \u2013 characterised by increasing poverty, religious intolerance, banditry and kidnapping, monumental oil theft, corruption, mismanagement of national assets, communal and religious strifes and near collapse of public services and public institutions.\n\n\u201cDuring my recent nationwide trips, I came face to face with angry and hungry youths, children, boys, and girls abandoned by their states who ought to provide them with education and vocational training. These had become the recruiting grounds of criminals, religious and political extremists.\u201d\n\nThe former managing director of the now-defunct FSB International Bank reiterated his decision to join the presidential race, saying he \u201cplanned to make Nigeria the continental economic powerhouse\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, one of his dreams is to end insurgency in the country and also halt the \u201cincessant closure of our universities and other public institutions due to strikes\u201d.\n\n\u201cI wish to reiterate that I did not join party politics and to contest for the presidency because of personal gains and inordinate ambition, but in order to serve our country,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore based on personal principles and with great humility that I have decided after wide consultations to withdraw from this contest which has been obscenely monetized.\u201d\n\n\u2018Shifting The Goalpost\u2019\n\nHe thanked his supporters and well-wishers for believing in his dreams and pledged, however, to work for the party.\n\n\u201cFinally, as a very loyal party member and believer in the democratic process, I will continue to avail myself and my teeming supporters at all times to ensure the victory of our great party,\u201d Hayatu-Deen added.\n\nHis withdrawal is the latest twist in the PDP presidential primary contest. Earlier in the week, a former Governor of Anambra State Peter Obi had defected from the party and days later, joined the Labour Party.\n\nHayatu-Deen\u2019s decision came hours after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) extended the deadline for the conduct of presidential primaries. Following the move, the All Progressives Congress (APC) fixed a new date for the party\u2019s presidential primary poll.\n\nBut the PDP, Nigeria\u2019s main opposition party, lambasted the electoral body for the decision, saying it amounted to changing the goalpost in the middle of a game.\n\n\u201cThe consequences will be grave for the country. And of course, we have to look at that,\u201d PDP spokesperson Mr. Debo Ologunagba said at the Velodrome of the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, the venue of the PDP primary poll\n\n\u201cThe bedrock of democracy is certainty of elections and the fact that the rules are clear to every participant, and you cannot shift the goalpost in the middle of the game.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), may soon be engulfed in serious crisis barely two months after the composition, following the petition from a member of of National Working Committee (NWC), Salihu Moh Lukman, complaining about perceived sundry issues going wrong within the ruling party.\n\nIn the petition Lukman sent to the party\u2019s National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the National Vice Chairman (Northwest) complained that the new national leadership is gradually losing grip of the party.\n\nHe hinged his petition on the continued inaccessibility of the National Chairman, lamenting the shabby treatment melted on the party\u2019s presidential aspirants of the party.\n\nLukman specifically emphasised that part of the challenge facing the NWC is the casual manner, \u201cit has been handling very critical responsibilities of managing affairs of the party.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the casual manners NWC has handled sensitive issues, Lumkman frowned at the constant involvement and peddling of the name of President Muhammadu Buhari over certain issues.\n\n\u201cThe case of appointing Screening, Primary and Convention Committees is a good example. Again, although with your prompting, a committee was set up under the leadership of Deputy National Chairman (North). Sen. Abubakar Kyari, with the task of managing all the processes, eventually the committee was unable to discharge its function.\n\n\u201cPartly because of that, for instance, although the National Convention to elect the party\u2019s Presidential Candidate is scheduled for May 29 and 30, less than 48 hours, we are yet to have a Convention Committee in place. In fact, the presidential aspirants are yet to be screened.\n\n\u201cThe official explanation is that you are awaiting final consultation with President Buhari. At the risk of sounding agitated, this is unfair to President Buhari because to the best of my understanding it is an attempt to use the President\u2019s name to give excuses for failure, if it happens, which should not be the case.\n\n\u201cAs NWC and as our leader being the National Chairman, I want to appeal to you on the need for new initiatives in managing the party. At the rate we are going, we are walking back to the old spot of over centralised implementation of party decisions around the National Chairman.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, critical challenges of managing important tasks such as organising National Convention to produce Presidential Candidate of the party is being handled informally. This should not be so, and everything must be done to correct that,\u201d he warned.\n\nHe said that apart from the unnecessary delay in implementing certain decisions concerning reformation of the secretariat staff and welfare of the members of the NWC, the chairman should develop \u201cgood relationships with individual members of the NWC to accommodate our individual perspectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinally, the issue of conditions of party leaders, including the NWC members is completely left unattended. The official excuse is that you requested a budget. Consequently, two months now in office no decision has been taken to pay members of the NWC.\n\n\u201cThe specific details of entitlements of NWC members are being reduced to speculations. This is very unhealthy and should be corrected. Partly. this is giving legitimacy for many unethical practices, which would appear to be influencing the conducts of some members of the NWC,\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, I wanted to meet you to discuss these matters. Unfortunately, it has proved difficult, and I feel very strongly about these matters. It is my hope that you will be able to prioritize developing good relationships with individual members of the NWC to accommodate our individual perspectives in handling the task of rebuilding our party, APC. I am confident that Your Excellency will be able to provide the needed leadership to rebuild our party, APC,\u201d he noted.\n\nComplaining further, the former Director-General Progressive Governors Forum wrote: \u201cPerhaps, it is important to acknowledge that, as National Chairman, you have raised the expectations of many of us in the NWC, and by extension many party leaders. For instance, the whole idea of setting up a transition committee, which took stock of what we have inherited was your singular initiative.\n\n\u201cThe report of the committee was to say the least very shocking. Apart from the fact that there were more than 200 employees in the party\u2019s National Secretariat, most of whom without valid letters of employment, there were no standardized conditions of service. Statutory requirements for taxations, pensions and insurance benefits as provided by relevant labour laws are not being respected. There were claims by legal firms about liability owed for legal cases handled without valid contracts.\n\n\u201cAll these were partly responsible for why many of the party\u2019s bank accounts were blocked by subsisting court judgements, most of which copies are not available at the National Secretariat, which with your guidance the party\u2019s Legal Department is able to resolve.\n\n\u201cPartly based on your recommendations and insistence, to reform the Secretariat, the NWC decided to send all the Directors on leave pending the outcome of our investigation. It is clear to every discerning member of the NWC that many of the Directors, f not all, would have to go. it is also clear that. apart from the Directors, there are many workers in the Secretariat that should go,\u201d he warned.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Click Here For Details .\n\nPDP: How delegates will vote\n\nEnugu: Wike tops, others follow\n\nEnugu being a PDP state, it is expected that the leader of the party and governor, as usual in such cases will direct how the PDP delegates vote. If the body language of Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi should be taken seriously, then it might be safe to say that the Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike will carry Enugu State\u2019s votes. Observers say Gov. Ugwuanyi has not identified with any other aspirant, than Wike.\n\nWith Peter Obi out of the race, having pulled of of the PDP, it appears to be Wike\u201d\u2019s game. However, the Ike Ekweremadu factor cannot be ruled out. Since the former Deputy Senate President is not working with Ugwuanyi, having lost out in the governorship primary, it is expected that Bukola Saraki stands a chance in Enugu. It was Saraki that supported Ekweremadu to be Deputy Senate President in 2015, even when APC senators dominated the Assembly. Now is pay back time. It is expected that delegates sympathetic to Ekweremadu will support Saraki. Anyim cannot also be written off.\n\nBarring unforeseen circumstances, however, Wike may get more votes than others in Enugu.\n\nImo: It\u2019s dicey\n\nIn Imo State, it is going to be a tough decision for the delegates of the PDP to make. If he had not dumped the PDP, former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi might have won more votes than the other aspirants. Abubakar Saraki, Governors Nyesom Wike and Aminu Tambuwal as well as former Vice President Atiku Abubakar will share the votes.\n\nKwara: Saraki all the way\n\nHere, the home-zone advantage for Saraki is 100 per cent. It\u2019s a no contest state. So other PDP candidates should not expect much from here.\n\nOyo: Delegates expected to follow Makinde\n\nThe sitting governor, Seyi Makinde, according to investigation, will really influence the presidential aspirant that all the 33 delegates from the state will queue behind. It is one delegate per each of the 33 local government areas of the state. Makinde is close to Wike and Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom.\n\nAkwa Ibom: It\u2019s Emmanuel 100%\n\nThe state governor, Udom Emmanuel will gather 31 votes from the delegates. Only Mr. Peter Obi and the former vice president, Atiku Abubakar went there to consult the party\u2019s delegates. However, each of the delegates would not have a mind of their own, but do the bidding of the governor to either vote for him or whom he would align with.\n\nNiger: It\u2019s Atiku, Saraki and Bala Mohammed\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar is expected to garner most of the votes, even though about eight aspirants visited the 98 delegates. Saraki and Bala Mohammed are also visible here.\n\nRivers: it\u2019s Wike\u2019s turf\n\nThe state governor, Nyesom Wike and presidential aspirant will ride on the party\u2019s one family and loyalty. The party in Rivers State has remained a unified body and with the governor\u2019s grip of the party\u2019s structure, there is no doubt he would get bulk vote.\n\nKebbi: Delegates undecided\n\nDelegates voting patterns will be the decision of leaders of the party. Atiku and Saraki might get most of the votes here.\n\nKogi: Saraki, Atiku on top\n\nAbout 80 per cent of the delegates votes will be shared between Saraki and Atiku.\n\nEbonyi: It\u2019s Anyim all the way\n\nThis is the state of the former Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim. Delegates have also pledged to vote for him during the convention.\n\nOgun: Atiku, Saraki to slug it out\n\nThe Ogun State chapter of PDP is still enmeshed in intra-party squabbles. The reconciliation of the late Senator Buruji Kashamu and Ladi Adebutu factions seems to be just a window dressing. As at present, the party has two factional candidates in almost every elective position, with each faction claiming legitimacy.\n\nHowever, the state delegates loyal to Adebutu may likely go for Atiku Abubakar, while the second faction may prefer former Senate President, Bukola Saraki.\n\nPlateau: Ex-Gov Jang to influence votes\n\nIn Plateau State, Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike because of his affiliation with the party leader and former governor, Jonah David Jang, and his support to the PDP in Plateau State, might make strong show here. However, some of the party faithful are working round the delegates to woo support for Atiku, Saraki and Bala Mohammed.\n\nAbia: Wike expected to take majority, Anyim follows\n\nAbia State governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu is rooting for his Rivers counterpart. And Wike is expected to get majority of the delegates\u2019 votes, especially since Peter Obi is no longer in contention. Anyim, being the other major South East candidate, hopes to get something.\n\nKano: Northern elders to decide\n\nThere are various litigations in the court between the Aminu Wali faction and the Shagagi led state executive. This situation has left a trail of confusion in the party. It\u2019s impossible to know for sure where the pendulum will swing. A very credible source told Saturday Sun that a lot would depend on the choice of the Northern Elders, stressing that Northern delegates have always been well guided about who to vote for on occasions like this, which has huge implications on who governs Nigeria and in the interests of the North. Saraki and Bala Mohammed are northern consensus aspirants, selected nu Northern Elders.\n\nNasarawa: It\u2019s Saraki, Wike and Atiku\n\nIt is crystal clear that the votes of delegates from the Nasarawa State could be shared among Saraki, Atiku and Wike, with the former Senate president having an upper hand because it is his zone; that is the North Central.\n\nSaraki, once the chairman of National Reconciliation and Strategy Committee (NRSC), played a major role in fostering unity and cohesion in the state chapter of the party. This could be an avenue to repay his good gesture at the convention.\n\nThe former Senate president also enjoys the support of some critical stakeholders of the party like Senator Suleiman Adokwe, Senator Phillip Gyunka and Senator Solomon Ewuga; all would help in gathering delegates votes for him.\n\nMeanwhile in the last few months, Governor Wike had also made tremendous efforts in swinging delegates through his close associate, Hon. David Ombugadu, while Atiku hopes for a surprise.\n\nOndo: Atiku, Saraki, Wike ahead\n\nThe cold war between the former governor of the state, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko and the governorship candidate of the party in the last election, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede is one major factor affecting the choice of presidential aspirants. To this end, the state chapter of the party may have their votes divided, as loyalists of Mimiko and Jegede who make the list of delegates will vote for the preferred choice of their leaders. It was said that Jegede was supporting former Vice -President,Atiku Abubakar, while Mimiko is supporting Governor Wike. Saraki is banking on his goodwill.\n\nDelta: Saraki is on ground\n\nIn the last couple of weeks, the Delta State Government House, Asaba, has become a political Mecca of sorts, playing host to an array of presidential aspirants on the platform of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP). But Dr. Bukola Saraki seems to be the leading presidential aspirant among ad-hoc delegates of the PDP in state. Besides, Okowa\u2019s secret ambition to run as vice president to a northern candidate appears to have found more favour with the Saraki candidacy. Although, other aspirants might get a share of the delegates\u2019 votes from Delta, their score would be insignificant to swing the pendulum. However, for Atiku, it is believed that his relationship with former governor, James Ibori, would swing a surprise, but most delegates appear not to be too comfortable with his age.\n\nBenue: Aspirants might share votes\n\nThe relationship between the state governor, Samuel Ortom and the Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, as well as that between former governor, Gabriel Suswam and Akwa Ibom governor, Emmanuel Udom, will determine the voting pattern. Also, Ortom said a lot of good things about Saraki when the former Senate President met Benue delegates.\n\nOsun: It\u2019s Saraki, Atiku\n\nThe two factions of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have agreed to share the slots of delegates for the presidential primary. The two factions reached an agreement due to the intervention of the reconciliation committee. There is no doubt that the faction of the governorship candidate of PDP, Senator Ademola Adeleke, would be supporting Senator Bukola Saraki, because of his close relationship with the family. Adeleke openly endorsed Saraki when the latter met the state\u2019s delegates.\n\nThe faction of Prince Dotun Babayemi is likely to support Atiku Abubakar because the former governor, Olagunsoye Oyinlola, who belongs to this faction, is likely to play a major role in the determination of the choice of candidate for this faction.\n\nEdo: Atiku, Wike, Saraki to share\n\nThere are two factions in the party in Edo \u2013 the state governor\u2019s faction and the faction of the South-South National Vice Chairmanship of the party, Chief Dan Orbih, following from the crisis rocking the party in the state. Obaseki\u2019s faction is said to backing Atiku Abubakar while Orbih\u2019s faction is supporting Wike. Saraki is banking on his goodwill.\n\nKaduna: Still open\n\nFor Kaduna PDP national delegates, it appears they will pull their weights behind the most appealing aspirant. Recent receptions accorded various presidential aspirants that came canvassing for their votes for the primaries showed the direction they would take. Nothing is given yet, but it is believed that Saraki, Atiku and Bala Mohammed might share the spoils.\n\nBorno: It\u2019s Atiku and Bala Mohammed\n\nThe PDP delegates are working on regional loyalty for Atiku Abubakar and Bala Mohammed, who are from the same North-East Zone. Sources also said money has huge influence on the preference of Atiku, who allegedly released funds to support the party in the state.\n\nAnambra: It\u2019s Saraki and Anyim\n\nWith Obi out, Anambra is for Saraki. It was gathered that most of the delegates are from the structure of a former governorship aspirant who recently rejoined the party and has sympathy for Saraki. Anyim may reap from Obi\u2019s absence being the other South-East candidate in reckoning.\n\nCross River: It\u2019s Wike, Emmanuel, but Atiku may get something\n\nWike is said to be a household name in Cross River PDP, as he has been the pillar behind the party and its leadership. It was learnt that Wike has been the financial backbone of the party since the defection of Governor Ben Ayade to APC since last year. He\u2019s likely to get most of the votes here. However, Gov Emmanuel and Atiku will also get some votes. Atiku has close relationship with former governor Liyel Imoke, who is the party leader.\n\nBayelsa: All eyes on Gov Diri\n\nGovernor Douye Diri will ultimately determine where the national delegates from Bayelsa State would vote. He is somehow close to practically all the northern aspirants \u2013 Bala Mohammed, Aminu Tambuwal, Atiku Abubakar and Saraki. The same way he enjoys a robust relationship with Governor Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom.\n\nLagos: Between Saraki, Atiku\n\nPDP delegates in Lagos will likely pitch their tents for Saraki and Atiku .\n\nSokoto: Tambuwal\u2019s exclusive zone\n\nSokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal, who is also a presidential aspirant will pick all the votes from the delegates.\n\nAdamawa: All for Atiku\n\nThis is the state of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. No ticket will fall for any other aspirant.\n\nGombe: Atiku, Mohammed share votes\n\nDelegates will share their votes between Atiku Abubakar and Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed.\n\nYobe: Atiku is comfortable\n\nAtiku Abubakar will maintain a comfortable lead, but Mohammed, Saraki will scratch some votes.\n\nJigawa: Tambuwal, Atiku, Mohammed\n\nAminu Tambuwal, Atiku Abubakar and Bala Mohammed will share votes.\n\nTaraba: Atiku in control\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nAtiku Abubakar is in control here\n\nZamara : Tambuwal holds the ace\n\nSokoto governor, Tambuwal has no one to contend with.\n\nKatsina: Atiku is on ground\n\nAtiku Abubakar is ahead of others here.\n\nAPC: How aspirants stand\n\nEnugu: State party leaders to decide.\n\nIt is expected that the direction the delegates will follow will be decided by the state leaders of the party. Though the leadership and delegates of both parties have been receiving presidential aspirants, there is nothing to show where the interests of the delegates lie.\n\nImo: Lawan holds the ace\n\nIt\u2019s going to be an easy ride for Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, as the Imo State governor, Hope Uzodimma has not hidden his support for him. It is expected that the governor would apply all the machineries of government and strong support he is having from above to push Lawan to the finishing line.\n\nKwara: For Tinubu, Lawan, Osinbajo\n\nTinubu might get a large chunk of the votes from the state. The governor and leader of the party, Mallam AbdulRahaman AbdulRazaq glowingly spoke of his efforts in the Otoge struggle, which assisted the party to win the 2019 elections. Some delegates might also go for Lawan and Vice President Osinbajo.\n\nOyo: Osinbajo, Tinubu, Fayemi will share votes\n\nThe votes of all the delegates from the pace setter state may be divided majorly among three of the presidential aspirants \u2013 Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Ekiti State governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi.\n\nAkwa Ibom: Akpabio\u2019s fortress\n\nThe votes will go to Godswill Akpabio, who is considered the leader of the party in the state. Apart from vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, no other APC aspirant has bothered to come to the state for consultation, thus leaving the field for Akpabio as the net beneficiary of votes from the state.\n\nNiger: Lawan, Osinbajo, Tinubu to share votes\n\nNo fewer than six presidential aspirants on the platform of the party have met with the delegates in Minna, the state capital. The votes of the Niger State delegates might be shared among Lawan, Osinbajo and Tinubu.\n\nRivers: Amaechi, Tinubu battle for votes\n\nThe APC in Rivers State has since been factionalized between Amaechi and Senator Magnus Abe. The latter\u2019s loyalists will most likely cast their votes for Bola Tinubu. So, the voting strength of Rivers delegates at the presidential primaries is likely to be shared between Amaechi and Tinubu.\n\nKebbi: The governor to decide\n\nDespite the few presidential aspirants that have been in contact with the delegates and party chieftains, many people still believed that who the delegates will cast their votes for would be finally decided by the state governor. The main reason is that the delegates are loyalists of the governor.\n\nKogi: Bello\u2019s turf\n\nSince the governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello is one of the aspirants; it is likely that he corners the votes of his state.\n\nEbonyi: Umahi all the way and Onu\n\nThe state governor, David Umahi is an aspirant. It is expected that he will get the votes here. Former Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, is also from the state. With the factionalization of APC in the state, the votes will be split between Umahi and Onu.\n\nPlateau: Amaechi on top\n\nDelegates from the APC will likely cast their votes for Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi because of his relationship with Governor Simon Lalong, the APC party leader in Plateau.\n\nLalong had declared the support of Plateau delegates to Amaechi when he stormed Jos last week to interface with the delegates to woo their votes.\n\nOgun: Osinbajo, Tinubu to share votes\n\nThe party delegates were carefully and strategically \u2018elected\u2019 to ensure those loyal to the incumbent governor, Dapo Abiodun, made the delegates list. This step, according to a source within the party, was to ensure party members loyal to the immediate past governor did not make the list of the party faithful that will produce the presidential candidate of the party. Governor Abiodun made it clear when the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo visited Ogun that the state would give him maximum support at the convention. However, Tinubu cannot be ruled out as some of his political associates had hand in making Abiodun governor.\n\nAbia: Lawan, the man to beat\n\nWhile it is not totally clear who among the presidential aspirants the state delegates would vote for, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan could be the sure candidate. This is as a result of the tacit support the Senate President has been getting from the Senate Chief Whip and former governor of Abia State, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu since he declared interest in the presidential race.\n\nKano: Gov might\n\nThe delegates are very loyal to Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and most certainly, would vote for whosoever he chooses. From all indications, his vote is for Bola Ahmed Tinubu and they would vote in the same direction.\n\nNasarawa: Tinubu on ground\n\nDelegates that would attend the convention from Nasarawa State are loyalists of the former governor, Tanko Almakura. Almakura is a strong ally of Bola Ahmed Tinubu who recently visited the state in continuation of his meeting with delegates at the Government House, Lafia It is very clear that all delegates\u2019 votes may all go to the former governor of Lagos State.\n\nOndo: Delegates yet to decide\n\nThere is no clear indication yet on the presidential aspirant delegates from Ondo State will support, as the leader of the party in the state, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu was said to have remained quiet in giving direction to the party members across the state.\n\nDelta: Cose to call between Lawan, Amaechi, Osinbajo\n\nAmaechi\u2019s loyalists in Delta State will vote for him, while loyalists of the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, who is the leader of the party in the state, will go for Lawan. Osinbajo hopes to reap from goodwill.\n\nBenue: Delegates still waiting for order\n\nThe leader of the party, Senator George Akume has not shown any preference for any presidential aspirant, and that is making it difficult for the party to take a position.\n\nOsun: Tinubu is it\n\nThe delegates are substantially for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. They did not hide this during the meeting with the Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, as some of them put on caps with the inscription of Tinubu\u2019s logo.\n\nEdo: Tinubu gets lion\u2019s share, while Osinbajo picks the rest\n\nBola Tinubu looks good to get the support of most party delegates. The backing of former governor of the state and ex-National Chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and other strong political leaders in the state, would come handy to make this possible. Vice President Osinbajo who also has the backing of another former governor of the state, Prof. Osarheimen Osunbo, is likely to be runner-up to Tinubu.\n\nKaduna: Tinubu, Amaechi, Osinbajo share votes\n\nWhen Vice President Osinbajo, Bola Tinubu and Rotimi Amaechi visited the delegates at different times in Kaduna, the delegates pledged to vote for each of them. As it stands, the three aspirants would share the votes from this state.\n\nBorno: Lawan, Osinbajo, Tinubu to grab the votes\n\nThe 81 delegates votes will be shared among Lawan, Osinbajo and Tinubu. However, Amaechi may get very few \u2018compensatory\u2019 votes.\n\nAnambra: Lawan, Umahi\u2019s citadel\n\nThe delegates shall be voting for Lawan with Andy Ubah as strong factor. The links of Senator Orji Kalu in the state will also swing it for Lawan. However Ebonyi State governor, David Umahi, will get some votes as people of the South East believe that 2023 is their time to produce the country\u2019s president and would do everything within their powers to make it happen.\n\nEkiti: Fayemi all the way\n\nGov Fayemi will no doubt get most of the votes here. A few might be left for Tinubu and Osinbajo to share\n\nCross River: Lawan on ground\n\nGovernor Ben Ayade, the leader of the party, seems disposed to be working for Sen. Ahmad Lawan, who was said to have tacitly supported Ayade in his struggle to ensure that Senator Steven Odey was not thrown out of the senate chambers.\n\nDuring Lawan\u2019s visit to Cross River, the governor assured the Lawan team of at least 80 per cent of the delegates votes.\n\nHowever, Amaechi and Osinbajo would battle for the remaining votes.\n\nBayelsa: Unsure\n\nIn Bayelsa, with the Minister of State for Petroleum and former governor of the state, Chief Timipre Sylva dropping out of the Presidential race, the delegates of Bayelsa are up for any of the presidential aspirants.\n\nHowever, there is no love lost between Sylva and Amaechi so it is very certain that Sylva would do everything including ensuring that Bayelsa delegates do not vote for Amaechi to stop his presidential aspiration.\n\nLagos: Tinubu fully on ground\n\nIt goes without saying that Tinubu will get all the votes of the delegates\n\nSokoto: Lawan is ahead\n\nSenate President Ahmed Lawan is very comfortable\n\nYobe: 100% votes for Lawan\n\nThis is the state of the senate president. No vote will fall for any other aspirant.\n\nGombe: Lawan, Osinbajo share votes\n\nDelegates will share their votes between the senate president and the vice president\n\nAdamawa: Lawal is comfortable\n\nLawal will maintain a comfortable lead, but Osinbajo, Saraki will scratch some votes.\n\nJigawa: Lawal, Osinbajo, Tinubu shear votes\n\nThe senate president, vice president and leader of the party will share votes.\n\nTaraba: Lawan is in control\n\nThe senate president is absolutely in control\n\nZamfara: Survival of the fittest\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nAs correctly predicted by The Sun on its online platform last night, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) may have bowed to pressures from political parties to extend the deadline for the conduct of primaries, shifting it by one week.\n\nInter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) had made a fresh appeal to the commission for the extension by one week, pleading that it will enable them to conclude all logistics concerning the primaries.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above?

Once again, the political parties requested the Commission to review the timelines for political party primaries provided in the timetable and schedule of activities for the conduct of the 2023 general election released on Saturday February 26, 2022.\n\n\u201cEarlier, the political parties had requested for 37 \u2013 60 days extension of the timeline for primaries and the nomination of candidates. The commission was emphatic that this request could not be granted because it would disrupt other scheduled activities on the Timetable. This position of the Commission has not changed.\n\n\u201cHowever, based on the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election, the parties have now pleaded with the Commission to use the six-day period between 4th and 9th June 2022 to conclude outstanding primaries and prepare to upload the list of candidates and their affidavits on the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal.\n\n\u201cThe commission did not schedule any specific activity during this period. The idea is to simply give parties time to compile the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates before uploading same to the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal from 10th \u2013 17th June 2022.\n\n\u201cThe commission has decided to allow the request of the political parties since the six-day period does not conflict with the next scheduled activity which is the submission of the list of nominated candidates or any of the subsequent timelines which remain sacrosanct.\n\n\u201cHowever, this request is granted in respect of outstanding primaries only without prejudice to those already concluded by political parties. The Commission will not monitor already concluded primaries,\u201d the commission noted in the statement.\n\nGiving more information about INEC candidates nomination portal, the statement read: \u201cAfter the conduct of primaries, the next critical activity for political parties is the online submission of the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor which shall be accompanied by an affidavit sworn to by the candidates indicating that they fulfilled all the constitutional requirements for election into the various offices via the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the commission, based on past experience, has decided to train the political party officials to make efficient and effective use of the portal. The Commission will train four officials from each of the 18 political parties, making a total of 72 in all.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Former Governor Peter Obi had earlier dropped his presidential bid on the platform of PDP and also resigned from the party.\n\nIn his letter of resignation, addressed to the PDP National Chairman, Hayatu-deen said, \u201c\u201dI wish to reiterate that I did not join party politics and to contest for the presidency because of personal gains and inordinate ambition, but in order to serve our country.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore based on personal principles and with great humility that I have decided after wide consultations to withdraw from this contest which has been obscenely monetized.\u201d\n\nHayatu-deen further stated: \u201cMy exposure locally and internationally and contributions to the nation\u2019s economic and political-well being positioned me to take up the challenges facing our dear nation and \u2013 the courage to participate in this grueling exercise which most of our elites have shunned away from. Regrettably the political system has proved to be acrimonious, corrupt and self-serving.\n\n\u201cFor the past three months I had the privilege of intensively interacting with Nigerians from all walks of life. This reinforces my resolve that Nigeria MUST BE saved, otherwise our future is doomed.\n\n\u201cI joined the contest as a democrat, with an open mind to keenly contest and accept the result of a process that is fair, credible and transparent.\n\n\u201cWe have endeavoured to forge a consensus which would have facilitated a seamless emergence of a candidate which unfortunately could not be achieved.\n\n\u201cI wish to thank all my supporters, especially those from my state, well-wishers, friends, family, the extraordinary hardworking young men and women of our campaign organization, the party leadership and members for their tremendous support which enabled us to contribute within this short period towards changing the character and direction of the Nigerian political landscape.\n\n\u201cFinally, as a very loyal party member and believer in the democratic process, I will continue to avail myself and my teeming supporters at all times to ensure victory of our great party.\u201d\n\nThe PDP presidential primary holds from Saturday May 28 to Sunday May 29\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Rules his right to vie for president again cannot be prevented by any retroactive law\n\nOlusegun Samuel in Yenagoa\n\nA Federal High Court in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State yesterday ruled that former President Goodluck Jonathan is still eligible to contest in the 2023 presidential election on the grounds that he had only been elected into office once, in 2011.\n\n\n\nThe trial judge, Justice Isa Hamma Dashen, in his judgement also held that Jonathan\u2019s right to vie for the office of president again cannot be stopped by any retroactive law.\n\n\n\nThe suit was filed by Andy Solomon and Idibiye Abraham as first and second plaintiffs and listed Jonathan, the All Progressives Congress, and the Independent National Electoral Commission as first, second, and third defendants, respectively.\n\n\n\nBut the APC and the INEC did not have any legal representations in the matter.\n\nSolomon and Abraham, members of the APC, had approached the court through their counsels, Egbuwabi Seigha and Timi Robinson, seeking the disqualification of Jonathan from the 2023 presidential polls.\n\n\n\nThey argued that by virtue of the introduction of Section 137, sub-sections 1(b) and 3 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria as amended, Jonathan was no longer eligible to vie for the office of the president because he had taken an oath to that office on two previous occasions.\n\n\n\nJustice Dashen dismissed the reliefs sought by the plaintiffs and held that the swearing of Jonathan as acting president on May 6, 2010, after the death of Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, was a constitutional provision.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the 2007 general elections produced the late Yar\u2019Adua as president and not Jonathan, stressing that Section 137 could not have a retroactive effect to stop him from contesting the forthcoming presidential polls.\n\nDashen ruled that there was no presidential election conducted in the country in 2010 and Jonathan could not be deemed to have been sworn into the office of the president that year.\n\n\n\nHe said that Section 137, which came into effect on June 7, 2018, following the fourth alteration to the constitution, \u201ccannot apply retrospectively except the legislature in clear terms expressly stated their intention for it to be so.\u201d\n\nThe judge rationalised that if Jonathan had won his re-election bid in the 2015 general polls, which he lost to the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari, he would have been inaugurated as president without any legal impediment.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cIn my opinion, the position being propounded by the first defendant (that he is eligible to contest) is tenable. It is the duty of the plaintiffs to direct this court where the legislature stated that the provisions of Section 137 sub-section 3 of the Constitution are to apply.\n\n\n\n\u201cI, therefore, find the arguments of the first defendant that he has been elected into the office of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria only once and in the year 2011, not only irresistible but established, and I so hold.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn law, he who asserts must prove. I find that the plaintiffs have not discharged the burden of proof placed on them by law. I, therefore, find merit in the argument of the first defendant that the introduction of Section 137 of the Constitution does not affect his right to contest for the office of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cBefore the year 2015 when the first defendant lost his re-election bid to the office of President, the restriction by Section 137 sub-section 3 was not in existence. If he had won the 2015 general elections, he would have been sworn in for the third time without any legal impediment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe first defendant acquired his right to contest for the office of President immediately after his term as president on May 29, 2015. Clearly, it is incontrovertible that the first defendant\u2019s right to contest and be sworn in as president was vested in him on May 29, 2015, and I so hold.\n\n\n\n\u201cI declare that the provision of 137 sub-section 3 of the Constitution acquired the force of law with effect from 7th June 2018, and as such does not have retrospective application.\n\n\n\n\u201cI also declare that the first defendant is not disqualified by the provision of Section 137 sub-section 3 of the Constitution from contesting for election into the office of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\n\n\u201cConsequently, I enter judgment for the first defendant, and all the reliefs sought by the plaintiffs in their originating summons dated 16 May 2022 and filed on 17 May 2022 are all hereby dismissed.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, Seigha, said that they believed that the introduction of Section 137 sub-sections 1(b) and 3 in the constitution \u201cis the law now.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cWe challenged the eligibility of Dr Goodluck Jonathan. We canvassed our position before the court that he is no longer eligible (to contest for presidency) by the introduction of Section 137 sub-sections 1(b) and 3 because he had taken the oath to the office of President twice.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy the introduction of sub-section 3, which is the law now, it is our position that under the law as it is, he is going to be screened for the elections coming in 2023.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeigha also said they approached the court seeking Jonathan\u2019s disqualification because he had ruled the country with integrity and dignity, \u201cand we also do not want a situation where he would come to transgress the law for so much integrity he had worked hard to acquire and will be allowed to slip into an error.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe, however, added that they would get a copy of the judgement and study it critically with a view to heading to the Court of Appeal.\n\n\n\nThe former president\u2019s counsel, Omare, expressed delight that \u201cThe court agreed with us and held that President Goodluck Jonathan is qualified to contest the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nOmare said he and his team were prepared to meet the plaintiffs at the Court of Appeal, adding that they were waiting to be served the processes of the appeal.\n\n\n\nJonathan was Nigeria\u2019s vice-president between 2007 and 2010. He became the president in May 2010 following the death of President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and completed the latter\u2019s tenure.\n\n\n\nHe won the 2011 presidential election but failed in his attempt to secure a second term in office in 2015.\n\nThere have been speculations that the former president had left the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC) \u2014 the platform on which President Muhammadu Buhari defeated him in 2015.\n\nA Fulani group had purchased the N100 million presidential nomination and expression of interest forms for the former president.\n\n\n\nThe forms were purchased days after he had asked his supporters to watch out, when he was asked if he would contest the 2023 poll.\n\n\n\nBut in a statement issued by Ikechukwu Eze, his media aide, Jonathan had said he did not give his consent to the purchase of the forms.\n\n\n\nBuhari signed the fourth alteration of the 1999 Constitution which bars Vice-Presidents who succeed their principals from serving more than one full term.\n\n\n\nHowever, some have argued that the new provision ought not to apply to Jonathan as the law ought not to take a retroactive effect unless it was expressly stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nPeter Uzoho with agency report\n\nNigeria\u2019s low crude oil production means the country is barely able to cover the cost of imported petrol from its oil and gas revenue, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed said yesterday.\n\n\n\nAhmed, who said this in an interview with Reuters, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said she hoped Nigerian oil production would average 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, up from around 1.5 million bpd in the first quarter.\n\n\n\nThe government had budgeted 1.8 million bpd of production, Ahmed said, blaming crude theft and attacks on oil infrastructure for the shortfall.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are not seeing the revenues that we had planned for,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cWhen the production is low it means we\u2019re \u2026 barely able to cover the volumes that are required for the (petrol) that we need to import.\u201d\n\n\n\nNigeria exports crude oil and imports refined petrol, suffering intermittent fuel shortages. It faces double-digit inflation and low growth, amid a shrinking labour market and mounting insecurity.\n\n\n\nA plan to abolish its petrol subsidy was scrapped ahead of national elections in February 2023 and recently, President Muhammadu Buhari got the National Assembly to approve N4 trillion for subsidies in 2022, up from the N400 billion initially projected for the purpose, putting pressure on the budget.\n\n\n\nNigeria raised $1.25 billion via a Eurobond sale in March at a premium rate and had planned to issue another bond.\n\nBut Ahmed said the government had \u201cnot seen a good opportunity to go in.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe country\u2019s deficit is set to rise to 4.5 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product this year due to the fuel subsidy, up from an original estimate of 3.42 per cent in the budget.\n\n\n\nAfter holding the Monetary Policy Rate constant at 11.5 per cent for about two and a half years, the MPC on Tuesday, raised the benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 13 per cent in response to global inflationary pressures, which had continued to hurt economies around the world. Inflation in Nigeria rose to 16.82 per cent in April, the highest in eight months.\n\n\n\nCommenting on the interest rate hike, Ahmed said the central bank move was necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes, including a 50 basis-point rise earlier this month, alongside Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and coronavirus lockdowns in China have prompted a move from riskier emerging markets to safe havens.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are certainly very, very concerned,\u201d Ahmed said of the Fed\u2019s policy tightening. \u201cThe actions that the Fed or the central bank in Europe take will affect us.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Taken aback by the question, the SaharaReporters correspondent asked: \"Is this not a restaurant?\"\n\nThe security guard looked as if he was contemplating a response, but seemed to think twice about it and stepped back.\n\nThe team proceeded (we came disguised as a company of people who had come to hang out).\n\nThe entrance smelt of something funny, but the source of the smell was not readily visible. There was a show glass displaying what looked like bags made of real leather. We made our way into the dimly-lit restaurant. Inside, we approached the front desk, which had a stern-looking female Chinese national at the register (probably trying to reconcile the books). She barely looked up, save for the Nigerian attendants/waiters who looked completely bewildered and almost shocked that we were standing there.\n\nIn the sitting area, two Asian men were seated, looking on at us. A member of the team turned back and requested with an assertive voice: \"Can I see your menu?\" The announcement was to deflect from our main mission there.\n\nWe were ushered to a seat, five of us on a round table overlooking a transparent glass and an outdoor sitting area. As the menu arrived, so did about three waiters, circling for no reason, with one making as if she wanted to serve tea, all the while peeking into our phones.\n\nThe Wait\n\nAs we awaited our moderately-priced fried rice and spaghetti, we made small talk, sipping the tea. By now, apart from the waiters who looked aloof and were now stationed at strategic points in the restaurant, the stern-looking Chinese lady behind the counter was now sitting close by in the restaurant.\n\nShe beckoned to another lady (Chinese) and spoke something to her in their language, while motioning at us. The new lady in the most inconspicuous manner (even for an amateur) started taking photos of us and recording. I caught her glance and she tried to look away while concealing her phone.

Ya ya (camera lady) was now tutoring us on how to use the chopsticks. A member of the team quickly requested a selfie and with concealed reluctance, she proceeded and everyone was obliged, including me.\n\nI wondered if they took selfies with all their guests or if it was a curated PR move? Soon after, we had to leave and requested takeaway packs for what was left off our spaghetti and fried rice (God forbid it wastes). As we were about to leave, a woman clad in black (Chinese) appeared from one of the many doors.\n\nShe walked up to us and said \"hello\" and stayed there. A member of the team asked for her name and she said Si Si and introduced herself as the manager of the place. One member of the team queried if \"everyone is welcome here?\" to which she simply said \"yes\".\n\nShe then proceeded to accompanying us out the front door (again, what establishment has its manager see customers to the door?). As we exited the building, I noticed the security guard (seemed like a Nigerian from his looks) looked jittery. I couldn't let it go, so I went back to take a photo in front of the building. How else would we prove we came to eat racist spaghetti?\n\nIt turned out the manager was watching from the glass window I described earlier; she hadn't anticipated our abrupt return for a photo.\n\nMore suspicious was the security guard, who suggested I use a wall with some flower pots for the photo as opposed to standing by the entrance which had the name of the establishment carved into it.\n\nIn the End\n\nFrom our findings, interaction with staff and management, we couln't help thinking that Shi Shi resturant is indeed racist, hence the security guard\u2019s inquiry about who we were looking for in a place listed as a public restaurant even on Google. There was also the issue of the staff recording a video of us, the policing while in the restaurant and the manager accompanying us out. Would they have done all that if we were Chinese?\n\nIn the restaurant's bid to gloss this over, it ended us awarding us an exaggerated reception.",

          "text": "What better place to have lunch than a restaurant accused of racism?\n\nSaharaReporters visited Shi Shi Chinese restaurant on Thursday due to multiple allegations of racism towards Nigerian visitors to the restaurant, located at 21B, Emina Crescent, off Toyin Street, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nOur Experience\n\nOn arriving Shi Shi, tucked away in a residential area in Ikeja, we approached the gate.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" we called out to the grumpy and irritated-looking security guard.\n\n\"Who did you come to see?\" he queried. Taken aback by the question, the SaharaReporters correspondent asked: \"Is this not a restaurant?\"\n\nThe security guard looked as if he was contemplating a response, but seemed to think twice about it and stepped back.\n\nThe team proceeded (we came disguised as a company of people who had come to hang out).\n\nThe entrance smelt of something funny, but the source of the smell was not readily visible. There was a show glass displaying what looked like bags made of real leather. We made our way into the dimly-lit restaurant. Inside, we approached the front desk, which had a stern-looking female Chinese national at the register (probably trying to reconcile the books). She barely looked up, save for the Nigerian attendants/waiters who looked completely bewildered and almost shocked that we were standing there.\n\nIn the sitting area, two Asian men were seated, looking on at us. A member of the team turned back and requested with an assertive voice: \"Can I see your menu?\" The announcement was to deflect from our main mission there.\n\nWe were ushered to a seat, five of us on a round table overlooking a transparent glass and an outdoor sitting area. As the menu arrived, so did about three waiters, circling for no reason, with one making as if she wanted to serve tea, all the while peeking into our phones.\n\nThe Wait\n\nAs we awaited our moderately-priced fried rice and spaghetti, we made small talk, sipping the tea. By now, apart from the waiters who looked aloof and were now stationed at strategic points in the restaurant, the stern-looking Chinese lady behind the counter was now sitting close by in the restaurant.\n\nShe beckoned to another lady (Chinese) and spoke something to her in their language, while motioning at us. The new lady in the most inconspicuous manner (even for an amateur) started taking photos of us and recording. I caught her glance and she tried to look away while concealing her phone. Sigh.\n\nWe continued to have conversations and our food began to arrive, the Chinese fried rice first.\n\nIn a bid to what I perceive as remedying our awkward \u2018glance lock\u2019, \u2018Camera lady\u2019 approached our table and offered to teach us how to use chopsticks.\n\nPlease note: while I was preoccupied with documenting our experience with a secret recorder, the team noticed that the two Asian men who were seated and had made their orders \"looked disgusted, got up and made their way into one of the many rooms\" in the restaurant.\n\nThe Show Must Go On\n\nAnd so it began, the overly choreographed friendliness, niceness, half-smiles and forced response to questions. Ya ya (camera lady) was now tutoring us on how to use the chopsticks. A member of the team quickly requested a selfie and with concealed reluctance, she proceeded and everyone was obliged, including me.\n\nI wondered if they took selfies with all their guests or if it was a curated PR move? Soon after, we had to leave and requested takeaway packs for what was left off our spaghetti and fried rice (God forbid it wastes). As we were about to leave, a woman clad in black (Chinese) appeared from one of the many doors.\n\nShe walked up to us and said \"hello\" and stayed there.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

This licensing follows a visit to Nigeria by the company\u2019s team in May last year to discuss the possibility of obtaining a licence. Starlink which currently operates in 36 countries has over 400,000 subscribers around the world.\n\n\u201cThe company received two licenses, which include the International Gateway license and Internet Service Provider (ISP) license, and will be trading as Starlink Internet Services Nigeria Ltd. According to NCC, the International Gateway license has a 10-year tenure while the ISP license is to last for five years. Both licenses take effect from May 2022 and may be renewed after the expiration,\u201d per Nairametrics.\n\nStarlink approved by Nigeria \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec & Mozambique \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddffhttps://t.co/Q1VvqVmJ2i \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 27, 2022\n\nStarlink is a low latency broadband internet system created to meet the needs of consumers in rural areas with low internet penetration across the globe.

All the customer needs is a clear view of the sky.\n\nStarlink enters a Nigerian Internet service provider space that is dominated by telcos like MTN and Airtel, as well as individual ISPs such as Spectranet, SMILE and others.\n\nCompared to existing similar internet plans in Nigeria which cost an average of $50, Starlink is a more expensive option costing $599 (~\u20a6330,000) for a full kit, including a terminal, mounting tripod, and Wi-Fi router, then a $110 (~\u20a660,500) for preorder and monthly subscription. Its premium service costs about $2,500 (~\u20a61.375 million) for the full kit and $500 (~\u20a6275,000) monthly.\n\nThis price range is deemed expensive for the average Nigerian, except it introduces a different offering for the Nigerian Market.\n\nShare this article",

It\u2019s also the ideal time to bill that tech bro or sis.\n\nThis type of weekend only occurs once a month. If you miss it this month, you\u2019ll have to wait until the next. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to wait. Just kidding. No, I\u2019m not .\n\nBy the way, today is Children\u2019s Day in Nigeria. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity to fulfil that promise to take them out or buy that ice cream. \ud83d\ude09 I mean, make a child happy today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis weekend, I\u2019m also following my advice and billing you. Just kidding. I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do this weekend, but I know it will be fun.\n\nEnjoy your weekend however you can. You know I\u2019m always concerned with your overall health and wellbeing. Take care of yourself during this short break!!!\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to talk about two stories:\n\nJumia\u2019s partnership with CGAP\n\nProducts for people with disabilities\n\nJumia\u2019s partnership with CGAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt goes without saying that Jumia is one of the dominant players in the African eCommerce market. In Nigeria, the company made $33 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2021, with a $14.6 million increase in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nAlso, the Central Bank of Nigeria recently granted it a Payment Service Solution Provider (PSSP) licence.\n\nThe licence will enable it to process payments for Nigerian third-party businesses. This development pits it directly against Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita.\n\nIt also provides an additional revenue stream when the company desperately needs to increase revenue.\n\nInterestingly, the company is testing a healthtech play through a partnership with the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis collaboration will provide users with access to doctors for a $1 monthly subscription fee.\n\nWell, Chimgozirim thinks it\u2019s a fantastic move that will allow Jumia to leverage its existing customer base and infrastructure.\n\nI do not think we have enough doctors in this country, though. I mean, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends one doctor for every 600 people in a country.\n\nHowever, in a country with one doctor for every 5,000 people, the WHO\u2019s recommendation appears a long way off.\n\nFurther, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria.\n\nIn his article, Chimgozirim discusses what the collaboration could mean for healthtech startups. You can find it here: Dear healthtech startups, Jumia is coming for your bread!\n\nKenya\u2019s digital products for people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a report, approximately 40% of Africa\u2019s population is disabled, including 10-15% of school-age children. This implies that there are over 300 million people with disabilities in Africa.\n\nEven though people with disabilities are often referred to as the world\u2019s largest minority, in Africa, they face exclusion, discrimination, and barriers to exercising their fundamental rights and participating in development.\n\nHowever, Kenya, an African country, is changing the narrative.\n\nHow? Kenya has developed a standard for digital accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nThis means that people with disabilities, and older people who are largely disconnected from most e-government services and business-owned digital platforms, will be connected, supported, and empowered by digital products to increase their digital inclusion.\n\nHow? It will be accomplished by providing computer assistive technology to the blind and visually impaired. Also, public and private sector digital products and services (like websites and mobile applications) will be more accessible and usable by all Kenyan citizens.\n\nThis follows the announcement by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) of a partnership with inABLE to develop a national information and communication technology (ICT) accessibility standard.\n\nThis is similar to EnableMe Kenya, an online platform, aimed at providing community-oriented technological support and increasing digital inclusion for people with disabilities.\n\nAccording to Bernard Njiraini, KEBS Managing Director, \u201cTo accommodate all people in the society, inclusive design and universal design principles should be integrated into digital products and services.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer. Apply here.\n\nGrant Master has announced the start of its second Creative Writers Fellowship cohort. The Fellowship for Creative Writers will take place virtually from July 4th to August 26th, 2022. Apply here.\n\nMOBI Automation, a startup that uses Web3 technologies to solve business problems, is looking for a Chief Technology Officer, UI & UX Designer, Senior Frontend Developer, and Creative Designer. Send your resume here.\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious? Apply for the Coinbase Community Ambassador Program (CAP) \u2014 Summer 2022 here.\n\nHave an amazing weekend!\n\nVictoria Fakiya for Techpoint Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Fakiya A writer with ADHD who is interested in mental health and how technology is improving the lives of Africans with mental disorders.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, May 17, 2022, Nigerian eCommerce giant, Jumia released its financial report for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nCo-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec shared that orders, revenue, and gross merchandise value (GMV) saw significant growth compared to the last nine quarters. Comparing Q1 2021 with Q1 2022, orders grew from 6.6 million to 9.3 million, GMV grew from $198.9 million to $252.7 million, while revenue went from $33 million to $47.6 million.\n\nEven with this growth, it\u2019s not all rosy for the company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss was $53 million. On a call with TechCrunch, Poignonnec shared that the company plans to keep EBITDA loss below the $70 million it recorded in Q1 2021.\n\nNow to some good and potentially exciting developments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJumiaPay, its fintech product, has secured a payment service solution provider (PSSP) licence, which will allow it to process payments for third-party businesses in Nigeria. This development puts it in direct competition with Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita. It also provides another revenue stream when it desperately needs to increase revenues.\n\nPSSPs usually make their money by charging a transaction fee for every transaction they facilitate, and these fees often vary depending on the transaction\u2019s value. Per the report, 34% of orders placed on Jumia were completed using JumiaPay, and with its licence, JumiaPay\u2019s numbers could significantly increase in the coming quarters.\n\nHealthcare at the drop of a hat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: AMISOM via Iwaria\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the developments shared in the report is Jumia\u2019s decision to venture into the healthcare space. Via a partnership with Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, the company is testing a service that will allow users to access doctors with a monthly subscription of $1.\n\nViewed in isolation, this is a great move that could see Jumia tap into its existing customer base and infrastructure. It also represents a more formidable competitor for existing healthcare startups.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 1 doctor per 600 people in a country, but Nigeria has 1 doctor for 5,000 people. Furthermore, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria, while the healthtech industry in Africa is projected to be worth $259 billion by 2030.\n\nAlthough little detail was provided about the move, its foray into an area that is notoriously difficult in Africa and is not remotely related to its core business warrants some questions.\n\nExisting telehealth startups in the country include CribMD, iWello, and WellaHealth. As private companies, their records are often not in the public domain, but in a 2021 interview with Techpoint Africa, iWello reported that it had 140 clients, with CribMD reportedly serving 2,800 patients as of 2021. WellaHealth\u2019s CEO also shared that the company hit 10,000 unique users in 2017, with thousands on its waitlist.\n\nThese companies are significantly less funded than Jumia, with Africa\u2019s healthcare sector raising $392 million in 2021. However, these companies have to combat low Internet penetration, dwindling household incomes, and cultural norms to get paying customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, Jumia has no expertise operating in the healthcare sector and would likely have to go through a learning curve for this venture to succeed. Even with the option of hiring experienced professionals, things will probably not go their way immediately.\n\nThe fragmented nature of the healthcare space is another challenge that existing players face. For example, there are only a handful of hospitals with digitised records and even fewer still that share this information. This makes it imperative that healthtech startups build solutions for this purpose.\n\nBuilding partnerships for effective healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these could pose challenges to Jumia\u2019s healthtech plans, Yomi Kazeem, Senior Consultant, Salient Advisory, believes that Jumia has what it takes to succeed, especially if it goes the partnership route.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he said, \u201cJumia can potentially build out its healthtech play through more partnerships to facilitate diagnostics. It can also partner with pharmacies, leverage its logistics network, and pair medication delivery with its telemedicine service, so patients are not only speaking to doctors remotely but also receiving needed medication seamlessly.\n\n\u201cThis approach is important because, ultimately, providing access to consultations is only one part of healthcare. With more of these companies emerging, user acquisition becomes more competitive. In essence, third-party partnerships that facilitate access to patients on a larger scale are vital.\u201d\n\nUnlike existing healthtech players, Jumia has an established logistics service that could help it deliver medications faster than startups that have to depend on third-party providers. While this means Jumia could potentially cut into their market, it also presents an opportunity to expand healthtech services in the country while unlocking one more revenue stream for Jumia.\n\nHealthtech startups, for example, can provide faster and more efficient services by partnering with Jumia. Such partnerships could also expose them to Jumia\u2019s considerably larger customer base.\n\nAn example of such a partnership is Airtel Kenya\u2019s partnership with MyDawa, an online pharmacy in Kenya that allows Airtel\u2019s customers log into the MyDawa website without incurring data costs while MyDawa provides an option to pay for products with Airtel Money.\n\nDespite being boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, healthtech startups are still a long way from meeting Africa\u2019s healthcare needs. However, partnerships such as this could be key going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Ask around and tell me what other people are saying.\n\nToday\u2019s episode is a lot of fun to listen to! The editorial team made me laugh; Bolu\u2019s story was one of the stories that drew me in.\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? The Central African Republic announced plans to launch SANGO, a bitcoin investment hub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis follows a warning from the Banking Commission of Central Africa (COBAC) prohibiting banks in the region from collaborating with digital payment platforms. Why? The CAR adopted bitcoin as a reference currency.\n\nAlso, a Nigerian, Chidi Nwaubani, launched the \u201cLooty\u201d project to reclaim African artefacts stolen by European colonists.\n\nThe project will create 3D images of these artefacts, sell them as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and use the proceeds to support young African artists.\n\nPlease listen to the podcast to hear these gists in particular. Bolu spoke last, so you\u2019ll have to listen till the end.\n\nYou can find today\u2019s episode here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow Traction wants to stop fake alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7m seed\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\nTraction wants to stop fake alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction Founders: Dolapo Adejuyigbe and Mayowa Alli (L-R)\n\nOn Monday, I had to use a PoS kiosk because I had problems with one of my banks. Currently, I have two active accounts, but only one has an ATM card.\n\nThat was intentional. I had no idea the other ATM card would come in handy. I have, however, learnt my lesson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, at the kiosk where I was supposed to transfer money to get cash, I asked if they accept mobile transfers, and the attendant took a long look at me before responding reluctantly in the affirmative.\n\nWith her response, I knew they don\u2019t accept mobile transfers. But, because I am someone she knows, she reluctantly agreed.\n\nOf course, the attendant isn\u2019t the only one who has reservations about accepting mobile transfers. In fact, there are small business owners in my neighbourhood who refuse to accept mobile transfers.\n\nSo, before I went there, I mumbled some incantations because I had no money. \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude39 I\u2019m kidding. But that money was urgently needed, though.\n\nAlthough the transfer was successful, she did not give me my money until she saw and confirmed the alert. I was slightly vexed, but I understood why.\n\nReceiving fake alerts isn\u2019t new for merchants in my neighbourhood, so they\u2019d rather you give them cash for every item you buy over making a mobile transfer.\n\nI waited about 15 minutes before she gave me my money. Fear of fake alerts cost me 15 minutes of my time! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22 I\u2019m not crying, but I believe this is a problem.\n\nI\u2019m sure you know someone or have heard of someone who has been a victim of receiving fake alerts. Consider a merchant receiving fake alerts for every item they sell or service they render. That\u2019s cruel, in my opinion.\n\nHowever, there appears to be a solution. What is it? Traction! The Nigeria-based fintech startup believes its proprietary solution can solve this problem.\n\nHow? It has a unique feature that allows merchants to confirm that every alert is real. Isn\u2019t this interesting?\n\nBusiness owners can use the app to accept payments, generate invoices, manage inventory, and track payments. It also enables merchant employees to confirm payments without calling their boss. Aren\u2019t you curious now?\n\nIf you are, please read Ogheneruemu\u2019s story to learn more about the startup: Traction is building an ecosystem for Nigerian small businesses, starting with stopping fake credit alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R, Pascal Ntsama, Canza Finance CEO and Co-Founder and Oyedeji Oluwole, Canza Finance CTO and Co-Founder.\n\nWith the volatility of cryptocurrency, I won\u2019t even look at you twice if you ask me to buy, not to think of launching a crypto business with you.\n\nIt\u2019s simply too risky, if you ask me. It\u2019s high today, low tomorrow; please don\u2019t give me a heart attack. \ud83d\ude0f\n\nThis reminds me of something that happened last Monday. Please accept my apologies if you are a crypto trader or investor. But, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing when the guy next to me on the bus was glued to his screen, checking his crypto app. \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude02\n\nSincerely, this guy didn\u2019t even close the app for a second. He was just staring. His expression was sad. That could be due to the drop in cryptocurrency that week.\n\nToday\u2019s story, on the other hand, features two Co-founders, Pascal Ntsama and Oyedeji Oluwoye, who began working together after Oluwoye advised Ntsama to buy cryptocurrency. That was bold, if you ask me.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t convinced initially, but after seeing Oluwoye\u2019s success with cryptocurrency two years later, he agreed.\n\nThat\u2019s when the pair realised there was more to cryptocurrency than just trading. They established Coincentrix in 2017 and received a grant from the Zcash Foundation in 2018.\n\nThen, in 2019, they launched Canza Finance, a crypto neobank that connects African businesses to the global economy.\n\nIn other words, the startup makes cryptocurrency transactions easier. It also allows for payments and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions within the country. Besides, it intends to include treasury management in its suite of services.\n\nChimgozirin described the startup\u2019s journey in detail here: Canza Finance is a neobank enabling decentralised cross-border payments for Africans\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to mental health, there is a common misconception that only people suffering from mental disorders see therapists. This is because some of us mistake mental health for a mental illness, which it is not.\n\nMental health is more than just the absence of a mental disorder. It includes how you think, feel, and act.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re having trouble thinking clearly, stressed, or feeling depressed, it can affect your productivity at school, work, or at home, indicating poor mental health.\n\nConsequently, it would help if you spoke with a trusted person who can keep your information confidential while also providing a safe space to express your emotions and possibly offer advice. You can also talk with someone who is trained in counselling or psychiatry.\n\nMoreover, due to the stigma surrounding mental health, most people are afraid of physically going to a centre to see a therapist or psychiatrist\n\nIn Egypt, Fadi Doss, Founder and CEO of Esaal, launched a platform that connects users to experts, allowing them to receive personalised and genuine answers to health concerns straightforwardly and smoothly.\n\nAnd yesterday, Esaal \u2014 an online health and wellness consultation platform \u2014 announced a $1.7 million seed round, led by Egypt-based A15.\n\nEsaal claims that it has over 350 consultants. Also, the company offers consultations on a wide range of topics, like anxiety, physiotherapy, paediatrics, and nutrition.\n\nUsers use an app to access these services via texting, video/voice calls, and in-person visits. They can pay with cash, credit cards, Vodafone, and Fawry.\n\nPer the CEO, the services are available in seven other countries across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries: Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Palestine, and Iraq.\n\nThe funding will be used to expand across MENA, invest in product and brand development, and hire more people. Between 2021 and 2025, Esaal anticipates a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50-60%.\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce retail platform, JABU, announced a $15 million Series A round yesterday, Wednesday,May 25, 2022.\n\nThe round was led by Tiger Global and saw participation from Box Group, Knollwood, D Global Ventures, Afore Capital, Oldslip and FJ Labs.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nWhat\u2019s new? Akinin stated that JABU intends to build around its Jwallet, a wallet system that is currently available as a standalone product. It enables Southern African merchants to use their physical flows to provide cash withdrawal and deposit services to their customers.\n\nIs this similar? Yes. It\u2019s identical to agency banking, a branchless banking system in Nigeria and West Africa where human agents serve as ATMs to provide financial services in outlying areas. And in Morocco, Chari provides a similar service.\n\nJABU will use the Series A funding to expand its presence in Southern Africa and enter new markets like Botswana and Eswatini later this year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer. Apply here.\n\nGrant Master has announced the start of its second Creative Writers Fellowship cohort. The Fellowship for Creative Writers will take place virtually from July 4th to August 26th, 2022. Apply here.\n\nMOBI Automation, a startup that uses Web3 technologies to solve business problems, is looking for a Chief Technology Officer, UI & UX Designer, Senior Frontend Developer, and Creative Designer.

Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby Abdullahi Fawale\n\nShort answer? Apply to AltSchool Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect avenue. Within 12 months, you would have learnt a highly sought-after tech skill and obtained a top-rated diploma. The knowledge and experience gathered during the program adequately prepare you for your first tech job.\n\nReady to begin that journey? Get started HERE.\n\nYou\u2019re reading this for one of two reasons:\n\n1. You\u2019ve made the decision to switch careers and you have your eyes set on the tech space. You\u2019re now on the lookout for key pointers on how to start.\n\n2. You\u2019re yet to decide on transitioning though you\u2019ve been giving it a lot of thought. You however seek more information in the hope that you get all the clarity and green light you need.\n\nA third possibility could be that you know someone who is at that phase of their life\u2014yearning for a career change and real opportunities for growth. This piece answers some of your questions about pursuing a career in tech and how to transition.\n\nBefore we dive in, what is your \u201cWhy\u201d?\n\nThe tech space undoubtedly holds a myriad of opportunities for skilled talent worldwide. Global ecosystems continue to witness exponential growth. In Africa, solution-driven startups keep springing up & raising rounds to help drive growth and expansion.\n\nTech news platforms are often inundated with announcements of funds raised by startups which sometimes run into several millions of dollars. More jobs are getting created. Top tech talents are being enticed with juicy compensation packages and then poached. Junior employees are now taking up more responsibility and securing promotions. It\u2019s Career Christmas!\n\nHowever, it\u2019s quite easy to get distracted by this zeitgeist. Away from the exciting announcements and fascinating Twitter conversations, the growth and successes of these tech ecosystems are powered by the blood and sweat of deeply passionate and hardworking people who put in their absolute best to make things work.\n\nIn other words, working in tech is not a walk in the park. Your \u201cwhy\u201d mustn\u2019t be influenced by the current ecosystem zeitgeist, but by a genuine readiness to learn, contribute and grow.\n\nYou also must define what you want to do going forward. Are you looking for core tech/code roles (e.g Software Engineering) or no-code roles like Product Design, Product Management, Product Marketing, Technical Writing, Customer Success, Recruitment etc,?\n\nHave you looked into what it takes to be successful in this new path and are you ready to give what it takes?\n\nAnswer these questions as truthfully as you can. Don\u2019t worry if you fear your answers aren\u2019t convincing enough at the moment. You can always look up more information on these roles to guide your final decision.\n\nWith that said, here are 5 Proven Tips to Help You Transition Into Tech:\n\n1. What transferable skills do you have?\n\nA sizeable number of people that transition to tech do so by leveraging their previously acquired skills\u2014though these skills are mostly no-code or non-technical. For instance, a Customer Service Representative at a local bank could easily transition to a similar role at a FinTech startup. A journalist or creative writer could try out technical writing and pick up really fast. Human Resource Managers/Recruiters in conventional companies would easily settle in as technical recruiters after a few months of training. The list goes on.\n\nWhat you should do is identify the skills you already possess and see what roles those could get you in tech. If you have your eyes set on an entirely different role (one that doesn\u2019t align with your current skills), check out the skills required for that role and how to go about acquiring them. Then go for it.\n\n2. Search for opportunities in industries where you have prior experience\n\nThis is in many ways similar to what we discussed above\u2014about seeking opportunities in tech where your previously acquired skills are a match. Say you\u2019re a Risk & Compliance Officer at a local bank; you can work the same job at a FinTech startup. A seasoned chartered accountant can head the Accounts & Finance unit at a tech startup. Medical doctors could, for instance, work as consultants at HealthTech startups offering home services. Product Managers can easily function across numerous industries. Conventional journalists and content creators could niche down and focus on reporting/producing content on tech and so on.\n\n3. Take courses & write a certification exam\n\nOne of the sure-fire ways to transition to tech is to learn the skill(s) required to function in specific areas of interest. A great way to achieve this is by taking online courses, registering for and joining boot camps and writing certification exams. Thanks to the internet, there now seems to be unlimited access to information allowing us to learn on our own.\n\nThe democratization of the internet has also brought about a rise in the number of digital platforms that help people acquire knowledge and learn new skills. Within a few months, you can go from being a complete outsider to becoming an entry-level professional, anywhere in the world.\n\nThis is where AltSchool Africa comes in. At AltSchool Africa, you can learn some of the world\u2019s most sought after tech skills and earn a top-rated diploma within 12 months. The school runs a number of coding and no-code learning programs that are stand-alone specialisations under its School of Engineering and School of Product respectively.\n\nFor instance, when you apply to the School of Engineering, you will have to select a specific area of specialisation among the following:\n\nFrontend Engineering Backend Engineering & Cloud Engineering\n\nHowever, for the no-code School of Product, you can choose to learn either Product Design, Product Management or Product Marketing.\n\nIs it possible to land a job in tech by just taking courses without certification? Yes. However, earning a certification badge from an institute of repute certainly opens more doors and gets you in much bigger rooms.\n\n4. Be on the lookout for Internships\n\nMany careers that began as internships have blossomed into highly successful vocations. Some of the most revered, most admired professionals today, started out as interns and managed to build their careers into the success we currently know them to be.\n\nInternships offer great learning opportunities and direct pathways to getting your first job in tech. Not only do you get the opportunity to learn directly from much more experienced professionals\u2013you could also be on your way to getting your first offer of employment. This, of course, is dependent on how well you perform during the period.\n\n5. Network. Network. Network\n\nThe opportunities you seek aren\u2019t coming to pay you a visit in the comfort of your home. You have to get out there and grab them. Your social capital will, to a large extent, influence your career trajectory.\n\nWho do you know? Who do they know? What do they know? What do they do?\n\nUnderstanding the power of networking and actively making time to build connections will help you grow personally and professionally. So, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll do:\n\nIf your LinkedIn has been inactive, it\u2019s time to power it up: That is a good place to start. Find people doing great work in your preferred field and connect with them. Genuinely engage them in conversations and keep an open mind during these discussions.\n\nYou could also look up startup founders and hiring managers in companies you have an interest in: Try to connect with them and send a properly worded message. Briefly introduce yourself and why you\u2019re reaching out. Remember to be courteous.\n\nAttend tech events: These events are the perfect place to network as attendance is primarily physical. You can walk up to stakeholders, politely introduce yourself and tell your story. If you\u2019ve completed all the necessary training and are now in search of a job, that would be a perfect place to pitch to startup founders and execs too.\n\nYou should also consider volunteering: A good number of startups are in the business of building communities and organizing events. Due to the workload which sometimes could get overwhelming, these startups seek to onboard volunteers to help out on a project temporarily. In some cases, volunteers are paid a stipend for the work they do. In reverse scenarios, they aren\u2019t. However, monetary benefits shouldn\u2019t be your primary concern here. Your focus must be on learning as much as you can, gaining insights into the workings of the space, identifying key players and expanding your social circle.\n\nVolunteering, when done right, puts your name on the lips of persons that have the capacity to get you your next job.\n\nJoin Tech Communities: As the ecosystem grows, stakeholders are beginning to appreciate the power of community; the need to bring key players and intelligent outsiders together to look inwards and map out strategies for continued growth.\n\nOne of the strategies designed to ensure said growth is the creation of smaller groups or communities dedicated to knowledge sharing, resource sharing, mentorship and access to opportunities. The primary targets of these communities are entry-level & intermediate professionals who are then guided by more experienced tech talent. Members of these communities often have a shared sense of responsibility to help each other grow.\n\nThere are communities for everyone. So, whether you\u2019re a Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Manager or Technical Writer, there is a place for you.\n\nOn a final note:\n\nIt is very much possible to transition into tech within one year. As a matter of fact, some have managed to make the switch in just a few months. Bear in mind that if you must transition and do it fast, you will have to simultaneously employ more than one of the methods mentioned above. For example, you could have direct, transferable skills but you may have to network and volunteer to access even bigger and better opportunities.\n\nThese methods also aren\u2019t set in stone. You could come up with other creative, honest ways to move several steps further and get to work.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s circle back to where we began:\n\nA quick guide on How to Transition into Tech in 1 Year?\n\nApply to AltSchool Africa\n\nApplications to the School of Product are currently open.\n\nReady to begin that journey?

In line with this, Enageed developed this initiative with the objective to improve the capacity of local community contractors and ensure their businesses continue to grow,\u201d Menkiti said\n\nSpeaking on the local capacity development initiative, the company Head of Supply Chain Management, Mr. Frank Emerua, said Enageed has put in extra efforts to properly engage with the community to facilitate their social license to ensure the safety of people and facilities, improve production and promote the sustainable development of all host communities thereby fostering economic growth.\n\nHe also stated that Enageed developed this initiative with the objective to improve the capacity of local community contractors and ensure their businesses continue to grow.\n\nEmerua explained that the theme \u201cConnecting our Communities to Endless Opportunities\u201d assumes significance, as Enageed believes that building human and social capital is a never-ending act and is integral to strategic community investments.\n\n\u201cEnageed is aware millions of people around the country still live in abject poverty without access to basic amenities, employment, health care, and education, Enageed is deliberate about the development of our communities. Enageed has gathered a rich combination of speakers who would be providing key lessons on fundamental 21st-century skills. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is critical in all sectors of the world\u2019s economy and is changing the way we live, work and do business.\n\n\u201cTo ensure community contractors have the right skills for an increasingly digital and globalized world, the ICT session which is a key component of this training would bridge that gap.\n\n\u201cAnother key component of the training is financial literacy which matters across many levels of our world economy. As such, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of financial literacy and inclusion. This session would ensure our contractors are more knowledgeable about finance in a way that is relevant to their business.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that the company\u2019s commitment to promoting healthy environment, has also led to the medical check-up which is being conducted for members of the community as safety and health is at the heart of its operation.\n\n\u201cEnageed is hopeful that this session will enlighten the community on how to stay healthy and will provide relief for people requiring eyeglasses and other basic health needs like hypertension, blood sugar and other health issues.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to ensure continuous development in the communities we operate in, and believe the skills learned and knowledge gained will better equip community contractors to improve the efficiency of their operations and grow their businesses. We therefore look forward to the future outcome of this training that will foster innovation and better economic development in the Ajoki Community,\u201d he declared.\n\nIn his goodwill message, the Secretary General of Ajoki Community, Scott Omesan, thanked Sahara Group for coming up with the initiative to foster better relationship between it and the host Community.\n\nOmesan promised that as a Community, \u201cwe shall do everything possible to protect the company\u2019s facilities in our domain.\u201d\n\nHe also added: \u201cWe also expect cooperation with the company for it to follow local content policy and best practices. There are some job the community can do. We are not going to struggle for jobs we cannot do.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s programme has given us the opportunity to learn more about ICT. Also, the medical outreach has afforded a lot of our people the opportunity to know their health statuses in the area of eye problem and others. Even the contractors among us, the programme will afford them the opportunity to know more as growing contractors and not to depend on the bigger contractors. So having such thing in Ajoki Community, I think the relationship between us and the company will continue to be cordial.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

I am sad to say that what ensued at the venue of the primaries highly threatens the credibility and integrity the APC has built over two political cycles. It is therefore a great disservice to my people and our great party, to be silent about such injustice.\u201d\n\nAhmad, who resigned his appointment in order to participate in the primary, maintained that election at the primaries stage requires delegates to cast their votes and a winner emerges with the majority votes.\n\nHe noted that this implies that there could not have been any voting process that occurred considering the majority of the delegates were neither allowed to vote nor even granted access to the venue.\n\n\u201cNo document that supposedly validates the election was signed by my agents because they were also denied access to the voting area.\n\n\u201cOn my arrival to the venue as an aspirant too, I was denied access to the voting area. My supporters who were around the premises for the primaries resisted the unjust treatment I was given and attempted insisting on my entrance into the voting area,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, due to his strong belief that his ambition was not worth anybody\u2019s life, he decided to vacate the premises in order to douse the friction and for the safety of the majority of the delegates and supporters who were being targeted by thugs.\n\nHe called on the stakeholders of the APC to, as a matter of urgency, save the reputation of the party by insisting on the members of the electoral committee to conduct a fresh, free and fair election.\n\n\u201cI would like to commend and extend profound gratitude to the delegates who despite the ill-treatment, refused to be intimidated by anyone. I would also like to send my appreciation to my supporters who have always been with me from the onset.\n\n\u201cTo be silent about the injustice we have experienced, is to disappoint those supporters. I implore all to be calm and remain the law-abiding citizens I know you to be because I still have faith in the APC that this spectacular blunder, we have experienced on May 27, 2022 shall be annulled and credible primary election shall be conducted,\u201d he said",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has eventually agreed to extend the deadline given for various political parties to conduct primaries ahead of 2023 general elections.\n\nA press statement by the commission\u2019s Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, on Saturday said the political parties now has between June 4 and 9, 2022 to conduct and conclude primaries.\n\nRead the full statement\n\n\n\nINDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nPARTY PRIMARIES AND SUBMISSION OF LIST OF NOMINATED CANDIDATES\n\nParty Primaries\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) met with the leadership of political parties today Friday 27th May 2022. Once again, the political parties requested the Commission to review the timelines for political party primaries provided in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the conduct of the 2023 General Election released on Saturday 26th February 2022.\n\nEarlier, the political parties had requested for 37 \u2013 60 days extension of the timeline for primaries and the nomination of candidates. The Commission was emphatic that this request could not be granted because it would disrupt other scheduled activities on the Timetable. This position of the Commission has not changed.\n\nHowever, based on the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election, the parties have now pleaded with the Commission to use the six-day period between 4th and 9th June 2022 to conclude outstanding primaries and prepare to upload the list of candidates and their affidavits on the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal. The Commission did not schedule any specific activity during this period. The idea is to simply give parties time to compile the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates before uploading same to the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal from 10th \u2013 17th June 2022.\n\nThe Commission has decided to allow the request of the political parties since the six-day period does not conflict with the next scheduled activity which is the submission of the list of nominated candidates or any of the subsequent timelines which remain sacrosanct. However, this request is granted in respect of outstanding primaries only without prejudice to those already concluded by political parties. The Commission will not monitor already concluded primaries.\n\nThe INEC Candidates Nomination Portal\n\nAfter the conduct of primaries, the next critical activity for political parties is the online submission of the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor which shall be accompanied by an affidavit sworn to by the candidates indicating that they fulfilled all the constitutional requirements for election into the various offices via the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal.\n\nIn addition, the Commission, based on past experience, has decided to train the political party officials to make efficient and effective use of the portal. The Commission will train four officials from each of the 18 political parties, making a total of 72 in all.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the political parties are still yet to submit their nominees for the training. The Commission hereby reminds such parties to do so immediately. The Commission wishes to reiterate that only electronically submitted nominations will be processed.\n\nPolitical parties are therefore advised to ensure that their primaries are free of rancour in order to meet the timelines for the remaining activities embodied in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election.\n\nFestus Okoye\n\nChairman, Information and Voter Education Committee\n\nFriday 27th May 2022\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "\u2018\u2026APC May 29 special convention shaky\u2019 \u2026NWC members still in the dark \u2013 Source \u2026Pro-Tinubu women warn on imposition\n\nThe Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa state capital, has ruled that former President Goodluck Jonathan was eligible to run for president in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nThe presiding judge, Justice Isa Hamma Dashen, gave the judgement on Friday.\n\nHe also held that Jonathan\u2019s right to vie for the office of president again \u201ccannot be stopped by any retroactive law.\u201d\n\nLagos lawyer Femi Falana had declared that Jonathan was ineligible to run for another term having been sworn in twice and served out the remaining term of the late President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, but the Law and Order Group disagreed over the eligibility of Jonathan to run for president in 2023.\n\nWhile Falana insisted that Jonathan cannot run by virtue of Section 137 (3) of the 1999 Constitution, the Law and Order Group disputed Falana\u2019s assertion.\n\nFalana, in a statement, said the former President has been disqualified by virtue of Section 137 (3) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cIt has been confirmed that former President Goodluck Jonathan has decided to join the APC for the purpose of contesting the 2023 presidential election. However, the former president is disqualified from contesting the election by virtue of Section 137 (3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended, which provides as follows:\n\n\u201cA person who was sworn in to complete the term for which another person was elected as president shall not be elected to such office for more than a single term.\n\n\u201cSome people have said that the amendment is not retrospective and therefore cannot apply to Dr. Jonathan. Assuming without conceding that the amendment is not retrospective it is submitted that under the current Constitution a President or Governor cannot spend more than two terms of eight years.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the Constitution will not allow anyone to be in office for more than a cumulative period of 8 years. In Marwa v. Nyako (2012) 6 NWLR (Pt.1296) 199 at 387 the Supreme Court stated that Section 180 (1) and (2)(a) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has prescribed a single term of 4 years and if a second term, another period of 4 years and not a day longer.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Governor Ladoja v INEC (2008)40 WRN 1 the Supreme Court rejected the prayer of Governor Ladoja for 11 months\u2019 extension to cover the period he was kept out of office through illegal impeachment. The Supreme Court rejected the prayer on the ground that a governor is entitled to spend a maximum period of eight years or less and not more than eight years.\n\n\u201cIt is not in dispute that Dr. Jonathan became the President of Nigeria in 2010 following the sudden death of President Umoru Yar\u2019Adua. He later contested and won the 2011 presidential election. Having spent five years in office as President, Dr. Jonathan is disqualified from contesting the 2023 presidential election. The reason is that if he wins the election, he will spend an additional term of four years. It means that he would spend a cumulative period of 9 years as President of Nigeria in utter breach of Section 137 of the Constitution which provides for a maximum two terms of eight years.\u201d\n\nBut the Law and Order Group, in a statement by its coordinator, Aliyu Mohammed, said: \u201cWe wish to categorically state that the said statement is erroneous and misconceived. In the first place, the 4th Alteration to the Constitution which introduced Section 137(3) was signed into law as part of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) by President Muhammadu Buhari on June 7, 2018.\n\n\u201cThe said Section 137 (3) contains a commencement date which is the date it was signed into law. Thus, the provisions of Section 137(3) of the 1999 Constitution (4th Alteration) became operative on June 7, 2018, and not any time before that date.\n\n\u201cThe law is settled beyond controversy or dispute that a law does not take effect retroactively. Again, it is the law that, where a piece of legislation sets out a specific commencement date, as in the case of Section 137 (3), all rights, duties, obligations, and interests created or intended to be created or imposed by that law will not be applicable to rights, events or duties which accrued or occurred before then. The case of Modu vs. FRN (2015) LPELR 4047 is very apt.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, Jonathan left office in 2015. The oaths of office that he took were taken prior to the enactment of Section 137(3). In a case decided by the Court of Appeal in 2015, the court rightly held that the oath of office sworn to by Jonathan on May 6, 2010, cannot be taken into account in the interpretation of Section 137(1) of the Constitution. It follows, therefore, that the only oath of office sworn by Jonathan is the one he took on May 29, 2011.\n\n\u201cAgain, it is not in dispute that Jonathan contested the presidential election in 2015 on the basis of the right which accrued to him. It follows, therefore, that Jonathan has the right to contest the forthcoming presidential election on the platform of any of the registered political parties in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny contrary position will be manifestly inconsistent with the provision of the Constitution which grants him the right to contest for any elective office in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThere were, however, speculations in various quarters that the party might be considering a former President Goodluck Jonathan as its flag-bearer.\n\nA Fulani group had obtained nomination forms for the former President, but Jonathan through a statement by his spokesman described the move as \u201can insult\u201d to him.\n\nIn a statement by his media adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president disowned the group that bought the forms for him and urged members of the public to disregard them.\n\nThe statement had read in part, \u201cIt has come to our notice that a group has purportedly purchased Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms, of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in the name of former President Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n\n\u201cWe wish to categorically state that Dr. Jonathan was not aware of this bid and did not authorise it. We want to state that if the former President wanted to contest an election, he would make his intentions clear to the public and would not enter through the back door.\n\n\u201cWhile we appreciate the overwhelming request by a cross-section of Nigerians, for Dr. Jonathan to make himself available for the 2023 Presidential election, we wish to state that he has not in any way committed himself to this request. \u201cBuying a presidential aspiration form in the name Dr. Jonathan without his consent, knowing the position he had held in this country, is considered an insult to his person. The general public is, therefore, advised to disregard it.\u201d\n\nAlthough an online media (not Blueprint) reported that the former President properly submitted the nomination forms bought for him secretly, it was not, however, clear whether the Bayelsa state-born politician had even joined the ruling party or not.\n\nShaky presidential primary\n\nMeanwhile, there is palpable confusion on whether or not the special convention slated for May 29 to elect the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the 2023 general elections will still be held.\n\nBlueprint reported Friday on the lack of preparations towards the said Sunday Convention of the ruling party.\n\nIt was further gathered that the lack of information and the body language of the presidency was responsible for the slow nature of the preparations to elect the party\u2019s flag-bearer.\n\nA reliable source in the party\u2019s national secretariat told our correspondent that \u201ceven the national officers (NWC members) cannot tell you the true position of things for now, because they too don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nTinubu support group\u2019s appeals\n\nIn a related development, a group of women who are supporters of one of the presidential aspirants, Bola Tinubu, has appealed to the national chairman of the party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, to ensure transparency and allow party delegates to choose a candidate of their choice at the forthcoming primary without any form of intimidation.\n\nThe group, under the aegis of Ondo state Women for Tinubu, also called on all APC delegates to ensure they elect the person of their choice as the presidential candidate without any harassment.\n\nThe leader of the group, Mrs. Bola Ige, in a statement issued Friday, said although there was a provision for a consensus candidate in the constitution, it should be a true consensus whereby all the aspirants would sign a written document \u201cto show they all agree to it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, there was a need to ensure transparency and allow party members to choose a candidate of their choice at the primary.\n\nThe group, while condemning what it termed \u201can attempt in some quarters to compel the delegates to vote for a particular candidate,\u201d urged the party leaders to desist from such an act and give all aspirants a level-playing ground.\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of justice, equity and fair play, our great party should allow all the presidential aspirants to go for the primary. Let the people determine who will be their president,\u201d Ige said.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "BY ONU OKORIE\n\nLagos: May 26, 2022: To encourage and simplify vehicle ownership for personal use by millions of Nigerians, First City Monument Bank (FCMB) now offers auto loans of up to N30 million at a reduced interest rate. The FCMB auto loan supports acquiring brand new and pre-owned vehicles (popularly known as \u201cTokunbo\u201d), with N500,000 as the minimum loan amount that a customer can access for a repayment duration of up to 5 years.\n\nThis affirms FCMB\u2019s commitment to improving the social well-being of individuals and enhancing access to credit for higher standard of living for families.\n\nCommenting on the unique value proposition, Divisional Head, Personal Banking of the Bank, Mr Shamsideen Fashola, said, \u201cvehicle ownership is one of the most exciting moments in a person\u2019s life. Yet, many people struggle to save up for a long time to make this dream come true. To bridge this gap, we created a value proposition that is flexible, convenient and empowers individuals, families and businesses to achieve the dream of vehicle ownership. Nigerians can now finance their dream vehicle with an auto loan from FCMB at a low-interest rate with monthly or yearly payment options depending on their income. We, therefore, urge the populace, including, but not limited to salaried individuals, to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfil their vehicle ownership dream\u201d.\n\nFCMB Auto Loan empowers qualified Nigerians to part-finance the purchase of brand-new and pre-owned vehicles while spreading the repayment between one and five years. The loan, which is dependent on the type of vehicle to be purchased, is open to salaried individuals and self-employed Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the number of registered vehicles in Nigeria is 13 million. However, vehicle ownership in the country has been declining because of increased prices. This is due to foreign exchange and importation challenges, leading to a drastic reduction in purchasing power and sales decline in the auto industry.\n\nA purpose beyond profit commercial banking institution, First City Monument Bank is a member of FCMB Group Plc, led by Ladi Balogun as Group Chief Executive. The Bank is committed to COVID-19 recovery, income equality and poverty reduction by easing credit constraints to disadvantaged individuals and small businesses. The intervention of FCMB in the automobile sector aligns with Goals 3 and 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus on well-being and reduced inequalities.",

Earlier in the week, a former Governor of Anambra State Peter Obi had defected from the party and days later, joined the Labour Party.\n\nHayatu-Deen\u2019s decision came hours after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) extended the deadline for the conduct of presidential primaries. Following the move, the All Progressives Congress (APC) fixed a new date for the party\u2019s presidential primary poll.\n\nBut the PDP, Nigeria\u2019s main opposition party, lambasted the electoral body for the decision, saying it amounted to changing the goalpost in the middle of a game.\n\n\u201cThe consequences will be grave for the country. And of course, we have to look at that,\u201d PDP spokesperson Mr. Debo Ologunagba said at the Velodrome of the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, the venue of the PDP primary poll\n\n\u201cThe bedrock of democracy is certainty of elections and the fact that the rules are clear to every participant, and you cannot shift the goalpost in the middle of the game.\u201d",

Once again, the political parties requested the Commission to review the timelines for political party primaries provided in the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the conduct of the 2023 General Election released on Saturday 26th February 2022.\n\nEarlier, the political parties had requested for 37 \u2013 60 days extension of the timeline for primaries and the nomination of candidates. The Commission was emphatic that this request could not be granted because it would disrupt other scheduled activities on the Timetable. This position of the Commission has not changed.\n\nHowever, based on the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election, the parties have now pleaded with the Commission to use the 6-day period between 4th and 9th June 2022 to conclude outstanding primaries and prepare to upload the list of candidates and their affidavits on the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal. The Commission did not schedule any specific activity during this period. The idea is to simply give parties time to compile the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates before uploading same to the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal from 10th \u2013 17th June 2022.\n\nThe Commission has decided to allow the request of the political parties since the six-day period does not conflict with the next scheduled activity which is the submission of the list of nominated candidates or any of the subsequent timelines which remain sacrosanct. However, this request is granted in respect of outstanding primaries only without prejudice to those already concluded by political parties. The Commission will not monitor already concluded primaries.\n\nThe INEC Candidates Nomination Portal\n\nAfter the conduct of primaries, the next critical activity for political parties is the online submission of the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor which shall be accompanied by an affidavit sworn to by the candidates indicating that they fulfilled all the constitutional requirements for election into the various offices via the INEC Candidates Nomination Portal.",

I am glad to inform Your Excellencies that the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs of Nigeria has continued to live up to its mandate in responding quickly to all situations of displaced persons and disaster management.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari said the ministry also broadened its scope of operations by caring for deprived school children in the country.\n\n\u201cThe ministry carries out a compulsory school feeding programme in primary schools across the country. This is to ensure that every child gets at least one balanced and nutritious meal daily.\n\n\u201cThrough the ministry, the government established Internally Displaced Persons camps in every part of the country for refugees, returnee migrants and displaced persons, where food, shelter, clothing, medical care and other livelihood support are provided for all displaced persons.\n\n\u201cWe also have introduced a Conditional Cash Transfer scheme, whereby a monthly cash transfer is made to the very poor and vulnerable in our society.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari welcomed the establishment of an African Union Humanitarian Agency to cater for the growing needs of displaced persons and refugees.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe rationale for the establishment of this Agency is to forge a common African position on humanitarian effectiveness and to create an appropriate continental architecture to effectively respond and coordinate humanitarian crises on the continent.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the African Union, government and people of Equatorial Guinea for providing the platform for leaders to deliberate and address pressing issues confronting the continent.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cYou will agree that this conference could not have come at a better time, considering the challenges posed by the increasing rate of Internally Displaced Persons, Refugees and Returnee Migrants, to our various countries and the continent at large.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, Mr. Chairperson, the world is confronted by emerging threats, such as Climate Change, resulting in global warming, rising levels in waters, in some climes shrinking of rivers and lakes.\n\n\u201cAll these lead to distortions in our aquatic and consequently ecological systems. Conflicts, violent extremism and terrorist attacks, including herdsmen-farmers clashes and banditry lead to the displacement of whole communities, thus rendering thousands of people homeless.\n\n\u201cIn the North-east of Nigeria alone, millions of people have been displaced, as a result of the Climate Change, which caused the shrinking of Lake Chad and subsequent loss of means of livelihood.\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, as we meet today in this historic city of Malabo to actualise our dreams to establish the African Humanitarian Agency, I congratulate you all for rising to the occasion.\u201d\n\nWhile pledging $3 million for the take off of the African Union Humanitarian Agency, the President also appreciated the Specialised Technical Committee for their hard work to produce the statutes.\n\nOn his part, the African Union Chairman and President of Senegal, Macky Sall, pledged $3 million on behalf of his country, urging other African leaders to contribute to the establishment of the humanitarian agency.\n\nThe AU Chairman said the rising challenges of climate change, natural disasters and terrorism had made it mandatory to set up an Agency that would meet the needs of displaced Africans.\n\nPresident of the host country, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, also pledged $4 million, with $2 million for the new Agency, while $2 million will go to Mozambique.",

          "title": "Tension As Atiku, Wike, Saraki Lock Horns at PDP Presidential Primary",
          "text": "After crisscrossing the country for weeks, consulting with delegates and stakeholders, 14 politicians aspiring to be the presidential candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023, will from Saturday face 810 delegates in Abuja who will pick one of them.\n\nAlso on Friday, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) extended the deadline for the conduct of party primaries to June 10 from the initial June 3, prompting speculations that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may shift its Presidential primary election hitherto scheduled for May 29 to 30.\n\nSome Northern elders, led by former National Security Adviser, Aliyu Gusau and former governor of Sokoto State, Attahiru Bafarawa, went into a crucial meeting Friday night, to try and reduce the Northern aspirants to one.\n\nSeventeen persons purchased the nomination and expression of interest forms for the PDP presidential ticket, two were later disqualified by the David Mark led screening committee; while two other aspirants, former governor of Anambra State Peter Obi and former banker Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, left the party and opted out of the race. So, 13 aspirants are contesting for the ticket of the PDP on Saturday.\n\nThe aspirants are former vice president, Atiku Abubakar; former Senate President, Abubakar Bukola Saraki; Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Anyim Pius Anyim; Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed; Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; Akwa Ibom Governor, Emmanuel Udom; boardroom guru, Sam Ohuabunwa; ex-Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose; Ovation Magazine publisher, Chief Dele Momodu; Olivia Tarela, who is the only female among them, Charles Okwudili and Chikwendu Kalu.\n\nHowever, the contest this weekend is expected to be a four-horse race involving Atiku, Wike, Saraki and Tambuwal.\n\nThe source said the Northern leaders felt Wike was getting stronger and may win the ticket if not checked.\n\nSaid the source: \u201cWith the departure of Peter Obi, Wike has gained more grounds in the South-east, while the aspirants from the North are divided. The Northern elders felt the only way to stop him was to present a single Northern aspirant at the convention. So, they are working to get two of the top three Northern aspirants to step down.\u201d\n\nAnother source added, \u201cIf Wike is allowed to win the primary, he can\u2019t win the presidential election. So, he must be stopped.\u201d\n\nThe refusal of President Buhari to sign the amended electoral act -Section 84(8) \u2013 to allow statutory delegates to vote at primaries, is also a plus for Atiku.\n\nWith reduced delegates from the South where the PDP dominates, the new geo-political distribution of the delegates favours Atiku.\n\nIn the earlier order, the Southern part of the country had more delegates because the PDP controls more states in the South. But with the exclusion of statutory delegates and with the provision that only elected delegates, one from each local government area, are eligible to vote during the convention, there is a shift in the balance of power between the North with more local government areas and the South with less local government areas.\n\nThis is where Atiku holds the ace. He is expected to get a bulk of the vote from the Northern delegates.\n\nAtiku\u2019s strengths are his experience, capacity and competence to address Nigeria\u2019s problems. He also knows Nigeria well enough and can balance the fault lines without crossing the lines.\n\nAtiku\u2019s major weakness remains his never disappearing corruption tag, which mere explanations have refused to clear. There are also questions about his age and health. Above all, he is categorised as part of the old order that brought Nigeria to its knees.\n\nSaraki is also a force to reckon with in the contest for the PDP\u2019s Presidential ticket. He was former President of the Senate between 2015 and 2019, a platform which availed him an opportunity to sell himself. Unlike many before him, Saraki made the office of the senate president very attractive and also drew attention to the fact that there was so much power and influence in being the nation\u2019s number three citizen.\n\nHis days as senate president also showed him off as a dogged fighter, who despite the various traps set in his way, triumphed, defeating the corruption label that his opponents had tried to hang on his neck.\n\nSaraki has shown capacity, competence and has experience also going for him. He clearly understands the issues and at every turn, has always intervened in the Nigerian project, proffering solutions to those knotty national concerns, even as a floor senate member.\n\nSaraki connects more with the youth and is very much in tune with global trends. His zone, the North-central, has been in the trenches for recognition, having been marginalised for many years. They consider now as their time.\n\nSaraki\u2019s major weakness is his state of origin, which is the first factor to count against him. Small Kwara in North-central has always been hard to place, either as a Northern or Southern state, realistically.\n\nWike is the third leg of today\u2019s four-horse race. He is believed to have also made in-roads into some places in the North. He also understands politics very well, even though his style is crude.\n\nBeing governor of an oil rich Rivers State is in itself a lot of advantage.\n\nWike has a lot of cash to throw around and with money, he has been able to buy loyalties and friends. This also accounts for why his reach transcends Rivers State.\n\nWike, without a doubt, lacks the character befitting of the office of the president. This is his major weakness: In virtually all his engagements, he throws decorum to the wind and treats his colleagues as if they are subservient. Unmindful of his integrity (if any), Wike is too reckless about his carriage. While he could actually undo many things, because of his money, he hardly can find the requisite support for his aspiration amongst his peers.\n\nMark: PDP Ready for National Convention\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of PDP\u2019s National Convention Organising Committee (NCOC), Senator David Mark has assured that arrangements had been made for a hitch-free exercise today.\n\nAddressing members of the committee of the Convention in Abuja ahead of the programme, Mark assured that the exercise would be smooth and transparent.\n\nHe told members of the committee to brace up to the challenges to ensure a credible exercise, saying \u201cyou must be absolutely transparent.\n\n\u201cIf you have any interest or bias for any of the aspirants, you can excuse yourself from this assignment,\u201d he said.\n\nMark maintained that the stage was set for a hitch-free programme as all logistics, materials and security have been sorted out.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are prepared for the exercise, virtually all our delegates have arrived Abuja.\u201d\n\nHe said the PDP had a track record of conducting peaceful congresses and conventions over the years, assuring that the outcome of this convention would make the party stronger.\n\nAccording to Mark, \u201cThe PDP has an array of eminently qualified persons to rule Nigeria. We carried out due diligence during our screening. I am confident that whoever emerges from the Convention will reflect the wishes of our party.\u201d\n\nSenator Mark and his committee members also inspected the facilities at the Velodrome, Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, venue of the Convention.\n\nThe Party is expected to elect its presidential flag bearer for the 2023 presidential election on Saturday.\n\nTight Security in Abuja\n\nAhead of the PDP primary scheduled for May 28 and 29 at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, the Federal Capital Territory Police Command has announced a robust security arrangement to ensure a hitch-free exercise.\n\nThe event is projected to be characterised by a high influx of people into the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cConsequent upon the above and in a bid to ensure a hitch-free event, the FCT Police Command has designed a robust security arrangement defined by a generous deployment within and without the election ground and to every nook and cranny of the Territory.\n\n\u201cThe deployment prioritises the protection of lives and properties of all and sundry by emplacing counter-insurgency measures, maintenance of clear road access, robust stop and search at strategic points around the suburbs and city center, effective crowd control, and intelligence gathering, \u201cit said in a statement.\n\nIt said the Commissioner of Police FCT Police Command, CP Babaji Sunday, while briefing the divisional police officers, heads of the various tactical and intelligence units of the command scheduled for the operation, charged them to be effective in discharging their duties with the utmost respect for fundamental human rights.\n\nHe, therefore, charged the good people of the FCT to go about the discharge of their lawful duties without the fear of harassment or molestation of any kind from any quarters.\n\nHe urged FCT residents to remain vigilant and report any suspicious or abnormal occurrence to the police.\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

As we speak, another round of strikes is going on and nobody knows when our public universities would be opened.\n\n\u201cIt is because of the foregoing that I found it morally compelling to introduce myself into the political space in order to provide tangible solutions to these problems. I was driven by passion and commitment to the cause of salvaging our country which is on the verge of collapse.\n\nMy exposure locally and internationally and contributions to the nation\u2019s economic and political-well being positioned me to take up the challenges facing our dear nation and \u2013 the courage to participate in this grueling exercise which most of our elites have shunned away from.\n\n\u201cRegrettably the political system has proved to be acrimonious, corrupt and self-serving.\n\n\u201cFor the past three months I had the privilege of intensively interacting with Nigerians from all walks of life. This reinforces my resolve that Nigeria MUST BE saved, otherwise our future is doomed.\n\n\u201cI joined the contest as a democrat, with an open mind to keenly contest and accept the result of a process that is fair, credible and transparent.\n\n\u201cWe have endeavoured to forge a consensus which would have facilitated a seamless emergence of a candidate which unfortunately could not be achieved.\n\n\u201cI wish to reiterate that I did not join party politics and to contest for the presidency because of personal gains and inordinate ambition, but in order to serve our country.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore based on personal principles and with great humility that I have decided after wide consultations to withdraw from this contest which has been obscenely monetized.\n\n\u201cI wish to thank all my supporters, especially those from my state, well-wishers, friends, family, the extraordinary hardworking young men and women of our campaign organization, the party leadership and members for their tremendous support which enabled us to contribute within this short period towards changing the character and direction of the Nigerian political landscape.\n\n\u201cFinally, as a very loyal party member and believer in the democratic process, I will continue to avail myself and my teeming supporters at all times to ensure victory of our great party.
