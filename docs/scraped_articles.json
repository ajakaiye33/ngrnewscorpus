          "text": "A pro-democracy group, #Citizens Searching for a President 2023, has started a nationwide search for a credible, patriotic Nigerian who will work for the good of all and \u201cnot give excuses.\u201d\n\nLeader of the group, Tom Abulu, who spoke in an interview in Abuja on Saturday, said the organisation, which is a non-profit, non-political, non-religious pro-Nigerian group, remains passionate and determined to change the leadership recruitment process in Nigeria for the better.\n\nHe said, \u201cSince independence in 1960, our common patrimony has been mismanaged by a set of individuals who, for the most part, were ill prepared, or, at best, accidental leaders.\n\n\u201cThe political system we have had has also helped in no small measure in ensuring that the worst of us make it to leadership positions either by buying their way or rigging the system to get into office.\n\n\u201cWe have decided to say enough is a enough. It is time to take Nigeria back from the brink of extinction.\n\n\u201cWe can begin to do this by ensuring that only men and women of proven integrity are given the chance to provide leadership at the highest level.\n\n\u201cTowards this end, ahead of the 2023 General Elections, we are launching a campaign to search for a man or woman who has what it takes to manage our diversity as a nation to harness the unique qualities that abound across the length and breath of this nation to enable us take our rightful place in the comity of nations.\u201d\n\nThe group argued that most Nigerians agree that the system we have today is not working and that we all deserve better than what we are currently getting .\n\nIt further said, \u201cGrinding poverty and insecurity have become the new normal that ought to be the case with the right kind of leader.\n\n\u201cWe intend to leverage on technology and lunch our search nationwide. We will announce the eventual winner when one is found at an event which will be streamed live across platforms.\n\n\u201cWe will receive and process nominations which will be taken through rigorous screening processes in conjunction with our partners in a transport manner.\u201d",

Chris Ngige, has said that as a developing country, Nigeria was unlikely to meet the recommendation of the United Nations and the World Health Organisation\u2019s ratio of one doctor to 600 patients.\n\nNgige said this at the two-day quarterly meeting of the Nigeria Health Commissioners Forum, on Friday, in Abuja.\n\nThe News Agency Of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the two-day Forum\u2019s theme was: \u201cBuilding a stronger health sector in Nigeria through collaboration and strategic partnership\u201d.\n\nThe meeting was primarily convened to discuss how to strengthen the health system at the sub-national levels, with an overall objective of achieving Universal Health Coverage(UHC).\n\nThe Minister said: \u201cwe\u2019re not a United Nations\u2019 country, we are a developing country. So, when such figures are given I will tell them every rule has an exception. We are not yet there\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, we shall make do with what we have. And when they\u2019re saying he said yes. Surplus doctors. We have surpluses I keep on telling them that we have not deployed our medical manpower proportionately, and adequately as we should do\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow many doctors do we have in the rural areas and in the suburbs since everybody is in the townships, with a medical and dental council data showing 4,000 doctors every year. Before, it used to be 3000, before the private universities came a lot of them are not doing medicine, including Afe Babalola and others\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are now in about 4000 plus, the people even trained abroad are coming back from Russia and Ukraine, and the rest of them all Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN), is registering them\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, almost everybody has come to Abuja, Lagos and Port Harcourt to stay. And we have 10,000 primary care centres that are unmanned as at the last count.\u201d\n\nProf. Akin Abayomi, Lagos State Commissioner for Health, called on state\u2019s governors to create an enabling environment for physicians in their states.\n\nAbayomi said that there were more than 20,000 Nigerian born physicians outside the country doing extremely well.\n\n\u201cThis is why our governors should create an enabling environment for our physicians. By now, Nigeria should not be talking about brain drain rather, it should be talking about bringing back our physicians to the country,\u201d he stressed.\n\nSpeaking on how the state was responding to COVID-19 pandemic, he noted that Lagos state used the experience it had acquired in 2015, when it responded to the Ebola outbreak.\n\n\u201cThis experience has helped us to effectively control the spread of the virus in the state despite, our huge population.\n\n\u201cWe had robust data collection supporting our policy decision making. We built a system of data collection, analysis and interpretation along the lines of each pillar of the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC).\n\nALSO READ: Controversy trails death of 55 yrs old woman in Lagos apartment\n\nWe then invested in technology to automate our data collection system through the information and implementation of the Lagos state emergency response system (LASERS), which allowed us to get data in real-time for our response.\n\nThe health commissioner, however, advised that the civil service should not be used to structure or manage any-pandemic, instead, a quick policy should be developed to raise funds for effective pandemic management, otherwise, the whole system would go down.\n\nAbayomi disclosed that Lagos was emergency ready to defeat an imminent deadlier fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics in the state, adding that the state had learnt from the first three waves.\n\nMeanwhile, The Director-General, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control(NCDC), Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, told the commissioners that states should play a critical role in strengthening the health security of the country.\n\nIhekweazu, who was represented Dr Priscilla Ibekwe, Director, Special Duties, NCDC, added that the state had the responsibility for the health of her population, including preparedness and response to outbreaks of diseases.\n\n\u201cStates have the resources, expertise and experience to strengthen the response to the coronavirus pandemic and other disease outbreaks in the country.\n\n\u201cWe need stronger political commitment, leadership, and funding to fight against any outbreaks,\u201d he added.\n\nDr Onoriode Ezire, Senior Health Specialist, International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group, said that conditions for inclusion of a state in a world bank project included; \u201cA common agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Executive Governors on a set of transparent eligibility criteria.\n\n\u201cStates will only be included in a project if the state\u2019s participation would contribute to a meaningful improvement of that development indicator.\n\n\u201dDemonstrated commitment to reform by that state and demonstration of ongoing commitment throughout the life of a project.\n\nREAD ALSO: COVID-19: Nigeria records 7 more deaths, 444 new infections\n\n\u201cThese include; meeting minimum performance criteria, adopting state legislation needed to establish an enabling environment for reform, and establishing the appropriate institutional framework to implement a reform program,\u201d he explained.\n\nEzire noted that the design of multi-state operations would pay close attention to ensuring conditions for mutual accountability of both the Federal and state governments.\n\nHe commended the \u201cFederal government for providing the enabling environment and a more level playing field for states, and states for delivering on the results to which they have committed, through their participation in the project,\u201d he said.\n\nIn her remarks, Cross River Health Commissioner, Dr Betta Edu, who spoke on behalf of the Commissioners said that the meeting was vital to promoting experience sharing, collaboration across states, learning and fostering of sub-national development towards building a resilient health system in the country.\n\nNAN recalls that the meeting focused on health issues such as the Basic Health Care Provision Fund; strengthening Primary Health Care; HIV/AIDS control with its multisectoral consequences; UHC, Health Insurance, as well as various high impact interventions being implemented either directly or with development partners.\n\nThe meeting also identified challenges and outlined the implementation of partnership support at the subnational level, and articulated measures to address them for adoption.\n\n(NAN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "A former Special Adviser and Director-General, Ekiti State Bureau of Public Procurement, Dr Bayo Arowolaju, has declared that ex-Governor Segun Oni surpassed other chief executives ever produced in the state in terms of performance.\n\nArowolaju described the event leading to Oni\u2019s removal by the appeal court on October 15, 2010, as an alleged high-level conspiracy against him by powerful politicians.\n\nDescribing Oni as incurably committed to lifting Ekiti to an enviable point in development index, Arowolaju maintained that Oni won both the 2007 governorship election and 2009 rerun polls, contrary to the position canvassed by the then Action Congress of Nigeria(ACN).\n\nArowolaju, in his congratulatory message in Ado Ekiti on Saturday, commemorating Oni\u2019s 67th birthday slated for September 5, 2021, revealed that the former governor\u2019s performance triggered agitations by the Ekiti masses that he should vie for the 2022 governorship.\n\nBy his ouster, the former Director General, Ekiti State Due Process Office, said the foundation for probity, transparency and economic liberation Oni laid for the people was scuttled by ill-feelings orchestrated \u201cby politics of bad-belle\u201d .\n\n\u201cDuring the tenure of Governor Segun Oni, Ekiti State almost became an Eldorado. There were regular and full payments of salaries and allowances to workers, effected promotions, payment of gratuities and pensions to retirees, employment of 4,000 youth into the public service, financial autonomy to local governments, legislature and the judiciary.\n\n\u201cIn the areas of education, students were given free lockers and benches in all schools, a school feeding system was initiated, scholarship for students to local and foreign higher institutions, supply of pipe borne water and improved electricity supply.\n\n\u201cSegun Oni\u2019s road revolution programme, where 24 roads were constructed simultaneously opened up the state as major, minor and feeder roads were solidly captured and reconstructed. The programme provided succour to different segments of the people.\n\n\u201cEkitis are still having the fond memories of a solid administration when health care services were not left behind, new hospitals and health centers were built throughout the state, world-class Cuban doctors\u2019 staffed Ophthalmological Center was built and a Central Pharmaceutical store was established in the State hospital putting an end to sale of fake drugs\u201d, Arowolaju said.\n\nEkiti 2022: Oni opposes zoning, says it will damage PDP\u2019s chances\n\nArowolaju lamented that the orgy of insecurity in the facets of banditry, kidnappings and killings that were alien to Ekiti have now resurged due to alleged ill-preparedness of those at the helm of affairs.\n\n\u201cOur Obas are no longer safe in their palaces. Not only did private car owners become ready targeted victims, but commercial transport patrons also have become victims that their driver unions are now openly protesting their insecurities.\n\n\u201cPoor farmers were not left out of terrorism by Fulani herdsmen, all who have virtually taken over the state from the lawful authorities as members of the state executive council are no longer immune from this malady of insecurity. Peace, security and safety that were taken for granted when Segun Oni as Governor has now eluded Ekiti,\u201d he said.\n\nArowolaju said the 2022 governorship poll presents a veritable opportunity for Ekiti masses to take their destiny in their hands and fight with their votes for a better alternative at the Primary and General Elections.\n\n\u201cAfter all, Japan, like Ekiti State has no drop of oil but quality brains like Ekiti people and they have succeeded and developed far more than some people with an ocean of oil. This had always been Oni\u2019s belief and that he would achieve it if returned as Governor in 2022,\u201d he said.\n\nOni was removed as the PDP governor of Ekiti State sequel to a petition filed by Governor Kayode Fayemi, the candidate of the ACN in the 2007 and 2009 main and rerun polls.\n\nI want to rescue Ekiti from total collapse \u2013 Segun Oni",

          "title": "\u201cTHERE WILL SOON BE NO WOMAN IN THE SENATE\u201d. -Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe",
          "text": "A very touching historical video by one Dumebi Kachikwu for ROOTS traced the history of women\u2019s political participation and advocacy way beyond the popular Aba women Riot of 1929 that many erroneously credit as the first major intervention in political issues by women in a colonial Nigeria.\n\nIn what appears like a passionate plea to Nigeria and African women to do what they know how to do best, he traced history to 1910 in Agbaja in present day Kogi state when women collectively stayed away from their homes for a month based on the suspicion that some men had been secretly killing pregnant women. This action, according to history pushed the elders in the communities to address their concerns.\n\nAgain in1924, three thousand women in present day Calabar took to the streets to protest the tolls imposed on markets by the colonial authorities. In the South West, women organizations like the Lagos Market Women Association, Nigeria\u2019s Women\u2019s Party and the Abeokuta Women\u2019s Union were pressure groups that actively took action to stop the colonial administration in their tracks. He recalled too that the Aba Women Riot of 1929 was a collective action that defied tribes and religion. The women pushed for justice and equity and even though some of them were killed in the process, they still won as they achieved some of the aims of their protest.\n\nIn tracing the history of women\u2019s standing up to the colonial administration in Nigeria, Ukachukwu is beckoning on women to remember that the they have always been active participants in the political sphere. He therefore wants women to stand up and own their positions in both the country and continent.\n\nAt the Roundtable Conversation however, we realize that the fact that Rwanda presently has the global highest number of women in parliament at 61.1% does not erase the fact that women seem to have taken a back seat in African political issues. Understandably, the 1994 genocide is a contributory factor there is a clarion call on women to intervene in the development of the country and continent. The female power is still unmistakably valid at all times and now is no different.\n\nThe Roundtable Conversation for long has identified the effects of the lack of gender parity in Nigerian political space seeing that Nigeria with a population of more than two hundred million has one of the lowest gender representations in parliament with a paltry 6.9%. What this portends is that the Nigerian political space still excludes women as a carryover of the colonial mono governance structure that reordered the traditional African complimentary leadership that existed before the white men came to, in Achebe\u2019s words, put a knife to that which held us together as a people and things have fallen apart.\n\nThe Roundtable Conversation sat down with the Senate Minority leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe who had penultimate week delivered a Keynote speech at the inaugural annual conference of Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo with the theme, \u201cEnhancing Women\u2019s Participation and Partnership in governance and Development\u201d. The Socio-Cultural Group of professional women believes that we all must join in the conversation to find a solution to the leadership question in ways that gender should not be a barrier for competent and willing women to win elections in a democracy.\n\nThe Senator startled everyone when he pointedly declared that, \u2018If nothing is done and urgently too, there will soon be no woman in the Senate\u201d. He should know, he is in a Senate of 109 members with a paltry seven female senators! A House of Representatives with 360 members has only 22 women. Most state houses of assembly have no woman at all and those that have do not make up to 5% of the total number. No woman in Nigeria has won a governorship seat since 1999.\n\nAccording to the Senator, the reality is that the number of women has been on the decrease since 1999. He said Nigeria must take decisive actions to make the political space more inclusive of women. However, modern politics according to him requires education and the literacy rate especially for women across some regions is still very low. So first things first, education of all our children, males and females must be a priority if we must get ahead in a world ruled by ideas and technology. The leaders in parts of the country where the literacy rate for women is very low according to the statistics of UNICEF, UNESCO and WHO must make education of the people a priority just like they make that of their children.\n\nAsked what he has done as a legislator to bring his fears to the fore and get his colleagues to act, he said that he had always advocated that we have to increase the number in the federal system to bring in more women. If certain appointments are based on Federal character, can Nigerians not realize that there is no gender parity in the Nigerian political space? Is the sense of justice limited to appointments in a country in dire straits that desperately needs the input of women in a complimentary leadership style?\n\nHe also has been pushing for a renewed legislative agenda in changing the laws to reflect the current realities in global politics. However, it is often a herculean task to get the majority to see the real danger in playing the ostrich. Some would often quote the constitution as it concerns federal character but see advocacy for political inclusiveness in another light. So if we can balance appointments, why not revisit our laws for gender balance? While we acknowledge the nuances of culture and religion we continue to push and persuade them to see the current dynamics as not very intrusive in that regard. We continue to knock on the doors hoping it works someday. We must continue to push for implementation.\n\nAsked whether women in politics are doing enough to help their gender, he said the same acculturation men are exposed to are the same for women too because you often see women not supporting fellow women seeking elective positions. So women in politics often have to work twice as hard as the men before they get results. Women must learn to sustain the unity they have at the rural community levels in party politics. They can work better with the sense of team unity that guides their interactions at the community levels nationally. Unfortunately it does seem they do not seize those moments.\n\nFundamentally, Nigerians must take stock. We can look around and see that the chicken has come home to roost. When women are uneducated, there is likelihood of early marriage and with marriage as a child bride, many things might follow. There are chances of the child-bride dying in pregnancy or labour due to reproductive issues which increases the maternal mortality, some might get the almost disabling condition of Vestico Vaginal Fistula (VVF) which subsequently makes them unproductive. An illiterate mother has less chances of raising well balanced kids nutritionally and mentally.\n\nThe numbers of uneducated and unskilled youths that cause most of the social ills that affect all of us are all products of a system that relegate women to the background. Ironically, most of the political elites understand the implication because their own kids neither miss education nor do they become child brides.\n\nNigerians must begin to think beyond today. The idea of focusing on the short term is a huge problem in any nation that desires development. Our short term plans are very destructive to any nation. Nations have fifty, hundred and fifty years strategic development plans. It seems we are a country of here and now. The earlier we begin to address gender parity in the country the better for everyone. We have to be more discerning and make better choices.\n\nThe senator believes that political parties must begin to do intra party re-strategizing to chat a better political culture that can bring a change. The essence is for political parties to begin to create the template that can engender more inclusiveness and with it the development we all seek.\n\nWe must as a nation agree that democracy that must be viable must stop seeing women in leadership as \u2018kind gesture or mere tokenism\u2019 to the female gender. There must be a reorientation for us all to realize that development in the twenty first century works better with complimentary leadership with women who have shown capacity and readiness to serve.\n\nThe serious issue of the decreasing number elected women across the country since the return of democracy in 1999 is an ill-wind that blows no one or region any good. It is a global truth that most countries including Nigeria with fewer women in leadership are not doing too well developmentally.\n\nThe recent pandemic across the globe has also shown the capacity of women leaders in other climes as most of the countries with female leaders statistically have done better at containing the spread of the virus and subsequently its effect on their economies. It is wrong to assume that gender parity is a favour to women. No, it is not, it is a way of life that dates back to pre-colonial and colonial periods.\n\nThe Amazons of Dahomey \u2013 present day Benin Republic got their title from their leadership gallantry against the French colonialists. Queen Amina, Idia, Moremi and a number of other historical women leaders are legends today that have earned prime historical positions even better than most men of their era. The myopia of the political leaderships in all regions must give way to better long term vision and plans. The divine that made us men and women thought of partnerships in more things than reproduction and home keeping.\n\nThe dialogue continues\u2026",

By that time, my father was already big in the industry. I had options of studying any other course and grow under his wings. But first, I decided to study Theatre Arts. I graduated in 2003 and did my National Youth Service Corps in 2004/2005. From then, I started hustling and my journey started from here in Enugu. There were times I would board night bus from Enugu to Lagos just to attend some auditions that didn\u2019t work. They would not choose me and I would come back.

          "text": "From John Adams, Minna\n\nArmed bandits in their large numbers, on Friday night invaded Magami community in the Shiroro local government area of Niger state killing no fewer than 20 villagers in what source close to the community said was a reprisal attack by the gunmen.\n\nA number of the villagers are said to be missing after the night attack while several others fled to neighbouring communities for safety.\n\nIt will be recalled that on Wednesday night, the men of the Special Security Task Force, comprising the Police, Local Hunters and Vigilante, launched an attack on the bandits, killing about 40 of them and recovered 16 motorcycles including arms and ammunitions mostly AK47 rifles.\n\nHowever a spokesman of the Concerned Shiroro Youths, Mallam Yusuf Abubakar Kukoki who confirmed the latest killings by the bandits to our correspondent on a telephone on Saturday morning, said the bandits came in their numbers, unleashing terror on members of the community in the night.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cRealizing that the combined team of Police Special Force, Hunters and local Vigilantes who had earlier inflated heavy casualties on them had returned to their Base at Galadima Kogo, the bandits mobilized and returned like a pride of wounded lions killing people at sight. They murdered and butchered their victims with dangerous weapons. Unfortunately, the unarmed, peaceful and defenseless locals are now at the receiving end.\n\n\u201cBy a reliable records, no fewer than fifteen people have gruesomely been murdered by the marauding criminals. Six people were confirmed dead at Unguwan Magiro under Madaka Ward, Rafi local government area, four people at Farin Hula and five people at Magami and environs all under Manta Ward of Shiroro local government while scores of others are still missing \u2013 probably killed too\u201d Kukoki said.\n\nThe Kukoki stated further that many villagers have now fled to Kuta headquarters of the local government and other neighboring villages where they are now staying as Internally Displaced People.\n\n\u201cKuta the headquarters of Shiroro local government which is considered a safer ground is swelling up with fleeing IDPs who have since vacated the troubled areas scampering helter skelter for shelter, peace and security\u201d Kukoki said in the statement.\n\nKukoki suggested that the \u201cOnslaught against criminals need to be a sustained one in order to avoid a replica of this nature\u201d adding that: \u201csustained operation can go a long way in halting or avoiding any possible reprisal that could result into unwanted casualties\u201d.\n\nThe Concerned Shiroro Youths, he said is therefore calling with \u201ca loud voice on the authorities concerned to immediately mobilize security personnel as well as local Vigilantes and station same at Magami which is now the epicenter of atrocities being perpetrated by dreaded criminals so as to restore security in the area\u201d.\n\nThis, according to him, will guarantee peace and enable the locals to continue with their lawful and legitimate activities.\n\nAll efforts to get the reactions of the Chairman of the Local Government Council Alhaji Sulaiman Chikuba on phone was abortive as he did not pick up his cell phone despite several calls made to it\n\nA government official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the attacks on Kukoki, Bassa, Magami and Madaka villages saying \u201cthey attacked and kill many people but the number is yet to be ascertained\u201d.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer Niger State Police Command DSP Wasiu Abiodun when contacted promised to get back to our correspondent but did not do so until the time of going to press.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "By Philip Nwosu\n\nThe Consul General of Brazil to Nigeria, Ambassador Francisco Carlos Soares Luz, has called for more cooperation between the Nigerian Navy and his country\u2019s navy to enable both countries give a bite to the fight against piracy.\n\nAccording to Ambassador Luz, fighting piracy in the Gulf of Guinea is important, as the success in the fight will improve the economy of both coastal states and land lock countries.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the end, the activities of piracy will raise the cost of products for everyone, especially the landlocked countries. They will have to pay more for those things. Brazil and Nigeria share the Atlantic Ocean as a border. So having our border safe is important for everyone and I think no cost is too expensive to keep the Atlantic Ocean safe.\u201d\n\nAmbassador Luz, who spoke during the visit of the crew of the Brazilian Navy Ship (BNS) Independencia to the Western Naval Command in Lagos, said: \u201cThis kind of operations is what we should do often. It will bring our countries together and our relationship has shown the reality in Nigeria and Brazil navies that we have so much in common and we must ensure we make the relationship the same.\u201d\n\nAlso the Flag Officer Commanding (FOC), Western Naval Command, Rear Admiral. Jason Gbassa said that a recent report of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) indicates skeletal activities in the operations of pirates within the Gulf of Guinea, expressing the readiness of the Nigerian Navy to contain them.\n\nAdmiral Gbassa, who was represented by the Chief Staff Officer of the Command, Rear Admiral Habila Zakaria, said the force had engaged pirates in the Gulf of Guinea that the achievement of the navy in that area was possible because of Nigerian Navy\u2019s collaboration with other foreign navies in conducting sea exercises that ultimately improved security at the area.\n\nAccording to the FOC, the Brazilian Naval Ship (BNS) Independencia also visited the country for a maritime interdiction mission code named \u2018GUNEX\u2019 in the Gulf of Guinea. He added: \u201cBy and large, the Nigerian Navy has done much to ensure that the maritime environment is deprived of any form of illegalities.\n\nGbassa said that Nigeria and Brazil had come a long way and that both countries had a lot of bilateral agreements, one of which was in defence.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Anti-open grazing law: Miyetti Allah mocks southern govs",
          "text": "By Vincent Kalu, Lukman Olabiyi, Lagos; Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu; George Onyejiuwa, Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri; Judex Okoro, Calabar; Paul Osuyi, Asaba; Lateef Dada, Osogbo; Tony Osauzo, Benin, Obinna Odogwu, Awka and Joe Effiong, Uyo\n\nThe Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore has mocked the17 Southern Governors for their failure to meet the September 1 deadline they set for themselves to enact and begin to implement the anti-open grazing laws throughout Southern Nigeria. Speaking to Saturday Sun on the issue, the National President the group, Abdullahi Bodejo said that his members knew that the Southern governors would not come together to speak with one voice on the matter when it comes to implemenatiaton. Bodejo who accused them of coming together for ulterior motive, 2023 politics and an agenda to take over Fulani cattle-rearing business, threatened to drag the states that have enacted such laws to court.\n\nBut insisting that their collective will to do so is still on course, aides and spokesmen of some of the 17 Southern governors that took the collective decision at their Asaba meeting to enact a law banning open grazing of cattle across the states that fall under the zone, have opened up on why the states couldn\u2019t meet the September 1, 2021 deadline set for the implementation.\n\nOf the 17, only six, namely, Abia, Ogun, Oyo, Ekiti, Ebonyi, Imo, and Enugu have in place an anti-open grazing law. In fact, Enugu just passed its own on September 2, less than 24 hours after the expiration of the deadline. Though no official statement was issued as to why the state missed the deadline, a privileged source from the State Assembly attributed the delay to the magnitude of harm open grazing had caused the state. The House, he said, was careful to make extensive consultations with all stakeholders to ensure that the bill meet the required goal for the good of all. The source noted that what was important \u201cis that the bill has been passed and I know Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi will not waste time in signing it into law.\u201d\n\nFive states, namely Rivers, Delta, Osun, Ondo, Bayelsa and Akwa Ibom are in the process of complying. But some of the states like Anambra, Lagos, Imo, Edo, and Cross River who were reported earlier as ignoring the agreement has come out to deny the report.\n\nIn Imo, the State Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General, Mr Cyprain Akaolise insisted that there was no need to come up with another anti-open grazing law as the state already has one banning open grazing of cattle in restricted areas of the state, including the state capital. This, he explained, is much better than the kind being proposed by the southern governors.\n\nAccording to him, Imo State Law No. 9 of 2006 signed by Chief Achike Udenwa, former Governor of Imo State on 19th January 2007 did not call for total ban but prohibition of cattle grazing in restricted areas of the state. \u201cA cattle herder cannot take his cattle into cultivated land within Imo State,\u201d he said. \u201cSo but the herdsmen could do their grazing in the forest. The other states should copy our own law.\u201d\n\nLike Imo, Cross Rivers State too claims to have passed its own law in 2017, four years before the Southern Governors Forum came up with the resolution at the Asaba meeting. Speaking on the matter, the former Speaker of Cross River House of Assembly, Rt Hon William Jonah Eteng, disclosed that the state was one of the earliest to pass law against open grazing.\n\nGaul, Speaker between 2015 and 2019, however noted that the law was not, and has not been assented to by Governor Ben Ayade. According to him, the lawmakers went for the traditional ranching because they don\u2019t have empty land neither does their culture permit movement of cattle from one place to another because the people engage in arable cropping of vassals, yams, cocoyam and maize.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe don\u2019t support open grazing in our state. But if it is the culture in the North to move cattle around, no problem. The President under our present constitution does not have land to give anybody because with the 1975 Land Use Act, the lands are under the management of state governors.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom, the Executive is yet to send the bill to the State House of Assembly.\n\nChief Whip of Osun State House of Assembly, Hon. Lekan Olatunji, also claimed that the legislators have passed the bill but added that the Governor Adegboyega Oyetola is yet to sign it. \u201cWe recently passed a bill to regulate animal grazing and establishment of cattle ranches in the state,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just awaiting the Governor\u2019s consent and I\u2019m sure that will be done very soon.\u201d\n\nHowever, it was gathered that the bill was not forwarded to the office of the governor till he travelled out recently. But speaking on the matter, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor, Ismail Omipidan assured that the governor would surely sign the bill if it is on his table. He added that the governor just returned to the state on Wednesday, September 1.\n\nIn Lagos, the State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, assured that very soon, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu will sign into law the Anti-open grazing Bill which he said, was already before the state House of Assembly for consideration.\n\nNoting that the executive arm of government had deliberated on the bill and deemed it worthy before passing it to the State House of Assembly to do the needful, he added that the moment the House of Assembly passed the bill, the governor would append his signature to make it law in the state.\n\nBut investigation by Saturday Sun shows that the bill is being worked on in both Edo and Delta States. The Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Hon. Marcus Onobun, who spoke on the matter, attributed the delay to the recess embarked upon by the members while assuring that the bill will soon be passed as it is being worked on. On their own part, the Delta State Commissioner for Information, Charles Aniagwu, assured that the Governor Ifeanyi Okowa-led administration would ensure that the bill is implemented as a step towards promoting healthy and harmonious living among farmers and herders.\n\n\u201cNo state can even start implementation immediately because after passing the bill and assenting to it, you need to give people time to adjust. You need to give the herders time to either return their cattle or build ranches,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now in Delta, we are still going to be seeing cattle on the streets because the law has not been enacted and we have not started implementation.\u201d\n\nHe attributed the delay in passing the law to the dissolution of the State Executive Council shortly after the decision to ban open grazing was taken by the southern governors. But then he insisted that the September 1, 2021 deadline was not for the implementation of the ban but for the passage of the bill and enactment of the law.\n\nOf the lot, Anambra may end up as one of the states that will not implement the decision, as there is no indication to that effect. The State Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment in the state, C. Don Adinuba, when contacted, simply told Saturday Sun that he did not participate in the Asaba meeting; and that his principal, Governor Willie Obiano, has not briefed him on his position on the matter.\n\nA member of the state House of Assembly representing Nnewi North Constituency, Nonso Okafor, who claimed to have been planning to move a motion in that regard, however, noted that the plan did not materialise before they went on their annual recess.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

Gbasam of the Degema Judicial Division vacation court, Rivers State had, few days back, granted an interim injunction restraining Secondus from parading himself as chairman and member of the PDP, sequel to the consideration of an ex parte application filed by two members of the party against Secondus and the PDP.\n\nBut last Thursday, Justice Nusirat Umar of the Kebbi State High Court ordered Secondus to return to his position, saying she was satisfied after reading the affidavit of the respondents that an interim order should be granted on the purported suspension of Secondus pending the determination of the case.\n\nBased on the favourable court ruling, Secondus resumed on August 27, only for another court in Calabar, Cross River State, to restrain him from parading himself as the National Chairman of the party.\n\nKwankwaso, who spoke on the PDP crisis yesterday in an interview with BBC Hausa, said the crisis \u201cis heightened by those who are after leadership of the party.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNow, the strength of the party has reduced, and in the end, what will happen is that it will tear us apart.\n\n\u201cYou see, the result will not help us, since we do not have a president and we do not have many governors.\n\n\u201cPeople like me have nothing to do with the crisis. I\u2019m after what will bring development to people; every good leader should focus on that.\n\n\u201cThe party chairman has only one month left. I think it\u2019s better to wait so that we can emerge stronger.\n\n\u201cBut the crisis is heightened by those who are after leadership. They are not doing it for the betterment of their people.\u201d\n\nThe opposition party has lost several key members to the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a result of its internal crisis.\n\nUche Secondus, the embattled National Chairman of the PDP, has been under increased pressure to resign from office.\n\nFollowing the court ruling in Calabar restraining him from parading himself as the national chairman of the party PDP\u2019s national working committee (NWC) named Akinwonmi, the National Deputy Chairman (South), as the acting chairman.\n\n\u2018God Brought Ganduje and I Together\u2019\n\nKwankwaso also spoke of his recent encounter with his successor in Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje, at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja.\n\nThe former governor said he had spent hours in the departure hall when he received information that Ganduje was also on his way to the airport.\n\n\u201cI said it\u2019s okay, God has brought us all together. The place is like a park or station. Nobody can ask someone to come or not to. So he came and we greeted each other.\n\n\u201cWe boarded the same plane and landed at the Kano Airport. I sat on the front seat, so I came out first.

          "text": "Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nWith the dusts raised by the legal challenges to the status of Mai Mala Buni as the interim Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yet to settle, coupled with the ward congresses of the party that ended in crisis in some states still generating controversy, the APC is today going ahead with local government congresses.\n\nA High Court sitting in Asaba had restrained Buni and other members of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee from acting or parading themselves as such until the determination of a substantive suit before the court.\n\nThe trial court by Justice Onome Marshal Umukoro, also put on hold the local government congress scheduled for Saturday, September 4, 2021 in Delta State.\n\nBut Buni, in a statement issued by his Director General of Press, Mamman Mohammed, on Thursday insisted that he was never restrained by the High Court order in Delta State.\n\nHe added that the restriction of the forthcoming local government congresses was limited to Delta State and did not affect other states.\n\nBuni, Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC, noted that some mischief makers, who never wished the party well, had continued to misrepresent the facts without having access to the court ruling.\n\nThe crisis generated by the judgement of the Supreme Court in the Ondo governorship election petition, has also left the APC in tatters.\n\nThe split judgment of four against three by the seven member Supreme Court justices, which sat on the Ondo governorship election petition, had contended that the reason it did not sack Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the state, was because the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its governorship candidate in the October 10, 2020 election, Eyitayo Jegede, failed to join Mai Mala Buni, even when the issues revolved around him.\n\nMany stakeholders of the APC argue that all congresses be suspended, because holding such under the leadership of Buni, portend serious problem for the party, by the time the consequences begin to manifest before and after the 2023 polls.\n\nThe Supreme Court judgement apparently questioned Buni\u2019s continued stay, both as national chairman of the party and governor of Yobe State.\n\nSection 183 of the 1999 constitution unequivocally forbids a sitting governor from combining his office with any other job, both as executive positions, same as Article 17 (iv) of the APC constitution.\n\nNotwithstanding objections to the continuation of the APC congresses because of the status of Buni, the Buni-led interim leadership of the party insisted that today\u2019s congresses in the local governments should go ahead as planned.\n\nBuni, in a statement yesterday, called on the officials handling the local government congresses across the country to just and fair to all aspirants.\n\nBuni in the statement issued by his Director General of Press and Media, Mr. Mamman Mohammed also urged members of the party to conduct themselves peacefully.\n\nHe said the Congress \u201cis a family affair that should be executed without rancour in the interest of the party. We should all abide by the rules governing the election to remain a role model to other political parties.\u201d\n\nBuni added: \u201cThe leadership of the party has substantially complied with the dictates of the party constitution to promote internal democracy for the success of the congresses.\u201d\n\nThe chairman charged the aspirants to respect the rule of the game and embrace the spirit of sportsmanship in the outcome of the Congress.\n\nHe commended the enthusiasm demonstrated by members of the party to elect leaders at the local government level.\n\nThe Chairman assured that the party would address all anomalies that were employed to manipulate the election results.\n\nHe called on aggrieved members to channel their complaints through the constituted channels to seek redress.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Tells INEC to stop acting on orders of trial court\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Court of Appeal, Abuja, has declared Valentine Ozigbo as the authentic candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in the forthcoming November 6 governorship election in Anambra State.\n\nThe appellate court made the declaration yesterday while delivering ruling in two appeals filed against the judgment of Justice Obiora Nwabunike of Anambra State High Court in Awka, which recognised Senator Ugochukwu Uba as the party\u2019s candidate in the November 6 governorship poll.\n\nBoth Ozigbo and the PDP, in two separate suits marked: CA/AW/223/2021 and CA/AW/234/2021, had approached the appellate court to challenge the decision of Justice Nwabunike, on the grounds that the lower court erred in law when it arrived at a decision affirming Uba as candidate of the PDP in the forthcoming election.\n\nWhile the PDP in its own suit argued that it conducted its primary in accordance with the provisions of the law and its guidelines on June 26 at the Professor Dora Akunyuli Women Center, Ozigbo claimed he emerged candidate of the party at that same primary having won majority of the votes cast.\n\nThey therefore urged the court to set aside the judgment of Justice Nwabunike and declare the primary held at the Professor Dora Akunyuli Women Center as legal, lawful and constitutional, and that the candidate from that primary be declared as candidate of the PDP in the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State.\n\nDelivering judgment in the two appeals yesterday, a three-member panel of the Court of Appeal, held that the appeals were meritorious and after allowing them, went ahead to set aside the decision of Justice Nwabunike of the High Court of Anambra State which had earlier declared Senator Uba as PDP\u2019s candidate.\n\nThe panel, in the unanimous decision delivered by President of the Court of Appeal, Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, held that the primary election held at the Professor Dora Akunyuli Women Center, Awka, which produced Ozigbo as PDP candidate, was conducted in line with the law and the PDP guidelines.\n\nWhile declaring as an aberration the parallel primary held at Saint Paul University, the Court of Appeal berated Justice Nwabunike for sitting as an appellate court over the judgment of Justice Olukayode Adeniyi of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court.\n\nThe panel faulted Justice Nwabunike for not only rubber-stamping the decision of Justice Adeniyi but also sitting as an appeal over a court of coordinate jurisdiction.\n\nJustice Adeniyi of an FCT High Court had in a judgement ordered the Chukwudi Umeaba faction to conduct the June 26 primary which produced Uba, having sacked the PDP leadership in the state.\n\nSimilarly, Justice Nwabunike in his own judgment enforced the earlier decision of Justice Adeniyi, recognising Umeaba\u2019s faction as the authentic leadership of the PDP in Anambra State to conduct the primary for the November 6 governorship poll.\n\nBut in their judgment, the three member panel held that it was convinced that the primary conducted by the PDP at the Professor Dora Akunyuli Women Center was valid having been done in compliance with the law and party guidelines.\n\nThe panel faulted the primary held at the Saint Paul University on the same day, which produced Uba because it was contrary to the law and the party\u2019s guidelines, adding that INEC in line with the law supervised only the primary at Professor Dora Akunyuli Women Center.\n\nWhile accusing politicians of forum-shopping, the panel wondered why a litigant would take a matter which happened in Anambra before a court in the FCT and then return to Awka to seek enforcement of Adeniyi\u2019s judgment.\n\nThe panel took turn to take swipes at lawyers who enable litigants to abuse the court\u2019s processes, stressing that relevant bodies like the NJC and the NBA must take decisive actions against culprits.\n\nJustice Dongban-Mensem, while urging INEC not to allow itself to be distracted in preparation for the election, advised the Commission to wait for the decision of the final court in the land and not hurriedly rush to comply with the judgment of the trial court.\n\nAfter granting the two appeals and setting aside the judgment of Justice Nwabunike delivered on July 19, 2021, the court accordingly ordered Uba to pay Ozigbo and PDP N10 million each as cost of the litigations.\n\nPDP Savours Judgment\n\nThe PDP yesterday said it received with delight the judgement of the Court of Appeal, which affirmed Ozigbo\u2019s candidature for the November 6, 2021 Anambra State governorship election.\n\nThe party in a statement, signed by Kola Ologbondiyan, the National Publicity Secretary, commended the judiciary for restoring peace and unity in the PDP, as well as strengthening the confidence of the people in the PDP ahead of the election.\n\nThe PDP noted that with the judgement, the time had come for all members, critical stakeholders and teeming supporters of the party to unite as a family to work in the interest of the party and its candidate, Ozigbo, knowing that the people of Anambra State were waiting for the PDP to restore the loses of the past years under the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA).\n\nThe PDP thanked all stakeholders of the party for their resilience in keeping its ranks closed despite the challenges, while enjoining all members to put the past behind and work in the renewed hope that awaits them on November 6.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "With Awabah, Tunji Andrews wants to make pensions as popular as banking",
          "text": "Between November and December 2020, Tunji Andrews co-piloted a project to help informal workers save for the future. Those efforts culminated in the January rollout of Awabah, a digital platform that provides micro pension access to self-employed Nigerians and informal workers.\n\n\u201cMany people in Nigeria and Africa do day-to-day financial transactions in markets but don\u2019t have access to the benefits that the formal financial system offers,\u201d Andrews told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cSo when I wanted to get into the fintech space, it had to be something that would drive financial inclusion on a very strong basis.\u201d\n\nA flexible, \u20a6500 plan\n\nCo-founded with Tina Ajishebiyawo and Gboyega Olatunde, Awabah Nigeria automates micro-pensions and target-savings for self-employed Nigerians and workers in the informal economy. An understanding of the unique characteristics of its target market has been key to Awabah\u2019s operations and ensuring last-mile delivery.\n\nLower-income members of the informal economy can be difficult to capture and most engage in local cooperatives and market associations. Awabah has leaned heavily on town hall meetings to reach these people in large numbers, introducing its product via group presentations and one-on-one sessions.\n\nAfter onboarding them, the company uses either its web platform or a network of local banking agents to continue taking collections from, educating, and further engaging with contributors.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIncome levels vary in the informal sector. Thus, Andrews explains that contributors with as little as \u20a6500 can start a micro-pensions account. Subsequent amounts contributed are based on an individual\u2019s capacity.\n\nContributions are also flexible. Taking into account the irregular cash flow of informal workers, they can be made daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, similar to local savings groups (popularly known as Ajo or Esusu).\n\nDue to the constant need for cash flow in the informal sector, users have the option of withdrawing up to 40% of their savings at any point after the initial 3 months of contributions. Whenever someone deposits \u20a61,000, for instance, \u20a6600 is locked in the retirement account while the rest goes into the customer\u2019s mobile wallet as contingent savings.\n\n\u201cThey always come and ask for their 40% after the first three months as a way of testing the product, and we make sure that they get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cOnce they get their money back and see alerts every time they put in their \u20a6500, they\u2019re able to test the system.\u201d\n\nAwabah has achieved impressive results within months of operation, having onboarded more than 5,000 customers so far. It makes money primarily by earning a commission on every contribution made.\n\nAwabah Nigeria Co-founder, Tunji Andrews.\n\nExtending pensions to the informal economy\n\nIn Nigeria, a good number of elderly parents are financially dependent on their children \u2013 partly because societal norms deem it necessary for children to care for aging parents; and also because there is an evident lack of working systems for retirement savings.\n\nEven where pension schemes are available, they often only cover people who are formally employed. Nigeria has a large informal workforce and about 88% of the entire labour force without pensions is from the informal economy. The result? A large group of citizens becomes financially vulnerable as they get older.\n\nWorse still is that relatively young Nigerians currently dominate the labour force and the lack of retirement savings means they are susceptible to living below the poverty line in their old age.\n\nNigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PenCom) has a target of growing the country\u2019s pension coverage to 30% of the entire labour force \u2013 formal and informal \u2013 by 2024. As of the first quarter of this year, the figure stood at 12%.\n\nA provision in the Pension Reform Act of 2014 ushered in a new micro-pension plan, effectively opening the door for the informal economy to participate in the national Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Awabah\u2019s operation is backed by this provision.\n\nThe micro pension scheme was formally introduced in 2019 but is yet to gain traction. Thus, Andrews has made it his and Awabah\u2019s mission to make the services available to those in the informal sector and whose employers are not legally required to deduct and remit pension.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the new micro pension scheme two years ago, I was excited as I had been thinking about pensions. But there weren\u2019t a lot of conversations and awareness about it. So for me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said.\n\nExpanding Awabah\n\nAwabah is less than a year old and has had to deal with manpower and logistics challenges. Still, Andrews has big ambitions.\n\nGoing forward, the startup plans to leverage the penetration of mobile phones in Nigeria to reach even a wider audience, starting with the planned launch of a USSD option.\n\nThrough a shortcode, existing and potential customers will be able to learn about and sign up to Awabah, as well as get financial literacy lessons in local languages. For those who have smartphones, Awabah will engage them via WhatsApp.\n\nThe Awabah team.\n\nThe startup raised $200,000 from early-stage angel investors ODBA and Co Ventures and Correlation Capital in July, which helped it expand into Ibadan. Awabah also recently gained acceptance into the Techstars London accelerator programme, where it will get some funding.\n\nAndrews reveals that a new fundraising round is in the works, which will help fund a larger expansion. Over the next few months, the startup has plans to enter into five more Nigerian cities. It is also mulling an expansion into Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe bigger goal is to create a larger awareness of micro pensions in Africa,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe want pensions to be popular as banking and insurance are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Awabah has partnerships with three Pension Fund Administrators, including Leadway Pensure, which holds the PenCom license under which it operates; a microfinance bank via which it provides mobile wallets; as well as two agent banking networks.\n\nAndrews aims to expand the list of partner organisations and, in the long term, plans to push conversations with Nigeria\u2019s pensions regulator on the possibility of issuing micro pension licenses for small players like Awabah.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have a one-size-fits-all pension license, unlike Ghana where there\u2019s a three-tier system,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lack of micro pension licenses can be a drawback as we believe we are best positioned to drive the product. But it\u2019s still very early days.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

The data can also be deployed in targeting Nigeria\u2019s huge unbanked population with customised services, based on similar profiles to existing clients.\n\nBut very few, if any, legacy banks in Nigeria actually go out of their traditional ways to innovate using the rich data reserves. However, banks can share the data with third parties that have better capabilities to use them, and that\u2019s the premise of Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is an emerging global practice of data sharing between banks and other stakeholders in the ecosystem; including third-party financial services providers (TPPs), fintechs, and other institutions.\n\nBy sharing one another\u2019s datasets, the companies can better understand their target markets, acquire more customers, and build out new customer-centric products and services or improve on existing ones.\n\nIfeoluwa Orioke, the Chief Commercial Officer at Flutterwave, explains to TechCabal that one of the ways customers can benefit from open banking is by accessing loans tailored to their needs.\n\n\u201cA lender can understand your credit score from your transaction history and tailor specific credit facilities to you. Or for instance, interest repayments for a farmer whose income is in seasons, and not months, can be structured around the harvest season.\u201d\n\nWhile these are viable use cases, Open Banking is more effective for driving financial inclusion in Nigeria. As of the end of 2020, over 36% of the adult Nigerian population (or 38 million adults) were unbanked.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBanks don\u2019t have incentives to target rural areas, where most of the unbanked population resides. In their place, fintech firms are extending access to financial services in these areas through agent networks and mobile money wallets.\n\nHowever, fintechs need to integrate data with banks before they launch agent locations. A common standard for both parties to share information is needed to help speed up integration.\n\nOpen Banking introduces this common standard, via uniform Application Programme Interface (API), which banks and fintechs all have access to. It aids the latter\u2019s efforts to reach the financially excluded or underserved.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking is a major step forward in solving restricted access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d said Orioke. \u201cThose who do not have bank accounts can participate in the financial ecosystem via Fintechs. Fintechs can provide improved solutions and personalised services to these people by processing data from banks.\u201d\n\nOpen Banking Nigeria, a private initiative building a common standard for Open Banking APIs in Nigeria, has, to an impressive extent, helped standardise API access, thereby easing the process of integration between fintechs and banks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank also recently launched draft regulations for Open Banking, which establishes principles for data sharing across the banking and payments ecosystem.\n\nWin-win for all\n\nAccording to Orioke, the Open Banking idea is a win-win for all parties involved in the ecosystem; banks, fintechs, TPPs, the banked, and the unbanked populations.\n\nWith vast and detailed consumer data gathered over the years, Open Banking provides value creation opportunities for innovation-friendly banks.\n\nFintech companies, with access to bank data, could better serve existing customers and even acquire new users in the process.\n\n\u201cOpen Banking equally creates more options for existing customers and could bring in more people into the banking system, simply by tailoring solutions to their needs,\u201d notes Orioke. \u201cWith more customer personalisation comes improved trust in the financial services industry.\n\nOutside financial services, Open Banking has the potential to impact all aspects of the customer\u2019s life, seeing as every activity is connected to finance; whether hospitality, healthcare, or insurance.\n\n\u201cIt can also increase the profitability of all participating parties (including the banks), reduce cost and improve customer experience. Open Banking could be the ultimate solution to all current difficulties with access to financial services in Nigeria,\u201d Orioke said.\n\nConsidering its numerous benefits and rapid adoption, Open Banking could potentially revolutionise the financial services ecosystem in Nigeria and go down as one of the most important innovations in the financial inclusion drive.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

The ordinary person in Jigawa or the ordinary person in Sokoto or the ordinary person in Bayelsa? Is it the Igbo vulcanizer or the Yoruba woman selling kerosene by the roadside or the Okada man in Delta?\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the capacity to unite because they are burdened by poverty.

We will never allow Nigeria to break because once it breaks, we will lose. But the common man loses nothing. What is he losing? He is already in hell; he cannot lose anything more than this hell.\u201d\n\nAlhaji Sule Lamido explained that the country is bleeding due to poor governance under the APC-led government of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe added, \u201cOur country is bleeding because there is no purposeful leadership, no justice, no peace, no security all over, only injustice, denial of people\u2019s rights and privileges and above all, the collapse of government institutions.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the convener, Comrade Umar Danjani stated that their reasons for pressuring the former Governor to contest the presidency is noting short of the collapse of the country\u2019s social infrastructure.\n\nHe opined, \u201cWe are confident only Lamido can remedy the situation due to his wealth of experience in the art of governance.\u201d",

          "text": "Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board has said it will withdraw\n\n2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination , UTME, results of one master Chinedu Ifesinachi John who altered his score.\n\nThe 19 year old candidate who claimed that JAMB has been altering his results since 2019 was also handed over to Nigeria Police for investigation.\n\nJohn had claimed he scored 380 in the examination conducted in June this year and was surprised to receive 265 from the board after the results were released.\n\nAfter several enquiries, 265 kept appearing as his score against the 380 scores.\n\nFollowing the alleged \u201calteration\u201d of the UTME score, his father, John Ifenkpam approached an Enugu \u2013 based lawyer, Ikeazor Akaiwe who wrote to JAMB for another opportunity for the boy to retake the examination and demanded N1 billion as damages.\n\nThe lawyer said the N1 billion was to cover for the physical and emotional trauma the boy had being through from being offered \u201ctwo separate scores.\n\nMaster John claimed that his UTME scores from 2019 till 2021 had been \u201caltered\u201d by the board, thereby denying him the opportunity to study his desired course \u2013 medicine.\n\nOn Friday, the candidate, his father and lawyers traveled down to Abuja from Enugu state following an invitation from the management of the board led by the Registrar of JAMB, Prof Is \u2013 haq Oloyede.\n\nInitially, the boy was given few minutes to \u201ccome clean\u201d in a closed session with his father and lawyers about the results he was parading but insisted that his original score from the examination was 380.\n\nAfter going back and forth, the board tendered evidence to counter the claim by John and his legal representatives. At the Friday meeting, documentary evidence tendered by the board showed that John actually scored 265, not the 380 he had claimed.\n\nOloyede accused the candidate of result tempering, adding that he will be handed over to the police for investigation and subsequently prosecuted.\n\nThe registrar said John was among 11 eleven other candidates who allegedly forged their results that the board would prosecute.\n\nHe said the original result issued to john would be withdrawn pending the end of the investigation.\n\nThe registrar said: \u201cWe have 11 of them who tampered with their results. Two of them are already being prosecuted. The remaining ones we are going to withdraw their results and prosecute them. The main purpose is to sanitise the system, including our own staff.\n\n\u201cThere was never any communication of 380 with this boy. Because this boy has accused JAMB, we are going to withhold his result until the investigation is concluded. We are going to request that our interactions with him be subjected to the public.\u201d\n\nHis lawyer, Ikeazor, appealed to the board to instead give room for further infestation.\n\nHe said: I will not stand against the investigation. Let there be an investigation but what I will not agree to is to prejudge him.\n\nEarlier, John had said: The result I have been receiving is not the result I am entitled to. I wrote the first jamb in 2019. The first time they sent 328 later I saw 278 score when I checked it. I printed it. I couldn\u2019t meet up for admission that year. I wanted to study medicine and surgery at the University of Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIn 2020 the same thing happened. I scored 343 by the time I went to the portal to print I saw 306. I used the 306 and it gave me admission in UI. But because I didn\u2019t have further mathematics I had to forfeit it.\n\n\u201cI decided to leave medicine and surgery for them in 2021, so I picked petroleum engineering. In 2021, JAMB issued me two results. I saw 380 the first time I checked, then the second I saw 265.\u201d\n\nHowever, the candidate later confessed after the Board discovered that he saved his sister\u2019s number on his phone as 55019 and used the phone to send the fake result to his phone.\n\nWhen he send such results they come as 55019.\n\nHe pleaded for mercy that he had to do that when the result he got was not up to what could give him his desired programmme.\n\nNigPilot, Daily Nigerian Newspaper, Nigerian News Update, Nigerian News Headlines, Nigerian Pilot Newspaper Online,",

Accordingly, on Friday the 3rd of September, 2021, all issues raised were resolved and we proceeded to the Headquarters of the DSS to demand the immediate release of the four (4) remaining detainees in their custody,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cRegrettably and in the whimsical habit of the DSS, only two of the remaining four received their freedom while the other two namely; Amudat Habibat Babatunde and Jamiu Noah Oyetunji, remain in the unlawful custody of the DSS. No valid reasons on law were availed the Legal Team for this willful disobedience of the rule of law and court.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Teenager Arrested For Tampering UTME Result\n\nOn August 4, Justice Obiora Egwuatu of the Federal High Court sitting granted bail to the 12 detainees but the DSS only released eight on August 31.\n\nThe detainees had met their bail conditions including the provision of 24 sureties, though the DSS lawyer, Idowu Awo, had kicked against the bail granted by Justice Egwuatu to four of them, claiming that they were heavily involved in the alleged offence of arms stockpiling and other criminal activities of their boss, Igboho.\n\nBut Olajengbesi warned that should the DSS refuse to release the remaining two aides, he would file contempt of court charges against its Director-General, Yusuf Magaji Bichi.\n\nHe noted that DSS is a law enforcement agency and should not be allowed to carry out its official responsibility with impunity and absolute disrespect to the law of the land, especially where the constitutional rights and liberty of citizens are at stake.\n\nSee the full statement here:\n\n\u2018DSS\u2019 RELEASES TWO MORE IGBOHO\u2019S Aides \u2013 Tajudeen Irinloye and Uthman Opeymi Adelabu \u201cDSS\u2019 SELECTIVE OBEDIENCE TO COURT ORDER; AN AFFRONT TO AND DISREGARD OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE COURT\u201d By. Pelumi Olajengbesi Esq. The keenly observing world will recall that during our last press briefing on the on-going case of Chief Sunday Igboho\u2019s aides, it was reported that the DSS is yet to release four (4) of detainees on their custody on grounds of bail perfection technicality, in which we were allowed to secure the release of others. Sequel to the refusal of the DSS to release the other detainees, concerted efforts were immediately made to resolve all technical issues raised by the DSS. Accordingly, on Friday the 3rd of September, 2021, all issues raised were resolved and we proceeded to the Headquarters of the DSS to demand the immediate release of the four (4) remaining detainees in their custody. Regrettably and in the whimsical habit of the DSS, only two of the remaining four received their freedom while the other two namely; Amudat Habibat Babatunde and Jamiu Noah Oyetunji, remain in the unlawful custody of the DSS. No valid reasons on law were availed the Legal Team for this willful disobedience of the rule of law and court. The DSS\u2019 cherry-picking of an order of the court is an open dare and affront on the authority of the issuing court and it lacks legal backing under the extant laws of Nigeria. It is a condemnable action in any sane democratic society and speaks ill of the professionalism of the intelligence agency. The DSS simply have no right nor power to select or unilaterally handpick which order of the court is convenient for it to obey or honor. Any iota of non-compliance to an order of the court is tantamount to disregard of such an order in its entirety and the same is contemptuous. Consequently, we want to restate that if by Monday the 6th of September, 2021, the DSS continue with their unlawful detention of the remaining two (2) detainees, we shall not hesitate to proceed with our earlier plans to institute a contempt proceeding against the Director-General of the SSS, Yusuf Magaji Bichi. The DSS as a law enforcement agency should not be allowed to carry out its official responsibility with impunity and absolute disrespect to the law of the land, especially where the constitutional rights and liberty of citizens are at stake. It is reprehensible conduct unbecoming of an agency that is itself a creation of the law and it will not go unchallenged. Thank you. Pelumi Olajengbesi Esq. Principal Partner Law Corridor\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Naomi Osaka looked over at her agent and said she wanted to tell the world what the two of them had discussed privately in an Arthur Ashe Stadium hallway after her U.S. Open title defence ended with a racket-tossing, composure-missing, lead-evaporating defeat in the third round.\n\nHis reply: \u201cSure.\u201d\n\nAnd then Osaka, pausing every so often as her voice got caught on her words and her eyes filled with tears, said Friday night she is thinking about taking another break from tennis \u201cfor a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like for me, recently, when I win, I don\u2019t feel happy, I feel more like a relief. And then when I lose, I feel very sad,\u201d Osaka said at her news conference following a 5-7, 7-6 (2), 6-4 loss at Flushing Meadows to Leylah Fernandez, an 18-year-old from Canada who is ranked 73rd and never had been this far in Grand Slam competition. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s normal.\u201d\n\nThe moderator in charge of the session with reporters attempted to cut things off, but Osaka said she wanted to continue.\n\n\u201cThis is very hard to articulate,\u201d she said, resting her left cheek in her hand. \u201cBasically, I feel like I\u2019m kind of at this point where I\u2019m trying to figure out what I want to do, and I honestly don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to play my next tennis match.\u201d\n\nCrying, she lowered her black visor over her eyes and offered an apology, then patted her palms on both cheeks.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Osaka added as she rose to leave, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to take a break from playing for a while.\u201d\n\nThis was the first Slam tournament for the 23-year-old Osaka since she pulled out of the French Open before the second round to take a mental health break after having announced she would not participate in news conferences in Paris.\n\nShe also sat out Wimbledon, before participating in the Tokyo Olympics, where she lit the cauldron as one of Japan\u2019s most famous athletes.\n\nOsaka owns four Grand Slam titles, including at the U.S. Open in 2018 \u2014 beating Serena Williams in a chaotic final \u2014 and a year ago, plus two more on the hard courts of the Australian Open. When she took a hiatus after Roland Garros, she revealed that she endures waves of anxiety before meeting with the media and has dealt with depression for three years.\n\nOver the last week, Osaka has written on social media and spoken about her thoughts on the importance of self-belief and how she wants to ignore others\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe first sign Friday that things were not entirely OK with Osaka came when she smacked her racket against the court after dropping one point. Moments later, Osaka chucked her equipment, sending it bouncing and skidding halfway to the net. Then came a full-on spike near the baseline.\n\nAfterward, she compared that behaviour to acting \u201ckind of like a little kid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was telling myself to be calm, but I feel like maybe there was a boiling point,\u201d Osaka said. \u201cLike, normally, I feel like I like challenges. But recently I feel very anxious when things don\u2019t go my way, and I feel like you can feel that.\u201d\n\nHer game was off. Her game face was gone. By the end, the crowd was booing her for turning her back to the court and taking too much time between points.\n\nSoon enough, the No. 3-seeded Osaka was out of the bracket.\n\nThis day had that sort of vibe: Earlier in Ashe, another 18-year-old new to this territory surprisingly eliminated a No. 3 seed when Carlos Alcaraz of Spain edged French Open runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (2), 0-6, 7-6 (5) to become the youngest man into the fourth round at Flushing Meadows since Michael Chang and Pete Sampras in 1989.\n\nOsaka came in with a 16-match winning streak at majors. Still, Fernandez declared: \u201cRight before the match, I knew I was able to win.\u201d\n\nFor Osaka, maybe the time away from high-level competition was an issue.\n\nAnother possible factor in her failure to close things out while serving for the victory against the left-hander Fernandez at 6-5 in the second set: Osaka hadn\u2019t played a match since Monday. The usual day-on, day-off rhythm at Slams was disrupted because the woman Osaka was supposed to meet in the second round, Olga Danilovic, withdrew with an illness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a walkover in a Grand Slam, so that was definitely a really weird feeling,\u201d Osaka said.\n\nOn Friday, Osaka was quite good down the stretch in the opening set. She grabbed 12 of 13 points, including the last nine, with a break at love to go up 6-5, and a hold at love with the help of a pair of aces at 112 mph and 114 mph to end it.\n\nSeemed on track for a similar conclusion in the second set, leading 6-5 and serving. But when Osaka sailed a forehand wide, Fernandez had her first break of the match to make it 6-all.\n\n\u201cFinally, I found a pattern to her serve,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cI just trusted my gut and hit the ball.\u201d\n\nAnd so began Osaka\u2019s downward spiral. She fell behind 5-0 in the ensuing tiebreaker, missing shots and displaying her frustration as she occasionally has done in the past \u2014 by flinging her racket.\n\nChair umpire Alison Hughes did not sanction Osaka then, although later a warning was issued for hitting a ball into the stands.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t really focused on Naomi,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cI was only focused on myself, my game, what I needed to do.\u201d\n\nMore to the point, Osaka was not at her best. She left the court with a white towel draped over her head after the second set, then sat in her changeover chair in that same block-out-the-world manner.\n\nFernandez, smiling and holding her right fist overhead after the biggest of points, certainly had something to do with the outcome.\n\nShe won 18 of 19 first-serve points \u2014 and never faced a break point \u2014 in the third set.\n\nFernandez\u2019s knee-to-the-ground, quick-redirect style at the baseline is reminiscent of another lefty, Angelique Kerber, a three-time Grand Slam champion who won the 2016 U.S. Open.\n\nAnd who just so happens to be the next opponent for Fernandez.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put on a show like I did tonight,\u201d Fernandez said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to see how it goes.\u201d",

          "text": "Zambia\u2019s parliament has elected its first female speaker, more than a week after longtime opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema was sworn in as the country\u2019s new president.\n\nNelly Mutti, a lawyer based in the capital, Lusaka, was elected unopposed on Friday to replace Patrick Matibini, a retired high court judge who served as speaker for 10 years.\n\nHis tenure ended after the August 12 election that saw Hichilema defeat incumbent President Edgar Lungu.\n\nMutti was sworn in along with her two deputies \u2013 Attractor Chisangano, a member of Hichilema\u2019s United Party for National Development (UPND), and Moses Moyo, who was elected to parliament as an independent candidate.\n\nIn his address at the ceremony, Hichilema said Mutti\u2019s election championed the cause of women in leadership roles in Zambia.\n\nA human rights lawyer and a former chairwoman of the country\u2019s anti-corruption commission, Mutti will have the job to preside over a parliament where the ruling party still needs the cooperation of opposition members of parliament to make constitutional changes.\n\nHichilema, who has promised a \u201cnew dawn\u201d, fired several military, police and prisons commanders just days into his rule.\n\nThe opposition and civil society groups have long accused the former government of using security apparatus to perpetrate violence and arrest critics.\n\nHichilema promised to let parliament operate independently and without any influence, urging legislators to give top priority to people\u2019s welfare.\n\nHe will open the first session of Zambia\u2019s unicameral parliament, known as the National Assembly, under Mutti\u2019s leadership on September 10, where he is expected to outline his vision for his government\u2019s five-year term.",
