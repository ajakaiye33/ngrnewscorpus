Also, make sure that you allow him to exercise and give him a good mattress\u201d, Justice Nyako had ordered.\n\nMeanwhile, when the matter was called up on Wednesday, the Prosecution counsel, Mr Shuaibu Labaran, told the court that Kanu was the one that chose to wear his designer Fendi clothes.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nI don\u2019t want to see Kanu in these clothes again, Justice Nyako provokes\n\nHe said: \u201cMy lord, based on your order yesterday, we provided Defendant with a new Orthopedic mattress, pillows and blankets.\n\n\u201cAs for his appearance, he chose to wear this particular one because he said that it is designers\u201d.\n\nIn his response, Kanu\u2019s lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, told the court that it was not true that his client insisted on wearing his designer\u2019s clothes.\n\n\u201cMy lord what happened was that by the time proceedings ended yesterday, and because it was not his visiting day, we were not able to pass to him, some clothes we obtained for him.\n\n\u201cWe even discussed it with him this morning and he said that on the next visiting day he would want to have the new clothes\u201d, Ozekhome added.\n\nHe however commended the DSS for providing the IPOB leader with new mattress and pillows.\n\n\u201cI want to commend the DSS and the court for ensuring that it was done\u201d.\n\nBefore allowing Kanu to be re-arraigned on the amended 15-count treasonable felony charge the Federal Government preferred against him, Justice Nyako reiterated her demand for Defendant to have a change of clothes.\n\nKanu is currently entering his plea to the fresh amended charge against him which borders on his alleged commission of acts of terrorism, felony, incitement, unlawful importation of a radio transmitter, and headship of an illegal organization.\n\nAlready, the DSS had before Kanu was ushered into the courtroom around 10:15 am, produced several documentary evidence, including electronic devices it would use to play some of the alleged inciting broadcasts that were made by the Defendant\n\nMore details soon\u2026\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The staff of the Ibadan Zonal Office (IBZO) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) have been tasked by the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, to sustain their commitment to regulatory effectiveness in keeping with the Commission\u2019s strategic objectives.\n\nDanbatta made the call to the staff not to rest on their oars recently at Ibadan when he visited the IBZO of the Commission en route Osogbo to deliver the 10th and 11th Convocation Lecture of the Fountain University.\n\nThe EVC, management and other staff in his entourage, were earlier received on arrival at Ibadan by the Controller, Ibadan Zonal Office of the Commission, Yomi Arowosafe, who led the EVC and his team on a tour of the Zonal Office.\n\nSpeaking later at an interactive session with staff of the Zonal Office, Danbatta commended the zonal controller and his team on the good work they have been doing in ensuring the people of the zone feel the presence and impact, as well as the significance of the Commission\u2019s regulatory activities.\n\nThe EVC particularly urged the staff of the Commission not to relax because of the successes that have been recorded. Rather, he implored the staff to rededicate themselves decidedly, to their assigned responsibilities, in order to sustain effective delivery of regulatory services to the people of the zone in keeping with the Commission\u2019s commitment to ensuring greater regulatory effectiveness.\n\nDanbatta asserted that his appeal takes life off the fact that the Commission and its staff have become major drivers of the Federal Government\u2019s vision for the birth of a robust digital economy as encapsulated in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020-2030 and the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP) 2020-2025.\n\nThe NCC CEO reminded the staff of the necessity to internalise the regulatory imperatives of the Strategic Management Plan (SMP), 2021-2024, as well as the Strategic Vision Plan (SVP) 2021-2025, both of which are streamlined implementation roadmaps by which the Commission plans to actualise the national digital economy and broadband targets as articulated by the Federal Government.\n\nIn his response, Arowosafe who spoke on behalf of the staff of the Zonal Office expressed gratitude to the Management for the visit and promised to ensure the zonal office sustains effective delivery of NCC\u2019s regulatory services to the people of the geo-political zone.\n\nStaff in the EVC\u2019s entourage to the zonal office include NCC\u2019s Director, Projects, Abigail Sholanke; Director, Digital Economy, Dr Austin Nwaulune; Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde; Head Research and Development, Kelechi Nwankwo; and other senior management staff of the Commission.\n\nThe IBZO was established in October 2005 to bring the Commission\u2019s regulatory services closer to the South-West geopolitical zone, except Lagos and Ogun which are in the purview of Lagos ZonalOffice. However, the jurisdictional sphere of the Ibadan Zonal Office, however includes other South-West states and Kwara State.\n\nThe recently constructed NCC Zonal Office building at Ibadan became fully functional in 2015 when the Commission\u2019s Management directed staff to commence operational activities from the new complex.",

          "text": "Immediate-past Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum PGF, Salihu Moh. Lukman has explained why he resigned from his appointment on Monday.\n\nHe said he resigned to put himself in an unhindered position to continue to freely hold the party accountable to the principles of internal democracy.\n\nWhile confirming the reports of his resignation in a statement on Wednesday morning in Abuja, Lukman said he restrained himself from making any public statement on the matter because he was still awaiting acceptance.\n\n\u201cI have privately responded to many enquiries from party leaders, friends, family members and clarified that it is true that my decision to resign my position is to enable me to continue with the campaign to return APC to its founding vision, which is to build a party that is not only democratic but oriented based on social democratic principles,\u201d he began.\n\nLukman recalled that since the buildup to the 2019 elections, internal contests in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) began to degenerate.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAccording to him, some leaders became intolerant and conducted themselves almost as tyrants, while every campaign to get the leadership of the party to commence the process of internal reform was resisted.\n\n\u201cSome party leaders in the bid to emerge as candidates of the party for offices became hostile. Party campaign drifted to almost war situations in many instances. Organs of the party stop meetings as required by the constitution. Views of party leaders became decisions of the party.\n\n\u201cThank God, we have a leader in President Muhammadu Buhari who disagreed with what is going on in the party and support the campaign for reform. Without going into all the details, the inspiration to setup the current Caretaker Committee came from President Buhari based on the expectation of ensuring that the drift in the party is arrested.\n\nRead Also: PGF DG resigns over APC national convention controversy\n\n\u201cThis is expected to produce a new leadership, which should emerge at the party\u2019s National Convention. Once the Caretaker Committee began to show sign of reluctance to organise the Convention, it should be a source of concern to all party members desirous of reform,\u201d Lukman added.\n\nHe said following the news of his resignation, many party leaders and members called to express these worries.\n\n\u201cOne of the party leaders who honoured me with an invitation to meet him late on Tuesday, January 17, 2022, was Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\n\u201cHe commended me for championing the campaigns to reform the party and expressed shock that some members of Forum were intolerant to criticism.\n\n\u201cHe argued that any party leader who will not accommodate critical opinion on fundamental issue such as respecting decisions and especially a matter as sensitive as organising the National Convention, which is the highest organ of the party, such a person is not a democrat and shouldn\u2019t be associated with a party envisioned to be progressive such as the APC.\n\n\u201cWith these words, he encouraged me to continue with my campaign, which is what the party needs. He declared his support to all decisions of President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure that APC Convention holds in February 2022,\u201d the ex-PGF DG said.\n\nAcknowledging that the Caretaker Committee has now announced that the Convention will hold February 26, 2022, Lukman said the next task before all party leaders is to ensure the new leadership of the party to emerge from the National Convention will be \u201ctolerant of criticisms, democratic and more importantly share the commitments of the founding leaders to build a truly progressive party\u201d.",

          "title": "Prices of Rice, Other Food Items to Crash Soon, Buhari Assures",
          "text": "\u2022Rice importation from Thailand drops by 99.83% as Emefiele praises farmers for their doggedness despite challenges\n\n\u2022President hails CBN Governor, Fayemi, Bagudu, others\u2019 contribution to agriculture\n\n\u2022PDP mocks FG, APC for unveiling \u2018pyramids of lies\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has assured Nigerians that prices of food items, especially rice will soon come down.\n\nThe president, who gave the assurance yesterday, during the official unveiling of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)/Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) Rice Paddy Pyramids in Abuja, urged Nigerians to exercise some patience, saying the growing food production in the country, especially expansion in rice farming would eventually bring down prices of food, making it more affordable for all.\n\nThis was just as the Governor of the CBN, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, revealed that following the successes recorded in the implementation of the CBN-led Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), the country had been able to significantly reduce rice importation from Thailand by over 99.83 per cent within the past seven years.\n\nBut reacting to yesterday\u2019s unveiling, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday mocked the APC and its governments, describing it as another shameless media stunt to again beguile Nigerians ahead of 2023 elections.\n\nAccording to the leading opposition political party, the unveiling of bogus rice pyramids in Abuja, was nothing but, \u201cpyramids of lies.\u201d\n\nHowever, Buhari\u2019s assurance to Nigerians on cheaper food items came on a day he personally presented awards to Emefiele and five other state governors for their contributions to the development of agriculture in the country.\n\nThe state chief executives included Governors of Ekiti, Mr. Kayode Fayemi; Kebbi, Alhaji Atiku Bagudu; Cross River, Prof. Ben Ayade; Ebonyi, Mr. David Umahi, and Jigawa, Alhaji Abubakar Badaru.\n\nThe president said: \u201cToday rice production in Nigeria has increased to over 7.5 million metric tons annually. Prior to the introduction of APB, the average production in Nigeria between 1999 to 2015 was less than four metric tons annually.\n\n\u201cI am aware that the bags of paddy will be moving straight from here to rice milling plants across Nigeria, which lead to the release of processed rice to the markets by the rice millers. The measure will aid our efforts at reducing the price of rice in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBefore this administration launched the ABP, there were only 15 standard Rice mills in Nigeria. As at today, we have over 50 Standard and integrated Rice mills creating jobs and reducing unemployment. We expect additional significant output when two new mills are started in Lagos and Katsina,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president said the large margins in the business of rice had also encouraged more people to show interest in investing in agribusiness.\n\n\u201cFellow Nigerians, our gathering here today, is no doubt a testament to the fact that the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme is working. Indeed, these sky-high pyramids which we are gathered here to commission are part of our commitment at achieving national food security and economic diversification through home-grown policies targeted at securing food for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs a critical policy of the government, the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme is expected to catalyse the agricultural productive base of the nation, which is a major part of our economic plan to uplift the economy, create jobs, reduce reliance on imported food and industrial raw materials, and conserve foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cIn the implementation of the programme, adoption of high-yielding seedlings, quality inputs and best farming practices were essential features.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the improved rice seedlings have helped to ensure our achievement of rice sufficiency, as they are disease-resistant and have an average yield of about 5 metric per hectare, compared with the traditional national average of 1.5 metric tonnes.\n\n\u201cThis has resulted in bridging our rice consumption gap, a significant reduction in rice imports, and saved us foreign exchange,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nPresident Buhari said the commissioning of the rice pyramids was an indication that the country was making steady and assured progress towards self-sufficiency in food production, adding: \u201cIt is my desired hope and expectation that other agricultural commodity associations that are yet to participate under the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme will emulate the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria in supporting our administration\u2019s drive for food self-sufficiency.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe president noted that, about three years ago, the first set of sky-high pyramids of rice harvests were showcased in Argungu, Kebbi State, which was followed by another set in Minna, Niger State, about a year ago and barely three months later in Zauro, Kebbi State, rice pyramids were again, unveiled.\n\nPresident Buhari said in May 2021, the CBN unveiled the first rice pyramids in the South-west in Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cThose events were historic as first, they remind us of our yester-year\u2019s agricultural commodity pyramids, such as the groundnut pyramids in Kano and secondly, they symbolize that we can produce what we eat.\n\n\u201cThe significance of today\u2019s occasion can be better understood by looking at the various economic strides the administration has achieved through agriculture.\n\n\u201cWhen we assumed the reins of leadership of this country in 2015, the administration identified the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme as an essential policy instrument for achieving economic diversification through agriculture.\n\n\u201cTo achieve this, the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme was designed to encourage investments in agriculture and empower smallholder farmers as drivers of transformation in the agricultural sector and as critical enablers of economic growth.\n\n\u201cI am indeed delighted that the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme continues to receive commendations, since its introduction six years ago, as it has become one of the reference points in the administration\u2019s agricultural revolution effort.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the Programme speaks loudly in its giant strides as it has increased access to finance by our rural farmers, who before now were virtually excluded from the financial system,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari commended the CBN over its efforts at resuscitating the Nigerian Commodity Exchange following approval to do so.\n\nThis, he said, had been done in the hope that farmers could have ready buyers of their produce, thereby resolving the current logistical challenge of moving their produce from farm to markets.\n\n\u201cLet me also commend the Governor and staff of the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as the leadership of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria for the successful delivery of these pyramids, which hopefully is just the first of many that will be unveiled this year across Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 the President added.\n\nSpeaking further, Emefiele, at the unveiling of the mega rice pyramids, said rice importation from Thailand alone was valued at 1.3 million metric tons as at 2014, adding that by 2016, importation from same country had fallen to only 58,000 metric tons.\n\nThe CBN governor further disclosed that as of the end of 2021, Thailand only exported 2,160 metric tons to Nigeria, thereby saving the country foreign exchange and helping preserve local jobs.\n\nHe said the ABP was launched in 2015 to curtail excessive imports, adding that, \u201cwe have seen incremental reductions in rice imports from Thailand.\u201d\n\nEmefiele, pointed out that as at the end of December 2021, the CBN had financed 4.48 million farmers who cultivated 5.30 million hectares across 21 commodities through 23 Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) in the 36 States of the Federation and Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are delighted that these efforts have yielded fruits in not just increasing the availability of rice, but also in moderating prices, reducing imports and increasing job creation in the country.\u201d\n\nEmefiele, nonetheless, said beyond increasing national output from about 5.4 million metric tons in 2015 to over nine million metric tons in 2021, there had also been significant improvement in the productivity per hectare of the smallholder farmer from about 2.4 metric tons per ha in 2015 to about 5 metric tons per ha in 2021.\n\nHe noted that these expansions have not only made Nigeria the largest rice producer in Africa, but had also unlocked enormous private sector investment in the rice value chain.\n\nHe said the number of Integrated Rice Mills grew astronomically from six in 2015 to over 50 in 2021 with many more in various stages of completion.\n\nThe CBN governor added that today, Nigeria\u2019s milled rice matches the foreign competition in quality.\n\nHe added that taking a cue from the success in the rice value chain, the apex bank had also commenced the \u201cBrown Revolution\u201d last year in line with its mantra for the transformation of the wheat value chain in the country.\n\nAccording to him, wheat remained the third most consumed grain in the country after maize and rice, stressing that the country only produce about one per cent (63,000mt) of the 5-6 million metric tonnes of wheat consumed annually in Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis enormous demand-supply gap is bridged with over $2 billion annual importation of wheat. As a result, wheat accounts for the second highest food import bill in Nigeria, thereby putting pressure on the nation\u2019s foreign exchange reserves.\n\n\u201cWe have concluded the first major wet season wheat farming in Plateau State and planted over 100,000 hectares of wheat across 15 States in the 2021 dry season. This strategic intervention will herald progressive reduction in our wheat import bills over the coming years.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor also commended smallholder farmers in the country and the leadership of the various commodities associations, \u201cfor the diligence, bravery, patriotism and adaptability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe past few years have been quite challenges for these farmers as they have battled with insurgency, banditry, lockdown and other related setbacks. Indeed, we lost some of our farmers to attacks by insurgents nationwide, while some could not assess their farms for several months.\n\n\u201cYet, the kept faith, they did not give up and the persevered. They did not abandon our fight for food self-sufficiency. Today\u2019s event therefore is a celebration of their doggedness and appreciation of their commitment to food security in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe ABP has catalysed the rural economy and has built a sustainable framework for financing small holder farmers in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also added that the CBN established a Strategic Maize Reserve with the stock of maize submitted as loan repayment by farmers, pointing out that this will provide a buffer for price modulation for the poultry and feed mills nationwide.\n\nHe said, \u201cA total of 241,656.76 MT was aggregated in the 2020 wet and dry seasons, out of which 217,218.53 MT has been disposed to 18 millers and poultry farmers through the Poultry Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe programme was able to stabilise the poultry and livestock sectors during the pandemic and saved the industry and consumers over N10 billion in raw material costs.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cOur experience over the years has been transformed to operational efficiency of the programme. We have added several layers of controls to improve on transparency and accountability among all stakeholders and what you are witnessing today is a demonstration of our growth and a strong indication of the enormous potential in the country\u2019s agricultural space.\n\nEmefiele, however, noted that the current progress was still a far cry from the desired goal, pointing out that the \u201cgrowth processes reaffirm our belief in the potential inherent in our agricultural space and we can hopefully harness them to lead the diversification agenda of the economy.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe mega pyramids being launched today represents aggregated paddy rice submitted as repayment of loans by RIFAN farmers under the 2020 dry season and 2021 wet seasons.\n\n\u201cBeyond the event, it also symbolizes the efforts made by our farmers to commit to loan repayment through produce submission and ultimately ensure the sustainability of the programme.\n\n\u201cTo further create value and transfer these gains along the value chain, we have mapped millers to off-take these paddies and we will track the release of their outputs to the market as we strive to manage inflation and grow the rice value chain in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that the resuscitation of the Nigeria Commodity Exchange (NCX) was another strategic initiative to enhance the food security drive of your administration.\n\nHe said a vibrant commodity exchange will significantly enhance post-harvest handling, reduce wastage and guarantee effective pricing for farmers and minimise the adverse effects of the activities of middlemen, commodity hoarders and ultimately transfer the gains from primary production to other nodes of the value chain.\n\nHe said this aligns with the CBN\u2019s resolve to take outputs as loan repayment under the ABP while the produce will drive the operations of the commodity exchange going forward.\n\nHe said all of the achievements would not have been possible without the leadership and vision of Buhari adding that these accomplishments also showed that with the right leadership and vision, the country can overcome any challenge.\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cCOVID-19 has shown that we cannot rely on imports and hence we must chart our own path to attaining self-sufficiency in our basic needs as a nation. And this must become our preeminent preoccupation going forward.\n\n\u201cWe have deepened our stakeholders\u2019 engagement to increase the arable land under cultivation and improve the productivity per hectare using improved seeds and agronomic practices.\n\n\u201cWe are currently exploring a new rice seed variety with RIFAN that has potential to deliver over 8 tons per ha. The pilot programme should commence in the 2022 dry season, and it has the potential of being the game changer for the rice sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe will work with the various seed certification authorities and explore the possibility of patenting it for RIFAN as part of their legacies under the programme.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, alleged that Nigerians were already aware and pictures were available of how the APC and its government, \u201ccreate fake pyramids of rice with sandbags and re-bagged rice stacked on pyramid shaped wooden structures as busted in an APC-controlled state in the South-west in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe PDP added: \u201cOf course, there is nothing to celebrate in the APC pyramid of lies in Abuja. It is rather shameful that APC leaders are again ridiculing President Muhammadu Buhari by making him unveil pyramids of allegedly imported foreign rice which are re-bagged as locally produced, just to create an impression of a boost in local production under his watch.\n\n\u201cIf indeed, there is a boost in local production of rice as the APC wants Nigerians to believe, how come the price of rice has not come down but continued to soar from about N8,000 per bag which the PDP handed over to the APC in 2015, to about N30,000 per bag today?\u201d the PDP asked.\n\nAccording to the main opposition party, \u201cIt is on record that the PDP turned the water land of various states of our nation into huge rice production hubs with farms and mills springing up across the country, leading to a boost in local production, drastic drop in imports and the celebrated affordable prices of food products under the PDP administration.\u201d\n\nThe PDP further alleged that, \u201cpainfully, the APC, with its incompetence, counter-productive policies and incurable corruption reversed all the gains made by the PDP in the agricultural sector and triggered a decline in production which resulted in the high cost of food in our country today.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba said Nigerians could recall how the APC-led administration failed to protect the farmers and particularly how it blamed over 40 rice farmers killed by terrorists in Borno state instead of going after their assailants.\n\nIt maintained that the rice pyramid was, \u201cAPC pyramids,\u201d stressing that it was nothing, \u201cbut huge signposts of their failures and irredeemable proclivity for lies, deception, beguilement and fake performance claims even in the face of unbearable high costs of food, 22.95 percent food inflation rate and our nation\u2019s ranking as 98th out of 107 in Global Hunger Index.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that with the 2023 elections in sight, the APC is desperate in pushing its stock-in-trade, pyramid of lies, propaganda, deceit and bogus claims with which they stole power in 2015. What the APC has not realised is that 2023 is not 2015. Nigerians have seen through APC deceits and not even these \u201cpyramids of lies\u201d can help the APC in 2023\u201d, the main opposition party stated.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Feb. 26 APC Convention: All Eyes on These Men",
          "text": "\u2022We should make it a policy convention, says Fayemi\n\nAdedayo Akinwale\n\nAfter weeks of apprehension, accentuated by orchestrated uncertainties, the National Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, affirmed February 26 as the date for the party\u2019s national convention, apparently, with the approval of President Muhammadu Buhari. Chairman of the caretaker committee and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, disclosed this in Abuja at the Progressive Women Conference, with the theme, \u201cOne Voice, Women Uniting for Progress.\u201d\n\nBuni was, however, silent on the proposed venue of the convention.\n\nOstensibly excited by the news of the convention, Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), and governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, said there was a need to make the party\u2019s convention a policy convention.\n\nIn another development, a group, the APC Rebirth Group, berated the party\u2019s governors for, allegedly, forcing the director-general of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, to resign. Chairman of the forum and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, and Buni had on November 22 last year announced February as potential time for the convention, after a meeting with Buhari.\n\nHowever, soon after the announcement of February as the month for the convention, a former governor of Abia State and Senate\u2019s Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, in a letter dated December 13, 2021, urged the caretaker committee to consider postponing the national convention. Kalu suggested that the presidential primary and the convention of the party be conducted the same day.\n\nBut kicking against Kalu\u2019s suggestion, Lukman called on Buni and Secretary of the caretaker committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, to resign honourably if they failed to conclude preparations for the party\u2019s convention.\n\nLukman, in a letter dated January 5, 2022, titled, \u201cAPC National Convention: Urgent Matters for the Survival of APC,\u201d pointed out that leaders of the party must understand that its survival was at stake and any attempt to continue to contemplate postponement of the convention was unacceptable, as it meant gambling with the future of the party.\n\nAfter immense pressure mounted on the caretaker committee by party\u2019s stakeholders, the APC governors met again on Sunday in Abuja, where they assured their members that the convention of the party would hold in February. It was the second meeting in weeks over convention matters.\n\nInterestingly, it emerged that the power play by the various interest groups and power blocs within the party later consumed Lukman, who resigned his position on Monday.\n\nMany saw Lukman as the conscience of the party, but it turned out that he could no longer be tolerated by some of the governors, who insisted that he must be shown the way out.\n\nWhile a majority of the governors opposed the attempt to force Lukman\u2019s resignation, a few insisted he must go, hence his eventual resignation.\n\nBuni, while speaking at the conference, said women constituted a large proportion of Nigeria\u2019s population and, therefore, their role in nation building, political and socio-economic development of the country could not be over emphasised. He said the role played by women made the membership registration and revalidation exercise a huge success.\n\nThe chairman boasted, \u201cAPC parades over 41 million registered members, asserting its position as Africa\u2019s largest political party and, of course, Nigeria\u2019s leading political party.\u201d\n\nBuni added, \u201cWith this, we are confident of winning the 2023 general election with huge success. Let me assure that the party shall not forget this gesture by supporting women and youths for their political aspirations, and to realise their political dreams.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to having more women contesting in the forthcoming National Convention of the party on February 26th, 2022, and the general elections. Now, as we approach the convention and moving closer to the next general election, I wish to remind you of your progressive role in supporting progressive minded leaders.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that politically, women had always played a key role in the country\u2019s electioneering process and administration, saying they remain the best and most reliable mobilisers of support for any political party and its candidates.\n\nReiterating that Nigeria proudly paraded a good number of women at the federal and state levels, as well as in political offices, who are serving excellently, Buni stressed that as the theme suggested, he was confident that the conference would unveil issues that would improve the fortunes of the ruling party and support the federal government in its commitment to improve the lives of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is in realisation of these great roles that the APC, as a matter of deliberate policy, always reserves some spaces to carry the women along at all levels,\u201d Buni stated.\n\nOn his part, Fayemi said, \u201cWe are going into our convention. I would like to plead with the chairman that we should make this a policy convention. A policy convention, where we can specifically take one by one all those aspects of life that our people want to know what we have done in the last six years; what we are still going to do roughly in the next 17 months left to our government and how we will consolidate on that by ensuring that we elect another APC president in 2023.\u201d\n\nFayemi said he was sure that Buni and members of the caretaker committee were interested in making the convention a policy convention and assured the people that the APC governors\u2019 forum would be happy to work with the committee.\n\nThe PGF chairman stated, \u201cWe in the PGF will work with them in order to ensure that the convention that is coming in February is not just a convention to elect the officers of the party, but also a policy convention to examine where we are, where we have come from, and where we are headed.\u201d\n\nHe hoped that the conference would come up with a charter of demands on issues germane to women before the convention.\n\nFayemi said, \u201cI know that we have covered a lot of ground, but we still have a lot of ground. We have not done enough for our women, we can do a lot more than what we have done. One, in terms of representation of women in offices, but also in terms of service delivery to our women across the length and breadth of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut we have the strength, we have the capacity, we have the commitment and we have the compassion to ensure that we deliver to our women.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, reacting to Lukman\u2019s resignation, spokesperson of the APC Rebirth Group, Mr. Aliyu Audu, in a statement yesterday said there was nothing progressive about the action of the progressive governors.\n\nThe group stated, \u201cOur disappointment is in the fact that a party that prides itself as a progressive party, more so governors elected under its platform, would be so intolerant to opinions that are not in agreement with their desires.\n\n\u201cWe are, however, not in the least surprised. When we started our campaign for the rebirth of the party as a way to address the obvious nosedive occasioned by the way past and current handlers were managing affairs, we were not only barred from using the party secretariat for any of our activities, members of the group were barred from entering the secretariat.\u201d\n\nThe group noted that while it hailed Lukman for his decision to tender his resignation, it was not unaware of the fact that APC governors at their meeting on Sunday orchestrated the resignation over his position on the state of APC and, particularly, his calls for the conduct of the national convention, which was long overdue.\n\nIt said Lukman shared a deep concern about the state of affairs of the party, just like APC Rebirth, adding, \u201cNot only has he courageously and consistently identified the problems, he has made far-reaching recommendations on how best to navigate the booby traps set before the party.\u201d\n\nBut rather than heed his calls, the governors of the party, the group said, mounted pressure on him to throw in the towel. \u201cIt is illogical that the attempt to stifle freedom of expression is being promoted by elected executives in a democracy, more so in a party that is said to be progressive,\u201d the APC Rebirth Group stated.\n\nHaving resigned his position, the group said Lukman was now at liberty, more than ever before, to continue his constructive engagement on behalf of millions of APC members, who counted on the bravery and fair-mindedness of people like him.\n\nIt also pointed out that the governors and leaders of APC had exposed their lack of principle as progressives and their inability to embrace opposing views.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Can APC Afford an Elective Convention?",
          "text": "Adedayo Akinwale\n\nAfter a long season of indecision, perhaps, prompted by an attempt to see the direction of events before committing themselves, the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has finally agreed to hold the national convention of the party on Saturday, February 26.\n\nThe date was announced yesterday in Abuja by the chairman of the committee and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, at a Progressive Women Conference. But Buni maintained a curious silence on the venue.\n\nThe announcement came after months of foot-dragging by the caretaker committee, which many initially thought had resolved to serve out the tenure of the sacked Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nDespite the announcement, which seemed to have excited key members of the party, the question now on the lips of many observers is whether the APC could afford to hold an elective convention, considering the multidimensional crises in most of the state chapters. Perhaps, it was based on this that a former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, in a letter dated December 13, 2021, urged the caretaker committee to consider postponing the national convention.\n\nHis suggestion came after the chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, and Buni had met President Muhammadu Buhari on November 22, 2021, before the February date announcement.\n\nKalu also suggested that the presidential primary and the convention of the party be conducted the same day.\n\nIt is public knowledge that the congresses recently conducted by the party led to further polarisation in many of the state chapters. At the end of the congresses, there were crises in at least 14 state chapters of APC at the last count. The states included Lagos, Bauchi, Imo, Enugu, Plateau, Zamfara, Kwara, Gombe, Ogun, Osun, Oyo, Ekiti, Kano, and Taraba.\n\nAggrieved party members from Lagos, Zamfara, Taraba, Ekiti, Kwara, and Kaduna states had also filed petitions against the party leadership at both state and national levels.\n\nAt the moment, no fewer than seven cases are pending before the Federal High Court, Abuja, challenging either the legitimacy of the Buni-led party committee or the decisions taken by the committee since its inauguration on June 25, 2020.\n\nFollowing the increasing court cases and the alarming polarisation of the party, particularly at the state level, the caretaker had set up the Senator Abdulahi Adamu reconciliation committee to halt the seeming descent into anarchy. But, like the other committees before it, the Adamu committee was unable to record remarkable breakthrough. However, it was able to reconcile aggrieved members in Enugu, Abia and Gombe state chapters of the party.\n\nAside from the crisis in the state chapters of the party, no fewer than seven cases are pending before the Federal High Court challenging the legitimacy of the Buni-led committee or some of its decisions. There were at least five cases in various courts challenging the eligibility of the party leadership. And with about five weeks to the proposed convention, there are still about 10 members contesting the national chairmanship position.\n\nThey are Chairman, Board of Trustees, Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND), Kashim Ibrahim-Imam; former governor of Nasarawa State, Tanko Al-Makura; another former governor of the state, Abdullahi Adamu; and incumbent governor of Benue State, George Akume.\n\nOthers include former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari; former governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda; former governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff; Mallam Saliu Mustapha; Senator Sani Musa; and Soni Monidafe.\n\nThough North-central seems favoured to clinch the number one party position, there are no indications yet that the aspirants have agreed to have a consensus arrangement. All the aspirants appear ready to slug it out at the convention.\n\nInvestigation, however, reveals that Ibrahim-Imam, Al-Makura, Adamu, and Akume are most favoured by the leadership of the party to emerge national chairman. The four are favoured by most of the governors.\n\nThough, there have been calls for serving governors, who are members of the caretaker committee, including Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, Buni and Governor of Osun State Gboyega Oyetola, as well as some members of the National Assembly, to resign. Those seeking the resignation base their argument on the officers\u2019 re-election bids, to prevent a situation where they would be judges in their own case.\n\nBut yesterday\u2019s meeting of the caretaker committee at the national headquarters of the party was inconclusive, and would be continued today.\n\nThe meeting yesterday deliberated on modalities, especially, the mode of the convention, whether it would be direct primary, delegate system, or consensus. The meeting also discussed the activities of the Adamu committee and the effect of the unresolved rancorous state congresses on the preparation for the convention.\n\nBut as is fast turning out, the fragile status of the ruling APC, especially, in the states, would make an elective convention for the party an acid test. Many believe it would be safer for the party to adopt a consensus arrangement in the forthcoming convention in order to present a united front at the 2023 elections.\n\nContenders for APC National Chairman\n\n\u2022Who among these men will lead the ruling party?\n\nAlthough the modalities for the February 26 National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has not been announced, one of these men, without a doubt, will lead the new National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling party, writes Chuks Okocha\n\nWith the February 26 date confirmed for the much-awaited national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the battle for the party\u2019s national chairmanship would kick off soon in full steam. This has necessitated a categorisation of the aspirants. Although it is looking like a battle of former governors, other contenders also seem ready to put up a strong contest.\n\nThe contest also seems like a realignment of the political forces that came together to form the APC, as some believe stakeholders may have agreed in principle to allow one of the legacy political parties to produce the next national chairman of the party.\n\nFor the record, APC was formed by a coalition of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), led by a former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu; Congress for Progressives Change (CPC), led by Buhari; New Peoples Democratic Party (NPDP), a faction of the PDP, led by the governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal; his then Rivers State counterpart, Chibuike Amaechi; and former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki. There were also segments of then All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), led former Imo State Governor, and now Senator, Rochas Okorocha.\n\nSo far, the CPC has taken the presidency, with President Muhammadu Buhari; ACN produced the vice president, in the person of Professor Yemi Osinbajo; while ANPP produced the Senate President, with Ahmad Lawan\n\nHowever, in the 2023 political calculations, a source at the weekend said though there was no official zoning of the offices of the party for the national convention, the CPC elements might almost certainly produce the national chairman of APC. The source said ACN stakeholders might produce the presidential candidate of the party.\n\nThe Chairmanship Contenders\n\nKashim Ibrahim-Imam\n\nKashim Ibrahim-Imam, from Borno State, is currently Chairman of TETFUND Board of Trustees. He was twice the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate for Borno State in 2003 and 2007, but he lost both elections to ANPP\u2019s Ali Modu Sheriff.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\nIbrahim-Imam was appointed Presidential Liaison Officer to the Senate at the start of President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s administration. He was not a founding member of the CPC, before it merged with other legacy political parties to form the APC, but he has solid contacts across the parties and in the government. He has been around for a while and boasts enviable experience required to move the party in a new direction. Largely seen as a friend of all tribes.\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n\nHis aspiration could be affected by his links to the PDP family, where he contested twice for the office of governor where he lost election twice to Sheriff, who is also in the chairmanship race. Borno was originally an ANPP state.\n\nTanko Al-Makura\n\nTanko Al-Makura is former governor of Nasarawa State. The 69-year-old businessman-turned-politician is keen on becoming the next APC NWC chairman.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\nAs a former governor and serving senator, Al-Makura has the war chest to prosecute the election, and he has the experience and network to become the next national chairman of APC.\n\nWEAKNESS:\n\nAl-Makura has running battles with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and may make a negative brand for the APC as party national chairman. He is reputed for not keeping to his promises and perceived as a selfish politician. He is rumoured to be in the habit of always running to the presidency to negotiate positions he wants, to the detriment of his party.\n\nIn 2011, Al-Makura allegedly negotiated with PDP to win the governorship seat. He was said to have repeated this in 2014.\n\nAbdullahi Adamu\n\nThe senator for Nasarawa West Senatorial District, Abdullahi Adamu was governor of Nasarawa State from 1999 to 2007.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\nAs former governor and third-term senator, he enjoys the same privileges as former governors for the contest, including a large war chest. This may also be considered a compensation for him, having yielded the senate presidency to Ahmed Lawan, following Buhari\u2019s intervention.\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n\nAdamu has lots of baggage on his personality. He is also a frequent guest of the EFCC on account of corruption allegations, and would not make a good brand image for the APC. A majority of party members see him as too old to be in the race, due to the complex nature of the job. At 75, Adamu is rated as too ambitious and might not make a good candidate for the national chairmanship of APC.\n\nGeorge Akume\n\nA two-term former governor of Benue State, Senator George Akume is Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\nAs a cabinet member, he can muster the confidence of some of his colleagues. He also has huge financial resources required to battle for the national chairmanship seat. As a former governor and senator, he has the contacts necessary to get the APC top job.\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n\nAkume is seen as arrogant and boastful, which were some of the factors that made APC to lose Benue to the opposition PDP. This followed the defection of Governor Samuel Ortom to the PDP. Akume does not seem to appeal to the new breed of politicians in APC.\n\nHe has the notorious reputation of drinking at crucial moments. His stewardship as Benue State governor was alleged to be unimpressive. Akume\u2019s role in APC losing Benue to the opposition is well documented and may be a minus for his aspiration.\n\nThe controversy surrounding his then ambition and scheming for the senate presidency may be an albatross for his new quest. APC members are wary of the imposition of party officials and Akume\u2019s antecedents in that regard is not pleasant.\n\nAbdulaziz Yari\n\nHe is a two-term former governor of Zamfara State, and a frontline contender to the position.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\nHe is former chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF), a position that gave him a lot of influence and respect among his former colleagues and some serving governors. He has the resources and political experience.\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n\nIf antecedents were anything to go by, then Abdulaziz Yari would be a bad sell for APC. The way Yari managed the last APC 2018 primaries, before the 2019 elections, was a disaster, which caused the total loss of APC candidates in the state to PDP.\n\nHis role in curtailing bandits during his tenure as governor of Zamfara State was not impressive. Today, his negligence in the handling of bandits is almost crippling the country.\n\nPolitical watchers saw the recent defection of the current governor of the state, Bello Matawalle, to the ruling APC as a threat to Yari\u2019s aspirations. Matawalle is reportedly not on the same page with Yari and has even accused the former governor of corrupt practices.\n\nSaliu Mustapha\n\nHe is an astute grassroots politician from Kwara State and the Turaki of Ilorin. Mallam Saliu Mustapha is the founder of Saliu Mustapha Foundation (SMF), which is involved in huge philanthropic services.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\nHe represents new hope in the political landscape of the country. A die-hard Buharist, Mustapha, has an edge over other contestants, as he is seen as a bridge between key party stakeholders, including the older and younger generations in the party.\n\nMustapha has paid his dues in political party administration. He was once national deputy chairman of the defunct CPC, one of the legacy parties that formed the APC, and a founding member of the ruling party.\n\nHis membership of the defunct CPC gives him an edge, as both ACN and ANPP blocs have had their slots; it looks like the turn of the CPC bloc to produce the next national chairman.\n\nMustapha is focused and regarded as one with a great vision for the party. He appeals to the majority of party members, because of his unique qualities and unifying role in the party. He is young and energetic, a major attribute members look forward to. The Kwara State governor is said to be behind his aspiration, including some ministers and governors.\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n\nHe is in battle with former governors that are seen as heavyweight political gladiators. And he may lack the financial capability to effectively pursue his ambition.\n\nAli Modu Sheriff\n\nA two-term former governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff is by disposition, a controversial character, who had traversed the two major political parties.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\nAli Modu Sheriff is a founding member of the APC, and also a leader of the defunct All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP). Sheriff is very rich and has the resources to stage a huge campaign for the national chairmanship seat. He has political experience and can gather some support from his ex-colleagues.\n\nSheriff\u2019s chairmanship of PDP a few years ago, which remains his major testimonial, is seen by his camp as a huge political advantage, which the APC should leverage upon at the convention. Having presided over the PDP, although largely controversial, the former Borno State governor is believed to know the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition party and should come to the battlefield better prepared than many others.\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n\nOrdinarily, many Nigerians may not take a party associated with Sheriff as the national chairman serious. He has a reputation for destabilising the political structure of parties. His stint as PDP factional national chairman was an eye-opener to the political class, to dine with the former Borno State governor with a long spoon.\n\nSheriff\u2019s alleged involvement in the creation of Boko Haram is in the public domain. His association with the late founder of the terrorist group, Mohammed Yusuf, also known as Ustaz Mohammed Yusuf, is an established fact. A lot of people would be dazed if the APC gave him the opportunity to chair the party. Sheriff enjoys little trust among the APC ruling class and even party members.\n\nKashim Shettima\n\nSenator Kashim Shettima is also a two-term former governor of Borno State, and currently a senator.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\nA cerebral senator and well-connected among the top echelons of the party, he enjoys the support of his governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, and some amount of goodwill among his colleagues. He also has requisite experienced for the job.\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n\nHe falls among the category of ex-governors that are associated with the imposition of party officials, without regard to party structure. Seen as a weak brand to represent the party, his handling of the Boko Haram crisis, when he held sway as Borno State chief executive, left much to be desired.\n\nSunny Moniedafe\n\nA former Federal Capital Territory (FCT) chairman of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Sunny Moniedafe is from Delta State.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\nMoniedafe enjoys the privilege of entering the contest with no baggage. Amiable and a good sell for the party, he believes the party could change for the better if it made the right choices in leadership. Seen as brave and courageous, Moniedafe is of the new breed politicians. He may not have previously occupied any elective office, but he believes his administrative experience in party management even before APC was established, gives him an edge.\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n\nHe is from Delta State, which seems not to be in tandem with the unofficial zoning of the chairmanship seat. He does not seem to have the requisite experience to manage such a big political party.\n\nSani Mohammed Musa\n\nMusa, 54, is senator for Niger East Senatorial district. He had previously contested for the PDP governorship ticket in his state but lost. Musa is a major contender in the race.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\nMusa is entering the race with a clean slate and has no issues with any of the anti-graft agencies. He also has a smooth-running relationship with party members. The young politician, who is fondly called \u201cSani 313\u201d by his political admirers, believes he has what it takes to take on the chairmanship position.\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n\nHe does not have the necessary experience as a party administrator. He needs to put in more effort to boost his popularity among the top political elite. His endurance level and loyalty to the party has not been tested. He is not a member of the CPC group and has a serious EFCC case over the card reader controversy.\n\nDanjuma Goje\n\nDanjuma Goje, a senator and former two-term governor of Gombe State, joined the APC from the Peoples Democratic Party, where he defected.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\nHe enjoys the same privileges as former governors. Goje\u2019s political influence in the state was instrumental to the APC taking over the state in 2019. As a third term and current senator, he enjoys the support of top party delegates. A highly respected politician with some whiff of national clout and appeal, he boasts huge experience.\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n\nPolitical observers in the North-east have expressed fear that the friction between the lawmaker and Governor Inuwa Yahaya over control of party structure in the state may affect his ambition. They argue that the influential role of the Progressive Governors Forum in determining who gets what in the party may be deployed by Yahaya to stall Goje\u2019s aspiration.\n\nParty members are not too disposed to former governors ascending the national chairmanship position, because of their characters of imposing party officials. This may work against Goje as well.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "The Thrills of Buhari\u2019s Visit to Ogun",
          "text": "By Bolu Adeosun\n\nThere are many reasons President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s visit to Nigeria\u2019s Gateway State on Thursday is a memory to treasure. His last visit to the state, made during the 2019 campaign period, had been all but pleasant: political forces intent on foisting an unpopular candidate on the people had turned the MKO Abiola stadium into a battleground, throwing objects at the Number One citizen in a fit of comedic anger. And recently when he postponed his visit, the naysayers jubilated to no end, saying that they had aborted the visit with their influence. But Buhari\u2019s coming proved just the opposite: he is his own man, he belongs to everybody and to nobody, and would not be railroaded into precipitate decisions. His interest is the good of the land and wherever he sees honesty, probity, transparency and accountability, that is where he goes. He attested to that much when, during the thick of the coronavirus pandemic, he turned down the request for N5bn by the Kano State government, saying that he gave that sum to Ogun and Lagos because he saw their sincerity of purpose in tackling the scourge.\n\nAnd so on Thursday, basking in the traditional warmth of the people that brought back memories of his days as a young infantry soldier, the president, who arrived at the Mojoda inauguration venue in Ijebu-Ode area at 11:37am and was received by Abiodun, governors of Yobe, Ekiti, Ondo and Osun states, among other top government officials, literally rode into the state in a blaze of joy. And he said just as much. As the chief host, Prince Dapo Abiodun, made clear, choosing the five projects the president would commission out of hundreds of projects was a herculean task. All his projects \u201chave the inputs and are informed by the needs of the people as expressed by them at different engagement fora that we provide. This is because we anchor our \u201cBuilding our Future Together\u201d Agenda on inclusiveness, equity, fairness, transparency, accountability, justice, and obedience to the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe president inaugurated the Ijebu-Ode-Epe road , a strategic arterial road that links the Lekki / Epe corridor of Lagos State to the eastern corridor of Ogun State at Ijebu-Ode, provides a ready alternative to the Lagos/Ibadan expressway for those going to Lekki and adjoining areas, and which, in Governor Abiodun\u2019s own words, is set to boost socio-economic activities in the South East and South South zones of Nigeria through the linkage of the road to Sagamu-Benin Expressway for easier access by motorists to Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s largest economy. He commissioned the 42 km Sagamu Interchange-Abeokuta road, the main arterial road that leads to the state capital. It comes with a dual carriageway with streetlights, median and other road furniture, vastly redesigned and reconstructed to address the daily challenges being experienced by commuters, and to make commuting between the state capital and other parts of the State and, indeed, the rest of the country safe, secure and pleasant.\n\nThe president did not leave out the Gateway City Gate, an architectural masterpiece made of composite materials towering to a height of 27m and warmly welcoming visitors to the state, and neither did he fail to commission the two Housing Estates for low, medium and high income earners at Kobape and Oke-Mosan. Kobape has 300 units of one, two and three bedroom flats described as a \u201cSmart City\u201d where people can live, work and play, complete with solar streetlights, sewage system, primary health centre, drainage, water, electricity, tarred road and a police post. Kings Court Estate, located in Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, has CCTV cameras, perimeter fence gated with security personnel, connected drainage and interlocking complemented by uninterrupted power supply, walkways, pipe-borne water, package sewage plant and recreational parks, among other features, and completed the five wonders Buhari officially unveiled for the good of the Ogun populace. Of course, there are many projects awaiting completion, including the first phase of the Ogun State International Agro Cargo Airport at Ilishan and the Atan-LUSADA-Agbara expressway which leads to Agbara Industrial Estate, the industrial nerve center of Ogun State, Nigeria and indeed, the entire ECOWAS Sub-region.\n\nThe Ogun helmsman could not hide his joy at hosting the president: \u201cSome naysayers had said, Mr President, that you were not going to come but I knew that you were going to come and I want to thank you personally for coming.\u201d And Buhari, baptized with a new name, Omowale, basked in the welcome by a large crowd. \u201cThe traditional hospitality of the people of this State has not waned a bit. Today, I am \u201cOmowale\u201d and very happy at this homecoming to meet my brothers and sisters whose goodwill I have always enjoyed. Thank you,\u2019\u2019 Buhari said at the Gateway City Gate. To him, the Gateway City Gate is not just a park beautification project, but one that depicts that something new is happening in Ogun State\n\nHe thumbed up Prince Abiodun\u2019s delivery of visionary and trail-blazing projects for the people, even in the midst of prevailing and challenging circumstances occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that the lofty projects he commissioned could not have materialised without the state government\u2019s huge investment and commitment to security of lives and property, which he said had Ogun State one of the safest and most peaceful states in the country and investors\u2019 destination of choice. The president was particularly impressed by the quality and standard of the road projects, and the creative way the governor had deployed resources to reconstruct and rehabilitate them. His words: \u2018\u2018It is significant to note that the two road projects being commissioned today are federal roads. This is an example of constructive engagement, cooperation and collaboration between the States and Federal Government. These roads also fit well into our rail transportation masterplan that connects Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s economic capital to Kano, with Ogun State having more rail stations, along the Lagos-Ibadan rail corridor.\u2019\u2019 The housing programme of the Ogun governor, he added, fostered inclusiveness, cutting across different social strata and capturing low, medium and high income earners.\n\nThrilled, the president assured that the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta and the Sango Otta-Idiroko roads would receive Federal Government attention, that the Federal Government would consider extending tax credit as funding option for the reconstruction of the roads, as done for the 100km Sagamu Interchange-Papalanto-Ilaro road, and would consider approving the reconstruction of Sagamu-Ogijo road by NNPC Ltd under the tax credit scheme. His concluding remarks will linger in memory: \u2018\u2018When state governments deliver impactful projects, in consultations with stakeholders, like we have witnessed in Ogun State, the trajectory of our national development will be enhanced.\u2019\n\n\u2019 That was spot on because, beyond these physical projects, the Ogun helsman has a series of fiscal and policy reforms, including the reinvigoration of the Security Trust Fund; establishment of Public-Private Partnership Office; the Ogun Digital Economy Infrastructure Projects, and the Ogun State Land Revenue and Management Systems (OLARMS). It is no surprise that Ogun State now ranks 4th on the scale of Ease-of-Doing-Business in Nigeria. And it\u2019s set to become number one very soon.\n\nAdeosun contributes this piece through boluadeosun@aol.com\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "What exactly is Web3?",
          "text": "Venture capitalists (VCs) and investors in Silicon Valley are saying the internet will evolve to become a place where users will be able to run their own servers, control how their data is used and shared by third parties, own digital property, and have access to a seamless and borderless payment system based entirely on the internet. But not many people have a clear picture of this great vision.\n\nTo explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralisation\u2014from platforms Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3 promises to deepen the democratisation of the internet.\n\nTo help you understand this promised new dispensation of the internet, let\u2019s take you through the origins of the previous and current versions of it.\n\nA brief history of the internet\n\nWeb 1.0 (Web1), the earliest version of the internet, existed roughly between the early 1990s and mid-2000s and was characterised by web pages that were static or read-only. This version of the internet was built by web developers to deliver mostly texts and graphics to participants, who could only consume the content but not interact with it. This version is considered decentralised because it used open-source internet protocols from the 1970s and 1980s, where anyone could build on them without permission from any quarters.\n\nAfter Web1, came Web2\u2014the version we have now\u2014which is a product of the Dotcom Bubble burst, where the initial rush of investments in internet-based companies yielded losses. This was historic as it helped filter out shams and highlight the real success stories, which laid the foundation for subsequent successful internet companies. While Web2 can be explained to be when the internet became an interactive and a social web\u2014where everyone with access to it could create content\u2014it is much more than that.\n\nA year and a half after the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was popularised, there was still a lot of debate as to what it meant. At some point, it was even labelled a meaningless marketing buzzword. (You might have heard this said about Web3 now.)\n\nWeb 2.0 is characterised by tech companies that build their own platform on the free layer of the internet and lock it in while providing a rich user experience that prevents users from wanting to leave. In this version of the internet, apps are built in a way that allows users to become creators. YouTube, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media are some popular examples of Web 2.0 applications.\n\nWeb2 companies build sleek and revolutionary apps that become popular quickly, and as the app\u2019s popularity increases, so does its user base. While users can access these applications for free, they pay by inadvertently offering up their personal data, which Web2 companies sell to advertisers and sometimes political campaigners. Consequently, some of these companies have grown to become the most valuable in history\u2014in less than two decades.\n\nSince these web apps are controlled by a single internet company, users can only use them as long as the company wants them to. This is one of the reasons ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, decided to abandon centralised systems and, subsequently, create the widely used cryptocurrency. The Russian-Canadian programmer wrote on his personal website: \u201cI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007\u20132010, but one day, Blizzard [the maker of the game] removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realised what horrors centralised services can bring.\u201d\n\nAll these confer so much power on these companies and make data breaches more dangerous and frequent. Additionally, governments have used centralisation to bully internet companies to censor or shut down the accounts of dissidents. This is usually because the government knows the exact company and centralised servers it is targeting.\n\nIs Web3 the next version of the internet?\n\n\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of Web3 Foundation, and he said then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain\u2014a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications\u2014also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAt the core of Web3 is decentralised finance (DeFi), which aims to take power away from traditional governmental institutions and corporations. The term \u201cDeFi\u201d was coined in a Telegram group by a community of software developers and entrepreneurs who sought a name for a new financial system that would be automated, outstrip traditional banks, and place a premium on individualism (as against institutions) by using a blockchain. As a matter of fact, black people are quite certain that DeFi or crypto presents the key to a better future for them. So, it\u2019s not surprising that they would seek refuge in a system that doesn\u2019t centre their exploiters.\n\nWeb3 intends to disrupt the way startups, businesses, and organisations are run, through decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs)\u2014a social community of like-minded people who create rules and regulations embedded in programming code called a smart contract and may issue governance tokens. In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratised organisation. The governance of DAOs is based on community. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented.\n\nIn DAOs, decisions regarding the design of products and spending of funds can be made only if members vote and an agreement is reached. In September last year, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group, a group of blockchain developers, created one of Africa\u2019s first DAOs, called BNUGDao.\n\nThat brings us to decentralised applications (dApps), which are powered by smart contracts\u2014a decentralised network, instead of a single server. A dApp may feel like your regular app, but it uses the ethereum blockchain for data storage and smart contract for its app logic. Examples of dApps include OpenSea, Rarible, Metamask, Audius, etc.\n\nWho are Web3\u2019s champions?\n\nIn this thread republished as an article, Andreessen Horowitz partner, Chris Dixon, who has been called the \u201cKing of Web3\u201d, in an argument in favour of Web3, wrote: \u201cTokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal\u2014the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This fixes the core problem of centralised networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that Dixon\u2019s firm has invested a massive amount of money in cryptocurrency companies and stands to gain heavily from the success of Web3. This is, in fact, why some other tech founders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk believe that it is just a marketing ploy by rich investors to further enrich themselves.\n\nWhile some believe that the decentralisation that Web3 proposes will come from ethereum, at the polarising end are people like Jack Dorsey who believe that bitcoin, not ethereum, is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralised.\n\nOne more problem: This version of the internet could be difficult for ordinary users to adopt, as they would need high technical literacy to use blockchain-based internet products. That is why Nigerian crypto entrepreneur, Yele Bademosi, started out his Web3 development plan in Africa with Breach, a platform that uses newsletters, blog posts, quizzes, etc to teach Africans complex Web3 topics.\n\n\u201cTo those who don\u2019t believe, everything is too early until it\u2019s not. My general focus is on builders and believers. And through the products that we build and the traction that we will get, we get more believers over time,\u201d said Bademosi, who is also the founder of Nestcoin, an African company that is building in the Web3 ecosystem with products like a pay-to-earn-crypto game, Metaverse Magna; the earlier-mentioned publication Breach; and a DAO.\n\nAn internet version where it\u2019s easier to monetise content?\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on Twitter, you must have seen discussions on why Web3 technology, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) powered by ethereum, are either useful or worthless evidence of ownership of digital assets. In case you don\u2019t know, NFT uses blockchain technology to allow individuals and artists to claim ownership and sell their digital assets.\n\nLast week, OpenSea raised $300 million and is now valued at $13 billion. The company, which was founded in 2017, hugely benefited from the huge investment in NFT that dominated last year and facilitated $14 billion worth of transactions, representing a massive increase from a now meagre $22 million recorded in 2020. It is important to note that OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee and, this year already, trading volume has passed $1 billion.\n\nAfrican creators, like others around the world, have benefited from NFT: Nigerian artist Jacon Oshinachi sold 3 NFT arts worth $70,000 in just 10 days; South African artist Norman O\u2019Flynn sold the country\u2019s first-ever NFT for around $35,000 in March; and, in April, Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge sold highlights of his career as NFTs for $50,000. Projects like Art X\u2019s Reloading\u2026, in partnership with digital art marketplace SuperRare, are part of an effort to support the unprecedented rise of NFTs on the continent.\n\nProponents of Web3 believe it is a perfect opportunity for content creators to monetise their content. \u201cBlockchain is going to allow information that shouldn\u2019t be free to not be free,\u201d explained Mike Novogratz, an entrepreneur who has half of his $700 million net worth in crypto assets.\n\nWeb3 wants to make it so that content creators make money. Web3 promises to give creators a fair share of what they contribute. By using the NFT technology games like Axie Infinity, Web3 has made it possible for people to make a living from playing\u2014as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nAn opportunity for builders\n\nWeb3 is an opportunity to build an entirely new tech ecosystem crypto. \u201cWhen I moved back to Nigeria in 2015, there was a lot going on in the ecosystem\u2014community related activities, developers training programmes, early-stage investors putting money in early-stage founders. I think it\u2019s the same thing all over again. We need to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Bademosi.\n\nNFT gaming is a huge part of Web3, and like Metaverse Magna, Thrill Digital has built a crypto gaming product, Astra, that will allow players to win real-life luxury fashion.\n\nThese startups will go ahead to hire hundreds of designers and developers to build out these ideas. A huge opportunity such as this will create opportunities for developers on the continent and prompt more of them to learn relevant languages and stacks. This will increase Africa\u2019s chances of not only supplying the world with developers that can build emerging technology products\u2014as there is a deficit\u2014but also building out crypto-native products that will scale globally.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s new deal with Twitter is not a win for the government or citizens",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s new deal with Twitter is its government\u2019s most recent effort to control social media. While experts tell us that this is a failed attempt at the project, they warn that the deal will definitely have a bearing on internet freedom in the country.\n\nThe Nigerian government banned Twitter for 7 months and only lifted the ban last week after it claimed Twitter has agreed to certain terms. The social media company has, reportedly, agreed to register as a legal entity in Nigeria, pay taxes, and cooperate with Nigeria, through the Partner Support and Enforcement Portal, to regulate harmful content.\n\nTomiwa Ilori, an internet freedom researcher, says the Twitter ban sets a very bad precedent for internet freedom in the country, and if freedom of information requests and lawsuits seeking to get accurate, official, and economic explanations for the government\u2019s actions are not filed now, \u201cwe might have opened up the online right of Nigerians to express [themselves only according] to the whims of politicians.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, like in other parts of Africa, laws made by the government to regulate violent, harmful, and fake speech are used to stifle legitimate online speech.\n\nWhile explaining that he isn\u2019t aware of the exact law that the government relied on for the Twitter ban, Ilori said the Nigerian Communications Act\u2019s (NCA) long history of being weaponised to block access to internet websites makes it a prime suspect. \u201cMy guess is that they used the provisions of sections 146 and 148 of the NCA to get the telcos to block access to Twitter, as they have done in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne major issue with these NCA provisions is that the government gets to decide what is in the public interest or is an emergency, as the basis of their request to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). There is no judicial review, human rights impact assessment of proposed actions before and after such requests, or public access to requests made to the internet service providers (ISPs) by the NCC. It is also important to note that ISPs do not push back or carry out necessary assessments before compliance.\u201d\n\nThe lifting of the ban is not a win for Nigerians\n\nIlori explained that the lifting of the ban means that Nigerians need to start thinking about terms of legal reforms for online expression in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI think the portal could be a great avenue for bridging sides. Having a dedicated means of reporting speech capable of causing violence and harm by proximate actors could help forestall violence. But who are these actors? I ask, because Twitter and the government should not be the only ones determining the nature and type of expression that Nigerians are allowed to share,\u201d Ilori says.\n\nIlori believes that there is a need to expand the content governance arrangement to include civil society actors, experts, and activists.\n\nThe government memo which contained the terms of lifting the ban states that the Portal would serve as a channel for law enforcement agencies to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian laws.\n\nHowever, Ilori thinks that the government\u2019s power in the agreement is secondary and the actual moderation of content would lie with Twitter.\n\nIt\u2019s not a win for the government either\n\nFor Gbenga Sesan, executive director of Paradigm Initiative, a digital rights group, the government didn\u2019t score any points with the Portal, as it has existed for a while now; it only looks like a win for the Nigerian government because it hasn\u2019t used it before.\n\nAccording to Twitter\u2019s Transparency Report\u2014a report that gives insights into information and removal requests from around the world, by country\u2014Nigeria has made zero removal requests and just 7 information requests, at the time of reporting. However, India has made 12,435 legal removal requests, 67 court orders, and 12,368 other legal demands, representing 6% of global removal requests. According to the report, Twitter complied with 12.4% of India\u2019s requests.\n\nIn February last year, India\u2019s government enacted a fresh social media rule that made social media companies like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and others more accountable to legal requests. This law allows the government to tag content as \u201cunlawful\u201d while forcing messaging service providers to identify posters of specific messages.\n\nThis regulation has its origin in the Indian government\u2019s semisweet relationship with Twitter. The government asked Twitter to take down some content it alleged was spreading misinformation about farmers protesting agricultural reform. But, to the chagrin of the Indian government, Twitter partially complied and restored access to some of the accounts it had blocked \u201cin a manner that we believe was inconsistent with Indian law,\u201d Twitter wrote at the time.\n\nThis, Sesan said, was the reason the Nigerian government has repeatedly tried to enact social media bills. But failed. First came the Frivolous Petitions Bill, which seeks to prevent the spread of falsehood on social media, with jail time and a $10,000 fine. Like subsequent remakes of the bill, it was withdrawn, after 6 months of widespread public criticism.\n\n\u201cSocial media bills\u201d as they would later be called, have been resurrected, over the years, in the form of 2 other bills: the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill and the National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill.\n\nBut Sesan says Nigeria\u2019s internet restriction tactics are miles behind India\u2019s because the latter drew up regulations; Twitter will only respond to legal requests backed by legislation. \u201cIndia drew up new laws on social media that were specific. Nigeria made similar demands, but there is no bill in parliament making that case.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The removal of the suspension took effect from 12 AM Thursday, January 13, 2022.\n\nThe announcement was made on Wednesday by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the approval was given following a memo written by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim to the President. In the memo, the minister updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting of the suspension based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nMy heart and tweet goes out to all the small businesses that lost revenue and opportunities during the #TwitterBan.

The execution timeline for the conditions begins from this week.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter. They\u2019ve also pointed out that the suspension was unnecessary and wonder if the removal was incentivised by the desire to use the platform to campaign for the country\u2019s upcoming elections next year.\n\nNot FG lifting the #TwitterBan 13 months to election, so they can come back and use this same social media to campaign.\n\n\n\nAffliction shall not rise a second time.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe#KeepitOn \u2014 QueenEsther Iroanusi (@QueenExtha) January 12, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Humans are social animals to the core, and travelling helps hone this social instinct.\n\nInterestingly, different companies are creating exciting solutions for the travel sector, and there seems to be a world of opportunities. Meta\u2019s (Formerly Facebook) Metaverse is perhaps the most compelling so far, and it feels futuristic. Our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi, had some compelling arguments regarding tourism and COVID-19 in this article.\n\nToday on Techpoint Build Spotlight, we\u2019re catching up with Akinnuga Ayobami, COO of Tramango, one of Africa\u2019s innovators in the travel space and the official travel partner for Techpoint Build 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you give us an idea of what Tramango does?\n\nWe are a full-service travel-tech company delivering premium travel experiences in Africa. At Tramango, we help individuals and organisations have memorable experiences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe offer a range of services that covers flight booking, stay reservations, visa assistance and documentation, concierge services and destination marketing.\n\nWith the development of the tourism industry in Africa, we firmly believe that the industry can lead to business and economic growth.\n\nHow would you explain your startup\u2019s value offering to a five-year-old?\n\nWe help people get around their favourite countries quickly and easily and give them pleasurable experiences in those countries.\n\nWhat makes Tramango excited about Techpoint Build 2021?\n\nTechpoint Build is helping African entrepreneurs showcase their ideas to the world and funding opportunities through Pitchstorm, the startup competition. We are excited to see future unicorns exhibiting at the event.\n\nWe will also be leveraging on the platform to promote our goal of bringing African tourism experiences to people.\n\nAbove all, this event allows us to position ourselves as the frontrunner of easy travel in Africa. This platform helps us push and promote our goal of easy travel in Africa.\n\nWhat pain point do you think needs to be addressed in the travel sector?\n\nEase of travel, most especially within Africa, as Tramango\u2019s main objective, is to make travel as easy as you can imagine. With the ridiculous airfares within the African border to stringent processes in getting visas, Africans are subjected to discriminatory policies which in turn create travel restrictions.\n\nYou can\u2019t innovate around some problems; most issues would need the call of the African Union and the interest of governments to invoke change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat impact do you envisage following Techpoint Build conversations on the next frontier?\n\nThese conversations will raise more interest for people to explore Africa, create a forum for partnership amongst relevant stakeholders to change the African travel narrative and help governments to create favourable policies in the nearest future.\n\nFor us at Tramango, we hope to create productive partnerships and collaborations with travel brands to achieve the primary goal, which is easy travel.\n\nAkinnuga will be dissecting the topic \u201cTravel 3.0: Exploring new business opportunities and innovations\u201d alongside Tayo Aina, filmmaker, entrepreneur, and travel YouTuber.

          "title": "Blockchain is hard, but Crevatal wants to make it easy",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe complexities that come with using blockchain or crypto platforms is one of the many reasons most people tend to stay away from it. The intricate-looking platforms usually dissuade many who have sought my help in starting their crypto journey.\n\nWhile data by Chainalysis shows that crypto adoption rate is increasing rapidly, findings by Triple A, a company that helps businesses accept crypto payments, cryptocurrency users globally are barely a fraction of the world\u2019s population.\n\nIn 2021, Triple A estimated that the global crypto ownership rate is at an average of 3.9%, with 300 million \u2014 4.285% of the global population \u2014 crypto owners globally.\n\nOluchi Enebeli and Clement Hugbo, Co-founders of Crevatal, are combining years of experience in the blockchain space to simplify blockchain and foster mainstream adoption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is blockchain complicated?\n\nBlockchain is said to be one of the technologies that will usher in the fourth industrial revolution. However, it is still a concept most people can\u2019t wrap their heads around. The technology, in itself, is a means of storage that provides accessibility to saved information but still provides high-level security through decentralisation.\n\nIt stores information in multiple places simultaneously, and these different locations become a network. By keeping the information in separate areas, alterations become problematic because they must be done simultaneously across all points.\n\nAlthough the tech in its simplest form is simply a clever way to store information, it has, in recent years, evolved to reveal other capabilities, especially in the area of finance (cryptocurrency) and, more popularly, Web3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClement Hugbo \u2013 CEO, Co-Founder, Crevatal\n\nHugbo believes the reason why this revolutionary tech is still complex for many to use is that the builders are not paying attention to a critical component \u2014 design.\n\n\u201cFor every new technology that makes its way into the tech ecosystem, one of the first people that the ecosystem looks up to for growth are the developers and the programmers.\n\n\u201cDesigners are sometimes less valued when it comes to creating products.\u201d\n\nHe adds that while their importance is relatively well understood in the tech ecosystem, design needs more attention when it comes to new tech like blockchain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluchi Enebeli, Co-Founder, Crevatal\n\nEnebeli\u2019s opinion on why blockchain is hard to use leans towards Hugbo\u2019s. As a blockchain engineer, she admits that the tech is quite complex. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new ballgame,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd being different from what everyone is used to makes it even harder.\n\nBeing a blockchain developer, she also understands the excitement of building new products and not paying attention to the ease of using the products.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s a maturing technology, developers are the major people in the space.\u201d\n\nHow Crevatal plans to make blockchain simpler\n\nCrevatal is a company that focuses on user experience (UX) design for blockchain and more specifically, Web3 products. Although the company started out doing other things, including backend engineering, integrating smart contracts, and tokenisation, it has decided to focus on design which it believes is a crucial ingredient to blockchain adoption.\n\nCreativity is vital to tech, and Crevatal believes strongly in it. In fact, the name Crevatal is a combination of the words, creativity and vital.\n\nFounded in late 2019, the goal for Crevatal is to become the most revered blockchain design company in Africa. It started pursuing this goal fully in 2020 when Enebeli, who has been a blockchain engineer since 2016, came on board.\n\nShe has worked for global blockchain companies like Binance, Crypto.com, and Bundle. Hugbo also has years of experience in the blockchain space, and the duo is combining their skills and expertise to bring simplicity to blockchain, one product at a time.\n\nUsing Web2 talents to build Web3 products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, tech talent is scarce in Africa, but finding blockchain talent is even more challenging.\n\nThis, however, isn\u2019t a problem for Crevatal as it doesn\u2019t actively recruit ready-made blockchain talents. They are using a route I consider rather cumbersome: taking in Web2 talents and grooming them into blockchain and Web3 masters.\n\nSide note: Web2 talents are tech talents that build Internet-based products for the current Internet iteration. Web3 talents, on the other hand, make decentralised blockchain-based products.\n\nBesides the co-founders, most team members are new to blockchain or Web3. The idea is to induct them into the fold by learning on the job.\n\n\u201cOne of the best ways to learn is actually through service, and this way, you begin to learn passively. We train and teach new members that come on board, and we create knowledge-sharing sessions where we share knowledge about blockchain technology.\n\nIn that process, they begin to pick things up. Understanding the intricacies of blockchain and how they connect with each other,\u201d Ugbo said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrevatal website\n\nInterestingly, the absence of Web3 and blockchain talents isn\u2019t the only reason Crevatal has chosen to train its own talents. According to Enebeli, it\u2019s essential to have a fresh pair of eyes when designing blockchain platforms.\n\n\u201cIf you have been in the Web3 space for too long, you begin to lose touch with Web2 platforms and traditional finance platforms. You become so used to it that you don\u2019t see it the way a newbie would see it.\n\n\u201cFor example, people who have been on decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms don\u2019t see any issues with it as they\u2019ve gotten used to it over time. That is one of the reasons why we want to also have Web2 designers on the team; we want to see things through their eyes.\u201d\n\nMarrying crypto with food using Noshify\n\nWhile Crevatal is committed to helping companies and Web3 communities build platforms with simple UX design, it\u2019s also building platforms of its own, one of which is Noshify.\n\nNoshify is a platform with the most unlikely combination: cryptocurrency and food. It is a marketplace that connects independent food vendors to customers who have the option of paying in cryptocurrency.\n\nCrevatal believes that using cryptocurrencies for real-world uses beyond trading gets people more accustomed to them.\n\nFor Enebeli and Ugo, the drive to create simple platforms comes from the passion they have for blockchain. They believe that it is a technology that could revolutionise Africa and provide true financial freedom.\n\nWhile several factors stand against the use of blockchain beyond simplicity, it is, however, an excellent place to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nOrda\u2019s $1.1 million pre-seed\n\nAffordable Internet for Africans\n\nFinclusion Group\u2019s pre-Series A\n\nOrda\u2019s $1.1 million pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud-based restaurant management platform, Orda, has announced its $1.1 million pre-seed led by Lofty Inc. Microtraction, Norrsken Foundation, MAGIC Fund, Ire Aderinokun, and other angel investors also participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Orda do? It is an electronic point of sale (ePOS) and restaurant management system that helps food business owners manage all their operations from one place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means restaurants and food business owners can see everything going on with the platform. From orders placed on WhatsApp, Jumia Foods, SMS and even inside the restaurant.\n\nWith all these order data, Orda can give business owners insightful information critical to business growth. The data also includes inventory \u2014 like how much salt, ogbono, or chicken is left.\n\nLaunched in April 2021, the startup was founded by Guy Futi (CEO), Adinlewa \u201cFikayo\u201d Akinwale (CTO), Mark Edomwande, Kunle Ogungbamila, and Namir El-Khouri. They had the idea when they tried building the tech for their own restaurants.\n\nOrda plans to expand to other African countries and become the leading platform for cloud-based restaurant management in the country.\n\nRead more: After building for 18 months, cloud-based restaurant management platform, Orda, raises $1.1m pre-seed\n\nPoa Internet raises $28 million to provide low-cost Internet to Africans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know how people say that the Internet creates a level playing ground for everyone regardless of social status. Well, not really. Too many Africans still can\u2019t afford an Internet connection due to the high cost of data services on the continent. As a result, millions of people are shut out from the Internet and its benefits.\n\nSo you can see why startups like Poa Internet, who have just raised $28 million for its Series C, need to be protected at all costs.\n\nPoa Internet provides low-cost Internet services to individuals and businesses in Kenya, starting with low and middle-income neighbourhoods. Currently operating out of Nairobi, the startup charges users KSh 3500 ($30) to install home Internet systems with a KSh 1500 ($13) monthly fee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike their competitors, who put a cap on data volume, the startup offers unlimited data connectivity to its customers. In addition, the company has set up WIFI hotspots across the country where users pay as little as $0.18 to download 1GB of data.\n\nAlthough Poa Internet charges about half of what their competitors do, their prices are not low enough for the average African. With a GDP of $2,169, most Kenyans will find it difficult to afford a plan from Poa. However, their ability to offer similar services to competitors at half the price may suggest there is still room for more affordable Internet.\n\nWith more capital at its disposal, the startup plans to expand its reach across Africa, starting with Kenya.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on Kenya at the moment, but the problem we\u2019re solving is continent-wide. And for us, it\u2019s not just about getting people some connectivity. Our aim is to get a lot of people online and to give them a meaningful internet experience like the ability to stream videos, without worrying about how much data they\u2019re consuming,\u201d Andy Halsall, CEO and Co-founder, said in an interview with TechCrunch.\n\nGo deeper: Kenyan low-cost ISP Poa Internet secures $28 million in round led by AfDB-backed Africa50, plans to link region with cheap, limit-free connectivity\n\nFinclusion Group raises $20 million pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Finclusion Group\u2019s website\n\nFintech startup, Finclusion Group has raised $20 million in its pre-Series A combination of debt and equity financing. Iyin Aboyeji, Amandine Lobelle, Christian Faes, Charlie Delingpole, James Mahtani, and Sudeep Ramnani were investors in the round.\n\nFounded in 2018, Finclusion Group has adopted a credit-led approach, including products like Smart Advance, Happy Pay, Trust Gro, NiftyCredit, and NiftyPay. With Smart Advance, for example, the startup works with employers to provide credit facilities for employees.\n\nWith the fresh injection of capital, the startup intends to grow its operations in Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Kenya, and Tanzania while expanding into Mozambique and Uganda. Finclusion is also adopting a neobank strategy to retain its existing customers.\n\nAccording to CEO, Timothy Nuy, the plan has always been to be a neobank. Having used credit as an entry point, it is now diversifying its services. Already, the company has an insurance product and plans to introduce buy now, pay later and savings offerings in the future.\n\nRead more: Finclusion raises $20M to build out credit-led neobank offering across Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\n\u201cEverything is content\u201d: Inside the daily grind of one of India\u2019s biggest influencer families\n\nHow to Calculate Your Pre-Money Valuation\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Build 2021 is this week!!!

          "title": "10 years after protest, over $60bn on subsidy, no change",
          "text": "Ten years after the #OccupyNigeria protest against petrol subsidy removal, the Nigerian government has only abolished it on paper. It is unclear if another attempt to remove it in six months will happen because of a political backlash as in a year before elections, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).\n\nIn its most recent report on Nigeria, the EIU said, \u201cPast attempts to lift price controls (most recently in 2020) were abandoned after a political backlash, and the government will want to avoid a repeat so close to the polls.\u201d\n\nNigeria spent over $63 billion between 2005 and 2018 on petrol subsidy, according to data from Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Last year alone, Nigeria spent $4.5 billion on petrol subsidy, according to the World Bank, and during the subsidy scandal in 2011, Nigeria spent $6.8 billion on subsidy. A back-of-the-envelope estimation puts subsidy spend in the last 10 years at over $60 billion.\n\nIn August 2021, the Federal Government passed the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which prescribes the deregulation of the downstream sector, putting an end to petrol subsidy and the infrastructure that enables it. On the 10th anniversary of that protest, the Buhari administration is yet to implement the law ending the practice.\n\nOn January 1, 2012, the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan announced the removal of fuel subsidy triggering demonstrations in major cities across Nigeria the next day.\n\nProtests\n\nTwo of Nigeria\u2019s largest labour unions \u2013 Trade Union Congress (TUC) and the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) \u2013 capitalised on the popular outrage and called for a national strike that began on January 9.\n\nSoon, the Nigerian Medical Association and the Nigerian Bar Association, as well as a number of other unions, backed the strike while many protesters began to refer to their cause as \u201c#OccupyNigeria.\u201d\n\nIn the ensuing civil disobedience and confrontations with security agencies, 11 protesters were reportedly killed.\n\nDamage control\n\nIn the face of mounting pressure, the Jonathan administration began to make some concessions. He announced the formation of a panel to oversee the funds freed up by the elimination of the fuel subsidy.\n\nThe government proposed cutting government salaries by 25 percent and bought some buses that would reduce transportation costs. Rather than eliminate the subsidy, the government succeeded in increasing the petrol price from N65 to N141 per litre.\n\nLogic fails\n\nAs was true in 2012, petrol subsidy was a drain on the country. It starves critical sectors of scarce resources for economic growth, fosters smuggling of petroleum products across Nigeria\u2019s insecure borders, and disrupts markets on the continent.\n\nJust like Jonathan\u2019s government did, the Buhari government has argued then that the removal of subsidy would free up funds for other public services, including health and infrastructure projects, and that the liberalisation of the downstream sector would benefit the economy.\n\nThey also argued that the primary beneficiaries of the subsidy were the wealthy, who used more petrol than the poor, and wholesalers who made a profit selling subsidized petrol out of the country.\n\nAjuri Ngelale, one of Buhari\u2019s spokespersons, recently told BusinessDay in an interview, \u201cOur neighbours that don\u2019t have the kind of economic fundamentals pay as much as N400 per liter. Yet their minimum wage is much lower.\n\n\u201cWe also have to live in a way that is more realistic so that the government can put resources into those things that are more profitable to the common ordinary Nigerians. This is the redistribution of resources that the President is more committed to.\u201d\n\nBut those agitating against subsidy removal have countervailing arguments, saying it is a shame that Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer cannot refine its own petrol leaving its three refineries in decay.\n\nRead also: Group plans protest against petrol subsidy removal, excise duty on soft drinks\n\nNigeria with highly-rated security agencies cannot curtail smuggling, and though petrol is imported, government charges at the port add to the cost per litre. This raises the fear that any increase will trigger runway inflation. Already, Nigeria has the world\u2019s poorest people and any extra burden is a recipe for chaos.\n\nTo worsen matters, successive government officials have been accused of stealing mind-boggling sums of money. When factored along with the putrid opulence of government officials and reckless public spending on salaries of unproductive lawmakers, it defeats any argument for the people to make sacrifices for a wasteful government.\n\nPresident Jonathan on January 16, 2012, rescinded the decision to remove the petrol subsidy but increased the pump price to N97 per litre, which was significantly lower than the N141 that reflected the landing cost of petrol. The unions called off the strike, and the protests ceased.\n\nRenewed push\n\nAccording to Zainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget, and national planning, \u201cThe government has concluded plans to end fuel subsidies by July 2022, paving the way for the full implementation of the PIA.\n\nThe minister, while responding to a question at the public presentation and breakdown of the highlights of the 2022 budget in Abuja, said, \u201cWe have only provided subsidies for petrol from January to June. And that means that from July, there is no provision that we made for fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cOur assumption is that by June, we would have been able to work through a process together with all stakeholders including the National Oil Company, all the regulators in the oil and gas sector, different MDAs that have a role to play as well as businesses and labour organisations.\n\n\u201cMoreover, by removing subsidies, the government is only complying with the PIA, which specifies that all petroleum products should be deregulated.\u201d\n\nDangote Refinery\n\nDespite some delays caused by shipping constraints, the 650,000 barrels per day (b/d) Dangote Refinery, which is set to be Africa\u2019s largest, is on track to begin operations this year.\n\nThe refinery is expected to bridge the gas importation gap of Nigeria, which stands around 1 million -1.25 million cubic meters per month (mt/month) of gasoline due to inadequate domestic refining capacity, while noting that all its refineries, with a combined nameplate capacity to refine 445,000 b/d of crude oil, are currently shut down, according to a Dangote presentation given at an industry event last year.\n\n\u201cWhen fully operational, the plant will produce 327,000b/d of gasoline, 244,000b/d of gasoline/diesel, 56,000b/d of jet fuel/kerosene, and 290,000mt/year of propane/LPG,\u201d it said.\n\nWith this development, the country\u2019s economy might be on track to create a platform with the new PIA, where the interplay of the forces of demand and supply of oil and gas are expected to drive down the price of oil and gas in the country while maintaining the subsidy removal.",

          "text": "The cost of freighting containers from India and China ports to Nigeria is beginning to record a slight decline on the back of frequent ship sailing to Asian routes and an increase in the ability of importers to secure space onboard vessels due to the availability of empty containers.\n\nCurrently, moving a 20-foot and 40-foot container from India to Nigeria now costs between $4,000 and $7,000, down from between $7,500 and $15,000 previously charged by shipping companies in September 2021.\n\nFrom China, moving a 20-foot and 40-foot container to Nigeria now costs between $7,000 and $11,000 instead of $8,000 and $16,000 that were charged in September 2021, when the cost of freight was at a record high.\n\nConfirming this, Tony Anakebe, managing director of Gold-Link Investment Limited, states that importers are beginning to see a reduction in the cost of freight from countries like India and China to Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Anakebe, moving 20-foot and 40-foot containers from India to Nigeria that used to cost between $7,500 and $15,000 now costs a little above $4,000 and $7,000, respectively.\n\nFrom China to Nigeria, he says, importers that used to pay $8,000 and $16,000 to bring in 20-foot and 40-foot containers during the peak of the supply chain disruption in September are now paying between $7,000 and $11,000 to ship 20-foot and 40-foot containers, respectively.\n\nAnakebe however notes that there is still a bit of rush among importers that want to bring in their goods from China to Nigeria, which made the cost of freight from China to Nigeria to still remain a bit high.\n\nOn why the cost of freight is beginning to normalise, he says suppliers in the countries of origin are producing several goods that need to be moved to countries where they are needed.\n\n\u201cThe cost of freight started normalising around December 2021, and it has remained a bit stable till date because international shipping companies are now deploying more ships to India and China to lift containers,\u201d he explains.\n\nCurrently, he says the number of ships calling India and China ports has increased and the ability of importers to secure space onboard vessels is also becoming easier because containers are being made available for people to load their goods.\n\nOn his part, Jonathan Nicol, president of the Shippers Association of Lagos, notes that freight costs are coming down but are still far from becoming normal.\n\n\u201cThe US is beginning to charge shipping companies for leaving empty containers in their country that may form part of the reasons shipping liners are now deploying containers to ports where they are needed to load goods,\u201d Nicol says on the phone.\n\nWhile emphasising that shippers globally want the cost to come down in order to reduce the skyrocketing cost of doing business, he states that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) does not allow Nigerian shippers to pay above $5,000 per month for freight charges.\n\nRead also: Petrol price regulation expected to continue in 2022, could reach N208/litre\n\nIf a shipper has a freight that is more than $5,000, the shipper has to wait for another month to be able to pay up, according to Nicol.\n\nNicol, who notes that most of the goods are a backlog of as far as six months ago, however, attributes the rush in China to the upcoming annual holidays in China, which is forcing most of the suppliers to clear their tables.\n\n\u201cChinese Lunar New Year holiday, which is scheduled to start on February 1, 2022, is almost here. And many Chinese suppliers and factories will shut down for over one week. This is why many importers are rushing to take delivery before that time,\u201d he explains.\n\nBut, according to Container News, an online trade report, the freight rates may not soften anytime soon but would like to shoot up in the coming weeks.\n\nIt states that the current freight cost in China can be attributed to the COVID-19 variant, the changing purchasing patterns, the Chinese New Year that is around the corner, and the restocking of supplies that followed due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in China.\n\n\u201cThe current level of freight rates is a reflection or consequence of the disruptions in the market that are partially driven by the exceptional demand situation in the US and Europe,\u201d Container News notes.",

Having consulted, the Senate will expeditiously look into the issue\u201d.\n\nOn the issue of the security challenges facing the country, the Senate President said the Security situation in the country is still dire.\n\n\u201cWe must remain focused and determined to work with Executive arm of government, and also continue to support our armed forces and security agencies. We must continue to prioritize the Security and welfare of our citizens as enshrined in your constitution nor despair\u201d.\n\n\u201cI urge us not to be discouraged by the situation. We should make this year as the year for the final securing of our nation from the numerous security challenges\u201d, he added.\n\nLawan also assured Nigerians that the review of the 1999 Constitution is a topmost in their legislative agenda, adding that the Committee on Review of the 1999 Constitution has done so much work on it while working with their counter parts in the House of Representatives the report of the Committee will be presented to the Senate for consideration soon. The Senate will consider the report and the National Assembly will communicate to the State Houses of Assembly within the first quarter of this year.\n\nThe Senate President also noted that political activities leading to 2023 general elections have already started and the Senate will continue to provide the support that Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) needs for successful elections across the country.\n\nLawan also pointed out that, the funding of the 2022 Budget is predicated on significant borrowing. \u201cOur country is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. We have to construct and provide infrastructure, in all parts of our country because infrastructure is needed for our nation to develop\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, we do not generate enough revenues to fund the provision of such infrastructure. Until more revenues are generated, the country has to borrow and also resort to other sources of funding our infrastructural development. But we cannot continue to borrow endlessly. It is imperative that we need to improve on the revenue to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio. At about 8% Revenue to GDP ratio, our country is basically at 50% of what is required of the revenue to GDP of 15% for it to support any significant economic development.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the Senate will develop a strategy of engagement with revenue generating agencies on how to make them achieve their targets and generate more revenues in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Senate will ensure that we boost their revenue generating drive with a view to reducing borrowing for development of our much needed infrastructure. This is a major challenge for our development and we need to treat as such\u201d.\n\nOn the the Petroleum Industry Act(PIA) 2021, he said that the Act was enacted with a view to providing better investments climate for better performance by the Oil and Gas industry, stating that the Senate will need to seriously supervise the implementation of the PIA 2021 so that the country can start benefiting maximally.\n\n...",

Osaigbovo Iyoha, reassured that his government will sustain projects and programmes to enhance the growth of the state\u2019s entertainment industry, ensuring that Edo youths realise their fullest potentials.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe have brought our own in the entertainment industry to inspect this hub as they have made an impact in the industry. This facility is for their use and they are in the best position to enlighten the people on the availability of the hub in Benin City.\n\n\u201cThe entertainment space, globally, is so massive and lucrative; hence, we want to make use of these great entertainers to boost the economy of the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a massive facility for the entertainment industry as we want to reposition Edo State as the world\u2019s entertainment hub,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nOn his part, Head, Edo Creative Hub, Charles Nzeribe said, \u201cThis hub, when in proper use, will generate more jobs for Edo people. Our goal is to reach everybody, both in the state and outside the state, allowing them to know that the hub is to be used for entertainment.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Osaronkhae Lawrence (MC Casino) commended the governor for the initiative of the creative hub, describing it as the dream of every Edo entertainer.\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is a great investment by the Edo State Government and a major breakthrough in the entertainment industry in the state; it is what entertainers in the state have been yearning for over the years. The governor has brought the dreams of entertainers to reality with the building of this entertainment hub.\n\n\u201cEdo has started appreciating Edo talents, with strong support from the government of the day. It\u2019s a breakthrough in the industry and I hope to see more talented people in the industry contributing to the development of the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a one-stop-shop for the creative industry, which is the highest employer of labour. If this facility is properly utilised, the state can create employment of over 20,000 persons directly or indirectly,\u201d he restated.\n\n...",

The plans fell through when Scott Walker became governor of Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2012, Talgo terminated the contract and sued the state leading to a court dispute that lasted almost three years but ended in a settlement where the state paid the company $50 million, and the trains remained under the company\u2019s ownership.\n\nMr Sanwo-Olu\u2019s intent to have the Lagos blue and red lines rail system up and running by the fourth quarter of this year followed the failure of previous administrations to improve public transportation.\n\nThe project, part of the Lagos Urban Transportation Project, is being handled by the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA). The contract is executed by China\u2019s state-owned China Civil Engineering Construction Corp (CCECC), expected to hand over by December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Lagos blue line project was inaugurated in 2003 under the Bola Tinubu administration and has seen multiple delays.\n\nThe project, however, is receiving expedited attention by Gov. Sanwo-Olu.\n\nThe President Muhammadu Buhari government, which had in the early 80s terminated the first metro line contract initiated by the Lateef Jakande administration, is said to have assisted the rail project with N45bn.\n\nIn 2018, the the immediate past governor of Lagos, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode claimed he had spent between \u20ac100m and \u20ac200m on the rail project since it was inherited from Babatunde Fashola.\n\nThe claim, was however, disputed by Sanwo-Olu who claimed that his predecessor did not the rail project.",

The last thing they want is \u201canother Buhari.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that even though the President will stand down after the election of a successor next year \u2013 whether that successor lives up to the exacting standards and example he has set or not \u2013 his legacy is strong and will be peculiarly tough to dismantle:.\n\n\u201cCourts that hold those before it fairly and properly accountable \u2013 regardless of their wealth or lack of it; the successful repatriation of stolen funds from decades of export abroad and its use to fund social, unemployment,\n\n\u201cAnd welfare programmes for the poorest; reforms that have taken the steam out of centuries-long ethnic and tribal disputes \u2013 such as the farmer-herder clashes \u2013 long used to stoke ethnic and regional tensions by venial politicians for political advantage;\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAnd the protection of millions through an effective vaccine roll-out programme. These are just a tiny handful of the achievements of the President,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut, perhaps, Shehu noted Buhari\u2019s greatest achievement of all is to break the belief that Presidents of Nigeria take the office and use it to enrich themselves and their accessories at the public\u2019s expense.\n\n\u201cThat wicked spell is broken for good. And it has offended politicians everywhere. They thought the state owed to them while the people provided for the state. Instead, they have witnessed how, when the state owes to them nothing, it provides for the people,\u201d he added.",

It has no basis at all.\n\n\u201cWe also have a motion requesting the court to grant bail to the Defendant\u201d, Ozekhome added.\n\nOn his part, FG\u2019s lawyer, Labaran, argued that Kanu\u2019s two applications were not ripe for hearing, stressing that he would require time to go through them so as to be able to respond.\n\n\u201cIn essence, business of the day cannot be allowed to be truncated by these applications\u201d, he argued.\n\nIn a brief ruling, Justice Nyako noted that since Kanu\u2019s first application is challenging the propriety of his trial as well as competence of the charge against him, the court ought to hear it first.\n\n\u201cAs for the second motion (on the issue of bail), I don\u2019t even want to talk about it, at least not at this stage\u201d, Justice Nyako held.\n\nThe court subsequently adjourned till February 16 to hear the pending application.",

We were able to review some of the invasions in the state. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you all.

          "text": "Airlines across the world, including the long-haul carrier Emirates, rushed Wednesday to cancel or change flights heading into the U.S. over an ongoing dispute about the rollout of 5G mobile phone technology near American airports.\n\nThe issue appeared to impact the Boeing 777, a long-range, wide-body aircraft used by carriers across the world. Two Japanese airlines directly named the aircraft as being particularly affected by the 5G signals as they announced cancellations and changes to their schedules.\n\nDubai-based Emirates, a key carrier for East-West travel, announced it would halt flights to Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Miami, Newark, New Jersey, Orlando, Florida, San Francisco and Seattle over the issue beginning Wednesday. It said it would continue flights to Los Angeles, New York and Washington.\n\nIn its announcement, Emirates cited the cancellation as necessary due to \u201coperational concerns associated with the planned deployment of 5G mobile network services in the U.S. at certain airports.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities to alleviate operational concerns, and we hope to resume our U.S. services as soon as possible,\u201d the state-owned airline said.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates successfully rolled out 5G coverage all around its airports without incident. But in the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration worries that the C-Band strand of 5G could interfere with aviation equipment.\n\nOf particular concern in the 5G rollout appears to be the Boeing 777, a major workhorse for Emirates.\n\nJapan\u2019s All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd. said in a statement that the FAA \u201chas indicated that radio waves from the 5G wireless service may interfere with aircraft altimeters.\u201d Altimeters measure how high a plane is in the sky, a crucial piece of equipment for flying.\n\n\u201cBoeing has announced flight restrictions on all airlines operating the Boeing 777 aircraft, and we have cancelled or changed the aircraft for some flights to/from the U.S. based on the announcement by Boeing,\u201d ANA said.\n\nJapan Airlines Co. Ltd. similarly said that it had been informed that 5G signals \u201cmay interfere with the radio altimeter installed on the Boeing 777.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will refrain from using this model on the continental United States line until we can confirm its safety and we regret to inform you that we will cancel the flight for which the aircraft cannot be changed to the Boeing 787,\u201d the airline said.\n\nChicago-based Boeing Co. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAir India also announced on Twitter it would cancel flights to Chicago, Newark, New York and San Francisco \u201cdue to deployment of the 5G communications\u201d equipment. It said it would try to use other aircraft on U.S. routes as well.\n\nThe cancellations come even after mobile phone carriers AT&T and Verizon will postpone new wireless service near some U.S. airports planned for this week.\n\nThe FAA will allow planes with accurate, reliable altimeters to operate around high-power 5G. But planes with older altimeters will not be allowed to make landings under low-visibility conditions.",

          "text": "The New York attorney general\u2019s office late Tuesday told a court its investigators had uncovered evidence that former President Donald Trump\u2019s company used \u201cfraudulent or misleading\u201d asset valuations to get loans and tax benefits.\n\nThe court filing said state authorities haven\u2019t yet decided whether to bring a civil lawsuit in connection with the allegations, but that investigators need to question Trump and his two eldest children as part of the probe.\n\nTrump and his lawyers say the investigation is politically motivated.\n\nIn the court documents, Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 office gave its most detailed accounting yet of a long-running investigation of allegations that Trump\u2019s company exaggerated the value of assets to get favorable loan terms, or misstated what land was worth to slash its tax burden.\n\nThe Trump Organization, it said, had overstated the value of land donations made in New York and California on paperwork submitted to the IRS to justify several million dollars in tax deductions.\n\nThe company misreported the size of Trump\u2019s Manhattan penthouse, saying it was nearly three times its actual size \u2014 a difference in value of about $200 million, James\u2019 office said, citing deposition testimony from Trump\u2019s longtime financial chief Allen Weisselberg, who was charged last year with tax fraud in a parallel criminal investigation.\n\nJames\u2019 office detailed its findings in a court motion seeking to force Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr. to comply with subpoenas seeking their testimony.\n\nInvestigators, the court papers said, had \u201cdeveloped significant additional evidence indicating that the Trump Organization used fraudulent or misleading asset valuations to obtain a host of economic benefits, including loans, insurance coverage, and tax deductions.\u201d\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with lawyers for the Trumps.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team has sought to block the subpoenas, calling them \u201can unprecedented and unconstitutional maneuver.\u201d They say James is improperly attempting to obtain testimony that could be used in the parallel criminal investigation, being overseen by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nTrump sued James in federal court last month, seeking to put an end to her investigation. In the suit, his lawyers claimed the attorney general, a Democrat, had violated the Republican\u2019s constitutional rights in a \u201cthinly-veiled effort to publicly malign Trump and his associates.\u201d\n\nIn the past, the Republican ex-president has decried James\u2019 investigation and Bragg\u2019s probe as part of a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nIn a statement late Tuesday, James office said that it hasn\u2019t decided whether to pursue legal action, but said the evidence gathered so far shows the investigation should proceed unimpeded.\n\n\u201cFor more than two years, the Trump Organization has used delay tactics and litigation in an attempt to thwart a legitimate investigation into its financial dealings,\u201d James said. \u201cThus far in our investigation, we have uncovered significant evidence that suggests Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization falsely and fraudulently valued multiple assets and misrepresented those values to financial institutions for economic benefit.\u201d\n\nAlthough James\u2019 civil investigation is separate from the criminal investigation, her office has been involved in both, dispatching several lawyers to work side-by-side with prosecutors from the Manhattan D.A.\u2019s office.\n\nJames\u2019 office said that under state law, it could seek \u201da broad range of remedies\u201d against companies found to have committed commercial fraud, \u201cincluding revoking a license to conduct business within the state, moving to have an officer or director removed from board of directors, and restitution and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains.\u201d\n\nIn the court papers, James\u2019 office said evidence shows that Trump\u2019s company:\n\n\u2014 Listed his Seven Springs estate north of New York City as being worth $291 million, based on the dubious assumption that it could reap $161 million from building nine luxury homes.\n\n\u2014 Added a \u201cbrand premium\u201d of 15% to 30% to the value of some properties because they carried the Trump name, despite financial statements explicitly stating they didn\u2019t incorporate brand value.\n\n\u2014 Inflated the value of a suburban New York golf club by millions of dollars by counting fees for memberships that weren\u2019t sold or were never paid.\n\n\u2014 Valued a Park Avenue condominium tower at $350 million, based on proceeds it could reap from unsold units, even though many of those apartments were likely to sell for less because they were covered by rent stabilization laws.\n\n\u2014 Valued an apartment being rented to Ivanka Trump at as high as $25 million, even though she had an option to buy it for $8.5 million.\n\n\u2014 Said in documents that its stake in an office building, 40 Wall Street, was worth $525 million to $602 million \u2014 between two to three times the estimate reached by appraisers working for the lender Capital One.\n\nOne judge has previously sided with James on an earlier request to question another Trump son, Trump Organization executive Eric Trump, who ultimately sat for a deposition but declined to answer some questions.\n\nLast year, the Manhattan district attorney brought tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization and Weisselberg, its longtime chief financial officer.\n\nWeisselberg pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he and the company evaded taxes on lucrative fringe benefits paid to executives.\n\nBoth investigations are at least partly related to allegations made in news reports and by Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, that Trump had a history of misrepresenting the value of assets.\n\nThe disclosures about the attorney general\u2019s investigation came the same day as Trump ally Rudy Giuliani and other members of the legal team that had sought to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election were subpoenaed by a House committee investigating the U.S. Capitol insurrection.",

          "text": "With a daily underperformance figure of 78,000 barrels per day in December, Nigeria lost as much as 2.418 million barrels of crude in the last month of 2021, data released by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) showed on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Brent oil, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark, rose further yesterday to close at $88 a barrel, having earlier hit $88.13, the highest since October 2014.\n\nThe month of December, according to the OPEC report, also saw Nigeria slump lower than other previous production performances, compared to for instance, October, in which 1.228 barrels were pumped per day, and November during which 1.275 million barrels were produced per day.\n\nGiven the average price of about $85 per barrel for the month, the inability to pump more oil may have cost the country approximately $205.5 million in the entire month.\n\nThe data, according to OPEC, which uses both primary and secondary sources to obtain information on production levels, was received from direct communication with Nigeria.\n\nAmong members of the cartel, the OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) for January showed, only crisis-torn Libya, lost more oil than Nigeria, with a production deficit of roughly 119, 000 barrels per day.\n\nFor proper context, Nigeria\u2019s quota for February remained at 1.701 barrels per day, but the country\u2019s effort to produce more in the last few months had not yielded any fruits.\n\nWhile the target was to produce about 1.86 million barrels daily by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, poor upstream infrastructure, long term waning investment and the impact of the OPEC-induced shutdowns last year, have combined to hobble the number of barrels pumped by Nigeria.\n\nPromises by the Minister of State, Mr. Timipre Sylva and the NNPC Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, that the country would hit between 1.7 million barrels per day and 1.8 million barrels per day by the end of 2021 remained largely unrealised.\n\nNigeria had also been losing the desperately needed foreign exchange to its intractable payments for petrol subsidy, which have increased to over N100 per litre in recent months.\n\nOn the Nigerian economy, OPEC stated that although the country recorded a surplus of $3.6 billion, consumer prices have continued to pose a serious challenge.\n\n\u201cAccording to recently released statistics from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the country\u2019s current account registered its highest surplus since early 2018, amid a strong trade position.\n\n\u201cIn 3Q21, the current account posted a surplus of $3.6 billion compared with $348 million in 2Q21 and a shortfall of $3.6 billion in 3Q20.\n\n\u201cIn 3Q21, exports exceeded imports by about $1.8 billion, recording the largest excess since late 2019. Additionally, improving oil prices continued to support the economic recovery, coupled with easing of the inflation rate, which marginally fell for the second month in a row to 15.4 per cent from 15.9 per cent, marking the lowest rate since November 2020, largely due to sustained moderation in food prices.\n\n\u201cHowever, on a monthly basis, consumer prices increased by 1.08 per cent, following a 0.98 per cent increase the previous month,\u201d it stated.\n\nOn a global level, OPEC stuck to its forecast for robust growth in world oil demand in 2022 despite the Omicron coronavirus variant and expected interest rate hikes, predicting the oil market would remain well supported through the year.\n\nTight supply has given impetus to the current oil rally, and OPEC\u2019s report also showed the group undershot a pledged oil-output rise in December.\n\nThe producers\u2019 group said it expects world oil demand in 2022 to rise by 4.15 million barrels per day (bpd), unchanged from last month while oil consumption will surpass the 100 million bpd mark in the third quarter, also in line with last month\u2019s forecast.\n\nIt added: \u201cWhile the new Omicron variant may have an impact in the first half of 2022, which is dependent on any further lockdown measures and rising hospitalisation levels impacting the workforce, projections for economic growth remain robust.\u201d\n\nAccording to the cartel: \u201cThe oil market is expected to remain well-supported throughout 2022.\u201d\n\nAlthough the report also showed higher output from OPEC as the group and allies, known as OPEC+, gradually unwind record output cuts put in place last year, still the expected surplus this quarter has remained elusive.\n\nOPEC+ has aimed to raise output by 400,000 bpd a month, with about 253,000 bpd of that due to come from the 10 OPEC members covered by the deal, but production has increased by less than that as some producers struggle to pump more.\n\nThe report showed OPEC output in December rose by 170,000 bpd to 27.88 million bpd, undershooting the rise OPEC was expecting.\n\nIn the same vein, OPEC raised its forecast for growth in 2022 production of United States shale, to 670,000 bpd from 600,000 bpd, with the growth forecast for overall non-OPEC supply in 2022 left unchanged.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
