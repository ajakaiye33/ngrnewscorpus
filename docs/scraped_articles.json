          "title": "PSC orders fresh probe into Kyari\u2019s link to Hushpuppi",
          "text": "THE Police Service Commission has directed the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to deepen investigations into the connection between the suspended erstwhile head of the Intelligence Response Team, Abba Kyari, and an internet scammer, Abbas Ramon, commonly known as Hushpuppi.\n\nThe commission, it was learnt, gave the IG two weeks to turn in the report which would be reviewed by the PSC Standing Committee on Discipline.\n\nThe directive to the IG was sequel to the advice from the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN.\n\nA four-man Special Investigation Panel headed by the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigations Department, Joseph Egbunike, had earlier probed Kyari, a Deputy Commissioner of Police.\n\nKyari had been suspended in July 2021 for alleged involvement in a $1.1 million Internet fraud allegedly perpetrated by Hushpuppi and four others; AbdulRahman Juma (Abdul); Vincent Chibuzo (Kelly); Rukayat Fashola (Morayo); and Bolatito Agbabiaka (Bolamide).\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation had alleged that Hushpuppi paid $20,600 to two bank accounts allegedly provided by Kyari on January 20, 2020.\n\nKyari denied wrongdoing.\n\nThe PUNCH gathered on Wednesday that the AGF said the facts contained in the police investigation report were not strong enough to convict the DCP.\n\nMalami was said to have informed the commission that the police investigation on Kyari was not water-tight and that more facts were needed to establish the relationship between the ex-IRT commander and Hushpuppi, who is awaiting sentencing after striking a plea bargain deal with the United States authorities.\n\nBased on the AGF\u2019s advice, the commission was said to have asked the IG to carry out a further probe into Kyari\u2019s relationship with Hushpuppi.\n\nA senior official, who confided in our correspondent, stated, \u201cThe advice from the AGF is that the case needs further investigation; that the evidence produced on Abba Kyari was not enough to convict him despite the fact that they have established a prima facie case against him. But the facts cannot convict him in the court of law.\n\n\u201cSo, the police report was returned and the IG was asked to set up a special panel to look at the case. We have given them just a short period of two weeks to turn in their report.\n\n\u201cThe final report is expected to return to the standing committee which will review and send recommendations to the plenary where the final decision on Kyari will be taken.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, spokesman, US Attorney Office for Central District of California, Thom Mrozek, has said Hushpuppi would be sentenced on February 14.\n\nAccording to BBC Pidgin, Mrozek, however, did not state the jail terms, which is expected to be between 10 and 18 years.\n\n\u201cHe may be subjected to removal from the United States once he completes his prison sentence,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Despite the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN\u2019s retention of the benchmark interest rate at 11.5 percent, a Senior Research analyst at FXTM , Lukman Otunuga , has said that the apex bank may be forced to tighten its monetary policy before the end of the year if exchange rate differentials widen between the naira and other currencies,.\n\nReacting to the CBN\u2019s retention of rate and Nigeria\u2019s outlook for the year 2022, he stated that \u201cit is not only the US Federal Reserve, that will be under the spotlight but for those with an interest in Africa\u2019s largest economy, all eyes were on the CBN which is widely expected to conclude with interest rates left unchanged.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:Obi Cubana nominates young Nigerians for leadership course in NIPSS\n\nAccording to him \u201cWhile other countries across the globe are experiencing untamed inflation, Nigeria\u2019s inflation continues to slow. Although the annual inflation rate rose to 15.63% in December 2021, after eight straight months of declines \u2013 the trend still points south. This continues to provide the CBN enough breathing room to leave interest rates unchanged in an effort to promote economic growth.\u201d\n\nOn how long will the apex bank keep the interest rate unchanged, he said: \u201cAs the US Fed and other major banks tighten monetary policy, the CBN may be forced to act \u2013 especially if differentials widen between the Naira and other currencies. Domestically, pre-election spending ahead of the general elections in 2023 could rekindle inflationary pressures \u2013 possibly forcing the CBN to take action. While the first MPC meeting of the CBN may be a non-event as the Central Bank sticks to the script, 2022 promises to be eventful for the bank and the Nigerian economy.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the outcome of the first MPC of the year, analysts at Cordros Capital, a Lagos based investment house, stated: \u201cThe decision of the Committee to maintain the status quo on monetary policy parameters did not come as a surprise to us. Although the Committee expressed concerns about the impacts of policy normalisation in advanced countries on the exchange rate and domestic price pressures, they believed it was desirable to hold rates constant to allow previous policy actions to permeate the economy.\n\n\u201cThough we find justification for the Committee\u2019s decision on the grounds that output growth in the real sectors remains soft, we believe there would be a compelling need to tighten monetary policy as external sector pressures mount.\n\n\u201cFor us, the timing of a change to a hawkish stance would be primarily hinged on the policy actions of global central banks as they redirect their efforts towards curbing inflationary pressures.\n\n\u201cIn the near term, we believe the Monetary Policy Committee , MPC will be walking on tight ropes as it attempts to drive economic recovery and stabilise the external sector.\u201d",

He just have seen something in me or read my antecedents . He is wizard. I thank him for willingly giving me his endorsement making me the winner of this primary.

It pleased the party to give me only 12 automatic delegates in mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have six local governments in my district as a sitting senator. They gave full compliments of delegates to somebody in four of my local government. And the two that were left, including my own local government.

How do you go from your home with a broken hoe and then, you are going to ask the people to give their own to you to till the ground?\u201d.\n\n\u201cI feel maybe it is because of my gender or maybe the party feels I have not done enough for it. That is why they would have done that to me\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, when they\u2019ve done that to me, it didn\u2019t make sense to continue with the process.\n\nWhen asked how the party arrived at giving out automatic delegates to aspirants, she said: \u201cWhat happened was that for two years, we\u2019ve been fighting over an illegal congress and somehow, a few weeks ago, they approved it for one group.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere have been two groups that have been fighting. And we said there was no congress because it was hijacked. Two weeks ago, the party approved that one group should take all the fourteen executives, and those of us that had been fighting should wait.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether she stepped down for any aspirant, Olujimi said she didn\u2019t step down but only pulled out of the race, instructing his supporters to vote for any aspirant of their choice.",

          "text": "The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has on Wednesday said that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) did not leave behind a $550 billion economy when it lost power to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2015.\n\nThe group, in a statement signed by its Chairman, Niyi Akinsiju, and Secretary, Cassidy Madueke, stated that the claim by the party\u2019s leaders is at variance with facts on ground.\n\nAccording to the group, while they knew that PDP elements are used to pulling numbers from the air, they did not expect that they would cook up figures on the state of the economy in May 2015 to deceive Nigerians.\n\nIt said it all began in December last year with former Aviation Minister Osita Chidoka dropping the cooked figure on the PDP-era economy, before governors elected on the party platform jumped on it.\n\nThe BMO said it is surprising that the PDP Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, who postures as an academic had also jumped on the bandwagon when he could have put his research skills into use.\n\nIt said Nigeria\u2019s GDP in 2015 was $486 billion, not the $550 billion the opposition party is bandying around like a badge of honour.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe make bold to say that virtually all the data the party rolls out are contrived to deceive unsuspecting Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe BMO argued that contrary to the rosy picture that PDP chieftains had been painting, the economy was on a decline at the time that President Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in.\n\nAccording to him, no fewer than 27 states were finding it difficult to pay staff salaries as of 2014 and it was not until the APC-led administration came on board that the states were given bailouts to stay afloat.\n\nThe statement further added that in 2013, Nigeria\u2019s poverty figure was 112 million out of a population of 165 million people, according to World Bank figures.\n\nIt said today, the Buhari administration has cycled millions of people out of poverty with the figure now put at about 88 million.\n\nHe said a large chunk of the country\u2019s debt was paid off by a PDP administration in 2006, but as of May 2015, Nigeria\u2019s public debt was $63 billion even when the country made $381.9 billion from crude oil sales alone between 2010 and May 2015.\n\nThe group, therefore, challenged PDP leaders to show Nigerians how they spent what the country realised as well as funds in the Excess Crude Account, saying there is indeed little or no infrastructure to show for the oil boom.\n\nBMO urged Nigerians to continue to reject the former ruling party because it has nothing to offer.",

Click Here Now .\n\nThe DDI said there is no gainsaying that the whole of society approach which the CDS have continued to advocate is a sure way to go in our commitment to overcoming various forms of security challenges confronting our nation.\n\n\u2018This will therefore no doubt open a new vista of collaboration and understanding between the armed forces and the media as both parties will henceforth be in the same phase in matters of defence and national security.\n\n\u2018At the end of the deliberations, media executives, editors, bureau chiefs are in a better position to set right the agenda for public discourse when the issues of national security and conflict-sensitive management are generating debate,\u2019 he said.\n\nAlso speaking, The Chief Executive Officer, Media Today, Charles Odenigbo, said the interface would mark a new beginning for the military and media relationship in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018The media is constantly looking for information backed by concrete evidence, concrete facts and they must be time-bound because time is the oxygen of the newsroom,\u2019 Odenigbo said.\n\n\u2018What role or any of what role can be media play in the governance of the security sector in Nigeria; what obstacle hinders the media\u2019s ability to provide effective oversight of security institutions.\u2019\n\nHe said a road map would be developed at the end of the parley for a clear understanding of the roles of the media in national security matters and conflict-sensitive communication.\n\nAccording to him, between public interest and national interest, the editors or media would definitely have to contend with the code of ethics because the functions of the armed forces are very clear and the duties of the media are also very clear.",

His assent to the bill was in furtherance to the passage of the Bill by both the Senate and the House of Representatives earlier in July 2021. The PIA is expected to grow investors\u2019 confidence in the petroleum industry and create more employment opportunities for the populace in the host communities.\n\nSylva explained that the suspension is to give all stakeholders time to ensure the implementation is carried out in a manner that guarantees that all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the PMS subsidy removal.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has agreed to an extension of the statutory period for the implementation of the removal of subsidy on petrol (Premium Motor Spirit, PMS) in accordance with extant laws.\n\n\u201cHowever, following extensive consultations with all key stakeholders within and outside the government, it has been agreed that the implementation period for the removal of the subsidy should be extended.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

That is why we are making this announcement.\u201d\n\nOn the possible legal implications after the assent to the PIA by President Buhari, the minister said: \u201cWe also see the legal implications. There is six months provision in the PIA which will expire in February and that is why we are coming out to to say that before the expiration of this time, as I said earlier, we will engage the legislature. We believe that this will go to the legislature, we are applying for some amendment of the law so that we would still be within the law.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing an 18months extension but what the National Assembly is going to approve is up to them. We would approve an 18 months extension and then it is up to the national Assembly to look at it and pass the amendment as the see it.\u201d\n\nAsked if the suspension has something to do with 2023 elections, he said: \u201cOf course not. As I told , first it\u2019s just the human face of the government, Mr. President especially wants certain structures to be in place. And he insisted if we want to remove subsidy, we must make sure that we put every measure in place to protect the suffering masses of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of gradual increase, that is not on the table right now, the minister said: \u201cGradual or increment in whatever guise is not on the table. We are going to see how to rejig the law, this is not going to be the only amendment to the PIA. A few months ago, the President already proposed an amendment to the law.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Okay direct, indirect, consensus primaries for parties\n\n\u2022Stipulate conditions for consensus \u2022Proposed legislation to be transmitted to Buhari in seven days\n\nUdora Orizu and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\nThe Senate yesterday passed the harmonised Clause 84 of the 2010 Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2022, which allows political parties to adopt three modes of primaries.\n\nThe proposed legislation, earlier passed last year, was not assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari had cited the provisions of Clause 84, which made direct primary compulsory for all political parties in electing candidates for elections, as his reason for refusing assent to the bill. The two chambers of the National Assembly then recommitted the bill for fresh legislation and added other options, as advised by the president.\n\nThe harmonised version accommodated the direct, indirect, and consensus modes of primary election.\n\nThe Senate had earlier passed the three modes of primaries, but the version of the House of Representatives did not include the consensus arrangement.\n\nThe upper chamber considered the harmonised version of the bill at plenary and passed it.\n\nSenate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, said the bill had given sufficient and clear definition to the modes of primary election now adopted by both chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nThe re-amendment was sequel to a motion on \u201crescission on clause 84 of the Electoral Act No. 26 2010 (Amendment) Bill, 2022 and Committal to the Committee of the Whole.\u201d The motion was sponsored by Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi (Kebbi North).\n\nThe amended bill provides in clause 84 (2), \u201cThe procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions shall be by direct, indirect primaries or consensus.\u201d\n\nIt adds in 84(3), \u201cA political party shall not impose nomination qualification or disqualification criteria, measures, or conditions on any aspirant or candidate for any election in its constitution, guidelines, or rules for nomination of candidates for elections, except as prescribed under sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 177 and 187 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended).\u201d\n\nOn direct primaries in 84 (4), the amended version provides, \u201cA political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party and shall adopt the procedure outlined below:\n\n\u201c(a) In the case of presidential primaries, all registered members of the party shall vote for aspirants of their choice at a designated centre at each ward of the federation.\n\n\u201c(b) The procedure in paragraph (a) above of this subsection shall be adopted for direct primaries in respect of gubernatorial, senatorial, federal and state constituencies.\n\n\u201c(c) Special Conventions or Congresses shall be held to ratify the candidate with the highest number of votes at designated centres at the national, state, senatorial, federal and state constituencies, as the case may be.\u201d\n\nIn terms of indirect primaries, the bill provides under 84(5), \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall adopt the procedure outlined below: (a) In the case of nominations to the position of presidential candidate, the political party shall \u2013 (i) hold a Special Presidential Convention at a designated centre in the Federal Capital Territory or any other place within the federation that is agreed to by the National Executive Committee of the party where delegates shall vote for aspirants of their choice.\n\n\u201c(ii) the aspirant with the highest number of votes cast at the end of voting shall be declared the winner of the presidential primaries of the political party and that aspirant\u2019s name shall be forwarded to the Commission as the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nIt further provides under 84(7), \u201cWhere there is only one aspirant or a consensus candidate in a political party for any of the elective positions mentioned in subsection (5)(a), (b), (c) and (d), the party shall convene a special convention or congress at a designated centre on a specified date for the confirmation of such aspirant and the name of the aspirant shall be forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission as the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nThe Electoral Bill provides in 84(8), \u201cA political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall clearly outline in its constitution and rule the procedure for the democratic election of delegates to vote at the convention, congress meeting.\u201d\n\nOn consensus candidate, the bill in 84(9)(a) provides, \u201cA political party that adopts a consensus candidate shall secure the written consent of all cleared aspirants for the position, indicating their voluntary withdrawal from the race and their endorsement of the consensus candidate.\u201d\n\nIt states further in paragraph (b), \u201cWhere a political party is unable to secure the written consent of all cleared aspirants for the purpose of a consensus candidate, it shall revert to the choice of direct or indirect primaries for the nomination of candidates for the aforesaid elective positions.\u201d\n\nThe bill states in paragraph (c), \u201cA Special Convention or nomination congress shall be held to ratify the choice of consensus candidates at designated centres at the national, state, senatorial, federal and state constituencies, as the case may be.\u201d\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, explained during plenary that the leadership of the House met on Monday and decided that to facilitate speedy passage of the bill and deepen democracy, both chambers of the National Assembly decided to add the consensus provision. Gbajabiamila, however, said the inclusion came with certain provisos so as to protect all aspirants for all positions, and give all an even playing field.\n\nHe explained, \u201cYou will recall that this House last week, as soon as we returned, looked into the complaints and added the provision of indirect primaries to our law. Unfortunately, the Senate added both indirect and consensus, which necessitated the possible need for a conference committee of both chambers.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the House met yesterday and decided that in the interest of speedy passage and also to deepen our democracy, the House and Senate decided to add the consensus provision, so there will be no need for conference but with certain provisos.\u201d\n\nBriefing journalists shortly after plenary, the House spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, said the bill would be transmitted to Buhari within seven days and hopefully he would look at it as quickly as possible.\n\nThe speaker said though the lawmakers included the consensus option, it did not mean political godfathers would seat in a room, prepare a list and call it consensus. He added that anyone who went against the provisions, as stipulated in the bill, could be taken to court.\n\nKalu said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the way it used to be before, that political godfathers will sit in a room and then prepare a list and call it consensus. That\u2019s not in the script of this particular section.\n\n\u201cSo, if you prepare a list and you\u2019re not able to give an evidence of a written withdrawal by those who are aspiring, who have now agreed for one candidate to go, you have gone against the spirit of this particular provision. In that extent one can approach the court.\u201d\n\nThe House spokesman said in preparing the new version of the electoral bill, \u201cWe are not doing anybody\u2019s bidding, we are partners in nation-building. It needs partnership, synergy.\u201d\n\nHe said good ideas for nation building could come from any of the arms of government.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we are concerned about,\u201d he stated, adding, \u201cIn it all what we have done are consultations, we have been consulting with Nigerians and Nigerians are saying give us the full option; we have to do that.\n\n\u201cNigerians should be happy that the options have conditions and those conditions will tailor the options to the ethos of democracy.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Seeks 18 months suspension, to send PIA amendment to N\u2019Assembly\n\n\u2022 FG says decision has nothing to do with 2023 elections\n\n\u2022IMF insists on end, wants funds channeled to health, social devt\n\n\u2022 NLC: Why we suspended nationwide protest\n\n\u2022LCCI calls for phased implementation, NACCIMA seeks wider consultation\n\nDeji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos\n\nThe federal government finally failed in its efforts to remove the highly contentious subsidy on petrol yesterday when it disclosed plan to recommend an 18-month extension of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) to the National Assembly.\n\nThis clearly means that the burden of the policy which has been described as a major drain and waste of resources would be shifted to the next administration from May 29, 2023, if the National Assembly approves an extension of the PIA\u2019s implementation.\n\nThe government\u2019s inability to take the tough decision on the subsidy issue is bound to have massive consequence on the overall implementation of the PIA.\n\nThe implementation of the PIA which stipulates the removal of petrol subsidy ought to be in February 2022 and was later shifted to July 2022. However, due to pressure and threats of protests by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC), the decision was on Monday suspended.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Abuja, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who spoke after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, said the president graciously okayed the suspension of the removal of fuel subsidy until further notice.\n\nBut the International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday reiterated the need for Nigeria to remove subsidies on petrol and channel such funds to health, social development and other critical sectors of the economy.\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) also announced the suspension of its nationwide protest.\n\nThis was just as the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has advised the federal government to adopt a phased removal approach to the dilemma it was facing over the subsidy issue and the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) called for wider consultation on the matter.\n\nAccording to Sylva, the executive would propose 18 months extension to National Assembly for the implementation of the PIA.\n\nOn the possible legal implications after the assent to the PIA by President Buhari, Sylva said: \u201cWe also see the legal implications. There is six months provision in the PIA which will expire in February and that is why we are coming out to say that before the expiration of this time, as I said earlier, we will engage the legislature.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this will go to the legislature, we are applying for some amendment of the law so that we would still be within the law.\n\n\u201cWe are proposing an 18 months extension but what the National Assembly is going to approve is up to them. We would approve an 18 months extension and then it is up to the national Assembly to look at it and pass the amendment as they see it.\n\n\u201cWe are going to see how to rejig the law, this is not going to be the only amendment to the PIA. A few months ago, the President already proposed an amendment to the law. Mr. President already proposed some amendment.\n\n\u201cNow we are going to propose this amendment. There might be other amendments that will be proposed because that is the way the law is; we will continue to adjust it as we see fit, as we operate it.\u201d\n\nThe minister explained that the suspension of the subsidy removal was to give all stakeholders time to ensure that the implementation was carried out in a manner that guarantees that all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the planned removal.\n\nThe modalities, he said, included getting the refineries to work, introducing an alternate fuel for cars in form of auto gas and possible palliatives for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has agreed to an extension of the statutory period for the implementation of the removal of subsidy on petrol in accordance with extant laws.\n\n\u201cHowever, following extensive consultations with all key stakeholders within and outside the government, it has been agreed that the implementation period for the removal of the subsidy should be extended.\n\n\u201cThis extension will give all the stakeholders time to ensure that the implementation is carried out in a manner that guarantees that all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the petrol subsidy removal in line with prevailing economic realities.\u2019\n\n\u201cAll those structures are not right now in place. One of those is to ensure that the refineries are working and you\u2019re all aware that steps are being taken for all the refineries to be functional very soon. The Dangote Refinery is expected to come on stream at the end of this year.\n\n\u201cAll our refineries, the Port Harcourt Refinery is expected to be performing at a certain capacity, not full capacity, by end of this year. There are some modular refineries that are also going to come on steam later this year.\n\n\u201cOf course, you\u2019re also aware that the rehabilitation of the refineries are ongoing, I already said that. Dangote Refinery is already on, we are hoping that by the end of this year, the refineries will be functional, at least to a great extent, not necessarily the nameplate capacity, Port Harcourt Refineries especially, will be producing. We are also expecting that Dangote Refinery will also have come on stream,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaking further he said: \u201cAlso, there is discussion of introducing an alternate fuel for cars in the form of auto gas and somebody asked, what has happened since launching. A lot has gone on there, in fact, even today, if you had noticed, I briefed Mr. President on the progress that has been made on auto gas. We are hoping that in March or April, the conversion processes will begin.\n\n\u201cWe promised that one million cars will be converted initially, and of course, the corresponding amount of gas filling stations will also be built. That is in progress and I want to assure you that it will happen very soon. That also has to be in place before we say okay, we want to take out subsidies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also looking at palliatives. The Minister of Finance and her team are looking at possible palliatives for Nigerians as well. So, because all these have to converge before we announce the complete removal of subsidy, because Mr. President, especially wants us to ensure that this doesn\u2019t have too much impact on the people, we are now extending the time for subsidy removal.\n\n\u201cI will not want to specifically mention the time of extension because that will be a product of a discussion with the National Assembly, because it is likely to involve an amendment of the PIA to extend extended time and I always do not want to preempt what timeframe the National Assembly will allow. But definitely at this moment, fuel subsidy removal is not on the card.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the likely effect of the subsidy removal on livelihoods of the poor, the Minister said: \u201cThe President assures that his administration will continue to put in place all necessary measures to protect the livelihoods of all Nigerians, especially the most vulnerable.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn queues at petrol stations that had resurfaced, he advised Nigerians to stop hoarding fuel nor engage in panic buying as government has no plans remove subsidy, Sylva said: \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to remove subsidy now. That is why we are making this announcement.\u201d\n\nAsked if the suspension has anything to do with 2023 general elections, he said: \u201cOf course not. It\u2019s just the human face of the government, Mr. President especially wants certain structures to in place. And he insisted if we want to remove subsidy, we must make sure that we put every measure in place to protect the suffering masses of Nigeria. That is the President\u2019s insistence. So we are now taking steps to ensure that these processes are in place.\u201d\n\nThe minister also assured that government would continue to engage the labour unions on the fuel subsidy issue saying, \u201cwe are already talking with labour, and our discussion with labour is also around this palliatives and mitigations.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEngagement with labour, of course, this will continue. This is an ongoing process; we want to start. We\u2019ve been engaging labour for a long time, if you are aware and that engagement will be ongoing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a development process and maybe by July 2022, we\u2019ll be able to get back to you and give you additional developments from here.\n\n\u201cSo all these will have to come together. That\u2019s why we decided at this time, especially since we are running against time, with the legal timeframe approaching very quickly, we thought we should come to you and let you know that we are taking steps to amend the law and to ensure that we are within the law.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of gradual increase in fuel price the, Sylva said: \u201cGradual or increment in whatever guise is not on the table.\u201d\n\nA THISDAY\u2019s analysis of documents from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) showed that between January and December 2021, the federal government spent over N1.43 trillion on what it terms under-recovery on petrol.\n\nA breakdown of the various payments last year, indicated that the subsidy burden has increased progressively, growing from N24.3 billion in February 2021, to N60.3 billion in March and N61.9 billion in April this year.\n\nFurthermore, in May, the NNPC removed N126 billion as subsidy, while June came next with N164.3 billion. In July, the analysis showed that N103.2 billion was spent on under-recovery.\n\nHitherto, August had last year\u2019s lion\u2019s share of N173.1 billion, but was overtaken by the deduction in November of N200 billion, while September\u2019s deduction stood at N149.28 billion and the October figure was N163.709 billion, before the highest deductible amount yet of N270 billion in December.\n\nNigeria has not been able to reap the full benefits of rising international oil prices, which is now about $88 per barrel because it doesn\u2019t refine a drop of the fuel it consumes locally.\n\n\u201cOur refineries, the Port Harcourt refinery, is expected to be performing at a certain capacity, not full capacity by the end of this year. There are some modular refineries that are also going to come on stream later this year,\u201d Sylva stated.\n\nIMF Urges Nigeria to Remove Subsidy, Channel Funds to Health, Social Devt\n\nThe IMF has stressed the need for Nigeria to remove petrol subsidy and channel such funds to the health and social development sectors.\n\nThe Washington-based institution gave the advice in response to a THISDAY question during a media briefing on its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO).\n\nThe IMF however left its 2022 economic growth projection for Nigeria at 2.7 per cent, but raised the country\u2019s 2023 growth projection from 2.6 per cent to 2.7 per cent, which represented a 0.1 percentage points increase.\n\nThe Division Chief, Research Department, IMF, Mr. Malhar Nabar, said: \u201cIn terms of subsidy, we have for long not just for Nigeria, but for many low-income countries that have these programme of subsidy schemes in place, called for scaling back of poorly targeted subsidies to create fiscal space that can then be repurposed for meeting vital health and social spending needs. That recommendation applies in the case of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Nigeria\u2019s growth projection, he said: \u201cWe have an unchanged growth projection for Nigeria for 2022 and this reflects offsetting effects that we had a slightly stronger outcome in the second half of last year, especially in the non-oil sector and this this momentum is expected to continue into 2022.\n\n\u201cBut now with the external headwinds with the impacts of Omicron, we do expect some drag going forward which will counterbalance a strong momentum going into this year.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he noted that Nigeria\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio was low which if properly harnessed could put the country on a path to sustainable recovery.\n\nNabar added: \u201cIn terms of the debt situation, among low-income countries, Nigeria in terms of its public debt to GDP ratio, is actually relatively on the low side compared to other low-income countries.\n\n\u201cSo, going forward, that is certainly providing a little bit more space to provide the needed support for combating the health emergency and also putting Nigeria on the path to a sustainable recovery.\u201d\n\nNLC: Why We Suspended Protest\n\nThe labour movement said it\u2019s decision to suspend the protest was based on the policy reversal by the government which was formally communicated to it on Monday.\n\nAddressing journalists shortly after a virtual National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the NLC yesterday, its President, Mr. Ayuba Wabba said: \u201cNEC after vigorous debates took a decision to suspend the planned nationwide protest scheduled for 27\u2033 January 2022 and the national protest scheduled for 2\u2033 February 2022.\u201d\n\nHe said NEC met Tuesday morning virtually to consider the new position of the government and that at the end of the meeting, it resolved to suspend the protest and to direct the state chapters and all affiliates to discontinue mobilisation for the protest.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the peak of very rigorous mobilisation of Nigerians by the NLC and a host of her civil society allies, the government through the Minister of Finance yesterday, 24\u201d January 2022 made a public announcement reversing the plans to increase petrol pump price.\n\n\u201cThe position of the government was also officially communicated to the Congress with calls for further engagement. Following the reversal and reapproach by government, the National Executive Council of the Nigeria Labour Congress met this morning virtually to consider the new position of the government.\u201d\n\nWabba said going forward, labour would continue to engage with the government on the very critical issues of ensuring local refining of petroleum, creation of sustainable jobs and affordable price of petrol for Nigerian workers and people.\n\nWhen asked about the steps labour would take to ensure that federal government does not renege on its pledge to shelve the policy on removal of fuel subsidy, Wabba said organised labour has a traditional of holding authorities accountable to their words, adding that NLC and its allies would use all instruments available to them to ensure that no policy measure that is injurious to workers and their families is allowed to go unchallenged.\n\nLCCI Calls for Phased Removal of Fuel Subsidy\n\nThe LCCI urged the government to do all it could to avoid truncating the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which it said has suffered a flip-flop as some of its provisions are being suspended.\n\nThe Director General of the LCCI, Dr. Chinyere Almona, who expressed the chamber\u2019s reaction yesterday in a statement titled: \u201cLCCI Statement on the Suspension of Fuel Subsidy Removal,\u201d said: \u201cIn the face of this dilemma, we recommend that the removal is phased and with a complement of heavy investment in critical infrastructure that supports production in the economy. More production means more job creation, poverty reduction, and improved economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must consider doing all that is possible not to truncate the implementation of the PIA 2021, which has already brought so much hope for industry watchers as a big game-changer for the oil and gas sector.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for stakeholders\u2019 consultations on addressing the implications of lapsed provisions of the Act and forging the way ahead towards the full implementation of the PIA.\u201d\n\nAlmona pointed out that the major implication of the suspension was that it would increase the 2022 national budget\u2019s deficit by N1.5 trillion and constrain the federal government to borrow more than it has projected within the fiscal year.\n\nShe said: \u201cWith a monthly payment of about N250 billion to subsidise fuel consumption, the implication is that an additional N1.5 trillion expenditure has to be provided for in the 2022 federal budget.\n\n\u201cWith additional expenditure against the projected revenue, deficit financing will be needed to support the budget expenditure. We are likely to see government borrow more than projected to finance the bloated expenditure in the face of revenue mobilization challenge.\u201d\n\nThe LCCI stated that while it supported the full implementation of the PIA and the total deregulation of the oil and gas sector, \u201cwe are not insensitive to the plight of the masses that may feel the pains of some of the provisions like the removal of fuel subsidies.\u201d\n\nNACCIMA Calls for Wider Consultation\n\nNACCIMA has described the federal government\u2019s suspension of the implementation of fuel subsidy removal as a welcomed development, adding that it was not surprised by the development.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe acknowledge government\u2019s dilemma and difficulties for an enduring solution to the issue of removal of petroleum subsidy especially the prices of PMS. This decision to move the date and suspend subsidy removal beyond June is therefore not surprising. It appears as kicking the can down the road again. It is a welcome development.\n\n\u201cOn one hand is the issue of problem of relieving itself of the onerous burden of a burgeoning petrol subsidy. On the other hand, is how to come up with commensurate benefits to cushion the effect of removal of subsidy on the people or economy at large.\u201d\n\nThe Director General of NACCIMA, Ambassador Ayo Olukanni, said yesterday that, \u201cit is absolutely necessary to consider a practical and acceptable implementation plan in the quest to gradually weaning the public off petrol subsidy and cushion the impact with appropriate palliatives.\n\n\u201cThis can only be done in consultation with organised labour and other stakeholders including the private sector. Such an implementation plan must take into account appropriate timing aligned with the MTEF of government, as well as other concerns related to security.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important that all efforts must be made not to overheat the polity either by commission or omission especially as we move ahead to an election year. We need a peaceful Nigeria for businesses to thrive, and attract foreign investment. The decision to temporise on subsidy removal, such as contemplated by government, deserves support and we hope this step will give the required time for extensive and wide consultation.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Launches national policy on 5th generation tech for digital economy\n\n\u2022Allays safety concerns\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday launched the national policy on 5G for Nigeria\u2019s digital economy, with a clear directive to all the security agencies to immediately leverage the technology to enhance security in the country when it has been deployed.\n\nThe president who spoke at the State House, Abuja, said the federal government would take full advantage of the opportunities that 5G provides for the economy, security and well-being of the nation.\n\n\u201dIt will also support security institutions with real time communication. 5G technology is significantly faster than earlier digital technologies and it provides near real-time communication. This can play a key role in boosting our efforts towards enhancing security across the nation.\n\n\u201dIt will enable our security institutions to effectively deploy robotics, autonomous vehicles, augmented and virtual reality to address any security challenges that we face,\u201d he said at the launch of the policy, which was presented and approved at the Federal Executive Council meeting on September 8, 2021, following a robust debate.\n\nPresident Buhari also allayed fears over health safety of 5G, affirming that such issues had been, \u201deffectively addressed\u201d in developing a policy that suits the country.\n\nCommenting on the benefits of 5G technologies, the president stressed that it would support virtually every sector of the economy, including enhanced connectivity, improved healthcare, support for education while fostering smart cities, and boosting agriculture, among other advantages.\n\nThe president explained that the National 5G Policy includes a deployment plan to ensure that major cities across the country benefit from the technologies.\n\nAccording to him, the policy, which was in line with the commitment of this administration to support the digital economy, \u201cas an enabler for the diversification of our national economy, also seeks to make 5G a major driver of the economy, a catalyst for smart cities in the country and a platform for the creation of jobs that support digital economy.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, assured investors that the federal government would continue to provide an enabling environment for their businesses to be very successful as Nigeria begins the roll-out of the technology.\n\nBuhari directed the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, to supervise the implementation of the Policy, being done by the Nigerian Communications Commission, with the support of other government institutions.\n\nThe president also gave a rundown of how his administration had created an enabling environment for investments to thrive in Nigeria\u2019s digital economy.\n\nHe recalled that the journey to the launch of the 5G National policy started with the launch of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy in November 2019, as well as the launch of a number of policies to strengthen the digital economy, including the Nigerian National Broadband Plan and the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector.\n\nBuhari noted that under his watch the agreement of the National Economic Council to peg the cost of the Right of Way at N145 per linear metre which was made in 2013, was only implemented in late 2019, after the intervention of the federal government.\n\nAccording to the President, the Information and Communications Technology sector played a prime role in enabling Nigeria\u2019s economy to swiftly exit the recession that was triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201dThe GDP Report of the National Bureau of Statistics showed that the ICT sector was the fastest growing sector in the fourth quarter of 2020 and entire year 2020, recording double-digit growth rates of 14.70 per cent and 12.90 per cent respectively.\n\n\u201dThe sector also recorded a 17.92 per cent contribution to our GDP in the second quarter of last year- this was its highest ever contribution. All these impressive and significant achievements have justified our efforts to support the growth of our digital economy,\u201d he added.\n\nDescribing the process of developing the National 5G Policy as painstaking, inclusive and focused, Buhari recalled that 5G trials commenced in some selected locations in November 2019.\n\n\u201dMulti-sectoral stakeholders then deliberated on the report of the trials to ensure that health, security and other concerns were effectively addressed in developing a policy that suits our country.\n\n\u201dThe National 5G Policy will position Nigeria to harness the potentials of 5G technologies to further develop the economy and improve the indices of well-being in the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his speech, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy affirmed that the sector recorded unprecedented achievements with increased remittances to the Federation Account, resolution of lingering issues in the industry and successful auctioning of the 3.5 gigahertz (GHz) spectrum for the deployment of 5G technology.\n\nPantami thanked the president for the consistent support to the sector, announcing that within two years, the federal government completed 1,667 ICT related projects.\n\nAccording to him: \u201dAs at August 2021, the sector remitted over N1 trillion to the Federation Account and this is unprecedented because the usual remittances is around 200 billion annually and this has been increased substantially.\u201d\n\nOn the spectrum auction for the 5G, he explained that from the reserve price of N75 billion per spectrum, each spectrum was assigned to the winners at the price of over N250 billion per spectrum.\n\nThe minister expressed confidence that given the experiences from other countries and available research, Nigeria would derive maximum benefits from the deployment of 5G technology.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says Nigeria not exposed to effects of US policy normalisation, others\n\n\u2022Banking industry NPLs drop 4.85%, lowest in 10 years\n\n\u2022Warns against patronage of loan sharks\n\nJames Emejo\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday said the apex bank would not raise interest rate following the policy normalisation being undertaken by some advanced economies such as the United States and the European Union.\n\nThe CBN governor said Nigeria did not benefit from those funds which were released into advanced economies during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in which some found their way into emerging markets.\n\nOrdinarily, such policy normalisation should be of great concern to the Nigerian economy as it would have led to huge foreign exchange (forex) outflows with dire consequence on the economy.\n\nBut, Emefiele, while reacting to the development after the two-day meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the first in 2022, further allayed concerns that the monetary authority might possibly react by raising interest rates as well.\n\nThis came as the apex bank after its meeting, resolved to leave all monetary policy parameters unchanged in a bid to support the recovery and growth of the economy.\n\nThe CBN left the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), otherwise known as the interest rate unchanged at 11.5 per cent with the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nThe MPC also voted to maintain the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 per cent as well as the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nEmefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, further disclosed that the banking industry Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) had reduced to about 4.85 per cent in December, the lowest in about 10 years.\n\nAlso, the CBN governor said Nigerian have no business patronising money lenders otherwise known as loan sharks, adding that the CBN had put in place measures aimed at ensuring that people easily accessed loans from commercial banks without having to influence anybody.\n\nHe was reacting to the alleged excesses on the part of loan sharks in recent times.\n\nIn November 2021, the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) had announced that it was partnering the CBN, and other anti-graft agencies to address multiple potentially dubious conducts of certain money lenders who charge extremely high rates of interest, typically under illegal conditions.\n\nEmefiele, however, vowed to deal ruthlessly with the money lenders if caught, stressing that most operated within rural communities.\n\nNonetheless, the MPC had noted with concern, the slight increase in headline inflation (year-on-year) to 15.63 per cent in December 2021, from 15.40 per cent in November, following seven consecutive months of decline.\n\nHe pointed out that the unexpected increase was attributed to both the food and core components, which rose to 17.37 and 13.87 per cent in December 2021 from 17.21 and 13.85 per cent in November, respectively.\n\nThe committee, however, expressed confidence in the CBN\u2019s sustained intervention programmes, noting that inflation would continue to abate as food supply improves as the seasonal drive in price development associated with the December festive period was largely contributory to the marginal increase in price levels, and as such, believed that the episode of increase may be temporary.\n\nThe committee accessed the balance of risks confronting the domestic economy in the near term as they impact output growth and price stability and noted the unrelenting effort by the monetary and fiscal authorities in mitigating the impact of the virus on the economy.\n\nIt observed the continued moderate recovery of the domestic economy but requires further concerted policy effort by both the monetary and fiscal authorities to improve the momentum and strengthen the recovery.\n\nOn the pandemic, the MPC reviewed its continued impact on the domestic economy as members collectively agreed that the downside risks were still hindering the recovery. In this light, it commended the efforts of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 for procuring vaccines and continuing the drive to ensure that most Nigerians are fully vaccinated.\n\nOn price development, the MPC continued to express concerns about the impact of insecurity in farming communities on food inflation, pointing out that whereas headline inflation had been moderating for several months, its recent uptick was associated with increased demand during the festive season.\n\nIt therefore believed that prices would return to the downward trajectory given the Bank\u2019s ongoing interventions in the agriculture sector.\n\nThe committee applauded efforts of the CBN with the recent launch of the rice pyramids, noting that efforts to increase food supply and stem food inflation were in the right direction.\n\nThe MPC, however, reiterated the key role of the federal government in providing the necessary security around the country, and particularly in the farming communities, to ensure that farmers and their produce remain safe, and food supply is both boosted and uninterrupted.\n\nAlso, members noted the ongoing debate around the removal of fuel subsidy and suggested a robust engagement with relevant groups in the country, and afterward follow a stepwise and gradual approach, to ensure its moderate impact on cost of transportation and energy for individual, households and firms.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, committee also noted the need to encourage the take-off of private refineries across the country to provide alternative competitive local supply source and reduce the need for government intervention to manage fuel prices for domestic consumption.\n\nIt called for the speedy conclusion of the government gas-powered vehicle conversion scheme and other alternative sources of fuel.\n\nMoreover, the committee noted the rising government debt profile and the concentration of the funding sources and its implications for fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability, including its impact on financial system performance and growth.\n\nThe MPC urged the government on the need to harness other sources of revenue to reduce its dependence on oil as a single revenue source. In addition, it reiterated the need for government to seek alternative, more viable, and efficient infrastructure financing sources, in order to ease its expenditure burden.\n\nOn exchange rate, the committee applauded the CBN\u2019s efforts at maintaining stability over the short term with increasing demand as the economy continues to reopen.\n\nMembers of the MPC noted the dwindling proceeds from oil sale, despite rising crude oil prices and stressed the need to address the persistent reduction in remittance of oil revenue to the Consolidated Revenue Fund and urging the NNPC to urgently address this anomaly.\n\nThey added that the improved forex supply would thus support the Bank\u2019s demand management strategy in the foreign exchange market and consolidate macroeconomic performance, especially those that promote export, reduce dependence on import and reduce foreign exchange demand pressure.\n\nThe MPC welcomed the improvement in foreign capital inflow through diaspora remittances and urged the Bank to further extend the incentive scope to attract more remittances to official channels.\n\nThe CBN called on the fiscal authorities to take advantage of InfraCorp, the private sector driven infrastructural vehicle and transfer viable infrastructure projects for consideration by the corporation, saying it would ease pressure on the government.\n\nThe committee further commended the CBN\u2019s efforts in ensuring the continued downward trend of NPLs, signifying improving conditions in the banking system and emphasized the need for the bank to closely monitor developments in the sector and swiftly respond to any emerging challenges.\n\nOn the decision to hold all policy parameters constant, Emefiele said the committee decided to tow the path after a careful balancing of the benefits and downsides of each policy option.\n\nHe said the MPC decided to hold all policy parameters constant, believing that a hold stance would enable the continued permeation of current policy measures in supporting the recorded growth recovery and further boost production and productivity, which would ultimately rein-in inflation in the short to medium term.\n\nHowever, commenting on the potential threats which policy normalisation posed to the country, the CBN governor said, \u201cIt is true normalisation will naturally lead to capital flow reversal particularly for the emerging market and developing economies. Some of those funds that were released into the advanced economies during the period of COVID-19, some of them actually flowed into the emerging markets to boost foreign exchange liquidity in the emerging market.\n\n\u201cBut let me say whether you call it fortunately or unfortunately, but I will rather use the word fortunately for Nigeria, when those flows were moving to emerging markets at the time the advanced economies were offering stimulus into their economies, those flows didn\u2019t come into Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cAnd indeed, about two years ago, what we have been doing is to see to the gradual, systematic and orderly exit of foreign portfolio investors out of the country because they feel that yields are not as high as they expect and they also expect that there should be some more hedging instruments to protect them in case they want to go out.\n\n\u201cYou all recall that in the last two years, the MPC adopted a policy of price and monetary stability that is conducive to growth. And if we are talking about price and monetary stability as position of MPC that is conducive to growth, it necessarily means that the CBN had to adopt a somewhat policy of accommodation that brings interest rates to a low level, that would attract borrowers or people who have projects to embark on projects and that\u2019s the reason you would have seen that we have aggressively in the last two years seen an increase in loans whether to households or small businesses, to large companies at no more than nine per cent and for 10 years.\u201d\n\nHe said the objective was to boost manufacturing and agricultural output, pointing out that this had been instrumental in reversing the country out of recession and increasing output growth.\n\nEmefiele added that the CBN had also tried everything possible to moderate inflation.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat am I saying in essence? The funds that would be leaving as a result of policy normalisation from the advanced economies didn\u2019t come to Nigeria and so as they withdraw them, there is nothing to withdraw out of Nigeria because we are not part of that game. So I\u2019d like to assure us that it is not affecting us.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, what caused the policy normalisation in advanced economies is because of rising inflation. And I must say that it is the truth that inflation has attained an unprecedented level in these economies \u2013 United States of America, Europe \u2013 and I will read some for instance.\n\n\u201cThe US inflation attained 7.08 per cent and this seems to be the highest since 1982, unprecedented. The UK inflation attained 4.2 per cent which is the highest since 2010. In the EU area, inflation attained 5.5 per cent and it is the worse since the European Central Bank and the Euro was created.\n\n\u201cSo you would imagine that if these are the unprecedented levels of inflation in these economies, they don\u2019t have a choice but to really think of how to aggressively rein in inflation because of the liquidity supply they see in their environment and the need to rein in prices to level that is acceptable because most of those governments are already facing a threat of even losing their next elections as a result of rising prices and inflation.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cBut for us in Nigeria, like I read, our challenge is not just inflation but also growth. And this is a policy we\u2019ve been adopting in the last two years. And if we feel this policy is working well, there is no reason for MPC to begin to contemplate a policy of tightening because we see that we are somewhat moderately tightening the liquidity system through our administrative controls using CRR discretionary powers that we have.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the reason the MPC feels that we will continue to do what we are doing now because we believe it is giving us the results that we expect and let not forget that as a result of these policies we have adopted that price and stability have contributed to growth.\n\n\u201cWe saw a reversal from recession after two quarters; as a result of the policy stance we have adopted, price stability contributes to growth, we saw inflation moderating consecutively from seven to eight months until we saw inflation uptick in December 2021.\n\n\u201cSo MPC thinks what happened in December is temporary but there is a need for us to look at it again and monitor it because we saw in December 2021 both the core and the food trending upwards.\n\n\u201cWe would have expected that even food should still be trending downwards but of course we are looking at it and we think that it could be reversed because the harvest for 2021 as very good. But we have noticed a few challenges that we will address over time.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added that, \u201cThere is nothing to worry because those countries that are raising rates or even if there are some emerging countries that are following them by raising rates, those economies are indeed facing pressures because they will if they are not already, facing capital flow reversals in their economies.\n\n\u201cSo we are not in that game and that is why we are not following them in that direction. We want to remain where we are right now \u2013 hold, watch because we believe what we are doing is working well.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "American tech conglomerate Meta (formerly Facebook) on Monday joined the list of tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia who have built an AI supercomputer, with the recent announcement of its new Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research SuperCluster (RSC). Meta claims RSC is already among the fastest supercomputers and, when completed in mid-2022, will be the world\u2019s fastest.\n\nSupercomputers are high-performance computers that perform computationally intensive (high-speed) tasks such as weather forecasting, climate research, and oil and gas exploration. AI supercomputers are an improved version of supercomputers that can carry out more calculations per second than regular supercomputers, using the same hardware.\n\n\u201cRSC will help Meta\u2019s AI researchers build better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples; work across hundreds of different languages; seamlessly analyse text, images and video together; develop new augmented reality tools; and more,\u201d the company explained in a blog post.\n\nWith more than 2.6 billion monthly active users, Meta\u2019s Facebook is the most popular social media in the world. In Africa, Meta\u2019s suite of social messaging tools\u2014Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp\u2014serve as the internet for hundreds of millions of people. Businesses and consumers depend heavily on these messaging platforms because its use is ubiquitous and access to these apps and sites are free or discounted on many African telecom networks.\n\nRSC is expected to aid Meta in identifying harmful content on Facebook and Instagram; processing larger and longer videos with higher sampling rates; and in developing new augmented reality tools. It\u2019s a valuable tool that\u2019ll aid Meta in accomplishing its plans to move billions of users into the Metaverse in the near future.\n\nBefore this announcement, Meta has been using the first generation of the supercomputer designed in 2017, which could design 22,000 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in a single cluster that performs 35,000 training jobs a day.\n\nRealising the need to accelerate progress, work on the RSC began in early 2020, with Meta engineers designing and building a new AI supercomputer system from ground up.\n\n\u201cRSC today comprises a total of 760 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems as its compute nodes, for a total of 6,080 GPUs\u2014with each A100 GPU being more powerful than the V100 used in the previous system,\u201d the company said.\n\nCompared to the first generation of Meta\u2019s supercomputer, early benchmarks on RSC show that it \u201cruns computer vision workflows up to 20 times faster, runs the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) more than nine times faster, and trains large-scale NLP models three times faster. That means a model with tens of billions of parameters can finish training in three weeks, compared with nine weeks before,\u201d Meta said.\n\n\n\nAware of privacy concerns, the company added that RSC has been designed from the ground up with privacy and security in mind. Meta\u2019s researchers can safely train models using encrypted user-generated data that is not decrypted until right before training.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Most motorcycle ride-hailing startups setting up in Nigeria have historically started from Lagos, the country\u2019s most populated city and its centre of economic activity. That was until February 2020, however, when a ban on motorcycles and tricycles by the Lagos State government put several companies out of business, forcing most players to find other uses for their fleet of motorcycles or seek new cities for operation in the country.\n\nAttention has since turned to other parts of the country as viable markets for bike-hailing services with Ibadan, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest cities with close proximity to Lagos, being the first choice. On Monday, Uber Nigeria announced its two-wheeler service, UberMoto, will commence operations in the city, where it started ride-hailing operations last October.\n\nIn a statement, Uber Nigeria\u2019s country head, Tope Akinwumi, explained that UberMoto is an expansion of the company\u2019s service to offer mobility solutions in Ibadan through motorbikes, known as Okada in the local dialect. Uber charges motorcyclists on its platform a service fee of 3% per trip with a minimum fare set at \u20a6100 ($0.24) for riders.\n\nThe new service is a \u201clow-cost alternative for city people looking to negotiate traffic more quickly and efficiently,\u201d a statement from the company reads. \u201cIt makes sense for us to develop a product that will help passengers get to their destination faster, which is where we can leverage our technology,\u201d Akinwumi said.\n\nUber began operations in Lagos in 2014 and after two years expanded its services to Abuja, Nigeria\u2019s capital. In 2019, it launched in Benin City, the capital of Edo State. It currently operates in more than five Nigerian cities, in which the company has launched a series of products, from UberX to UberConnect.\n\nThe American mobility giant\u2019s entry into the okada market marks yet another product expansion in Nigeria. Uber may be a market leader in the countries it operates but in Ibadan, stiff competition already awaits. Its city of choice puts Uber at loggerheads with other two-wheeler ride-hailing startups currently operating in one of Nigeria\u2019s largest cities by geographical area, chiefly among them SafeBoda.\n\nWhereas players like Opera\u2019s ORide, Gokada, and MAX.ng launched their motorcycle hailing businesses in Lagos, SafeBoda\u2019s expansion to Nigeria from Uganda kicked off in Ibadan back in December 2019, a decision that drew criticism initially but later proved to be an act of genius when okadas were eventually banned in Lagos.\n\nBabajide Duroshola, the startup\u2019s manager for Nigeria, who was hired to launch in the country, told Rest of World that it became apparent a few months into the job that Lagos was not a viable location for the company. While other players in the country struggled and had to alter their primary business model after the Lagos motorcycle ban, SafeBoda thrived in Ibadan.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSafeBoda is one of the most active bike-hailing players in sub-Saharan Africa and claims to hold more than 80% market share in Uganda and Nigeria. In Ibadan, it had over 2,500 drivers and 40,000 customers as of May 2021. A month earlier, the company said it had completed 1 million rides in the city within a year and two months of operation.\n\nUganda\u2014SafeBoda\u2019s first market\u2014was the initial African country where Uber and Bolt decided to launch their bike-hailing service, uberBODA and Bolt boda. But in spite of the popularity and financial muscle of these companies, they\u2019ve been unable to significantly eat into SafeBoda\u2019s market share.\n\nAccording to Alastair Sussock, co-CEO of SafeBoda, as cited by TechCrunch, the company was recording about 80,000 completed rides a day in Kampala as of May 2021 while Uber and Bolt barely completed 10,000 rides in the country.\n\nGokada, ORide and MaxNG are also players in Ibadan. The former, a popular name in the last-mile logistics space in Nigeria, revived its e-hailing business in Oyo and Ogun states after the Lagos ban. The battle promises to be interesting as Uber enters the fray but will the company be able to compete with SafeBoda and others to capture on-demand mobility market share in the city?\n\n\u201cWe know that we face significant competition across local transportation modes in Africa,\u201d Akinwumi told TechCabal in an emailed response, adding that \u201cwe believe competition makes us better, which improves the service for riders and earners alike.\u201d\n\nCompared to Kampala, things may yet play out differently in Ibadan between Uber and SafeBoda, despite the latter being an already established player there. Also, the race for market share would most likely hinge on whichever player can offer drivers the best terms and riders superior user experience at affordable rates.\n\nSo far, Uber appears to be doing better by those parameters, according to an Ibadan-based user of both UberMoto and SafeBoda, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cA \u20a6300 ($0.72) trip on SafeBoda could go for around \u20a6200 ($0.48) on UberMoto. But I think Uber is still significantly cheaper because the service is new,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been using SafeBoda since March 2021 but now, getting matched with drivers is becoming more difficult. Drivers are also often rude, some even start trips without picking me up and there is no way to report issues in-app.\u201d\n\nMoreover, in spite of the presence of several players, there is still ample space for Uber\u2019s bike-hailing business in Ibadan, a city covering a total area of 3,080 square kilometres, home to over 6 million residents with a strong motorcycle transport culture but has only an estimated 80,000 active okadas.\n\nIn addition to a large population and a motorcycle culture, regulatory certainty is another reason bike-hailing startups prefer Ibadan. In Oyo state, conversations about regulating the mobility sector have been simple. Governor Seyi Makinde, in April, gave an assurance that his administration does not plan to ban the operations of motorbikes in the state.\n\nStill, startups should be cautious of regulatory risk, a major problem that\u2019s historically hindered ease of doing business in Nigeria. When quizzed on this, Akinwumi noted that Uber will continue to \u201cactively work with regulators to ensure we comply with the requirements set out by the government in each city we operate in.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In 2019, a few months after the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA) was signed, some African tech and creative industry players were hosted by CcHUB in Kigali, Rwanda, to discuss how the tech and creative ecosystem could leverage the newly signed agreement.\n\nIn that room, among 80 participants from 30 countries, was Tola Onayemi, a young lawyer who was in the middle of everything. Onayemi was the assistant chief negotiator and head of trade remedies at the Nigerian Office for Trade Negotiations. So, at the time of the meeting, he was at the forefront\u2014leading the technical negotiations of the AfCFTA on behalf of Nigeria.\n\nAt the core of the discussion was trade facilitation issues and everybody in the room, big and important in their own right, knew Onayemi as the go-to kid for the subject matter; he was the exact intersection between tech, law, and trade\u2014the three parts that form a successful cross-border business.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHaving drafted the Nigerian Ease of Doing Business Policy and advised the Nigerian vice president on industry, trade, and investment before moving to lead the AfCFTA, Onayemi had an idea what the continent needed\u2014Africa had to be a \u201ccountry\u201d to win in the global market.\n\nAfter the Kigali meet-up, COVID-19 hit and the momentum died down. But around late 2020 when countries began to ease the lockdown and open their borders, founders began to reach out to Onayemi to help them in their expansion efforts. He handled a couple of these as ad-hoc services and then began to see his idea of \u201cCountry Africa\u201d unfolding like a morning flower\u2014slow but significant.\n\n\u201cPeople would reach out to me and say, \u2018You\u2019re a lawyer and you are also knowledgeable about trade and tech; you\u2019re the perfect advisor and middle person to help us get into any market.\u2019 So I helped them expand,\u201d Onayemi told TechCabal. \u201cAnd then over time, I just realised there\u2019s something here. So, I started discussing it with Tope Obanla, my co-founder, to see if there\u2019s something here we could build.\u201d\n\nFast forward to June 2021, Onayemi and Obanla were finally ready to roll Africa into a country with their tradetech startup Norebase, a one-stop-shop digital platform for African businesses to expand, file trademarks and patent an Intellectual property (IP) across the continent.\n\nTola Onayemi, co-founder and CEO at Norebase. Image credit: Terna Iwar\n\nThe startup handles everything it takes for a business to launch in a new African country. It\u2019s a 360 degree business launchpad: business registrations, opening of business bank accounts, compliances, license acquisition, and further legal requirements\u2014all from one dashboard.\n\nExpansion across Africa can be tedious. Even though there are similar problems across the continent\u2019s countries, there are just too many impediments that frustrate the process. There are issues of legal frameworks, language barriers, smug policies, cultural disparities, and other nuances.\n\nAlthough most of these impediments can\u2019t be erased overnight, Norebase is building a node that at least takes the burden of scaling these brickwalls off the shoulders of business owners.\n\nAt the core, the company is helping African companies expand, but as they take on more businesses they realise they need to do more than just help companies to start in a new market.\n\n\u201cNow, we don\u2019t just want to help businesses launch in a new market; we want to also help them operate and scale across Africa quickly and safely without experiencing all the fractions of doing so,\u201d said Onayemi, who was also the founding legal partner at Future Africa, an Africa-focused early-stage venture fund.\n\nEssentially, Norebase wants to be the partner a business would need to operate in a new African market. All it takes are a few clicks away.\n\nOnayemi believes expansion for most African businesses isn\u2019t a want but a need. Most African countries don\u2019t really have a population size that has the disposable income to fuel a unicorn or a wildly successful business. Hence the expansion into more markets.\n\nTola Onayemi by Terna Iwar\n\n\u201cYou have to be in several markets because there\u2019s a disposable income gap in most markets. In Nigeria, for instance, after you do Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt, you are kind of stuck thinking of the next place to find your audience. What happens if you can\u2019t find it? Then you\u2019ll start looking into Accra or Nairobi.\u201d\n\nOnayemi also thinks African businesses need to expand to reduce their vulnerability and derisk against unfavourable regulations that may throw them off course. \u201cIt\u2019s a survival strategy and a way to edge against unfavourable markets. For instance, what happens when Nigeria says no more cryptocurrency or motorcycles?\u201d\n\nBig companies that have expanded into different markets have in-house expansion teams and keep their learnings private. This means that other companies, especially smaller startups that are operating on a lean budget, would have to go through the same mistakes before getting it right. Norebase is solving the problem of trial and error due to the information silo.\n\nLike every other company playing in the African market, Norebase has both online and offline solutions. Its online expansion solution covers Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa and Kenya. In addition to these four countries, its offline offer is extended to Senegal, Egypt, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and more. Onayemi said, while you can only access their expansion offering to select counties for now, you can file trademark and IP across the 55 countries in Africa.\n\nThe company makes money by charging a base fee, depending on the country of expansion. Onayemi said they are constantly making price savings for their customers. As a venture-backed impact company, Norebase\u2019s objective is to first ensure that businesses get into new markets.\n\n\u201cWhat you see happening is that we\u2019re actually constantly pushing down prices so, for instance, our price for Kenya between March and December last year was cut by almost 70%.\u201d\n\nOnayemi said the goal of their pricing strategy is to get to a point where incorporating in any African country will only cost $500. The startup has helped companies like Patricia and Brass, among others, to expand into new markets.\n\nNorebase is tackling a big problem involving multiple government bureaucracies and it wishes to create an environment where founders aren\u2019t restricted to their native countries. Imagine a Kenyan choosing to build in Egypt and the other way round without bothering about running into walls. If AfCFTA wants to create a single African market, think of Norebase as a tool that will power its efficiency. Onayemi believes this will encourage African governments to create policies that support their local businesses.\n\nFor Norbase, the ambition is big and almost sounds impossible because of the precedence set by the present intra-African business and information exchange. But the startup is filled with relentless individuals with an unmatched focus to make this work.\n\n\u201cIn order to accomplish our audacious target, we\u2019re keen on building a culture that attracts talents from the biggest companies in the world,\u201d Onayemi said. \u201cWe hire people with a leadership mindset. People who are founders in their own right.\u201d\n\nAccording to Onayemi, he and his team are building the most significant company in Africa, and when they succeed, the whole African tech and business ecosystem wins. Besides him being a trade leader, his co-founder is an ex-Goldman Sachs associate and a senior engineer at Microsoft.\n\nIn conclusion, even though he didn\u2019t specifically say what they are, Onayemi hinted that the company is launching new products that will \u201cchange the game\u201d, especially fintech startups. The phrase \u201cchange the game\u201d sounds like a founder pitching investors, but it\u2019s Onayemi and his antecedent is enough to take him to be serious and anticipate these products.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

With 54 countries at the moment, that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s easy to see why they could make that mistake. Eager to free the continent from colonial rule, leaders from several African colonies pushed for a united front, but that never happened.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven after independence, collaboration between African countries has been notoriously tricky such that one is better off travelling or conducting business with countries outside the continent than with those within.\n\nThe desire to collaborate across the continent has not faded, and a few policies have been drawn up to tackle this challenge. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement \u2014 has come very close to doing this, inspiring Tola Onayemi to build Norebase in the process.\n\nA lawyer, Onayemi\u2019s career has seen him work at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and as a Technical Adviser to the Office of the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Industry, Trade & Investment.\n\nAs a Technical Adviser to the Nigerian Vice President, he led the negotiations for the AfCFTA agreement, getting familiar with the difficulties of starting and expanding businesses in Africa.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does a lawyer with a cushy government job decide to go into the stressful world of the startup founder?\n\nYour guess is as good as ours, and Techpoint Africa decided it was time to find some answers.\n\nIn 2015, after a stint in the Office of the Legal Adviser at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Tola Onayemi accepted the position of Technical Adviser to the Office of the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Industry, Trade & Investment.\n\nThis position led him to serve as Nigeria\u2019s Assistant Chief Trade Negotiator, where he led parts of the negotiations for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnayemi told us, \u201cThere had been a mandate to negotiate the AfCFTA, but no one had really used it; it had just existed. But given the late Ambassador Chiedu\u2019s [Osakwe] experience, Nigeria started centring the conversation, and in a year, Nigeria had pushed through the AfCFTA. And I worked on that.\u201d\n\nOn a clear, sunny day on July 7, 2019, Nigeria signed the AfCFTA in Niamey, Niger.\n\nFor members of Nigeria\u2019s tech community, signing the AfCFTA resulted in discussions on what it meant for them.\n\nIn August 2019, Onayemi was invited to Kigali to attend the creation of the Africa Technology and Creative Group (ATCG) by the Co-creation Hub (CcHub). Apart from his experience with negotiating the AfCFTA, he had previously advised his classmates who had gone into tech and other clients.\n\n\u201cWe had these very robust conversations, and we started thinking, what are the things that need to happen for tech to take strong advantage of the AfCFTA, and we came up with a bunch of ideas. One of the ideas was the cross-recognition of corporate documents.\n\n\u201cIs there a world where there can be a central registry where I can take my incorporation documents from Nigeria to South Africa, and they are recognised automatically, so I don\u2019t have to start the process all over again? Or how do we use hubs to create a support system of people trying to expand across the continent?\u201d\n\nThis was when the conversation to build Norebase started.\n\nEverything comes together neatly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTola Onayemi, Co founder: Norebase. Source: Instagram\n\nWhat happened between August 2019 and December 2020?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the most part, nothing. 2020 was the year of the pandemic, and with the coronavirus bringing nations and businesses to a standstill, Onayemi\u2019s ideas went on the back burner.\n\nBut, he soon became restless, and by December 2020, thoughts of helping to implement the AfCFTA had begun to fill his head once more. Like he told us, a policy without an implementation framework is akin to a joke.\n\nThe first challenge, however, was deciding what to do.\n\n\u201cThere were a bunch of options, but we wanted to identify something that we could build in the private sector to scale and work. And so we started bouncing a bunch of ideas around and one that kept resurfacing was this idea of a central digital platform that helps businesses to start, scale, and operate across Africa.\u201d\n\nAfter speaking to friends, his co-founder (Tope), and getting data from the data analytics company they hired, it became clear that there was something to build upon.\n\nFrom helping companies get incorporated, it became a platform to help businesses move past the incorporation stage and right into the thick of operations and expansion.\n\nInterestingly, Onayemi told Techpoint that things moved very fast from the very beginning with them already handling clients, even at the ideating and data-gathering stage.\n\n\u201cFor us, there were a bunch of validating signals. One of them was being able to build out a formidable team interested in African prosperity. It was like having customers who were all in. The entire team came together and said, there\u2019s a demand here, and we are building for it\n\n\u201cAnother was that the demand for this solution was high and would only increase. Every potential client we interacted with only validated this point. So, the real question was, what\u2019s the best model you use to build it in a way that makes it sustainable as a tech business?\u201d\n\nThe concept of Norebase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nTo help understand, Onayemi painted a picture comparing the US market and the African context.\n\n\u201cAs a businessperson based in the US, you can easily stay in San Francisco alone and build a unicorn. You can stay in one place and have access to lots of disposable income. With most African businesses, you would have to cherry-pick from 54 markets because the disposable income in individual African countries can be low.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, expansion is a survival issue for most African businesses. As of 2020, nine of the ten countries on the world\u2019s poorest countries list were African.\n\nEssentially, the total addressable market size is quite small, even for countries like Nigeria. Although Africa\u2019s projected population growth level is often touted as a blessing, there\u2019re still other attendant issues many developing countries face: poor infrastructure, bad governance, and bureaucracy, among others.\n\nHe also explains that in most of these countries, the problems startups face are pretty similar, with issues such as regulators moving \u201cinteresting\u201d, as he put it.\n\n\u201cThe effect being that businesses have to start their business registration process anew each time, which can be long and tedious. But the thing is, when people try to expand or even set up in their own markets, one of three things happen. Either they find out that registration is very expensive, or that it\u2019s very complicated to understand, or that there\u2019s a trust deficit.\n\n\u201cWhat Norebsase is doing for you is simple \u2014 we are providing you with the digital infrastructure for you to register, start, and scale your business in any African country. The idea is to build a digital infrastructure that ensures that anybody can actually just get into either their own market or another market without too much of a hassle.\u201d\n\nAt the core of this is the need for companies to focus on their business rather than be bogged down by the fine print and extraneous details.\n\n\u201cSo imagine a world where you had previously expanded to Ghana and now need to expand to South Africa, and it is achievable with just one click. In two minutes, you have started the process to have a company in South Africa! That\u2019s where we are going.\u201d\n\nDealing with African \u201canyhowness\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how do you deal with similar yet different markets?\n\nOnayemi postulates a game theory where countries have to compete for startup attention.\n\n\u201cImagine a world where you say, I\u2019m in Nigeria, but I don\u2019t want to incorporate in Nigeria. I want to go to Kenya. What that does is, you create an incentive where countries now have to compete for who has the better environment.\u201d\n\nThe end goal, with the help of the AfCFTA as a cushion and pressure, is to make starting and scaling so easy that countries have no choice but to change. Some might call this audacious, especially considering the African context, but it would definitely be interesting to watch how this plays out.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that building for the African market is quite different in the sense of having to sometimes do everything yourself.\n\n\u201cIf you are building in the US, you can focus on a small facet of the need as others focus on complementary parts because it is a system that works. But what has been our experience so far is that we have to provide an end to end experience for our users as no one else is fulfilling the need. Our users that have registered in some countries still have to stall operations for varying reasons.\u201d\n\nHe also touched on a lawyer\u2019s usual gamble: understanding the rules so well that you find exceptions to them.\n\n\u201cSo the way we basically approach it in each country today is to say, \u2018What is the minimum rule in this country? What are the exceptions?\u2019 And then build around those to ensure that our users do not have to worry about the intricate details.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, he said that an often forgotten side-effect with the current mode of expansion is that helpful information is either lost or rarely available.\n\n\u201cOne big advantage is that we can aggregate learning. So, for instance, we can say, the biggest issue with expanding in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is xxx, and you can solve it and apply it to several people at once and then it\u2019s now a learning that you can apply at scale.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s see the numbers, though. Or maybe not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnayemi speaking at the SOAS Khartoum conference in 2019. Source: Instagram\n\nSo, how much does it cost to set up in different countries?\n\nWell, according to Onayemi, it depends on the market. Nigeria is pretty cheap, but countries like Ghana and Kenya are a bit steep, with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire a bit higher.\n\nThe price also depends on what the customer wants.\n\n\u201cSo the way to think of it is that there\u2019s a basic business registration product, and there are a bunch of add-ons that you can also buy.\u201d\n\nHe also said that over time, they\u2019ve tried to introduce price reductions. Once they get a price cut, they implement it.\n\nWe can\u2019t tell you the price, though. You\u2019ll have to see for yourself.\n\nWhat we can tell you is what you get. In Kenya, for example, you get a company secretary that provides legal services to you for a year. You also receive a registered mailing address, among other things.\n\nIn Onayemi\u2019s words, \u201cIt\u2019s basically a buy-what-you-want service.\u201d\n\nCurrent challenges; future plays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nOne of the biggest problems right now is data.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we see frequently is that people want to expand, but they don\u2019t have the requisite data to determine where they should go. We get asked questions ranging from \u201cWhat is the best country to expand to?\u201d to \u201cHow do I know this country can afford my product?\u201d These questions, we believe, should be answered through market research, which is not a service we provide.\u201d\n\nBut there are also policy inconsistencies and trying to choose the best markets based on that. Onayemi, however, sees this as even more reason to expand \u201cand build antifragility into your business.\u201d\n\nHe also believes this would improve with time because the more options businesses have, the better choices they can make, creating a sort of competition to do better among them. In his words, essentially, countries would market themselves.\n\nFor him, the different cycles of how this would play out would start with people expanding to different markets (current situation), people staying in one market and then expanding into different markets, and, finally, Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), where you have a company that\u2019s not registered in any African market, but with which you can do business in Africa.\n\n\u201cSomeone can say, \u2018Okay listen, I am a business incorporated in maybe the cloud or whatever it is, and I\u2019m supplying a Nigerian businessperson with a service.\u2019 It\u2019s not based in Nigeria; it\u2019s not based anywhere. That changes the entire dynamics of what businesses are or what companies can do.\u201d\n\nWhy DAOs? He believes that giving people the power to make decisions would ultimately lead to higher decision-making capabilities because there\u2019s no third party to make decisions for them. It forces people to scrutinise their decision-making.\n\n\u201cDo I think that there should be centralised regulations? Yes, but we need to strike a balance between how much we strip people of decision-making abilities and how much we just trust that they can make the best decisions for themselves.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Norebase is introducing new features like payment in local currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello,\n\nLet\u2019s talk about this not-so-new kid on the block.\n\nUber\u2019s gamble on Nigerian motorbikes\n\nThe gist: On Monday, Uber launched UberMoto, its motorbike on-demand service in Ibadan, Nigeria, to join competitors like SafeBoda, MAX.ng, and Gokada.\n\nThe global mobility company has been operating in Nigeria for eight years. Besides heralding the beginning of app-based on-demand car-hailing in the country, it has witnessed the entrance of popular competitors like Estonia mobility startup, Bolt(formerly Taxify) and inDriver, including other local entrants; it also saw how Chinese-owned OPay gave the model a try with OCar, although it didn\u2019t scale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin the same time, Uber has expanded into five states in the country. The latest is Ibadan and Portharcourt in October 2021. However, despite its slow but calculated expansion rate, it took Uber this long to bring any other vertical asides car-hailing into the country.\n\nMakes me wonder why. A possible reason is if the company planned to do something totally different? Come to think of it; the best time would have been when Lagos was still a hotspot for on-demand motorcycle services. But that would also mean partaking in the loss suffered following the Okada ban in February 2021.\n\nFour weeks ago, it was in the news that Uber partnered with Opibus to deploy 3000 electric motorcycles across the continent. Could this be the plan for Ibadan?\n\nFrom Uber\u2019s country manager, Tope Akinwumi\u2019s comment about the launch, the plan is to provide a cost-effective and quicker transportation option. But there was no mention of electric vehicles.\n\nAlthough UberMoto\u2019s model was not clearly stated, it is most likely going to run like Uber car service, where it taps into the current network of riders, screens and does background checks on interested riders before onboarding them.\n\nMy concerns: If the late-mover disadvantage exists, Uber might have to resort to giving heavy discounts to attract and retain customers, which might be unsustainable in the long run. While UberMoto would rest on Uber\u2019s image, which by the way, is pretty new to Ibadan, we can\u2019t say it will be Uber\u2019s top priority to make it work.\n\nFun fact: Thailand was UberMoto\u2019s first market in 2014. Sadly, this service was halted two years later due to government regulations. In 2018, it was Uganda\u2019s turn to have UberBoda, the first in Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly too early to guess UberMoto\u2019s fate; after all, Ugandan SafeBoda seems to be having a relatively good run in the market. Only time will tell if this was a smart decision. What do you think?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nRecently, two crypto platforms planned to introduce some new features that caught my attention.

          "text": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has declared an emergency response to Lassa fever after the country recorded a surge in the number of confirmed cases.\n\nThe center on Wednesday activated the national multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to respond to the outbreak in some parts of the country after a joint risk assessment with partners and sister agencies.\n\nAs of January 23, data from the NCDC show that a total of 115 cases and 26 deaths have been reported from the disease, with fatality at 22.6 percent. These cases were reported in 30 local government areas (LGAs) across 11 states.\n\nThe reports in weeks one and two show the highest number of confirmed cases recorded in the last four years for the same period. For instance, in the first week of 2022, 48 cases were recorded compared to the nine cases recorded in week one of 2021.\n\nLassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness transmitted to humans through contact with food or household items contaminated by rodents infected with the Lassa fever virus. Person-to-person transmission can also occur, particularly in a hospital environment with inadequate infection control measures.\n\nLike several other countries in West Africa, the disease is endemic in Nigeria and is often recorded during the dry season, often between November and May.\n\nLassa fever presents initially like any other febrile illness such as malaria. Its symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, general body weakness, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle pains, chest pain, and in severe cases, unexplainable bleeding from ears, eyes, nose, mouth, and other body openings.\n\nRead also: Oyo moves to contain spread of Lassa fever\n\nThe time between infection and the appearance of symptoms of the disease is between three to 21 days. However, early treatment and diagnosis increase the chances of survival.\n\nTo reduce the risk of the spread of the disease, the NCDC has advised Nigerians to ensure proper environmental sanitation; dispose of refuse properly, store foodstuff like rice, garri, beans, and corn, among other raw foods, in containers with tight-fitting lids.\n\nNigerians are also urged to avoid bush burning, eliminate rats in homes and communities by setting rat traps and other means, and practice good personal hygiene like frequent hand-washing with soap under running water or use of hand sanitizers when appropriate.\n\nThe center urges Nigerians to visit the nearest health facility if they notice any of the signs and symptoms of Lassa fever, and avoid self-medication.\n\nIt also advised that healthcare workers practice standard precautions and to maintain a high index of suspicion at all times.\n\nSince 2016, the NCDC said it had worked hard to improve diagnostic capacity for the disease. There are currently, seven laboratories that can conduct confirmatory tests for Lassa fever in Nigeria and are coordinated by the NCDC National Reference Laboratory. This has improved active case detection for the disease.",

          "text": "The Federal Government has said it is unwilling to inflict an additional burden on Nigerians as a major reason for the decision to suspend its petrol subsidy removal.\n\nHowever, understanding how countries in similar situations solved the problem may provide lessons for Nigeria.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s analysis of studies conducted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the non-profit, Governance and Social Development Resource Centre, sheds light on strategies used by over a dozen countries to lessen the pain of subsidy removal.\n\nResearch\n\nSome countries succeeded in convincing their people that subsidies are harmful using independent research and proactive communication.\n\nGhana, one of Nigeria\u2019s neighbouring countries, ended subsidies on petroleum products in 2005, by employing Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA), a systematic approach to analysing the distributional impact of policy reforms and programmes on the welfare of different stakeholders groups.\n\nPSIA promotes evidence-based policy choices and fosters debate on policy reform options and it\u2019s used increasingly by governments, civil society organisations, and multilateral agencies.\n\nThrough the PSIA, Ghana found the subsidy programme was poorly targeted, with the wealthy receiving the lion\u2019s share of the benefits. It quantified how and to what extent the poor would be affected by future deregulation.\n\nThis became an important foundation for persuasively communicating the necessity for reform and for designing policies to reduce the impacts of higher fuel prices on the poor.\n\nThe PSIA in Ghana also showed that cash transfers would be more cost-effective in reaching the poor than the existing tax exemption on kerosene and the LPG subsidy. However, it must first generate an accurate list.\n\nThese arguments are true for Nigeria as only the rich in a few states benefit the most from petrol subsidies. The government is trying to fix the decrepit refineries, counting on Dangote refineries, offering cash to the poor, and propping autogas policy without research showing whether these measures would be effective or not.\n\nPublic campaigns and education\n\nCountries that have successfully removed petrol subsidies embarked on public campaigns to educate the people.\n\nIn Ghana, the finance and energy ministries undertook a public relations campaign, including a broadcast explaining the reason for the price hikes and announcing measures to lessen their impact.\n\nGhana provided transparent and readily monitored mitigation measures which included the immediate abolition of fees at government-run primary and junior secondary institutions, as well as a program to improve public transportation.\n\nIndonesia developed a clear strategy to educate the general population about the benefits of fossil-fuel subsidy reform.\n\nCampaigns against fuel subsidy removal have often lacked coherence and integrity. The argument for efficiency sounds hollow in the face of government waste, corruption, and inefficiency.\n\nRead also: Nigeria faces higher budget deficit on revived subsidy\n\nCash transfers\n\nSeveral governments that have tried to remove fuel subsidies in their respective countries have always aimed at protecting low-income households.\n\nThe Governance and Social Development Resource Centre (GSDRC), in its report titled \u201cexamples of successful fuel subsidy removal,\u201d indicated that the Indonesian government established a cash transfer scheme in October 2005 to compensate for an average 114 percent increase in product prices, though new levels remained below international market rates.\n\nHowever, this unconditional cash transfer proved to be an effective method for overcoming societal and political opposition to fuel-subsidy reform.\n\nPublic Trust\n\nThe importance of public trust in its government can never be overemphasized.\n\nA case study is Indonesia\u2019s administration, in January 2003, where corruption and inefficiencies of political life and bureaucracy, encountered considerable popular dissatisfaction from the public.\n\nIn furtherance, an attempt to raise fuel prices sparked popular outrage, prompting the administration to scale back much of the rise.\n\nHowever, the administration in power in 2005 roughly tripled the price of kerosene and nearly doubled the price of gasoline and diesel with no protest.\n\n\u201cPublic trust can also be improved if subsidy reform is timed with fiscal reform, establishing a more rational structure of energy taxes and improving education, health, and welfare,\u201d the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said.\n\nPhased approaches\n\nMany governments use this scheme to pursue a gradual approach to the removal of subsidies in order to minimise opposition from the interest groups that had benefited from the policies.\n\nUsing Brazil as a case study, the IMF stated that the transition to free-market prices in the country began with petroleum products used by a small number of people (e.g., asphalt, lubricants) and progressed to other extensively used items (e.g. gasoline, diesel, fuel oil, and LPG).\n\n\u201cThe first items to lose subsidies were those that were commonly utilized by politically weak stakeholders, with the politically more problematic subsidies being eliminated later.\n\n\u201cWhile trade unions remained hostile to the price hikes, the general people accepted them, and there were no large-scale protests,\u201d said the IMF.\n\nInternational and Domestic Pressure\n\nOne of the solutions to the lack of political will is to apply pressure through international institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF, and Transparency International (TI).\n\n\u201cLoan institutions, assistance providers, and international organizations can also help developing nations design and implement subsidy reforms by transferring expertise and technology and enforcing well-reasoned lending and development aid conditions,\u201d UNEP said.\n\nCoherence in reform policy\n\nThis would ideally be designed with broad stakeholder support; set a timetable for implementation; include complementary policies to offset any negative effects on the poor and industry; develop a communications strategy to reassure stakeholders that their interests are being respected; create mechanisms to ensure transparency regarding subsidies and the reform process.\n\nAccording to the IMF, Iran began allowing a significant increase in natural gas and electricity costs in December 2010.\n\n\u201cThe country raised domestic energy prices by up to 20 times, becoming the first major oil-exporting country to significantly remove implicit energy subsidies.\u201d\n\nHowever, this entailed a complex and sequential process of defining objectives, legislation, lowering inflation, and establishing a cash transfer system.\n\nFurthermore, the forum indicated that all of these processes, well-sequenced, could arguably allow the reforms to achieve a degree of success.",

Tony Iju Nwabunike stated this in Lagos recently during a press briefing to celebrate the four years of his executives on the leadership of the foremost freight forwarding association in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPursuing bigger revenue and failing to strengthen trade results in greater losses to the economy as investments are either threatened, reduced or made non existent.\u201d\n\nHe also said that totality of customs efforts deployed into revenue pursuit reduces the service\u2019s productivity in many ways\u201d, Nwabunike stated.\n\nWhile appealing President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Finance not to sign the proposed $3.1 billion the customs modernisation contract, Nwabunike said that it would tie down the NCS to a 20 year debt repayment programme that is not necessary for the country which is already contending with huge foreign and domistic debts that are gulping over 85 per cent of the nation\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nNwabunike said: \u201cWe want to also advise the Federal Government to be careful before signing into the $3.1 billion Customs Modernisation Project which we heard, will run for 20 years.\n\nWe urge President Muhammadu Buhari and the Finance Minister to avoid assenting to the deal, saying \u201cNigeria is already in serious debts and customs being a strategic non-oil revenue earner for government shouldn\u2019t be tied to another long term debt repayment for two decades.\n\n\u201cOn this, we call on the National Assembly to take a closer look at the details and ensure that the Federal Ministry of Finance, Nigeria Customs Service and all parties involved observe due diligence that won\u2019t entrap the country in another long term debt repayment for 20 years and maybe for lesser value,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended the Federal Government for its recent inauguration of an expanded partnership committee on blue economy chaired by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, saying its a very bold step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cFor us, this shows more commitment by the Buhari administration to maritime matters. We urge the committee to go beyond conference room talk and paperwork to addressing real challenges militating against full harvesting of our marine environment benefits in a sustainable manner.\u201d\n\nNwabunike also called on Federal Government to ensure that it includes the ANLCA in some of its committees, saying \u201cAs a body of Customs Brokers, practitioners and investors,\u201d they have vast experience in trade matters\u201d.\n\n...",

It is a big setback but we will not relent.\n\n\u201cWe are reiterating our appeal for recourse to the law and avoidance of generalizations. These killings and counter killings are unjustifiable.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFor instance in 2020, 114 citizens were killed in Zangon Kataf and 28 in Kauru, and in 2021, 186 were killed in Zangon Kataf and 59 in Kauru and if you put the figures, we lost 387 people in these two councils. In 2021, 100 citizens incurred gun shot injuries in the two councils, 77 in Zangon Kataf and 23 in Kauru.\n\n\u201cThis is aside, houses and settlements burnt, farms destroyed, cattle killed and collapse of the rural economy affecting all the communities.\n\n\u201cWe must rise to the occasion and put a stop to all these challenges, arising from the behavior of a few elements on all sides. Let us reason together and avert this needless bloodshed.\u201d\n\nThe member of House of Representatives representing Zangon Kataf/Jaba federal constituency, Amos Gwamna Magaji, in his remarks supported the appeal for recourse to the law and collective campaign for peace in the locations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn their separate remarks, the Agwatyap, Sir Dominic Gambo Yahaya, and Res-Tsam (Chief of Chawai), Alhaji Yahaya Mohammed, corroborated calls for peace and pledge their commitment to support security forces in their moves for sustainable peace and development.\n\nThe chairman of Zangon Kataf local government, Hon.

          "text": "A socio-cultural and political group, Greater Southern Borno, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the Senator representing Borno South, Mohammed Ali Ndume, for instituting developmental schemes and fighting poverty in the area.\n\nA statement issued by the convener, Greater Southern Borno, Ibrahim Abubakar, said President Buhari has provided a unique opportunity aimed at addressing poverty in the area.\n\n\u201cWe wish to extend our gratitude first, to the government of President Muhammadu Buhari for giving Nigerians and especially the people of Southern Borno this unique opportunity to readdress poverty and set a new trend in capacity building and economic revolution,\u201d Abubakar said of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) intervention programmes through NIRSAL.\n\nHe added: \u201cTo our most Distinguished Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume, words cannot express our appreciation and gratitude for this selfless efforts in securing this unique opportunity for his people,\u201d Abubakar said, adding that the lawmaker has proven to be a leader by fulfilling campaign promises he made of ensuring excellent representation of his people.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFor the last hundred years, the global south has been the epicenter of poverty. On a daily basis 426 children are at risk of death in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, issues of social development and poverty alleviation must be taken seriously.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, successive governments have rolled out numerous social development schemes- which appear perfect on paper. However, these schemes have fallen short of long-term impact.\n\n\u201cMany may fault successive governments for the failure of previous and current social development schemes. What analysts have failed to study is the implementation process. There must be a constituted authority or a political force at least to complement the government in implementing and deepening the impact of these schemes,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe group said Boko Haram insurgency and the COVID-19 pandemic impacted negatively on the businesses and livelihood of the people of Borno and the country at large, saying Ndume has chosen to do things differently to cushion the effects.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAfter Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced the N50 billion Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) as a stimulus package to support households and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and also trigger economic rebound, Ndume, initiated a group to come up with a training and sensitization formula to compliment the government\u2019s effort.\n\n\u201cAcross the country, this loan has been misused as a large population of people see whatever comes from the government as free money that they have earned due to trials and difficulty they are facing; money that should not be put to good use, rather should be spent on short term goals and nothing can be done about it.\n\n\u201cNdume, in his efforts to make sure his constituency conforms with sustainable development tenets, especially as they have been bedeviled by poverty caused by insecurity, has ensured excellent representation for his people and ensured that almost 4000 individuals benefited from the CBN- NIRSAL Targeted Credit Facility for COVID-19 for his constituents to support their households and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) etc. Majority of whom are educated youth who form the large part of the population,\u201d the group added.\n\nThe group said Ndume\u2019s training has been able to sensitize and educate beneficiaries on the importance of the loan, suggest practical and productive businesses that they can engage in, guide existing SME Business owners on how to further build and promote their existing business, adding that most of the beneficiaries now know the importance of book keeping, registering business names and paying tax to link with the intention of the TCF funds\n\n\u201cNdume is getting feedback on challenges of beneficiaries and data base for monitoring and tracking the progress of beneficiaries. Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume represents the breed of leaders the third world needs to advance,\u201d the group said adding that the lawmaker has proven to be the bridge that connects the old and the new generations.\n\n\u201cHe has indeed showed his willingness to work with the youth and lead them to the bright future that is not far from now,\u201d the group said of Ndume.",

          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Wednesday denied zoning its 2023 presidential ticket to any part of southern Nigeria as being speculated in viral reports making the rounds in the media space.\n\nIn the reports which went viral Tuesday, the anonymous author of the report stated that the APC had zoned its presidential ticket to the South-East, while that of the Vice President was zoned to the North, with other key positions spread round the different geo-political regions in the country.\n\nDismissing the report in a statement, Director General, Press and Media Affairs to Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee of the APC Mamman Mohammed, quoted Governor Mai Mala Buni as saying there was no iota of truth in the report.\n\nThe Yobe state governor added that a decision on zoning of the party\u2019s tickets would only be taken at the convention of the party coming up in February.\n\n\u201cThe attention of His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Yobe State and Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Hon. Mai Mala Buni, has been drawn to media publications with purported zoning of offices allegedly announced by him,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nHe further said: \u201cHis Excellency has, in clear and unambiguous terms, denied the said list, saying, it is false, baseless, unfounded, misleading and has nothing to do with him.\n\n\u201cThe Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee said the party has not taken any decision at any fora on anything relating to zoning of offices.\n\n\u201cThe publication is just a figment of the author\u2019s imagination that has nothing to do with the Chairman and the party. The public is hereby urged to disregard the purported list as it is misleading and completely false.\n\n\u201cGovernor Buni urged the press to resist unverified stories and rumours, and to always verify all issues related to the party assuring that the doors of the party are always open.\u201d\n\nOkorocha joins race\n\nIn a related development, the rank of presidential aspirants on the platform of the APC swelled Wednesday with the declaration of Senator Rochas Okorocha (APC Imo West) for the contest.\n\nMaking the declaration Wednesday through a letter forwarded to Senate President Ahmad Lawan and read to other lawmakers, Okorocha said his joining the race was to offer Nigerians the leadership that would take Nigerians out of the wilderness .\n\nOkorocha, in the letter titled: \u201cNigerian President 2023 \u201c, said the country at the moment needed \u201d a detribalized Nigerian who can unite our country, a leader with a compassionate heart, who will care for the poor and downtrodden and the masses of our country, a visionary leader who can create wealth for our teaming populace thereby, addressing the issues of poverty, insecurity and youth restiveness.\u201d\n\nThe letter, in part, also informed the lawmakers of a proposed World Press Conference to be hosted by him Monday 31st January, 2022 at the Executive Hall of the International Conference Centre, Abuja at 11am.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, the Independent National Electoral Commission has announced the time table for the conduct of 2023 general election, including that of the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith elections drawing nearer as the days go by, our citizens are concerned about the quality of persons to run the affairs of our nation, one who can address some of their major concerns.\n\n\u201cIt is as a result of these concerns that I wish to hold a world press conference on my intention to run for the office of the President of our dear Nation. I therefore wish to solicit for your prayers as I make known my intention\u201d, he said.\n\nAvailable records show that Okorocha is a 3-time presidential aspirant who made his first outing 20 years ago on the platform of the All Nigeria Peoples Party(ANPP).\n\nHe sought the party\u2019s ticket alongside Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, Chief Nnia Nwodo and Chief Harry Akande.\n\nIn 2007, he ran on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) coming second to late President Umar Musa Yar\u2019adua in a contest that also had Prof Jerry Gana, Gen. Mohammed Gusau and Gen. Buba Marwa.\n\nSaraki too\n\nSimilarly, former Senate President Bukola Saraki has indicated interest to contest the 2023 presidency.\n\nHis declaration is coming after former National Leader of the All Progressives Congress Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Ebonyi Governor Dave Umahi, Senate Chip Whip Orji Kalu and former Imo Governor Rochas Okorocha declared a similar interest.\n\nThe two-term governor said he has a strong record of delivering and experience in making tough decisions.\n\nBorn December 19, 1962,? Saraki is the son of Second Republic Senator, late Olusola Saraki.\n\n\u201cAs we prepare for the journey ahead, I hope we can all join hands to get the ticket of our great party, PDP, and build a nation that works for all of us.\n\n\u201cJoin me to make our communities safer and provide real opportunities for you and your families.

It is a big setback but we will not relent.\n\n\u201cWe are reiterating our appeal for recourse to the law and avoidance of generalisations. These killings and counter killings are unjustifiable,\u201d he said.\n\nGiving the figure, Aruwan said: \u201cFor instance in 2020, 114 citizens were killed in Zangon Kataf and 28 in Kauru, and in 2021, 186 were killed in Zangon Kataf and 59 in Kauru, and if you put the figures, we lost 387 people in these two councils. In 2021, 100 citizens \u2018incurred\u2019 gunshot injuries in the two councils, 77 in Zangon Kataf and 23 in Kauru.\n\n\u201cThis is aside houses and settlements burnt, farms destroyed, cattle killed and collapse of the rural economy affecting all the communities.\n\n\u201cWe must rise to the occasion and put a stop to all these challenges, arising from the behaviour of a few elements on all sides. Let us reason together and avert this needless bloodshed.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, member House of Representatives for Zangon Kataf/Jaba Federal Constituency, Amos Magaji, supported the appeal for a recourse to the law and campaign for peace in the areas.\n\nIn their separate remarks, the Agwatyap, Dominic Yahaya, and Res-Tsam (Chief of Chawai), Yahaya Mohammed, pledged their support for the drive for sustainable peace and development in the areas.\n\nAlso speaking at the meeting, Chairman of Zangon Kataf local government area, Francis Sani, and his Kauru counterpart, Bashir Dawaki, also commended Governor El-Rufai \u201cfor dispatching a high-powered delegation to the areas following recent killings and counter killings.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Commander Sector 7 of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) Tony Opurum expressed concern over the incessant killings and lawlessness in the areas.\n\nOpurum, an army colonel, said the military would continue to work hard in containing threats to peace in the areas.\n\nSimilarly, Area Commander Kafanchan Police Area Command Danladi Ibrahim said: \u201cThe Police will continue to be neutral and prosecute anyone found guilty.\u201d\n\nThe meeting ended with all sides agreeing to deepen the campaign for peace and continue the engagements in all communities.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the participants appealed to the state government to resolve the land tussle lingering in Zangon Kataf since the 1992 crisis.\n\nThe Kaduna state government thanked the Center for Democracy and Development (CDD) for accepting to organise peace and security engagements in the two local government areas beginning from February 2022.\n\nACF fumes\n\nMeanwhile, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has expressed worries over the incessant killings of innocent citizens in the North, noting that from civilisation, Nigeria was fast returning to barbarism.\n\nACF National Chairman Chief Audu Ogbeh made the remark Wednesday while addressing its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Kaduna.\n\nOn the recent killing of five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar in Kano, the setting ablaze of 20 passengers in Sokoto and reported cases of bullying and sodomy in schools across the country, he said Nigeria cannot afford to return to barbarism after civilisation.\n\nHe said the APC would support a presidential candidate for the forthcoming 2023 presidential election, who has the capacity to move Nigeria out of the present security and economic challenges currently facing the nation.\n\nHe said the Forum would meet with their counterparts from other regions, like Afenifere, Ohanaeze, South South People Movement to discuss on peace building and consensus among the various regions.\n\n\u201cWe are having experiences which are very scary, a five-year-old girl killed by a school proprietor in Kano, 20 people were locked in a vehicle in Sokoto and set ablaze. It is a terrible thing. We appealed to proprietors of schools and government to take measures to stop these heinous crimes in our schools.\n\n\u201cHorrible things are happening even in government schools and military institutions. Many bad things are happening, bullying, sodomy all kinds of things are rumoured. Government must try very hard to bring order to these schools. We are very concerned about these developments, our country cannot return to barbarism after experiencing civilization.\n\n\u201cThere are economic challenges everywhere, people are finding it difficult to feed their family, kidnapping along highways, relentless criminalities. Farmers cannot go to their farms to harvest their crop, they have to pay taxes to be allowed to harvest their crops and farming is our main occupation in the North.\n\n\u201cWe are in a very delicate period; it is for these reasons that we are not having too many meetings because we don\u2019t want anybody coming for these meetings to be affected on the highways.\n\n\u201cThe 2023 election is on the way, people would meet you and ask if ACF is endorsing anyone or if ACF is supporting anyone, make it clear to them that we are not political parties, that the parties have not told us their candidates yet. After the candidates are picked by their parties, they will come to talk to us, they will give us their agenda, then we will know who to support.\n\n\u201cWe are not a political party but we hope we will get a good person who will lead Nigeria out of the circumstances in which we found ourselves. We have not had it this bad and it should not continue for too long.\n\n\u201cWe commend the Governor of Kaduna state for the wonderful job he is doing trying to change a semi rural town to a semi urban state. We also commend the Governor of Kano state for closing down that school and revoking the licenses of other private schools.\n\n\u201cWe are meeting with our counterparts from other regions, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, South South People Movement to discuss with them on building peace and consensus among the various regions. We have not held these meetings yet due to few obstacles. We need to appeal for peace and understanding to stop abusing and quarrelling with each other which does not make any sense and does not stand well for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cShould there be chaos here, where do we go as refugees? Refugees don\u2019t carry more than Ghana must go bag, you don\u2019t carry your car, your Television set, your microwave. We don\u2019t want chaos to take place,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Sadio Mane scored as Senegal beat nine-man Cape Verde 2-0 in the last 16 at the Africa Cup of Nations, but was immediately forced off with concussion.\n\nMane curled in off the underside of the crossbar soon after keeper Vozinha had been dismissed over a nasty clash of heads with the Liverpool forward.\n\nMane continued despite appearing to be briefly knocked out in the incident.\n\nAfter celebrating his goal he lay down on halfway, and before the game restarted he was led off the field.\n\nCape Verde midfielder Patrick Andrade had been shown a straight red card midway through the first half, while Bamba Dieng added Senegal\u2019s second in second-half injury time.\n\nThe match in Bafoussam was preceded by a minute\u2019s silence for the victims of the crush at the Olembe Stadium on Monday.\n\nSenegal will face either Mali or Equatorial Guinea in the last eight on Sunday.\n\nTournament organisers the Confederation of African Football may have questions to answer about their concussion protocols after Vozinha and Liverpool striker Mane were both floored in the 53rd minute.\n\nThe Cape Verde keeper rushed out of his box in an attempt to intercept a long kick downfield by Senegal keeper Edouard Mendy, and collided head-first at pace with Mane, who had got to the ball first and headed forward.\n\nAfter a lengthy stoppage a clearly groggy Vozinha was about to be substituted but, following a video assistant referee review, deserved to receive Cape Verde\u2019s second red card for his reckless challenge.\n\nSomehow Mane was deemed fit to continue and, after having a shot saved by substitute keeper Marcio Rosa, the forward then broke the deadlock from the resulting corner.\n\nSenegal manager Aliou Cisse said Mane had been taken to hospital following the game.\n\n\u201cHe felt faint, his head was spinning and he had to go there,\u201d said Cisse.\n\nMane later posted a picture from his hospital bed of himself and Vozinha on his Instagram account, adding that everything was well.\n\nMane\u2019s head clash was really uncomfortable to watch. It was clear that the Liverpool forward was knocked out as he fell and hit his head again on the turf \u2013 he looked like a defeated boxer.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cape Verde keeper couldn\u2019t walk straight before being ushered away by his team-mates following his red card.\n\nBut it\u2019s the aftermath that raises questions. Why wasn\u2019t Mane substituted straight away?\n\nYes, he scored not long after the collision but the decision not to take him off looked even more unwise when he laid down on the pitch following his goal and clearly looked in distress, before eventually being replaced.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a good look and you just hope Mane is OK.\n\nMore red cards in knock-out stages\n\nSenegal had topped their group despite scoring once in just three matches, and spurned several more chances in front of goal.\n\nMane hit the right-hand upright in the first minute, and the Teranga Lions had a man advantage 20 minutes later when Andrade was dismissed following a VAR consultation.\n\nHe had caught Pape Gueye on the top of the ankle with his studs and his initial yellow was upgraded to red, meaning all five last-16 ties at the tournament have had at least one sending-off.\n\nTwo men down, Cape Verde had few forays forward and Julio Tavares had their best chance with five minutes left but tamely flicked a cross straight at Mendy.\n\nDieng, who had earlier sent two attempts wide, wrapped up the game from a counter-attack as the islanders pushed for a late equaliser.\n\nSenegal were runners-up in 2019 and remain among the favourites to win the Nations Cup, but coach Aliou Cisse will need further improvements in the final third if the West Africans are to lift the trophy for the first time.",

          "title": "US Could Sanction Putin Personally If Russia Invades Ukraine, Biden Says",
          "text": "US President Joe Biden says he would consider personal sanctions on Vladimir Putin if Russia invades Ukraine.\n\nMr Biden said there would be \u201cenormous consequences\u201d for the world if Russia made a move on the nation, which sits on its south-western border.\n\nHis comments came as other Western leaders repeated warnings that Russia would pay a heavy price for invasion.\n\nRussia has accused the US and others of \u201cescalating tensions\u201d over the issue and denies planning to enter Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Moscow has deployed an estimated 100,000 soldiers near the border.\n\nThe Kremlin has said it sees the Western military alliance Nato as a security threat, and is demanding legal guarantees that it will not add new members further east, including neighbouring Ukraine. But the US has said the issue at stake is Russian aggression, not Nato expansion.\n\nFears of invasion have prompted Western embassies in Kyiv to withdraw some personnel.\n\nDiplomats from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France will gather in Paris on Wednesday for talks about the ongoing tensions.\n\nTaking questions from reporters on Tuesday, Mr Biden replied \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether he could see himself imposing sanctions on the Russian president personally in the event of an invasion.\n\nSuch a move across Ukraine\u2019s border would mean \u201cenormous consequences worldwide\u201d and could amount to \u201cthe largest invasion since World War Two\u201d, he said.\n\nIn the past the US has imposed sanctions on foreign leaders including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Venezuela\u2019s Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Measures included blocking property and transactions related to the leaders\u2019 respective countries.\n\nMr Biden added that he would feel obliged to beef up Nato\u2019s presence in eastern Europe if Russia invaded. But he repeated that there were no plans to send US troops to Ukraine itself.\n\nOn Wednesday UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss echoed Mr Biden\u2019s words, telling the BBC\u2019s Today programme that the government has \u201cruled nothing out\u201d \u2013 including sanctions against the Russian leader \u2013 and said the UK is looking to \u201ctoughen up\u201d its sanctions on people, banks and businesses.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is that all of our allies do the same. It is by collective action. By showing Putin we\u2019re united, we will help deter a Russian incursion,\u201d she said.\n\nRussia responded angrily to Mr Biden\u2019s remarks. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the Russian parliament, posted on social media site Telegram: \u201cFinally, the US leadership has openly said what it wants: Washington wants a loyal Russian president.\u201d\n\nThe country has also accused the US and NATO of \u201cflooding\u201d Ukraine with weapons and Western advisers.\n\nThe US has already put 8,500 combat-ready troops on alert to deploy at short notice \u2013 partly to help reinforce Nato allies \u2013 which Russia said caused it \u201cgreat concern\u201d.\n\nWashington has also warned Russian ally Belarus that it would \u201cface a swift and decisive response\u201d if it assists in an invasion.\n\nDuring crisis talks on Monday, Western powers agreed to \u201cunprecedented\u201d sanctions against Russia if it were to invade.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday that the Western allies would respond to any incursion with \u201csevere\u201d economic sanctions, adding that Britain was prepared to deploy troops to protect Nato allies in the region.\n\nHe raised the issue of banning Russia from the Swift international payments system, a move which senior Russian officials said meant Europe would not be able to pay for and receive Russian products.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said dialogue with Moscow would continue.\n\nHe would speak by phone to Mr Putin on Friday, he added, and seek clarification about Russia\u2019s intentions towards Ukraine.\n\nSeparately, Mr Biden\u2019s administration said it was working with oil and gas suppliers around the world to boost shipments to Europe in the event of Russia cutting off supplies, the New York Times reports.\n\nRussia currently provides about one-third of the crude oil and gas imported by the European Union.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tried to reassure his nation in a TV address on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere are no rose-coloured glasses, no childish illusions, everything is not simple\u2026 But there is hope,\u201d he said. \u201cProtect your body from viruses, your brain from lies, your heart from panic.\u201d\n\nRussia seized Ukrainian territory before, when it annexed Crimea in 2014. After Russian forces seized control, Crimea voted to join Russia in a referendum the West and Ukraine deemed illegal.\n\nRussian-backed rebels also control areas of eastern Ukraine near Russia\u2019s borders. That conflict has cost an estimated 14,000 lives, with a 2015 peace deal a long way from being fulfilled.",
