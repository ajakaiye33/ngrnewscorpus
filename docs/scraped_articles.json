          "text": "The Lagos State High Court on Monday dismissed the discharge application of a Dane, Peter Nielsen, accused of murdering Nigerian singer, Zainab Nielsen, and her three-year-old daughter, Petra.\n\nPUNCH Metro had reported that Peter, 53, allegedly murdered Zainab and Petra at the family\u2019s residence at the Ocean Parade, Banana Island, Lagos, on April 5, 2018.\n\nZainab\u2019s younger sister, Gift, reported to the facility manager of the estate that Zainab was being assaulted by Peter.\n\nThe 13-year-old, who lived with the family, reportedly told the manager, Mr Kunle Kukoyi, that she heard her sister crying around 4am.\n\nThe manager was said to have reported to the police at the Ikoyi division and the team that was dispatched to the house around 11am found Zainab and her daughter dead.\n\nDuring the trial at the state High Court in Igbosere, the court admitted the nightgown worn by Zainab and the pyjamas worn by Petra as evidence.\n\nA forensic scientist told the court that Peter\u2019s DNA profile matched that of the male DNA samples found on the nightgown worn by Zainab and the pyjamas worn by Petra.\n\nHowever, Peter\u2019s counsel, Olasupo Shasore (SAN), filed an application for the production of the nightgown for another DNA testing, but the court could not produce the exhibit as a result of the burning of the court during the #EndSARS protest.\n\nDue to the failure of the court to produce the gown, Shasore on Monday urged the court to free the defendant, saying the relevant exhibit was missing.\n\nResponding, the prosecutor, Jonathan Ogunsanya, urged the court to dismiss the application, saying there was other evidence before the court to determine the case.\n\nJustice Bolanle Okikiolu-Ighile, who held that the submission of the defendant\u2019s counsel was premature, dismissed the application.\n\nShe said, \u201cBoth the prosecution and defence have called several witnesses and tendered several exhibits, which are not premised on exhibit PWN. Therefore, at the end of the proceedings, when all the evidence has been given and final written addresses adopted, the court will evaluate the totality of all the evidence before it.

          "text": "Business owners, residents and motorists in Arepo, in the Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State are in despair over the road construction which they say has grounded business activities in the community.\n\nPUNCH Metro learnt that no fewer than 22 houses were negatively impacted by the construction, while three were on the brink of collapse.\n\nOur correspondent, who visited the community on Sunday, observed that the construction, which covered the main access road, also resulted in traffic congestion.\n\nExcavation of some parts of the community, especially from the Integral Mart Supermarket to the Arepo Central Mosque, shut out many residents from their houses, making vehicular entry and exit impossible.\n\nA motorist, Peter Abodurin, told PUNCH Metro that the planning of the road excavation lacked professional input.\n\nAbodurin said, \u201cWe are happy that we are having a road, but what we are concerned about is the negative impact it\u2019s having on residents and businesses. We believe that the road excavation lacks professional inputs because some of us have been denied access to our premises and businesses. We have lost customers who cannot access our facilities because the depth of the excavation is beyond normal.\n\n\u201cWe are at least seven feet down from the former planning. The contractor did not consider the topography of Arepo before starting the work. We want the government to review this section such that the upland area doesn\u2019t have the same drainage as the lowland. Infrastructure should be an addition to us, not to take away from us.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said power had been out in some parts of the community for two weeks, adding that the Internet was unstable because of the destruction of telecommunication cables during the excavation.\n\n\u201cProfessionals have looked at it and said the excavation is an engineering mistake. I usually move my cars out when they (construction workers) come, but I was not informed when they excavated my driveway. I just came to see that I could not access my house or drive my car in again; no one told me anything. A lot of cars are still stuck in people\u2019s compounds. People have to start constructing their own way to access their property.\n\n\u201cWe believe that only the government can correct this error. They want to still excavate our houses to level the ground and we can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nThe Manager of Integral Mart Supermarket, Sunday Abioro, told PUNCH Metro that the excavation had negatively impacted his business.\n\nHe said customers on the left side of the road could not access the supermarket because they could not freely enter and exit their houses.\n\nAnother resident and business owner, who identified himself only as Segun, said 22 houses were affected, adding that three of them, including a radio station, were about to collapse.\n\n\u201cThe design and competence of the contractor are questionable. The community has engaged the contractor and construction company manager, but they haven\u2019t done anything about the situation.\n\n\u201cYesterday, a baby having convulsion was put on a motorcycle to the hospital. The baby, the mother and the motorcyclist fell into a ditch. Another person with oxygen being rushed to Abeokuta for medical treatment was stuck on the bad road,\u201d he added.\n\nA commuter, Razak Alabi, told PUNCH Metro that traffic congestion in the area was unbearable, saying the contractor did not create alternative routes for vehicles.\n\nThe Ogun State Commissioner for Works, Ade Akinsanya, said he was not aware of the excavation, adding that if there were any challenges, a committee set up in the community would have spoken to the government.\n\nHe said, \u201cI have been to the area a couple of times and I have an engineer on the site. The residents appointed a committee to liaise with the government on their behalf and if there is an issue, they would have brought it to our attention. Construction is a continuous process; we will put a slab over the drainage for easy access.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of the Arepo Community Development Council, who identified himself only as Kassim, told PUNCH Metro that the committee had yet to receive any complaints on the excavation.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have asked aggrieved residents to write so we can take their issues to the government, but we haven\u2019t received any letter. The only letter we received was from a CDA which pleaded with us to facilitate the contractor to put things in place so as to stop the use of their road as an alternative route.\n\n\u201cThere is a committee chosen by the CDC that liaises with the government and they are experts. The governor also told those who need to be compensated to bring their documents. \u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Johnbosco Agbakwuru \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, has felicitated with Muslims in the country as they celebrate the Eid-el-Kabir.\n\nThe NLC in a statement issued by its President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, in Abuja, Monday also reminded workers to be conscious of the ravaging Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cOn behalf of the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress, I extend very hearty felicitation with the Muslim Umma all over the world especially Nigerian Muslims and workers on the occasion of this year\u2019s Eid-el-Kabir celebration.\n\n\u201cThe celebration of this year\u2019s Eid-el-Kabir reminds us of the mercies and benevolence of Allah.\n\n\u201cEid-el-Kabir is very significant in the life of every Muslim due to the virtues and values that it conveys. The celebration of Eid-el-Kabir reminds us of the loving provision and sacrifice of Almighty Allah which has continued to sustain humanity.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to imagine what would have been the lot of Ibrahim and Ismail if the Almighty Allah the most beneficent and most merciful did not provide a substitute lamb at the mountain of sacrifice.\n\n\u201cIndeed, there would be no Eid-el-Kabir without the substitute lamb.\n\n\u201cWhat would life be without the loving sacrifice of workers? In the spirit of Eid-el-Kabir, workers have sacrificed the pursuit of personal wealth, fame and luxury in order to serve humanity.\n\n\u201cIt is not for want of alternative choices that many workers choose to serve.\n\n\u201cWorkers work in response to the divine call to be the productive wheels of the human population. In the course of turning the wheels of productivity, workers sacrifice a lot.\n\n\u201cThe relevance of work and the role of workers in sustaining humanity is best exemplified by the response of the working-class population in confronting the challenge of COVID-19 which has ravaged the planet for the past two years.\n\n\u201cJust imagine the fate of humanity in the hands of the novel coronavirus disease if there were no nurses, doctors, environmental health inspectors, morticians, laboratory scientists, drivers, pilots, airport workers, maritime workers, cleaners, agricultural workers, civil servants, law enforcement officers and market men and women.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for the hardworking men and women of our country and the world who were used and are still being used by Almighty Allah to keep the wheels of productivity and life going.\n\n\u201cWe celebrate our frontline workers who sacrificed personal comfort, safety and in many cases their own lives just to be of service to humanity and to keep the rest of the population safe from the fangs of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cTo the workers who paid the ultimate price in the course of service to humanity, we assure you that your sacrifice of love and devotion will never never be forgotten\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the Sallah this year, we must all be mindful of the prevalence of the third wave of COVID-19 which has afflicted many countries of the world with the very virulent Delta variant. We urge all citizens and workers to be on the guard and take necessary precautions.\n\nALSO READ: Gunmen kidnap medical doctor in Kogi\n\n\u201cWe implore our dutiful frontline workers not to let down their guard.\n\n\u201cWe urge them to continue to religiously observe all the COVID-19 handling and treatment protocols. We need you alive and well to keep making sacrifices.\n\n\u201cWe urge government at every level in Nigeria to prioritize a human-centred approach and built-up resilience to the COVID-19 insurgence.\n\n\u201cAs we go through the blizzard of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is need for stronger commitment to social protection and welfare benefits for the most vulnerable in our society especially workers, the unemployed, women, young persons, the disabled and the aged.\n\n\u201cIt is the duty of our government to ensure that the impact of COVID-19 leaves no one behind.\n\n\u201cElected political office holders, administrators in the bureaucracy and employers in the private sector must not forget the sacrifice by workers. So many times, the labour and sacrifice of workers are held in contempt by those who should appreciate them.\n\n\u201cEmployers hold workers in contempt and trample upon the sacrifice they make when they owe workers arrears of salaries and deny them the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cEmployers scorn and dismiss the labour of the working class as scotched toil when workers are denied the right to benefit from the dividends of their own investment in productivity.\n\n\u201cIn recent times we have witnessed increasing waves of hostility, scorn and contempt on the labour and sacrifice of Nigerian workers by some elected political officeholders.\n\n\u201cDespite earning some of the lowest wages in Africa, Nigerian workers are usually the first to be laid off en masse and at the drop of a hat. We want to use the opportunity of this year\u2019s Eid-el-Kabir to appeal to the conscience of Employers in Nigeria to show some respect for workers\u2019 sacrifice.\n\n\u201cWorkers are not slaves to be used, sapped, and tossed aside. Workers are partners in progress. Our labour moves society forward.\n\n\u201cNigerian workers deserve not just the minimum wage but living wages. We demand wage justice now! State Governors yet to fully implement the national minimum wage and the consequential salary increase belong to the league of politicians who pour contempt and scorn on the sacrifice of Nigerian workers.\n\n\u201cEmployers who deny workers social protection benefits regard workers as no better than slaves. Elected political office holders who believe that paying workers their salaries as when due is a misplaced priority have a misplaced sense of judgement. Such do not deserve our respect.\n\n\u201cOn this Eid-el-Kabir, workers must not wait for any political office holder or employer to confer worth to our sacrifice. We must be confident that our contribution is making a marked difference between life and death, prosperity and poverty, fulfilment and frustration, progression and retrogression, and cohesion and chaos.\n\n\u201cWe must also use this Eid-el Kabir to remember the sacrifice of our soldiers, police officers, and other paramilitary security operatives who toil under the sun and rain, in the bush, jungle, deserts, and mangroves to keep us safe and to keep the corridors of our socio-economic life open for legitimate activities.\n\n\u201cWe must remember those of them whose sacrifice is the ultimate price. We must remember the families they left behind.\n\n\u201cThere is no sacrifice too big to make for peace. We urge the Muslim Ummah to use the occasion of this Sallah to pray for the forgiveness of sin, peace in our country, for the safe return of all victims of hostage-for-ransom all over the country and for prosperity.\n\n\u201cThere can never be development without peace and security.\n\n\u201cWe urge those who feel aggrieved with the State to give peace a chance. We appeal to those who feel wronged by the system to give peace a chance. We implore those who feel short-changed by society to give peace a chance.\n\nREAD ALSO: Anambra guber primary list: APGA faction asks INEC to follow due process\n\n\u201cThose who are just irresponsible and unleashing wickedness on their fellow citizens should remember that their victims are also victims of an unjust system. Government must strengthen security to rein in criminal elements.\n\n\u201cWe will have no country if we all especially workers take out our grievances violently.\n\n\u201cThis is why workers will continue to advocate for social dialogue and conciliation in dealing with social grievances, promoting social cohesion and fostering sustainable development.\n\n\u201cViolence is not excusable. Violence can never be the solution. We call on government to take utmost caution not to criminalize social dialogue.\n\n\u201cSocial dialogue can only be meaningful when every party comes to the table in good faith.\n\n\u201cGovernment being the custodian of the ideals of our collective civilization must embrace social dialogue and with utmost good faith.\n\n\u201cPeaceful protest is a form of social dialogue. Peaceful protesters must not be harassed, humiliated, brutalized, maimed, imprisoned or killed.\n\n\u201cViolent crushing of peaceful protest sends a very dangerous signal that civilization and indeed our shared humanity have failed.\n\n\u201cThe government as the embodiment of our sovereignty must ensure we never get to that point.\n\n\u201cOn this Eid-el-Kabir, we must commend and extend the worthy sacrifice of the Nigerian workforce to all segments of society.\n\n\u201cThe Social Partners, Government, Employers, and Workers must all renew our commitment to making worthy sacrifices towards building a peaceful, prosperous, inclusive, secured, and sustainable society.\n\n\u201cOnce again, we join all our Muslim compatriots in celebrating this year\u2019s Eid-el-Kabir.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "A Federal High Court sitting in Lagos yesterday declined to make an order of status quo ante that would have suspended the local government elections in Lagos scheduled for Saturday, July 24, 2021.\n\nJustice Chukwujekwu Aneke, rather, adjourned till November 29, proceedings in the suit filed by an All Progressives Congress (APC) chairmanship aspirant Raheem Rasaki Alani.\n\nThe judge gave the ruling after upholding the argument of counsel to the Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC), Mr Kemi Pinheiro, SAN.\n\nJoined as first and second defendants/respondents in the suit numbered FHC/L/CS/677/2021 are the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and LASIEC.\n\nAlani is seeking, among others, to restrain INEC from making the register for Lagos\u2019 20 Local Government Areas (LGA) available, arguing that LASIEC ought to conduct the election in accordance with the \u201cconstitutionally-recognised\u201d LGAs in Lagos, and not based on the 57 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) created by the state.\n\nBut Pinheiro has filed a preliminary objection on behalf of LASIEC praying the court to strike out and or dismiss the suit in its entirety.\n\nAt the resumption of proceedings on Monday, some political parties including the African Action Congress (AAC), African Peoples Movement (APM) and BOOT informed the court of their intention to join as plaintiffs.\n\nResponding, Pinheiro prayed the court to adjourn proceedings till after the annual vacation of the court because, among others, the intending parties who said they had filed a notice to join the suit, had yet to serve him and until that was done, the case could not go on\n\nHe argued further that the failure of any party to comply with the law guiding the issue of service would rob the court of jurisdiction to entertain the case because \u201cservice is very fundamental before a case can be properly adjudicated on.\u201d\n\nWhen Alani\u2019s counsel Mr Taiwo Alabi suggested that given the development, it was reasonable that the court should issue an order of status quo ante bellum i.e. parties should stay action until the determination of the case pending in court, Pinheiro opposed him.\n\nHe submitted that Alabi\u2019s offer was a trap \u201cwhich the court must not fall for\u201d adding that the Appeal Court had stated on different occasions that the court should not entertain that type of approach.\n\n\u201cHow can the plaintiff in the face of various applications for joinder filed by different parties which are yet to be served on me, and a motion challenging the jurisdiction of the court from entertaining the case filed by us, be seeking the order of status quo?\n\n\u201cI pray the court to adjourn further proceedings in this case till after the annual vacation of the court which is starting on the 26th of July,\u201d Pinheiro added.\n\nGranting his application, Justice Aneke adjourned till November 29 for the hearing of all applications.\n\nHe advised the plaintiff to approach the vacation judge during vacation.",

          "text": "By Vincent Kalu\n\nThe promoters of Bayelsa Oil Company Ltd with its Joint Ventures Partners, Hardy Oil Nigeria Limited and Century Exploration and Production Limited, have appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene and restore the Atala Oil Field (OML 46) belonging to them.\n\nRecall that the Hon Minister of State for Petroleum and the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) awarded the field to Halkin Exploration and Production Limited without knowledge of the true facts surrounding the development of the Field by the Joint Venture Partners.\n\nIn a press statement signed by the management of Bayelsa Oil Company Ltd, and its Joint Venture Partners, Hardy Oil Nigeria Limited and Century Exploration and Production Limited, the JV debunked newspapers publications that the said oil field was awarded to Halkin Exploration and Production Ltd on grounds of its investment in reviving the Field and transfer of 41% interest of BOCL in the Field to Halkin Exploration and Production Ltd.\n\nThe statement emphasised: \u201cWe restate that the Joint Venture Partners of BOCL \u2013 Hardy Oil Nigeria Limited and Century Exploration and Production Limited are indigenous companies owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs holding 20 percent and 29 per cent stakes, respectively, in the said Marginal Field with a State Enterprise-Bayelsa Oil Company Limited (a company wholly owned by the Bayelsa State Government) as the Operator, holding a controlling 51 per cent stake on behalf of the Bayelsa State Government.\n\nThe JV Partners further stressed that: \u201cIt is pertinent to state here that Atala Marginal Oil field (OML 46) has been developed, crude oil produced and sold from the same field at different stages of test crude production. Royalties on crude oil sold from the field had been paid to the Federal Government severally before the field was revoked under very strange and suspicious circumstances.\n\n\u201cAt present, the Joint Venture Partners have invested massively in bringing the Field into production of Test Crude preparatory to commencement of commercial production. The revocation of the asset has put into jeopardy the entire efforts and resources pumped into the development of the Field by the JV Partners. Most of these funds were secured through loans from banks in respect of which Atala Field (OML 46) Joint Venture Partners are still repaying with huge interest.\n\nIt is against the significant milestones achieved regarding the joint operations at the Atala oil field that full Production Permit was awarded to them by DPR in August, 2018.\n\nThe statement further added: \u201cCurrently, there are about 20,700 barrels of unevaluated crude oil at Atala Field. Consequently, Atala JV Partners executed Crude Handling Agreement (CHA) with Excel Exploration and Production Limited to handle Atala crude, as well as using their pipeline for transporting Atala crude to Shell Petroleum Trans Forcados pipeline. BOCL had also executed Sales and Purchase Agreement with Shell Trading Company in respect of the remaining crude oil at Atalalocation.eld Development Plan (FDP) was submitted to DPR in 2017 and there are ongoing reviews in relation to drilling Atala wells 2, 3, & 4.\n\n\u201cSeveral Community Development Projects executed across the Host Communities. All Royalties and NDA made to date is US $160, 545.18. Logistics support base in Kidney Island, Port Harcourt and Warri. Consistent payment of National Data Registry Fees.\n\n\u201cThe above stated milestones clearly and unequivocally support our position that the revocation of the Atala Marginal Field by DPR was in error and consequently caused to, in league with the other ten revoked Marginal Field Operators, write to Mr. President for a review of the revocation. We understand that the letter was given sympathetic consideration by Mr. President, who remarked, \u2018the ten (10) revoked marginal fields be re awarded on discretionary basis to qualified companies with consideration given to the previous operators of the respective fields subject to the demonstration technical/financial capacity and payment of applicable good and valuable consideration (GVC).\u201d\n\nThe JV Partners denied any investment in the development of the field or revival of the field by Halkin and challenged it to prove its claims of having spent $60,000,000 in reviving the oil field and the purported Farm -in Agreement with her conveying the transfer of 41 per cent of BOCL equity, which it presented to secure the award of the Field in its favour.\n\nThe JV Partners maintained that: \u201cThese claims by Halkin in the Atala Marginal Field is therefore spurious, fraudulent, deceitful and an attempt by the desperate Company and its faceless sponsors, who will soon be unmasked in the fullness of time, to hijack benefits arising from the sweat and hard work of the Atala JV Partners.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From: Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nSpecial counsel to the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafara (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu has expressed concern over the alleged refusal by the Department of State Security Service (DSS) to allow him consent to consular and diplomatic interventions in his trial by the United Kingdom and her High Commission in Nigeria.\n\nThe lawyer, Aloy Ejimakor, in a statement on Monday, lamented that the DSS are tactically delaying the signing of the two forms which he took to Kanu some days ago for his signature.\n\nHe explained that both forms relate to affirming his consent to consular and diplomatic interventions by the United Kingdom and the her High Commission in Nigeria.\n\nEjimakor stated that the implication of the refusal will rather fuel the notion that the government of Nigeria is deliberately isolating Kanu from having consular and diplomatic access to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe statement reads; \u201cLet me make it clear that the day I took the Forms to the DSS, the officers on location were amenable to Kanu signing them until somewhere along the line, they tarried and decided to send it to the legal unit for vetting.\n\nSo, my sense is that it\u2019s the legal unit of the DSS that disapproved of Kanu signing the Forms for reasons that were not given to me.\n\nAs a Lawyer, I don\u2019t see any legal advantage the government of Nigeria stands to gain by blocking Kanu from signing those Forms. The Forms are but a mere routine in matters like this.\n\nInstead of any advantage, the refusal will help fuel the notion that the government of Nigeria is deliberately isolating Kanu from having consular and diplomatic access to the United Kingdom.\n\nIt does not comport with the best traditions of fundamental fairness that a detainee is being denied access to resources that will assist him in his defense. This is one of things that will count in our reckoning as this matter continues to fold.\n\nFor these reasons, I am now compelled to call on the British High Commission in Nigeria to banish every red tape and exert the full weight of its diplomatic clout in gaining immediate access to Kanu. This is especially important, given the prospects of better welfare, including adequate medical care for Mazi Kanu.\n\nFurther, the prompt intervention of the High Commission will mean that Kanu will have another layer of human contact in addition to his legal team who are the only ones currently allowed to see him.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Molly Kilete, Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has given details of how the missing pilot of one of its Alpha Jets which crashed on Sunday while on an operation in Zamfara state, survived the crash.\n\nThe pilot Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, was said to be returning from a successful air interdiction mission between the boundaries of Zamfara and Kaduna State, when he came under intense enemy fire which led to its crash in Zamfara State.\n\nAfter the crash, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, was said successfully ejected from the aircraft but could not make it to a safe haven as he was surrounded by the enemies thus forcing him to remain at a safe location until morning.\n\nNAF Director of Public Relations and Information Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, who made this known in a statement said \u201cOn 18 July 2021, at about 12.45 pm, a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet aircraft, returning from a successful air interdiction mission between the boundaries of Zamfara and Kaduna State, came under intense enemy fire which led to its crash in Zamfara State. Luckily, the gallant pilot of the aircraft, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, successfully ejected from the aircraft. Using his survival instincts, the pilot, who came under intense ground fire from the bandits, was able to evade them and sought refuge in nearby settlements awaiting sunset. Using the cover of darkness and his phone set for navigation, Flight Lieutenant Dairo was able to elude several bandits\u2019 strongholds and maneuvered his way to a Nigerian Army Unit, where he was finally rescued.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that upon receipt of the news of the crash, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, had directed that all efforts must be emplaced to rescue the pilot. Accordingly, NAF Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and helicopter gunships provided close air support to NAF Special Forces and Nigerian Army troops who were able to locate the crash site and the pilot\u2019s parachute, while also combing nearby locations for any sign of the pilot. It is gladdening to note that while in hiding, Flight Lieutenant Dairo confirmed that the presence of NAF aircraft within the vicinity of the crash site helped in scaring the bandits who were after him, thus enabling him to find refuge and escape to a safe location.\n\n\u201cIt is important to also recall that only recently, the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, had directed the Armed Forces of Nigeria to do all it takes to flush out criminal elements in Katsina, Zamfara and Kaduna States. It is in fulfilment of this directive that the NAF, in conjunction with surface forces, has in the last 2 weeks mounted intensive day and night air interdiction operations against bandits and their hideouts, especially in these 3 states. Through these intensive air operations, hundreds of bandits have been neutralized and several of their hideouts destroyed.\n\n\u201cDespite the setback of yesterday\u2019s crash, the NAF remains committed towards fulfilling Mr President\u2019s mandate as well as other constitutional roles assigned to it.

          "title": "OPEC+ Resolves Impasse, to Boost Production by 400,000bpd",
          "text": "*PIB will take care of host oil communities, secure environment, says Buhari\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nAfter over a two-week stalemate, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+, yesterday resolved to gradually add more inventory to the oil market, as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) finally put aside their differences.\n\nWith the new agreement, the oil cartel will boost supply by as much as 400,000 barrels per day each month from August until all of its stranded output due to its decision to curb production last year, following the twin impact of the price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia and COVID-19 pandemic, has been restored.\n\nThe breakthrough came just as President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will take care of agitations by host oil communities and ensure that the environment is protected from harm.\n\nAccording to the new deal, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Kuwait and Russia have now been given new baselines against which their production cuts are measured from May next year.\n\nThe baselines, which were set using October 2018 production volumes, are used by the OPEC+ alliance to set output quotas, so a higher baseline for a country would result in a more generous allocation.\n\nThe UAE had said that the way its quota was calculated was unfair because it didn\u2019t reflect a costly expansion in the country\u2019s industry. Now seemingly convinced by the country\u2019s presentation, the baseline was increased yesterday to 3.5 million barrels per day, below the 3.8 million it initially demanded but well above the previous level of 3.2 million.\n\nOne of the immediate impacts of the new agreement is that it will ease a looming supply shortage and reduce the risk of an inflationary oil-price spike as well as end the division with the OPEC group.\n\nBack home in Nigeria, it is also expected that the truce will lead to some relief for the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), whose Group Managing Director, Mallam Mele Kyari, recently raised the alarm over the rising oil price.\n\nKyari hard warned that a rising oil price was bad for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria since buyers of the nation\u2019s crude would either resort to buying less or start the search for alternatives.\n\nKyari put the oil price band with which Nigeria would be comfortable at between $50 to $60 per barrel. The price of the commodity hit $77 recently before falling to between $73 and rising again to $75 during the last week.\n\nWith certainty now restored to the market, consumers now have a clear line of sight as to how quickly OPEC+ will restore the 5.8 million barrels a day of production it is still withholding.\n\nA statement after the 19th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (ONOMM), held via videoconference, stated that the ongoing strengthening of market fundamentals, with oil demand showing clear signs of improvement as economic recovery has continued in most parts of the world with the help of accelerating vaccination programmes.\n\nOPEC welcomed the positive performance of participating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC), especially their overall conformity to the production adjustments which was out 113 per cent in June.\n\nThe statement said OPEC resolved to \u201cAdjust upward their overall production by 0.4 mb/d on a monthly basis starting August 2021 until phasing out the 5.8 mb/d production adjustment, and in December 2021 assess market developments and participating countries\u2019 performance.\n\n\u201cContinue to adhere to the mechanism to hold monthly OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meetings for the entire duration of the Declaration of Cooperation, to assess market conditions and decide on production level adjustments for the following month, endeavouring to end production adjustments by the end of September 2022, subject to market conditions.\u201d\n\nEffective May 1, 2022, OPEC further agreed to adjust the baseline for the calculations of the production adjustments and reiterated the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and taking advantage of the extension of the compensation period until the end of September 2021 and fixed the next meeting for September 1, 2021.\n\nWhile Nigeria\u2019s reference oil production up to the end of April 2022 and effective May 2022 stayed at 1.829 million barrels per day, countries that had theirs raised included Iraq, which was increased from 4.653 million bpd to 4.803 million bpd, while Kuwait\u2019s was raised from 2.809 million bpd to 2.0959 million bpd.\n\nAlso, Saudi Arabia\u2019s baseline was raised from 11 million bpd to 11. 5 million bpd, UAE had theirs raised from 3.168 million bpd to 3.5 million bpd and Russia\u2019s was put at 11.5 million bpd from 11 million bpd.\n\nBut it is unclear how quickly additional supplies can be delivered to the market as August sales volumes are largely locked in and most Gulf countries are preparing for an Islamic holiday that will close government offices and businesses for most or all of next week.\n\nBuhari: PIB Will Take Care of Host Oil Communities, Secure Environment\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will take care of agitations by host oil communities and ensure that the environment is protected from harm.\n\nIn an exclusive interview in the just-released OPEC bulletin, which was dedicated to Nigeria, the president stated that when it becomes law, the legislation will reinvigorate the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Nigerian oil and gas industry needs reinvigoration in the presence of the global uncertainty and the threats surrounding the industry. This is the purpose of the PIB. We need more investment to be able to derive optimal benefits from these natural resources.\n\n\u201cWe need a better enabling environment for growth in the industry. We need to take better care of the host communities. We need to be more environmentally conscious. And so the PIB is focused on all these, and more.\u201d\n\nHe lauded the oil cartel for the role it has consistently played in the industry, saying that is important because without OPEC the oil industry would have been in a chaotic situation where the winner takes all.\n\nHe added: \u201cMany countries, like Nigeria, would not have been able to develop their oil industry due to stiff competition. However, the good collaboration between OPEC member countries has made it possible to accommodate both the weak and strong players in the oil production industry. This has been very important, and a catalyst, to the development of Nigeria\u2019s oil industry.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the country must constantly look ahead and plan for the future to ensure that it does not get caught off guard, reason it has to keep investing and strengthening its local capability, both in technology and human resources.\n\nHe stated that being a member of OPEC has facilitated closer relationships and fostered bilateral cooperation in other fields and industries as members seek areas where they can be of help to one another.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Presidency Accuses Kukah of Portraying Nigeria in Bad Light Before Foreign Audience",
          "text": "*Accuses Catholic bishop of portraying Nigeria in bad light before foreign audience\n\n*Faults Catholic bishop\u2019s position on state of the nation\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Presidency on Sunday formally responded to the recent position of the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto, Father Matthew Kukah, before the United States Congress that nothing really works in Nigeria saying the cleric\u2019s position is an incredible falsehood.\n\nIt also described as unfortunate and disappointing the position of the \u201cso-called\u201d man of God painting his country in bad light before a foreign parliament.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a release, stated that it was unfortunate, and disappointing, for citizens of Nigeria to bear witness to one of their Churchmen castigating their country in front of representatives of a foreign parliament.\n\nThe Presidency said it was familiar with overseas political tours that opposition politicians take \u2013 visiting foreign leaders and legislators in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe saying the argument goes that if they are heard seriously abroad, then Nigerian citizens back home should surely listen to them too.\n\nIt said: \u201cBut in order to be heard at all, and to maximise media coverage back home for their activities, inevitably these visits involve painting the worst possible picture of our country before their chosen foreign audience.\n\n\u201cSoon enough we inescapably hear an identical list of racist tropes against Northerners, how one religion dominates governance above all others, how the government is doing nothing to address herder-farmer disturbances, and how the government spends money on infrastructure to benefit everyone but the group and religion of the speaker. Of course, in order not to disappoint their western audience, regardless of fact, the list is always the same-and always slanted for whoever wishes to cross-check.\u201d\n\nThe release added that Nigerians expect such position from their unimaginative opposition stressing that it is troubling when a \u201cso-called\u201d man of the Church copies the worst excesses of those seeking personal advancement in public office.\n\nThe Presidency also explained steps taken so far by the present administration to tackle the issue of herder-farmer disturbances saying \u201conly this government has put forward the first and singular plan in nearly a century to address herder-farmer challenges \u2013 a fact recognised by international NGOs, including the International Crisis Group\u201d.\n\nIt further punctured Kukah\u2019s position that the Buhari-led government had done nothing in six years.\n\n\u201cTo declare to a foreign audience that this government does nothing is an incredible falsehood\u201d.\n\nRather than the investment in infrastructure between Nigeria and Niger being wasteful and biased as erroneously said by Kukah, the Presidency stressed that a similar infrastructure project between Lagos and Benin has revolutionised the two neighbouring economies to the advantage of both countries.\n\nIt emphasised that there is religious balancing in government appointments notwithstanding that the 1999 Constitution never stipulated ethnic or religious leaning in appointments into public office\n\n\u201cThere is no bias in this government when the president is northern and Muslim, the vice president southern and Christian, and the cabinet equally balanced between the two religions. But neither is there anything in our Constitution to state that political posts must be apportioned according to ethnicity or faith. It takes a warped frame of mind for a critic to believe ethnicity is of primary importance in public appointments. It is yet more troubling to hear a Churchman isolating one group for criticism purely on ethnic lines\u201d.\n\nThe Presidency further punctured Kukah\u2019s position that only Christian schools were being attacked by bandits and terrorists saying it is untrue as both Christian and Muslim schools had suffered in the past in the hands of the terrorists and bandits.\n\nIt said: \u201cWith due respect to the esteemed position he holds, the Bishop\u2019s assertion that only Christian schools are being targeted by bandits or terrorists is not supported by the facts on the ground. It is sad to say but also true that victims of crime, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism cut across all strata of the society. Sad but true that Kankara students in Katsina State were stolen by bandits of the same Islamic faith as those they took away. The same may be true of those who are still holding the 134 students of the Islamic School at Tegina in Niger State. The nation witnessed the sad incident of the female students abducted by bandits at Jangebe in Zamfara State and the over 100 predominantly Muslim students of the Federal Government Girls College Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State who are currently in captivity- and the nation\u2019s security agencies are hard at work to release them unharmed.\n\n\u201cThe attack on Christian students is sad and unacceptable; so also is the abduction of students of other faiths. The claim that only Christian schools are being targeted is totally untrue.\n\n\u201cAs a nation and a people, we must together define evil as evil. We must not allow our religious differences to divide us. No one gains but the evil doers when we divide our ranks according to ethnicity and religion in confronting them. The bandit, kidnapper and terrorist are the enemies of the people who should be confronted in unison.\u201d\n\nThe statement also quoted copiously from the Bible to support its claim on ethnicity and racialism\n\n\u201cTo be clear, The Bible is definitive on matters of ethnicity and racialism: In Romans 2:9-10, it says: \u201cThere will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; but glory, honour and peace for everyone who does good\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd in Galatians 3:28: \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d Whether Christian or Muslim, we stand by these beliefs and are steadfastly committed to them in governance\u201d.\n\nThe Presidency used the forum to be hard on the cleric for disparaging Nigeria before a foreign audience saying \u201cthere is no place in mainstream civil discourse for those who actively, negatively, and publicly label an individual ethnic group, especially before a foreign audience.\n\n\u201cThese are not the views expressed or opinions held by the vast majority of the citizens of Nigeria. For all our challenges as a nation, nearly all of us seek to live together in harmony, celebrating differences, and finding common ground as Nigerians above all. But people like Kukah are doing their best to sow discord and strife among Nigerians.\n\n\u201cMore than any other set of people, leaders \u2013 in politics or religion who preach respect for truth have a duty to practice it. It is a moral and practical responsibility.\n\n\u201cGoing by the history of the Church as is well known, it will stand up publicly for the truth.\n\nIt is time others did the same.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It is clinically similar to a pericardial effusion, and, depending on the volume and rapidity with which it develops, may cause cardiac tamponade.\n\nAgitators for Yoruba self-determination had on July 3 gathered at the Gani Fawehinmi Park in Ojota amid the presence of armed policemen and soldiers.\n\nThis was after the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, had addressed newsmen at the venue, where he announced that no rally is allowed in the state. See Also Police Yoruba Nation Rally: 14-year-old Girl Killed By Stray Bullet In Lagos\n\nHowever, his announcement was set aside by the agitators who flaunted their banners and chanted all sorts of slogans to express their determination towards the breakaway of the Yoruba group from Nigeria.\n\nThis displeased the security operatives at the venue who fired teargas canisters and used water cannons to disperse the crowd.\n\nThis didn\u2019t deter the agitators who returned to their converging point and carried on from where they left off.\n\nThe next action from the security operatives had everyone at the rally scampering to safety as gunshots sounded from different directions.

          "text": "An autopsy conducted on a young girl, Jumoke Oyeleke, who was hit by a stray bullet during the Yoruba Nation rally in Lagos has been obtained by SaharaReporters.\n\nAccording to the autopsy signed by Dr SS Soyemi of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, Jumoke\u2019s death was caused by \u201cHaemopericardium, disruption of the heart and lungs and missile injury to the chest.\u201d\n\nHemopericardium refers to blood in the pericardial sac of the heart. It is clinically similar to a pericardial effusion, and, depending on the volume and rapidity with which it develops, may cause cardiac tamponade.\n\nAgitators for Yoruba self-determination had on July 3 gathered at the Gani Fawehinmi Park in Ojota amid the presence of armed policemen and soldiers.\n\nThis was after the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, had addressed newsmen at the venue, where he announced that no rally is allowed in the state. See Also Police Yoruba Nation Rally: 14-year-old Girl Killed By Stray Bullet In Lagos\n\nHowever, his announcement was set aside by the agitators who flaunted their banners and chanted all sorts of slogans to express their determination towards the breakaway of the Yoruba group from Nigeria.\n\nThis displeased the security operatives at the venue who fired teargas canisters and used water cannons to disperse the crowd.\n\nThis didn\u2019t deter the agitators who returned to their converging point and carried on from where they left off.\n\nThe next action from the security operatives had everyone at the rally scampering to safety as gunshots sounded from different directions.

See Also Breaking News BREAKING: Yoruba Nation Agitators Protest Department Of State Services' Invasion Of Igboho\u2019s Residence In Ibadan\n\nThe 12 persons are; Abdullateef Ofeyagbe, Amoda Babatunde (Aka Lady K), Tajudeen Erinoyen, Diakola Ademola, Abideen Shittu, and Jamiu Noah.\n\nOthers are Ayobami Donald, Adelabe Usman, Oluwafelumi Kunle, Raji Kazeem, Taiwo Opeyemi and Bamidele Sunday.\n\nThe defendants are the Director-General, State Security Service (SSS), also known as the Department of State Services (DSS) and the DSS.

We are optimistic that we will get another short date since we are not certain the matter will proceed for hearing that day, however we will follow up.\n\n\u201cThe matter should have been heard by now, but we are surprised that it took too long for us to get a response from the assigned court despite filing affidavits of extreme urgency. We are glad the matter is now in Court 9 and we are hopeful of having a good day in court soon.\u201d",

          "text": "The Pasteur Institute in Senegal will produce rapid antigen tests for diagnosing the coronavirus disease from early 2022 with the help of a new tech transfer agreement.\n\nThe Dakar-based centre is partnering with Bionote, a South Korean company that provides diagnostic solutions for Covid-19, and Mologic, a British biotech company set to be acquired by a Bill Gates-backed consortium.\n\nAn antigen test is regarded as a suitable \u2018first line of defense\u2019 against the coronavirus disease for individuals who have symptoms. It is a simpler and quicker procedure compared to other approaches like PCR testing.\n\nA typical antigen testing takes around 15 minutes to determine whether a patient is infected, although it is less accurate than PCR, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe agreement between Pasteur and the companies was disclosed in a statement from two international health agencies, UNITAID and FIND, a global alliance for diagnostics, as reported by Reuters.\n\n\u201cHigh-quality antigen tests are the primary diagnostic tool for detecting active infection in poorer settings where molecular testing is not available,\u201d the statement read.\n\nUnder the deal, the technology and expertise for making the Covid tests will be passed from the foreign pharmaceutical giants to Pasteur\u2019s DiaTROPIX, a diagnostic test production unit launched in November. The goal is to boost Covid detection in Africa.\n\n\u201cExpanded production capacity in local and regional hubs is critical to ensuring that healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries can implement effective testing strategies to contain the spread of the virus,\u201d UNITAID spokesman Herve Verhoosel, said.\n\nDiaTROPIX will seek regulatory approval in Senegal for the tests transferred from Mologic and Bionote and commercialise them under its own brand. It plans to make 2.5 million tests per month in 2022, according to the statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnprecedented surge in infections\n\nCompared to its regional peers like South Africa and Nigeria, Senegal has seen fewer coronavirus-related cases and deaths.\n\nDakar has so far recorded more than 52,000 infections and 1,220 deaths since the outbreak started. The numbers pale in comparison to South Africa\u2019s (2.24 million infections and 65,000+ deaths) and Nigeria\u2019s (169,000+ infections and 2,000+ deaths).\n\nHowever, the rapid antigen test deal involving the Pasteur Institute comes at a time when Senegal is grappling with soaring coronavirus cases.\n\nAccording to health ministry spokesman Mamadou Ndiaye, the West African nation was seeing an \u201cunprecedented\u201d surge in Covid infections. He said this after a new daily record of 733 cases was recorded, beating the previous record of 529 cases.\n\nMore than 25% of the 2,854 tests carried out in the past 24 hours to Wednesday came back positive, according to Ndiaye.\n\nVaccinations have been slow, making Senegal vulnerable to fresh surges. Out of over 16 million people, only 590,969 have been vaccinated. Senegal lacks enough doses to vaccinate everyone, like most African countries.\n\nSenegalese authorities are expecting 165,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine and 300,000 doses of China\u2019s Sinopharm shots, Ndiaye said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Telecommunications infrastructure owned by several mobile network operators was severely damaged in the rampant looting and destruction of property that rocked South Africa last week.\n\nThe Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) revealed on Tuesday, July 13, that the vandalism included more than 100 mobile network towers in some parts of the country.\n\nAfter the statement, rioters destroyed many more mobile sites, according to multiple reports. Virtually all network providers operating in South Africa reported disruption to service delivery.\n\nMTN alone reported damage to over 100 of its base stations which the company\u2019s technicians could not safely reach the sites to repair.\n\n\u201cOver 1,000 MTN employees can\u2019t get to work, and millions of calls and queries from our customers cannot be attended to, as our primary call centre remains inaccessible,\u201d MTN South Africa chief executive, Godfrey Motsa, said Friday.\n\nAccording to Vodacom spokesperson, Byron Kennedy, there was a connectivity issue that affected customers in many parts of the country. Like MTN, the crisis prevented its staff from fixing a fault in its infrastructure.\n\n\u201cUnrest in these areas meant that it wasn\u2019t safe for technicians to immediately visit affected sites physically to remedy faults,\u201d Kennedy was quoted as saying by MyBroadband. An estimated five to ten of Vodacom\u2019s base stations at malls were also damaged by fires.\n\nData-only operator Rain, which has a lease agreement for using Vodacom\u2019s network towers, also said it has sites in the affected areas that had been vandalised and were down. The network provider operates in South Africa\u2019s major metropolitan areas with 3,000 towers.\n\nChildren are evacuated from a burning building in downtown Durban, South Africa. Image credit: AP via NZHerald\n\nOnly Cell C\u2019s facilities had not experienced significant damage from the unrest as of Friday, according to its chief operations officer Andre Ittman.\n\nJust one of its network towers was vandalised within the Durban area but it did not affect service delivery to consumers.\n\nAccording to Ittman, there are six other sites available within a two-kilometre radius of the damaged site, which helped to absorb the coverage provided to ensure customers stayed connected.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe ongoing unrest in South Africa, said to be the worst since the end of the apartheid regime 27 years ago, was sparked by the imprisonment of former president Jacob Zuma.\n\nLast month, the ex-leader was sentenced to 15 months jail time for defying an order to provide evidence at a judicial inquiry set up to probe high-level corruption during his nine-year tenure (from 2009 \u2013 2018).\n\nProtests swiftly degenerated into violent marches and looting. Hundreds of businesses have been destroyed and more than 200 people have died.\n\nSouth African authorities believe the unrest was deliberately provoked by political opponents to force president Cyril Ramaphosa to pardon Zuma or even step down.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Unique and untapped\n\nFrancophone Africa is home to an island country where many African startups register their headquarters. Two days ago, this country reopened its borders to vaccinated tourists, which may include people founding new companies and seeking a tax-friendly environment.\n\nYes, Mauritius.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, startups and SMEs in francophone Africa received $417.9 million, according to Briter Bridges, a research firm. 89% of that money went to businesses domiciled in Mauritius.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a high-income economy, Mauritius has only about 1 million people which is not a huge market. So where does the real action happen in the region?\n\nWe\u2019ll use Partech Africa\u2019s report on venture capital funding in 2020.\n\nMorocco ($11.2m), Senegal ($8.8m), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire ($6.5m), Algeria ($5.5m) and the Democratic Republic of Congo ($4.6m) are the top five for venture capital funding. Rounding off the region\u2019s top ten are Cameroon, Togo, Tunisia, Benin and Mauritius (startups that operate there, not just domiciled).\n\nThe $52m raised by all ten countries combined is far less than what Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt and Ghana raised.\n\n\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nThis is where I clarify that Partech only counts equity deals that are at least $200,000 in size; such investments must be in tech or digital startups. So there could be $15k to $50k grants or loans being written for innovative food processing companies or waste recyclers that are not captured.\n\nThat said, we can definitely say that startups in Africa\u2019s 21 french-speaking countries trail behind the top five where tech investment is concerned.\n\nIf we exclude Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, francophone Africa is a near 300 million market: the seven countries using the West Africa CFA franc (~125 million people), six Central African countries using the Central African franc (~55m people) and DR Congo which, at about 100 million, is Africa\u2019s third largest country after Nigeria and Ethiopia.\n\n[Read: A spotlight on DR Congo\u2019s early-stage tech ecosystem]\n\nSome startups have taken note of this relatively homogeneous culture and currency and leapt into the region.\n\nGozem, a ride-hailing company which also offers ecommerce services, launched in Gabon, its third francophone country, this year with eyes on Cameroon and Dr Congo. Bizao, a cross-border payment company, has stretched across 10 countries.\n\nDjamo (founders pictured at the top of today\u2019s edition) is building a finance app to cover the region and became the first francophone African startup to be accepted into Y Combinator. Two Cameroon-based fintech companies, Maviance and Diool, have raised at least $3m each this year for continental ambitions.\n\nThese ventures, it must be said, are the exception.\n\nFrancophone Africa is dogged by lack of clarity around regulations, language barriers and limited networking opportunities, per Briter Bridges report. Presidential power play in the DRC and an anglophone crisis in Cameroon are examples of the region\u2019s uncertain business climate.\n\nThese concerns will take some time to quell, so maybe unicorn bells won\u2019t ring in francophone Africa anytime soon.\n\nBut 2021 could be the region\u2019s best funding year yet; a big french bank is set to invest in a West African francophone VC fund this year, according to a source familiar with the matter. So watch out \u2013 and maybe prepare to join my plane.",

Since this pivot, delivery volume has increased by a hundred fold, revenue has increased 10 times and $100 million has been realised in annualized transaction value, according to the company.\n\nBut in its boldest step since it was founded in January 2018 by Fahim Saleh, Gokada now identifies as a super app. In addition to other items that can be packaged in a motorcyclist\u2019s delivery box, food is taking the centre stage.\n\nGokada\u2019s super app is entering the market at a time when Lagos residents are consuming \u20a65 trillion ($12 billion) worth of food annually. \u201cIf the population is to grow to about 30 million by 2030, Lagos will likely need food worth \u20a66.3 trillion on an annual basis,\u2019\u2019 the state\u2019s commissioner for Agriculture said in May.\n\nDika Oha, a former senior executive at Andela and Konga who leads Gokada\u2019s product development, says Gokada delivers more food than any other delivery service in Nigeria.\n\nDika Oha, VP of Product at Gokada. Image credit: Gokada\n\nThe claim is hard to verify without numbers from other players. But Gokada\u2019s evolution from transport provider to food aggregator could help ecosystem players understand the future of super apps in Africa.\n\nA standing fleet is an asset in emergencies\n\nIn August 2019, Gokada took a two-week break to readjust its business strategy following OPay\u2019s sensational entry into Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing market.\n\nA new fleet of 200cc motorcycles were fitted with new tracking features. A higher standard of quality was demanded of drivers who, in many users\u2019 eyes, looked rather unkempt for a technology business.\n\nPerhaps not anticipated at inception, but these changes would serve the company effectively six months later.\n\nFacing existential questions about its future, Gokada repurposed the tracking feature from the ride-hailing business to begin winning customers over to GSend. \u201cWe decided we could not launch without that ability for customers to track,\u201d Victor Daminabo, Gokada\u2019s head of operations, tells me.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, Gokada set an audacious target: have drivers pick-up and complete every delivery in Lagos within two hours. They set up a goods-in-transit insurance policy to cover cases of damage or loss of items in their custody, Daminabo explains.\n\nStarting off as a service for sending individual packages, Gokada iterated to enable one driver to book and fulfill multiple deliveries. That iteration birthed \u2018Gokada for business\u2019 which helps enterprises create different user profiles for staff in various branches. The organisation uses one Gokada account but each unit can monitor deliveries separately.\n\nThis was how Gokada acquired Fan Milk and Jumia Foods as enterprise customers. Rather than invest in their own assets, these companies readily adopted Gokada\u2019s logistics fleet of over 1,000 motorcycles which is already integrated with payments systems like Paystack and Flutterwave.\n\nEating into other verticals\n\nAs the ghosts of GRide gave way to a thriving GSend, the data showed something interesting: Gokada says it has recorded over 1 million deliveries so far in 2021 and about 40% have been food deliveries.\n\nThis volume was driven by formal partnerships, like with Jumia Foods. But small and medium restaurants downloaded the app and used it to find drivers who would deliver food to customers.\n\nImage credit: Rotimi Daramola\n\nSusan*, who lives in the Surulere area of Lagos, tells me the food she ordered directly from a restaurant in her neighborhood in May was delivered by a Gokada driver.\n\nWith this happening frequently, it encouraged Gokada to float GShop, a service that aggregated restaurants, opening the door for the company to bundle all it offers onto one app.\n\nSo why a super app? On one level, it is a practical decision.\n\nUsers enter the company\u2019s ecosystem of services through one channel. That singular funnel makes it easier for the company\u2019s developers to manage updates. Growth and sales teams focus resources on selling one app.\n\nBut Oha, Gokada\u2019s VP of product, explains their motivation is also to take advantage of Nigerians\u2019 increasing familiarity with ecommerce as more businesses \u2013 food, fashion and furniture outlets \u2013 use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to find and sell to customers.\n\nSocial media platforms grow through network effects \u2013 the presence of more users doing more things improves the quality and usefulness of the platforms. Super apps emulate this playbook too, following users\u2019 lead to add more products to the stack.\n\nLike Grab in Singapor and Gozem in francophone Africa, Gokada\u2019s super app journey started with transportation | Graphic by Boluwatife Sanso/TC Insights\n\nBut as Yinka Adegoke explained in this insightful piece, apps become super by offering essential services within large markets. WeChat and Alibaba serve 2 billion users a month across China and parts of Southeast Asia; but can Gokada find a market that large and homogenous?\n\nFrom food, back to ride-hailing\n\nThe only way to reach those exalted heights, then, is by aggressively focusing on customer satisfaction for high-demand products, making the app sticky and top of mind.\n\nOr as Oha puts it, ensuring Gokada is the first thought a user has when they need to order food \u2013 arguably a bigger need than sending parcels.\n\nTo assure users, Gokada is sticking with the simplicity and transparency that has made ride-hailing platforms universal: tap to order, input destination and track your order in real time as it arrives.\n\nGokada\u2019s food service notifies the user of each step along the delivery process to maintain engagement and offer assurance.\n\nAnd yes, pay on delivery.\n\nPerfecting this cycle also means paying attention to renowned global food delivery services like Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats and Deliveroo. The reward is that perfecting a time, quality and culture-sensitive business like food delivery in Africa can be a springboard for getting people to trust and use other products en masse.\n\nThose other products, according to Oha, could be groceries, fashion and electronics. And in cities that permit, motorcycle-taxi \u2013 the company\u2019s first love.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Real estate guide for flood-prone areas as rain humbles Lagos",
          "text": "Residents and real estate investors in Lagos are still counting losses following the heavy downpour and the accompanying flooding that submerged communities and sacked many homes in the city last weekend.\n\nAs a coastal city, Lagos has many flood-prone and low-lying areas, lending it easily to flooding events. As part of measures to check the incident, the state government has produced a well-documented guide for investors wishing to do real estate developments in the state.\n\nThe state, according to its authorities, has an idea of everywhere that is prone to flooding, given its master plan that speaks to what it calls flood mapping, which has identified every area that is prone to flooding and the necessary solutions to the problem.\n\nRead Also: Estate residents in Ajah kick as development activities cause flooding in neighbourhood\n\nThe state expects every investor that wants to invest in an area that has been identified as a flood-prone area to apply to the Office of the Drainage Services and Water Resources for what it calls drainage clearance.\n\nAccording to officials of the state\u2019s Office of Drainage Services, the aim of the application is to tell investors that if they must invest in that location, there are things they need to do.\n\nThe investors would also be required to disclose the kind of drainage infrastructure they need to put in place along with the kind of set-back that would be provided if there were existing channels there.\n\n\u201cIf it is a low-lying area, we will advise you on your minimum height of reinforcement, all kinds of engineering intervention that you need; so when you do your environmental impact assessment (EIA) in addition to the remaining clearance, that is the look of how you are going to protect the ecosystem as it were,\u201d the officials explained\n\nAccording to them, these are the things the law expects investors to do as they affect drainage and flooding, adding that an investor is supposed to have a drainage clearance issued by the government.\n\nIt has been observed that the yearly seasonal flooding incidents that occur in Lagos, destroying properties and submerging roads and whole communities, are products of a combination of factors including water bodies rising above sea level, irregular and unapproved developments, and climate change effect.\n\nOsato Osawaya, an estate surveyor and valuer, notes however that flooding is part of the challenges of having a mega city in a coastal area, explaining that every city that is an island like Lagos deals with water.\n\n\u201cYou must plan for water in your built environment; when you are making your building plan and projections, you must bear in mind that you are going to have flooding,\u201d he says.\n\nOsawaya notes that there tends to be an increase in the water level in all the three main water bodies including the Atlantic Ocean, Rivers and Lagoons, adding that Lagos being a coastal mega city has direct impact from this increased water level.\n\nExperts are of the view that Lagos has flooding challenges because it has experienced developments that precede governance\u2014a situation where so many developers do their development prior to governance.\n\nLagos, according to them, is a city where developers that do not have building approval are more than those that actually have approval from the government before development.\n\n\u201cIt is like we are pretty catching up with development; areas that are low land would have been fully built up without any infrastructure built up for drainage or for you to advance any mitigations or measures to put in place for people to follow through to have a good life,\u201d Benedict Odoabuchi, an environmentalist, notes.\n\nOdoabuchi believes that everybody has a role to play in protecting the environment, noting, \u201cWhat people can do is if you know you are living in a lowland area, especially Lagos Island, you relocate.\n\n\u201cWe are being told that in 30 or so years the sea would be rising 2.1 meters that is like 7 feet, so we need to start thinking of how it is going to affect our houses, dwellings or areas.\n\n\u201cWe should not begin to make it a third-party problem because it affects everybody; so we have to be futuristic and start planning for what happens if sea level rise happens, if the rain fall continues as we are still having now.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Friday precisely, economic activities were paralysed in Lagos as nature in its fury emptied its bowel in what was clearly a torrential down-pour, causing massive flooding in many parts of the sprawling city.\n\nThe rain, which lasted for hours, left many homes and roads flooded, making movement difficult and impossible in some locations, bringing untold hardship to Lagos residents.\n\nThough both the Mainland and Island neighbourhoods were affected, the Island was worse off. In Lekki, for instance, almost the entire length of Admiralty Way was heavily flooded causing slow vehicular movement. It was the same story in other streets. VGC was also flooded.\n\nIn Ikoyi, there was very slow movement of vehicles along Orsbone Road, which was heavily flooded. It was the same story on Kingsway Road up to Falomo Bridge. Awolowo Road was also flooded, causing slow movement.\n\nAll cars parked at the sprawling Marina Car Lot on Lagos Island were submerged. The situation was so helpless that most of those cars could not leave the park till Saturday afternoon for fear of engine knock.\n\nIn Alimosho, the largest local government area in the state, areas like Iyana Ejigbo, Idimu and Egbeda, driving inward Akowonjo, were submerged. Here, residents were seen bailing water from their homes and calling on the government to intervene by desilting the gutters and opening up blocked drainages.\n\nOne of the residents in Egbeda area, who identified himself as Tunde Samson, said it had become an annual \u2018ritual\u2019 to be bailing waters from their homes every rainy season, blaming the situation on collapsed drainage systems around Vulcanizer Bus Stop on Akonwonjo Road.\n\nMany vehicles trapped in the flood are today having engine problems, which, to a very large extent, are eating deep into the lean resources of many households. The same story is told of homes where many valuables were either destroyed or carried away by the flood.",

We should not seek happiness at the expense of others.\n\n\u201cRemember that Islam is a religion of charity that urges us to love our neighbour as we love ourselves.\u201d\n\nHe urged all Muslims to continue to live in peace and harmony with their fellow Nigerians of other faiths in the spirit of peaceful coexistence.\n\n\u201cLet us pray for the progress of Nigeria at all times.

          "text": "At least 30 people died from cholera in Jigawa State in the past month, an official has said.\n\nThe Jigawa casualties add to the increasing death toll from the disease across Nigeria. Other states that have reported deaths from cholera in the past few weeks include Enugu, Benue, Plateau and Bayelsa.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health in Jigawa, Salisu Mu\u2019azu, said the deaths were from the over 2,000 patients who tested positive for the disease in nine of the 27 local government areas of the state. Hadejia and Dutse local governments are the most affected, he said.\n\nHe blamed open defecation for the spread of the disease.\n\n\u201cSpecifically in Hadejia LGA, the outbreak was due to open defecation from a nearby almajiri school that contaminated a water source,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state government has shut down the water source pending further investigation, the official said.\n\nHe said rainfall washes faeces and other wastes into wells and water outlets that the residents use for domestic purposes.\n\nMr Mu\u2019azu said the state government has directed the release of free drugs to the victims for immediate medical attention.\n\nHe said UNICEF and Doctors Without Borders have indicated readiness to partner with the state in mitigating the scourge from further spreading.\n\nWater sanitation and hygiene\n\nAmidst the cholera outbreak in Jigawa, the federal government certified 14 local government areas as Open Defecation Free (ODF) in the state.\n\nThe Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, presented ODF certificates to the affected local government\u2019s areas at Sule-tankarkar LGA during an official visit to the state on Monday.\n\nThe local councils declared open defecation free include Gagarawa, Birniwa, Guri, Sule-Tankarkar, Gwiwa, Kiyawa, Dutse, Buji, Birnin Kudu, Taura, Kafin Hausa, Auyo and Jahun.\n\nMr Adamu said the areas were declared open defecation free after over three million families in over 40,000 communities in the areas met the requirement of ODF protocol for hygiene promotion.\n\nAccording to the minister, some of the conditions for attaining the ODF status include: communities must have eliminated open defecation by 100 per cent toilet use and increased ownership and sustainability of hygiene and sanitation services.\n\nCholera spread\n\nThe Monday announcement of the cholera deaths in Jigawa occurs two days after the Enugu government confirmed that seven people died from the bacteria infection in a market in the state.\n\nThe Enugu State Ministry of Health said there was a cholera outbreak in New Artisan Market, Enugu, which resulted in the death of seven people in the market with 19 persons identified with the symptoms of loose stool and vomiting.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES reported how the Commissioner for Health in Enugu, Emmanuel Obi, disclosed in a Saturday statement that the ministry\u2019s rapid response team, upon receiving reports of the incident, carried out an immediate investigation and \u201cit was observed that the patients presented with sudden onset of passage of loose stool and vomiting\u201d.\n\nHe added that \u201cthe ill persons identified within the area were immediately and safely evacuated to the state teaching hospital and are receiving treatment, while health education on safe and hygienic practices were given to the inhabitants of the market\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the health commissioner, \u201cfurther tests carried out by the State Ministry of Health at the Teaching Hospital revealed that all the persons were suffering from cholera.\n\nREAD ALSO: Cholera kills 119 persons in Kano in three months\n\nMr Obi explained that cholera \u201cis an infection caused by some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Risk factors are from poor sanitation, and contaminated drinking water.\n\n\u201cThe classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days. Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur. Symptoms range from none, to mild, to severe.\n\n\u201cDiarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and even death. Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is prevented by improvements in sanitation, use of clean water, hand washing and vaccines. Treatment involves replacement of lost body fluids orally or intravenously, zinc supplementation and antibiotics,\u201d he said.\n\nAcross Nigeria, between January and June 27, a total of 14,343 suspected cholera cases and 325 deaths, including 345 laboratory-confirmed cases, were reported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control.",

          "title": "Save Osun Judiciary from Deji Adeleke and his Cronies \u2013 PDP Youth Alliance",
          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi,Osogbo\n\nA group within People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State, PDP Youth Alliance has called on well-meaning Nigerians to help save Osun judiciary from what it called the \u2018impunity of the Adeleke dynasty.\u2019\n\nThe group in a release issued and jointly signed by its leaders, Adegoke Abiodun (Apesin), Oladapo Babatunde (Omoga) and Bashorun Adekanola Abiodun at the weekend alleged the Adeleke dynasty of perverting justice through illegal means and so causing more havoc and disunity in the party.\n\n\u201cWe are representatives of the silent majority in Osun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party. Findings from our recent survey on the happenings in the PDP coupled with our unflinching love for democracy and overall wellness of our great Party gave prominence to this significant gathering concerning the legal tussle between Hon. Olasoji Adagunodo and the Peoples Democratic Party as well as, Mr Sunday Bisi, Elder Sunday Akanfe Atidade, Prince Bola Ajao and a number of other supporters of Dr. Deji Adeleke,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u201cIt would be recalled that Hon. Adagunodo was asked to step aside as the party chairman on 30th of April, 2020 sequel to a petition written by three persons loyal to Senator Ademola Adeleke and forwarded to the National leadership of the Party\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is in the public domain that rather than investigating the claims of the petitioners, the national chairman of our party, PDP, Prince Uche Secondus sent a premeditated fact finding three man committee to Osun with an instruction that the matter would be referred to the National Disciplinary Committee yet to be set up to adjudicate on the said petition but till this moment, nothing of such happened\u201d\n\n\u201cContrary to the dictates of our Party and in reckless disregard for the truth and express provisions of the constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party and other extant laws and rules of engagement within the PDP, the National Disciplinary Committee was not put in place only for Hon Olasoji Adagunodo, the duly elected chairman to be, at first, asked to step aside and later suspended through a text message\u201d\n\n\u201cNot done, the distractors of Hon. Adagunodo being sponsored by Dr. Deji Adeleke again came up with another allegation and in what looked like a political coup, slammed a Vote of No Confidence on him, again violating the mandatory one month maximum time allowed by the Constitution of the party for investigation against any officer of the party to be indicted or cleared, as the case may be\u201d\n\n\u201cThe so-called Vote of No Confidence which was also based on spurious allegations was not reviewed, neither was it investigated by a National Disciplinary Committee which the NEC leadership of the PDP, as a matter of duty, has the sole responsibility of setting up. In fairness, we wish to state that all due processes, according to the constitution of the party, were bracingly violated by the NWC as regards the lingering leadership crisis in the Osun State chapter of the Party\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, neutrality is connivance with evil. There is no middle ground. Therefore, we align with Robert F Kennedy\u2019s position that \u201ceach time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn this note, we salute Hon. Adagunodo\u2019s gallantry and unprecedented decorum in the phase of highest provocation. He has since been following due process and pursuing his case with class and truth. It is necessary to note that he explored all necessary timing and internal mechanism as stipulated in the party constitution before finally heading for court to contest his removal\u201d\n\n\u201cEven Mr Sunday Bisi and his few supporters as well as Dr. Deji Adeleke who is heavily bankrolling them know that the National Working Committee of the party have no legal right to dabble into an issue involving a NEC member, they can only advise and refer such a case to them and without any authority to take decisions as they did without the consent of the NEC the way they had acted in Hon. Adagunodo\u2019s case\u201d\n\n\u201d They know that there is a serious lacuna and that the flawed processes leading to the removal of the elected chairman is a nullity and same would not stand if contested in the court of law. Hence, their deliberate attempts to waste the time of the court with series of injunctions and applications that have no bearing with the present stage of the case by engaging in premature appeals and petition against all judges handling the case including the Chief Judge of Osun State from inception\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why Dr. Deji Adeleke and his people in the minority are desperately trying to build something on nothing and as of now, doing everything possible to stop the high court sitting in Osogbo from ruling on the case on July 29th, 2021\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this point, it appears ideal to tell the general public that the originating summon was filed before a High court sitting in Ikirun and presided over by Hon. Justice Jide Falola. We reliably gathered and can confirm that Hon. Justice Falola was petitioned against by some known supporters of Dr. Deji Adeleke, Prince Bola Ajao in particular, who asked him to recuse himself from the case when all attempts to buy him and derail the course of justice failed\u201d\n\n\u201cThe case was however reassigned to another High Court Judge sitting in Court 4, Osogbo Division and the court, having entertained all injunctions and arguments from the counsels and parties to the case, adjourned for rulings and judgment. It is worth noting that these same set of people, on the evidence of an affidavit deposed to by Prince Bola Ajao, dictated to Hon Chief Judge of Osun State, to transfer the case to a court sitting in Osogbo and she did just that. Now, they are complaining again after the case has been heard in their choice place \u2013 Osogbo and has been adjourned for rulings and judgement\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, time has started to run for judgement to be delivered. Importantly, aside the fact that the CJ, having acceded to their previous recusal request and given the fact that they are estopped from seeking transfer to a third judge, if the case is transferred for the third time, will the case start de novo for the third time? Would the litigating public not perceive Osun State Judiciary under the highly respected Honourable Chief Judge of Osun State with negative opinion? This is a threat to the image of Osun State Judiciary. More so, the case has been heard, judgement is being awaited. And, delivery of judgements has time \u2013 bar, under the Constitution\u201d\n\n\u201cWe compassionately plead that the Judgement should be delivered as scheduled. Whoever is not satisfied can go on Appeal. The Judiciary should not be blackmailed or intimidated to pander to the wish of a particular party\u201d\n\n\u201cFurther more, we wish to place it on record that Mr Sunday Bisi and Dr. Deji Adeleke\u2019s serial harassment of judges and their latest petition signed by one Diran Odeyemi and forwarded to the NJC against the current judge requesting the NJC to direct the CJ of Osun State to retrieve the case file and reassign it to another judge reeks of good reasoning and constitutes an abuse of the judiciary and if not checked, will weaken the judiciary institution in the state. We hold, therefore, that this development is not in the best interest of Osun and its people\u201d\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that the recent petition to the NJC amounts to arrest of judgment. It suffice to state that the defendants had filed a Motion on Notice for stay of proceedings and a Notice of Appeal in which their amongst other reliefs were also asking the Court of Appeal to direct the CJ of Osun State to retrieve the case file and transfer same to another judge. We hereby call on the NJC to discountenance their ill-conceived petition calling for reassignment of the case and as well call on every concerned stakeholder in our Party and the State to check the excesses of Mr Sunday Bisi and Dr. Deji Adeleke, who are apparently living in false hopes that laws are spider webs through which the big flies pass and the little ones get caught. Finally, it should be noted that if the misery of the righteous is caused not by the laws of nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin.\u201d",

          "title": "Buhari govt has done everything to decimate Yoruba, other indigenous nations in Nigeria \u2013 Voice of Reason",
          "text": "Voice of Reason (VOR), an Intelligentsia Group of Emininient Yoruba Sons and Daughters, has accused the government of President Muhammadu Buhari of doing everything to decimate indigenous Nigerians.\n\nThe group in a statement titled \u201cNigeria: Witnessing The Epilogue?\u201d seen by our correspondent on Monday, said the emergence of Buhari in 2015 as President was achieved with the active collaboration of the \u2018Yoruba Mainstream\u2019, predicated on the covenant he made to restructure Nigeria, but that the president soon began to pursue other agenda.\n\nThe group chaired by Dr Olufemi Adegoke, regretted that the Yoruba have become endangered people in the country they invested their sweat and blood to achieve independence for, in 1960.\n\n\u201cEvents happening within the South West of Nigeria have shown that the Yoruba have become an endangered species in Nigeria, a country they invested their sweat and blood to achieve independence for, in 1960.\n\n\u201cSince 1947 till date, the Yoruba have responded to the surreptitious, premeditated and relentless pursuit of dominance over all other Nigerians by a small group of oligarchs, by commending to all Nigerians the virtues of collective, inclusive, self-reliant and self-governing federating units to manage our diversity as a true Federation. We believe that the best route to a stable and productive democratic Federation for the Nation is one in which none of its federating units seeks primacy over others,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u201cThe Yoruba Nation is the only region of the three initial federating regions at independence that up to date has never sought secession. The gathering storm articulated in calls for secession among a people who hitherto accepted being in opposition, and who when presented with opportunities to be part of government at the centre insisted instead on terms that would be in the best interest of the entire nation rather than opting for the opportunism of predatory participation, is incontrovertible evidence that the Nigerian contraption as presently operated as a Unitary system is neither viable nor sustainable.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria was achieved with the active collaboration of the \u2018Yoruba Mainstream\u2019, predicated on the covenant he made to restructure Nigeria. This was after his hitherto unprecedented losing streak in three successive presidential elections.\n\n\u201cHowever, after assuming office, everything has been done to decimate the Yoruba and other indigenous nations; to impede their growth and checkmate their advancement socially, politically and economically. With skewed appointments, we can only play along with this long term surreptitious agenda at our own peril.\u201d\n\nVoice of Reason said that, like everyone else, it had hoped that Buhari would address Nigerians to calm nerves amid mounting challenges, but when he opened his mouth, it was only to consign the aspirations of other nationalities to the whim and caprices of members of the National Assembly.\n\nThe group said, \u201cMost Nigerians, just like those in Voice of Reason, had hoped that when the president eventually spoke, it would light up the darkness presently enveloping Nigeria. When he eventually bared his mind, first pretending not to understand Restructuring and secondly, to consign the aspirations of other nationalities to the whim and caprices of members of the National Assembly, it was a great disappointment as well as an eye opener. The 1999 Constitution that was foisted on everyone by the military. The votes of the Yoruba representatives along with those of others in the South and Middle Belt do not count on the floor of the National Assembly because of a preconceived gerrymandered lopsidedness, favouring some over the collective interests of all others.\n\n\u201cConsequently, two tendencies have emerged in the Yoruba Nation:\n\n\u201cThe first tendency are those who are optimistic that reason, common sense and patriotism would prevail, on all sides, and lead to negotiated talks to reconfigure Nigeria toward devolution of powers to geopolitical zones or regional ethnic nationalities.\n\n\u201cThe second and more recent strand of opinion have come to the conclusion that an outright separation has become existentially necessary. That the Yoruba peoples of Nigeria, in order to survive, will have to exercise the self-determination option with the end goal of birthing a separate nation out of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith the continuing unabashed implementation of the said agenda of President Buhari\u2019s administration, these two tendencies will invariably coalesce into a unified goal for \u201cself-government for the Yoruba Nation as soon as practicable.\n\n\u201cWe note and applaud the recent constructive articulation by retired military officer, Colonel Abubakar Umar. No part of Nigeria is at peace. Bandits are having a field day in the North West, Boko Haram and ISWAP have created a caliphate in parts of the North East and have gone as far as installing a governor. Herdsmen are on the rampage in the whole of the South. Surely, this was not the dream of our forefathers and is not what we, collectively, wish to bequeath to our children.\n\n\u201cIf you do not know where you are going, at least you know from whence you came. Yoruba remember the era when the Western Region attained Self-Government in 1954 with the attendant progress and prosperity and the dream of a better future. Nigeria under President Buhari has turned into a nightmare for all indigenous peoples. The economy is in tatters, the country is debt-ridden to the extent of spending over 90% of its revenue on debt servicing even as more debt is proposed. There is no guarantee of the sanctity of Life and Property whilst Pursuit of Happiness, for the generality of the people, is unattainable. Even the Commander in Chief himself has urged persons to defend themselves.\n\n\u2018Recently, the DSS executed an illegal midnight attack on the home of Chief Sunday Adeyemo Igboho in the Yoruba heartland that resulted in the death of two innocent citizens of Nigeria with the obvious intent to silence the renowned Yoruba freedom fighter. All right-thinking persons have condemned this descent into despotism. One can see the abysmal level to which the country has sunk. This is provocative and unacceptable to the Yoruba.\n\n\u201cWe commend the uniform approach of the Governors of the Southern states against the backdrop, onslaught and dereliction of duty by the Federal Government. We encourage them to invite their counterparts in the Middle Belt, who also bear the brunt of the rampaging ethnic-cleansing militia, for a unified approach.\n\n\u201cWe note their carefully worded communique but urge better clarity in order to carry the populace along. It is confusing advocating federalism or devolution of powers, praising the passage of the mutilated PIB and 2023 presidency in the same breath. This is not the time for politicking.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, and in accord with the recent decision by the leaders of Niger Delta Region as conveyed by the Communique issued at the end of their June 25, 2021 meeting held at Port Harcourt, we also hereby call for a Consultative Forum of \u2018willing\u2019 Ethnic Nationalities to be held and concluded before October 01, 2021. The objective would be the negotiation of whatever residual relations is left between and among the peoples of Nigerian territory. The Forum should be structured to accommodate the representatives of any Nigerian nationality that is willing to attend.\n\n\u201cAll hands are to be on deck in the four regions to work, in concert, to extricate our peoples from the grips of those that are beholden to a medieval culture and way of life. Based on the above stipulations, it is hereby proposed that the ethnic nationalities in the South-West (SW), Middle Belt (MB), South-East (SE) and South-South (SS) territories commence lawful activities to the exercising of their inherent sovereignty powers by immediately starting the process that would assert their rights to self-determination and self-government.\n\n\u201cIn June 2018, VOR produced and published a draft constitution that has all the features of the best possibilities for a federal governance framework. It painstakingly synthesize all issues upon which a consensus can be built ranging from principles derived from 1963, 1979, 1999 constitutions and the agreements embodied in the 2014 Conference report. A document therefore already exists which can be used to reconfigure the political architecture of Nigeria. Adopting a document such as this is critical at this stage, otherwise there would be nothing to hold on to, as we slide into ultimate disintegration.\n\n\u201cIn the event that the above call for constitutional talks is futile, the quest for our freedom shall commence in earnest. All legal and civilized processes to extricate the Yoruba Nation from the grip of the subsisting inequitable regime will be applied.\n\n\u201cOur final message is to our compatriots who are occupiers of political offices under the current regime and others in the dominant parties who intend to waste resources on another bid to be favoured with crumbs i.e tickets to contest the 2023 elections. The political parties have a timeless and do-nothing agenda that is patently obvious to the blind. The new Electoral Act with allegedly rigged provisions that are discordant to transparency and the bizarre allocation of polling units. We note and warn of the advent of another Maradonic era that culminated in the debacle and destruction of the unfulfilled MKO Abiola election.\n\n\u201cWithout the restructuring of Nigeria, the quest for another round of elections based on the 1999 constitution is a ruse of epic proportions. It will be a tragedy to be fooled once again.\u201d\n\n[email protected]",

It is symbolised with slaughtering of ram as commanded by Allah and exemplified by Prophet Ibrahim. As Muslims all over the world celebrate this great festival, I congratulate our Muslim brothers.\n\n\u201cI want to urge them to emulate the resilience, patience, steadfastness and absolute faith in Allah, displayed by Prophet Ibrahim, when he was commanded by Allah to fulfil his covenant by sacrificing his son, Ismael.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThough Allah asked the Prophet to slaughter his son, He replaced the son with a ram, in response to Ibrahim\u2019s total submission to Allah\u2019s will and commandments. Let us therefore use this period to seek the face of Allah in surmounting the present socioeconomic situation in our country.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe and hope, that God who changed the reproach of Prophet Ibrahim and replaced with joy and victory, will change our situation in Nigeria for better.\n\n\u201cAs our Muslim brothers celebrate, let us be moderate and remember those who don\u2019t have in our neighborhood and share the merriment with them. Let us remember Nigeria and in particular, Ogun State, in our supplications.\n\n\u201cAs an administration, we shall continue to espouse good governance and put policies in place to ensure prosperity for all,\u201d Abiodun was quoted as saying in the statement.",

July 20 and 21 have been declared as holiday to celebrate the event in Nigeria.\n\nIn his message, the president restated the determination of his administration to create a just, harmonious and prosperous country in which the safety of life and property is assured.\n\nHe said \u201cCOVID-19 pandemic had taken a heavy toll on the economies of all countries, including Nigeria\u201d while bemoaning the challenges of Nigerians.\n\nHe added that floods had caused large-scale destruction to agricultural farmlands, thereby \u201cimpacting negatively on our efforts to boost local production in line with our policy to drastically reduce food importation.\n\n\u201cNo government in our recent history has invested as heavily as we are doing to promote local production of about 20 other commodities, through the provision of loans and several other forms of support to our farmers.\u201d\n\nMr Buhari however noted that apart from the destruction caused to rice farms by floods, middlemen had also taken advantage of the local rice production to exploit fellow Nigerians.\n\nAccording to him, this has further undermined the government\u2019s efforts of supporting local food production at affordable prices.\n\n\u201cAs an elected president who enjoys the goodwill of the ordinary people that gave us their mandate, let me assure you that we are continuing with measures to bring relief to Nigerians, including making fertiliser available at affordable prices to our farmers,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president also noted that the current insecurity in the country \u201chas produced severe and adverse effects on agriculture because farmers are prevented from accessing their farms by bandits and terrorists\u201d.\n\nMr Buhari reassured Nigerians that his administration had taken measures to address the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\n\u201cWe have started taking delivery of fighter aircraft and other necessary military equipment and hardware to improve the capacity of our security forces to confront terrorism and banditry,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the significance of the Eid-el-Fitr celebration, the president appealed to Muslims to demonstrate the good virtues of Islam through personal examples and practices.",

          "text": "\u2026 Nigeria bleeding from subsidy payment \u2013 Kyari \u2018\u2026 Irregularities make amount being spent uncertain\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s compounded by politics \u2013 Economist \u2018\u2026A pro-people policy on crude refining key\u2019 \u2026 Ignorance fuelling oppositions \u2013 Sylva\n\nThe issue of fuel subsidy removal remains a thorny one with each administration engrossed in the debate. Notwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s economic realities, its fiscal authorities are at a crossroads over the desirability or otherwise of the policy; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\nThe story of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector and its entire value-chain has continued to defy explanations. With oil sale as its main source of revenue, the country has yet to fully utilise the over $300 billion realised, in three decades, from the sale of crude.\n\nAs a major oil-producing nation, Nigeria still continues to import refined products for its domestic needs. From Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, to AGO (diesel) and kerosene, many still ask why the 10th major oil- producer globally has continued to import refined fuel. This is as the several turn-around-maintenance over the years has not been able to bring the five refineries that are almost in comatose state back to life. The country has since been left with no choice other than to fund importation of fuel at a subsidised rate.\n\nA situation where some non-oil producing countries import crude oil from Nigeria, refine and sell the same to Nigeria is an indication that something is fundamentally wrong with political leadership in the country. The refineries in the countries are at different levels of disrepair and, therefore, cannot meet local demands, just as it\u2019s been argued that oil cabals make more money through importation and distribution of oil than its production.\n\nIt\u2019s also been argued that the economy and political institutions which have become woven around this system would take quite an effort to extricate.\n\nThe conundrum, the fluctuation\n\nThe removal of petroleum subsidy has been in the front burner of debates for decades; however, it has taken a worrisome dimension since the return to civil rule in 1999, given the frequency of the demand and constant public outcry over subsidy management. Fuel price was first increased from five kobo to 9.5 kobo per litre and since then, it has become a recurring decimal in the polity. Subsequently, on October 2, 1994, the price was increased from N3.25 to N15, but on October 4, the following year, it dropped from N15 to N11.\n\nAgain, in 1998, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar increased it from N11 to N25, but reduced it to N20 on January 6, 1999. By the time he left office in 2007, the Chief Olusegun Obasanjo-led administration raised it from N20 to N75.\n\nHowever, after Obasanjo left office, the President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua-led government felt it wise to reduce the price to N65. In his case, President Goodluck Jonathan increased it to N143, but subsequently reduced it to N97 after many days of protest, killings and destruction of public property. Last year, with the global price of crude dropping, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, announced that subsidy on petrol would finally go.\n\nThis is as the Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, reiterated that market forces would begin to determine the price. Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy. Experts have argued that with the refineries not working, it would be inconsiderate for the government to remove the subsidy.\n\nCrude price burden\n\nSpeaking at a recent media parley, the minister of state for petroleum resources told journalists that the rising cost of petroleum products was not healthy for the country. Toeing the same lane at a recent virtual event, the NNPC GMD warned that rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria. He added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC and were becoming a burden.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the payment of petrol subsidy had made NNPC unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nHe expressed concerns that as commodity prices rise buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\n\u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60,\u201d he said.\n\nImpact on economic growth\n\nRecent checks revealed that the federal government spends as much as N1.3 billion as subsidy for fuel. Speaking at a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum penultimate week in Abuja, Sylva made case for the removal of fuel subsidy, arguing that the petroleum sector should be deregulated. The minister insisted that the country\u2019s economic progress would remain slow except a market-driven pricing of products was put in place.\n\n\u201cA situation where you produce something at a certain cost and you have to sell it at a lower cost to people because you are taking some of that burden off the people is not the best.\n\n\u201cIt is a very desirable thing but it is also not too sustainable because what happens is that you produce it for N10, you sell it for N5; tomorrow, you produce it again at N10, you add N5 from somewhere, produce it again at N10 and sell it for another N5.\n\n\u201cSo, the losses increase and compound on a daily basis and those accumulated losses have brought us to where we are.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that subsidy was part of what made the refineries to stop operating, the minister said, \u201cPart of the reasons the refineries were not working is subsidy because a refinery that is producing something at a certain cost and selling at a loss, how can it sustain itself. If you are producing something and they are selling at a certain subsidised price, it cannot work. That is why you see that the sector is not growing at all.\u201d\n\nThe former Bayelsa state governor also used the opportunity to blast Nigerians stating that the lack of understanding of the real issues about subsidy had led to serious opposition to its removal. He wondered why Nigerians have continued to oppose deregulation of petrol when other products such as kerosene and diesel have been deregulated.\n\n\u201cIt is actually in the interest of the common Nigerian to ensure that some people do not just profiteer on them, which is what has been happening. But at the end of the day, I believe that it is better for us because if we are able to deregulate, then we can save money.\n\n\u201cFirst, you can imagine the savings we will make as far as Foreign Exchange (Forex) is concerned and, of course, it will bring down the pressure on forex.\n\n\u201cPeople will be able to access Forex for imports, the government will not be the one providing foreign exchange for the importation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since the government will no longer be subsidising, the money which is over a trillion naira yearly, would be gained, instead of being burnt in cars, and would then be used for development.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much money the federal and state governments will have at their disposal if there is deregulation.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s concerns\n\nIn the same vein, the GMD NNPC disclosed that the country was bleeding from continuous subsidy payment. According to Kyari, the federal government can no longer sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume put at 100 million litres.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA database we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month. That means we can do with less than 70 million, the balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country.\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June. There was a day we got about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201cWe know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC are not in control of that; we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots. But when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the managing director of SD&D Capital Management Limited, Gabriel Idakolo, told Blueprint Weekend that with so many irregularities in the sector, it has become difficult for the government to ascertain the amount it spends on subsidies.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are several irregularities in the system and the Nigerian State cannot presently state the statistics of petroleum import to Nigeria. The actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it. There is also high level corruption surrounding petroleum subsidies which has made it difficult for the government to solve the problem of subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, a political economist and development researcher, Olamilekan Adefolarin, in a chat with this reporter said the politics around fuel subsidy has made it difficult for the government to address the subsidy issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cSubsidy removal on PMS and the deregulation of the downstream sector is one of the oldest and most fundamental issues of governance, politics and economy in Nigeria. Since 1999, no civilian administration has been proactive enough to tame the problems in our petroleum sector; rather they compound the challenges in that sector through anti-people policies that ended up reversing whatever gains or progress that should have impacted the economy.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the statement from the NNPC GMD and that of minister are not new and Nigerians are already aware of the Nigerian state failure. Regrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.\n\n\u201cThe question around the four refineries rehabilitation and turn-around-maintenance over the years has proven their inept and fragrant resource wastages. In addition to this is the politics and corruption in the oil and gas sector perpetuated by the ruling class who are enjoying the proceeds of subsidy.\u201d\n\nRemedy\n\nAdefolarin suggested that to address the situation, the government must come out with a pro-people policy especially as it relates to refining crude. He noted that policy that \u201cencourages the refining of crude oil in Nigeria is the appropriate policy the government must ensure it deploys to put an end to petrol importation.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, must translate to building and owning a new refinery on behalf the citizens and encouraging private individuals to build, even as he expressed the optimism that state governments could do likewise with modular refineries.\n\n\u201cEqually, to end this quagmire there is the need for the government, especially the national assembly, to pass the petroleum industry bill (PIB) for the president\u2019s assent so as to reduce the politics around the law.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Idakolo insisted that the NNPC in conjunction with the PPMC and other regulators needed to generate actual statistics of petroleum import to enable the government to plan adequately.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy must be removed on the long run but it must be after we have been able to achieve self sufficiency in petroleum products distribution through the optimisation of the five Nigerian refineries.\n\n\u201cWe should also collaborate with private refineries, especially Dangote Refinery, which will come on stream by 2022. Perpetrators of the subsidy scam must be prosecuted by the government.\u201d",

          "text": "Federal Government has flagged off the construction of the Kaduna-Kano segment of the Lagos-Kano railway modernization project.\n\nSpeaking at the Ground Breaking Ceremony in Kano, President Muhammadu Buhari reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to reviving the Nigerian Railway system.\n\nHe said the project when completed, will not only drive the nation\u2019s economies through employment from new business opportunities and wealth creation but will also reduce the deficiency in our nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThis administration recognizes rail transportation as a potent economic driver and as such, has accorded railway infrastructure development the greatest priority it deserves and it is not surprising that several landmarks have been achieved, from the Flag-off for commercial operation of Abuja \u2013 Kaduna railway in 2016 to the recent commissioning of the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway project on June 10, 2021, thereby maintaining the pace for the actualization of this vital thoroughfare\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis project is crucial to the establishment of a supply chain in railway transport within its corridor, Kano \u2013 Kaduna \u2013 Abuja, as it links the major commercial cities of Kano and Kaduna to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja\u201d.\n\nHe further said \u201cthis railway connection when completed will establish the ports in Lagos, as the choice for import and export business of the people of landlocked Niger Republic.\n\nThe railway line will be linked to the second Port in Lagos, the Tin Can Island Port. It is also expected that the Inland Dry Port on these routes will be activated and the ports can now receive imports directly from the international market as ports of destination such as the Ibadan, Kaduna, and Kano Inland Dry Ports\u201d.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi says the project will no doubt improve the standard of living of citizens within its corridor, and further create employment and promote trade.\n\nHe said \u201d The project will no doubt improve the standard of living of citizens within its corridor, create employment and promote trade. In the long term, the railway will help decongest the Lagos Port Complex and increase its efficiency as well as further increase the viability of the Inland Dry Ports located in Ibadan, Kaduna, and Kano\u201d.\n\nHe said \u201cThe scope of the railway project involves a 203km double track standard gauge railway from Kano to Kaduna. The railway along this route traverses the major cities of Kaduna, Zaria, and Kano with three (3) railway stations both for passenger and freight services at Rigachukun, Zaria, and Kano with varying capacities and categories\u201d.\n\nHe further said \u201cThis project will link the Federal Capital, Abuja with the Commercial city of Kano and also link the ongoing Kano \u2013 Maradi project. The outstanding addendum, Ibadan \u2013 Abuja, will link the Sea Ports in Lagos to Maradi, Niger Republic. This I believe will greatly boost trade between the two countries and foster economic development. This railway line will present an opportunity for Nigerians to traverse between Abuja and Kano via Kaduna with relative ease\u201d.\n\n\u201d The rail line is also provided with accessories and special installations including Power and Water Supply schemes, Signalling System & Communication in GSM-R, Freight yards, Rolling stock depots, and maintenance workshops,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Kaduna \u2013 Kano railway project is to link the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Railway project via Abuja, Minna, Ilorin, Oshogbo, Ibadan to Lagos on one end, and Maradi, Niger Republic on the other.",

          "text": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has joined post-riot clean-up efforts as his government warned against vigilantism and sought to avert racial conflict following days of unrest.\n\nThe country was gripped by more than a week of chaos in which more than 200 people were killed as looters ransacked shopping centres and rioters torched key industrial infrastructure and blocked trade routes.\n\nThe violence was the worst in post-apartheid South Africa and was sparked after former President Jacob Zuma was sentenced to 15 months in jail on July 8 for snubbing a corruption inquiry. The protests widened into grievances over longstanding poverty and inequality.\n\nHis trial for corruption in a separate case is due to resume on Monday.\n\nOn Sunday, Ramaphosa, who has faced criticism over the response to the violence, told a crowd outside a mall in the Soweto township: \u201cWe all admit there were lapses \u2026 we will gather ourselves and do a proper review.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople want to defend what we have in the form of democracy, our constitution and economy.\u201d\n\nHe also called for unity: \u201cWe must emerge after this much, much stronger and much more capable than we were before this incident happened.\u201d\n\nRamaphosa is under mounting pressure as only one of the suspected ringleaders of what officials have called an attempted \u201cinsurrection\u201d, which caused an estimated $1bn of damage, has been arrested.\n\nWhen asked if he would shake up his ministers responsible for security he said: \u201cWe are reviewing the situation, yes.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from Johannesburg, Al Jazeera\u2019s Fahmida Miller said Ramaphosa has faced significant criticism over his comments about the riots last week.\n\n\u201cHe had said that it was ethnically-based and today he used his address to say that there was no link to ethnicity and the riots, and that notion was out the window,\u201d Miller said.\n\nShe went on to say that there was a lot of \u201cfinger-pointing\u201d between the military and the police.\n\n\u201cThere has been criticism that there wasn\u2019t enough intelligence passed on to police, in particular, to respond adequately to the riots,\u201d Miller said.\n\n\u201cPolice have said they were overwhelmed and didn\u2019t have the capacity to deal adequately with what had happened.\u201d\n\nAccess to basic necessities like food has become a pressing issue in the areas affected by looting, arson and violence as many stores were destroyed while others remain closed.\n\nMany in the worst-hit KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province are now going hungry.\n\nAt a branch of the Grace family church in Durban, trestle tables were piled high with donated fresh vegetables and bread to prepare food parcels for those in need of food.\n\nMeanwhile, Police Minister Bheki Cele has warned against \u201cvigilante acts\u201d after residents of Phoenix outside Durban, a township of mostly Indian-origin South Africans, were accused of victimising their Black counterparts.\n\n\u201cIf we hear that people are being racially profiled at roadblocks set up in the area \u2026 [people] including police, are being intimidated, violated and in extreme cases people are being beaten up, and their cars are searched and torched [this] is simply criminal and won\u2019t be tolerated,\u201d he said in a statement late on Saturday.\n\nA task force of 10 detectives would be deployed to the area to investigate the deaths of 20 people during the mayhem, he added.\n\nOf the 212 people reported killed nationwide, some were shot and others died in looting stampedes.\n\nAlongside the human and economic toll, officials closed several beaches around Durban warning of possible contamination after a chemical spill at a factory set ablaze during the mayhem.\n\nOn Sunday, Ramaphosa visited malls in Soweto township, the most populous part of Gauteng province \u2013 the country\u2019s economic powerhouse \u2013 which also saw rioting and looting, to support business owners with clean-up efforts.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the [governing] African National Congress (ANC) will assess the damage caused by the recent looting and vandalism and to engage communities and various stakeholders in the rebuilding and reconstruction programme,\u201d the party said in a statement.\n\nSunday marks Mandela Day, in honour of democratic South Africa\u2019s first President Nelson Mandela, and would be a day of jubilation for the ANC under normal circumstances.\n\nPope Francis prayed for South Africa on Sunday, saying that violence had rocked the country \u201calready hit by health and economic challenges because of the pandemic\u201d.\n\nMany in the industry, particularly tourism which accounts for 7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), worry that the violence will damage South Africa\u2019s reputation and set back economic progress.\n\nThe AFP news agency reported that traffic was back to normal on Sunday along a main highway linking the country\u2019s north to the Port of Durban which had been closed for days.\n\n\u201cIn as much as we are over the hurdle now, we are still scared,\u201d Zanele Khomo of the Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industry told AFP.\n\n\u201cThe world is looking at us with those (negative) eyes, but we want to tell them that South Africa has a lot of good people and we have a lot of good stories to tell,\u201d said Siyanda Nxumalo, a head teacher in Durban, who helped to clear up the Dube Village Mall outside Durban following the unrest.",

          "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged caution as most legal restrictions on social contact are lifted in England.\n\nThere are now no limits on how many people can meet or attend events, nightclubs can reopen, and table service will not be necessary in pubs and restaurants.\n\nFace coverings will be recommended in some spaces, but not required by law.\n\nThe PM, chancellor and the health secretary are self-isolating, and there are warnings cases will surge.\n\nSome scientists are predicting that UK infections \u2013 currently at about 50,000 a day \u2013 could reach 200,000 a day later in the summer.\n\nBut with more than 68% of UK adults fully vaccinated, modelling suggests hospital admissions, serious illness and deaths from Covid-19 will be at a lower level than in earlier peaks.\n\nHow are Covid rules changing on Monday?\n\nIn a video posted on Twitter on Sunday afternoon, the prime minister said now was the \u201cright moment\u201d to move to the final stage of England\u2019s roadmap out of lockdown.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do it now we\u2019ve got to ask ourselves, when will we ever do it?\u201d he asked, adding that the virus would have the \u201cadvantage of the cold weather\u201d in autumn and winter.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do it cautiously. We\u2019ve got to remember that this virus is sadly still out there. Cases are rising, we can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant.\u201d\n\nAs restrictions ease in England, businesses such as nightclubs \u2013 and large events \u2013 will be encouraged to use the NHS Covid Pass to check people are fully vaccinated.\n\nAnd contact tracing and self-isolation requirements will remain in place.\n\nUK-wide guidance recommending against travel to amber list countries is also being removed. Adults who have been fully vaccinated in the UK will not have to self-isolate for 10 days after visiting these countries \u2013 with the exception of those returning from France to England, Scotland or Wales, because of concerns over the spread of the Beta variant of the virus.\n\nScotland is easing restrictions so that pubs and restaurants can open until midnight \u2013 but limits on outdoor meetings will remain, the return of workers to offices will be delayed and face coverings will still be mandatory.\n\nRestrictions are set to be relaxed in Wales on 7 August and in Northern Ireland on 26 July.\n\nMr Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak are self-isolating after contact with the health secretary, who announced on Saturday that he had tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nNo 10 initially said they would not have to isolate, as they were taking part in a pilot scheme that involves daily testing instead \u2013 sparking a backlash from opposition parties and businesses affected by staff quarantining.\n\nThe UK recorded a further 48,161 cases and 25 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Sunday. On both Friday and Saturday daily cases exceeded 50,000 \u2013 the first time this level has been reached since mid-January.\n\nAlmost 88% of adults in the UK have had a first dose of a Covid vaccine, and 68.3% are double jabbed, according to the government\u2019s coronavirus dashboard.\n\nA decision on routinely offering Covid jabs to under-18s is expected within days.\n\nHowever, the scientist whose modelling led to the first nationwide restrictions has expressed concern that the UK could see as many as 200,000 cases and 2,000 hospital admissions a day.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Prof Neil Ferguson suggested a peak could occur between August and mid-September.\n\nMore than half a million alerts telling people to self-isolate were sent by the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the first week of July, with supermarkets saying they may have to cut opening hours or shut shops due to a lack of staff.\n\nAbsences from school have also surged, with 840,000 pupils self-isolating last week, with a further 630,000 absent for other reasons.\n\nPeople who are \u201cpinged\u201d by the app are advised to self-isolate for 10 days, but those contacted by NHS Test and Trace in England via text, email or phone can be fined if they do not self-isolate.\n\nSome fully vaccinated frontline NHS staff in England will be allowed to continue working if contacted by NHS Test and Trace, the government has said, amid concerns over employee shortages.\n\nFrom 16 August, people who have had both their jabs in England will no longer have to self-isolate after close contact with someone who tests positive, but anyone who tests positive or develops symptoms will still need to do so.\n\nShadow health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth said the government was being \u201creckless\u201d with Monday\u2019s easing of rules, adding: \u201cWe are saying keep masks, keep working from home\u2026 We are in favour of the economy reopening but we would put in place a series of precautions to try and slow the growth\u201d.\n\nLib Dem MP Layla Moran, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, said the government was \u201cadding fuel to the fire\u201d by easing so many restrictions when the virus was \u201csurging\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are already seeing businesses disrupted and hospitals filling up, showing that pitting lives against livelihoods was always a false choice,\u201d she said.",
          "summary": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged caution as most legal restrictions on social contact are lifted in England.\nSome scientists are predicting that UK infections \u2013 currently at about 50,000 a day \u2013 could reach 200,000 a day later in the summer.\nCases are rising, we can see the extreme contagiousness of the Delta variant.\u201dAs restrictions ease in England, businesses such as nightclubs \u2013 and large events \u2013 will be encouraged to use the NHS Covid Pass to check people are fully vaccinated.\nRestrictions are set to be relaxed in Wales on 7 August and in Northern Ireland on 26 July.\nThe UK recorded a further 48,161 cases and 25 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Sunday.",

          "title": "Huge Oregon Blaze Grows as Wildfires Burn Across Western US",
          "text": "The largest wildfire in the US torched more dry forest landscape in Oregon on Sunday, one of dozens of major blazes burning across the West as critically dangerous fire weather loomed in the coming days.\n\nThe destructive Bootleg Fire just north of the California border grew to more than 476 square miles (1,210 square kilometers), an area about the size of Los Angeles.\n\nErratic winds fed the blaze, creating dangerous conditions for firefighters, said John Flannigan, an operations section chief on the 2,000-person force battling the flames.\n\n\u201cWeather is really against us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be dry and air is going to be unstable.\u201d\n\nAuthorities expanded evacuations that now affect some 2,000 residents of a largely rural area of lakes and wildlife refuges. The blaze, which was 22% contained, has burned at least 67 homes and 100 outbuildings while threatening thousands more.\n\nAt the other end of the state, a fire in the mountains of northeast Oregon grew to more than 17 square miles (44 square kilometers) by Sunday.\n\nThe Elbow Creek Fire that started Thursday has prompted evacuations in several small, remote communities around the Grande Ronde River about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of Walla Walla, Washington. It was 10% contained.\n\nNatural features of the area act like a funnel for wind, feeding the flames and making them unpredictable, officials said.\n\nIn California, a growing wildfire south of Lake Tahoe jumped a highway, prompting more evacuation orders, the closure of the Pacific Crest Trail and the cancellation of an extreme bike ride through the Sierra Nevada.\n\nThe Tamarack Fire, which was sparked by lightning on July 4, had charred nearly 29 square miles (74 square kilometers) of dry brush and timber as of Sunday morning. The blaze was threatening Markleeville, a small town close to the California-Nevada state line. It has destroyed at least two structures, authorities said.\n\nA notice posted Saturday on the 103-mile (165-kilometer) Death Ride\u2019s website said several communities in the area had been evacuated and ordered all bike riders to clear the area. The fire left thousands of bikers and spectators stranded in the small town and racing to get out.\n\nKelli Pennington and her family were camping near the town Friday so her husband could participate in his ninth ride when they were told to leave. They had been watching smoke develop over the course of the day, but were caught off guard by the fire\u2019s quick spread.\n\n\u201cIt happened so fast,\u201d Pennington said. \u201cWe left our tents, hammock and some foods, but we got most of our things, shoved our two kids in the car and left.\u201d\n\nAbout 500 fire personnel were battling the flames Sunday, \u201cfocusing on preserving life and property with point protection of structures and putting in containment lines where possible,\u201d the U.S. Forest Service said.\n\nMeteorologists predicted critically dangerous fire weather with lightning possible through at least Monday in both California and southern Oregon.\n\n\u201cWith the very dry fuels, any thunderstorm has the potential to ignite new fire starts,\u201d the National Weather Service in Sacramento, California, said on Twitter.\n\nExtremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have swept the region, making wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.\n\nFirefighters said in July they were facing conditions more typical of late summer or fall.\n\nNorthern California\u2019s Dixie Fire roared to new life Sunday, prompting new evacuation orders in rural communities near the Feather River Canyon. The wildfire, near the 2018 site of the deadliest U.S. blaze in recent memory, was 15% contained and covered 39 square miles. The fire is northeast of the town of Paradise, California, and survivors of that horrific fire that killed 85 people watched warily as the new blaze burned.\n\nOfficials in Montana identified a firefighter who was seriously burned when flames overtook a crew fighting a small blaze there. Dan Steffensen was flown to a Salt Lake City hospital after the winds shifted suddenly on Friday, engulfing his fire engine near the Wyoming border. A second firefighter escaped without injury and called for help.\n\nThere were about 70 active large fires and complexes of multiple blazes that have burned nearly 1,659 square miles (4,297 square kilometers) in the U.S., the National Interagency Fire Center said. The U.S. Forest Service said at least 16 major fires were burning in the Pacific Northwest alone.\n\nAP",
