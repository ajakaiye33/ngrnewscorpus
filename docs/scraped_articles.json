          "text": "The fourth President of Malawi and second female democratically-elected President in Africa, Dr Joyce Banda was hosted by ElectHER and Platform Capital to an intimate evening on Thursday, July 21.\n\nIt was on the theme, \u2018The Future Is Feminine: How Can African Women Position Themselves as Change Agents in Life, Business and Politics\u2019.\n\nThe Founder and CEO of ElectHER, Ibijoke Faborode, noted that countries that have seen the election and representation of women at the highest political offices, have done so at the lowest point of their economies.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s presidential candidates almost size of Zambian Parliament, says Banda\n\nAccording to the CEO and host, this signifies the undeniable importance of women to peace, security and socio-economic development.\n\nOn her part, the Chief Host, Dr. Akintoye Akindele, Chairman, Platform Capital Group also noted, \u201cOur women have woken up and become entrepreneurs in the proper world. By increasing capital access from three per cent to 10 per cent to female initiatives and businesses, we can create improved development outcomes in Africa.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Banda clarified the distinction between \u201cThe Future is Feminine\u201d and \u201cThe Future is Female\u201d.\n\nIn her speech, she remarked \u201cthe Future is Feminine: this does not mean that the future belongs to women only: rather it\u2019s all about propagating values of equality, justice and fairness for both sexes in every sense and dimension.\n\n\u201cIt is about eliminating all practices and systems that disadvantage women. It is not an infringement or disturbance to the world order but rather it is about correcting what is fundamentally wrong with the current world order,\u201d says the ex-president.\n\nShe emphasised that it is about creating or having a new world order that is built on the principles of equality, fairness and inclusivity and, accordingly and effectively, putting an end to the world order that is built and based on gender prejudices, predispositions and constructions.\n\nBanda, however, referred to three critical changes to create a feminine future: a shift in mindset to ensure that women at all levels understand that eradicating poverty that affects them is in their own hands; political will at all levels of government across Africa to pass laws that encourage equal treatment for both men and women; and women economic empowerment and participation in leadership.\n\nAdebola Williams, CEO of RED For Africa; Barr Ngozi Ekeoma, CEO of NEPAL Oil and Gas; Prishina Satypal, CEO of Sustainability Truthing; and Helen Emore, CEO of Helen Food engaged in a high-level panel discussion.\n\nThe session was moderated by Akindele and Faborode to further highlight the importance of increased women participation in government and business.\n\nThe event also had in attendance members of the recently inaugurated AGENDER35 Advisory Council: Adaora Onyechere, Japheth Omojuwa, Blessing Adesiyan, Ope Oriniowo, Adewumi Emoruwa and Azeezat Yishaw; representatives of Diplomatics Missions \u2013 Teshome Nkrumah- Deputy High Commission, Canadian mission in Nigeria and Jannie T Lewis, Official Spokesperson of the US Consulate.\n\nOther high-network individuals in the event included John Obayuwana, Founder/Managing Director, Polo Luxury Group; Betty Irabor, Founder/publisher Genevieve magazine, Ponmile Osibo, Partner, Platform Capital; Hansatu Adegbite, Executive Director, WIMBIZ; Stephanie Busari, Editor, CNN Africa; Joyce Daniel, Esan Local Government Chairmanship Candidate Edo State among others.\n\nIn her closing remark, Faborode led all guests to make a renewed public commitment to improving women\u2019s participation in government, ensuring equality and representation of women in different walks of life, especially as Nigeria prepares for her next general election in February 2023.\n\nVanguard News",

          "text": ".\n\n**Says Defence College Has Graduated 2, 549 Participants in 30 years including, 254 Foreign Military Generals\n\nBy: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja.\n\nFollowing the apprehension that has gripped the country over unrelenting activities of murderous bandits and kidnappers, the Deputy Commandant of the National Defence College, Major General EV Onumajuru has said there is no need to review the National Security Strategy which was activated in 2019, rather, all stakeholders including MDAs, the Political authorities, CSOs and Security agencies who jointly fashioned the document must pull together to ensure its implementation for success.\n\nThe Deputy Commandant who was speaking on activities lined up to mark the 30th Anniversary of the NDC as well as the graduation ceremony of Course 30 of the College, had been asked if going by the security situation in the country where bandits were terrorizing innocent citizens and getting away scot-free, there was need to review the current strategic document?\n\nHe said, \u201cI think the national security strategy as it is, is not due for review because it\u2019s just been reviewed in 2019. Incidentally I was one of the teams that reviewed the document, it\u2019s all encompassing and it is current.\n\n\u201cOf course, don\u2019t forget that the document is solely owned by Nigerians. It is not owned by the military. It is not owned by the presidency. It is owned by every single one of us and the procedure for writing or reviewing this document involves all key stakeholders of the country because they were several meetings. You had people from the MDAs, you had traditional rulers, you have Faith-based organization, everybody was represented for the country\u2019s good.\n\n\u201cFor the current document, the last exercise held at Transcorp Hilton whereby all key stakeholders were invited, so that people can take ownership of the document. So it\u2019s not something that we should assume that it is owned by the military or by the MDAs, no, it\u2019s a document owned by Nigerians and the input of all Nigerians was brought to bear through this service into that document, so all of us owns it and it is also the works of all of us to make sure that it works to implement it.\n\n\u201cOf course, the challenges (of insecurity) are there, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it cannot be surmounted. It can be done as a country. But that means every hands must be on deck to make it work\u201d.\n\nOn the journey of NDC, Major General Onumajuru who represented the Commandant, Rear Admiral MM Bashir at the briefing said, \u201cCumulatively, We (NDC) have graduated 2, 549 participants since its establishment. Out of this number 216 are from strategic ministries, departments and agencies; 254 graduands/generals are international participants from Africa, Europe, Asia etc, and 92 are from the Nigerian Police force over the 30 years.\n\nElaborating on its Defence and Diplomatic roles, the Deputy Commandant said, \u201cOn defence policy, diplomatic policy, even the national security strategy which also the high level area, the college based on the expertise they have, in terms of human resources, have actually raised teams that cracked this documents. In terms of defence diplomacy, I gave you the statistics of 254 foreign participants that this college have graduated. Among them, so many have been service chiefs in their Armed Forces both in Nigeria and other countries.\n\n\u201cThis year we will be honouring two of them who are current service chiefs from Burkina Faso and from Uganda. So, when you graduate participants who rise to the position of service chiefs in their respective countries, of course you have a link to those countries because we monitor their progress and they remain part of us. It enables you to get certain things done easily.\n\n\u201cThe college is also a Centre of excellence in the conduct of each support operation at the strategic level.

          "text": "By Emma Emeozor, Molly Kilete, Fred Ezeh, Ndubuisi Orji and Okwe Obi, Abuja and Sola Ojo, Kaduna\n\nLess than 20 days after attacking the Kuje Correctional Facility in Abuja and freeing scores of its members, terrorists, late Sunday, stormed Bwari, a suburb of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), ostensibly to attack the Nigerian Law School, but were repelled by troops from the Guards Brigade, Nigerian Army in a battle that saw three soldiers injured.\n\nIt was not immediately known if there were casualties or any arrest of the bandits by troops.\n\nBwari Area Council is where the Nigerian Law School and the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) are located.\n\nDaily Sun had reported that the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) had first planned the attack on the Nigerian Law School Bwari before it later bombed the Kuje prison on July 5.\n\nSunday\u2019s invasion of Bwari is said to have been nipped in the bud by soldiers who were on routine patrol on the Dutse Alhaji/Bwari road in the Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory(FCT).\n\nIt was learnt that the soldiers had ran into an ambush laid by the terrorists while on patrol of the area, but fought back to prevent their mission into the area.\n\nThe guards\u2019 soldiers, it was learnt, have been carrying out patrol in the town following intelligence report of an impending attack on the Nigerian Law School.\n\nIt was learnt that soldiers injured in the battle were evacuated to the 7 Guards Medical Centre where they are receiving treatment.\n\nIn recent week, most residents of the Abuja and suburbs have expressed fears over the safety of lives and property, especially students in boarding schools, as the terrorists appear to be emboldened following the successful attack on Kuje prison.\n\nA cryptic message on the attack titled \u2018Ambush Attack Against Own Troops Of Gds Bde\u2019 obtained by Daily Sun indicated that the terrorists target was the Nigerian Law School.\n\nIt read: \u201cAt about 241620A Jul 22, own tps of 7 Gds Bn on routine ptl along Rd Kubwa \u2013 Bwari were ambushed by suspected terr. 3 x sldrs were injured during the attk. The sldrs have been evacuated to 7 Gds Bn MRS for med attn. Details on the extend of their injuries still under cfm. The ambushed attk happening within the gen area of Bwari shows that the terrs are actually within the loc and possibly to carry out their plans of attacking the law schl in Bwari as earlier reported.\u201d\n\nThe Guards are in charge of the security of the President, his family, the Vice President, Very Important Personalities (VIP), the Federal Capital Territory and its surrounding states.\n\nGuards Brigade Public Relations Officer, Captain Godfrey Anebi Abakpa, confirmed the attack but declined to give details.\n\n\u2022FG orders security beef-up in FGCs\n\nFederal Ministry of Education has asked Principals of all Federal Government Colleges (FGCs), otherwise known as Unity Schools, to beef-up security to forestall any form of breakdown of law and order.\n\nIt suggested to the principals to liaise with the police and security agencies in their locations, as well as in-house school security outfit and adopt other measures to protect their schools.\n\nThe suggestion was, perhaps, in response to the recent report of security breach at the Federal Government College (FGC), Kwali, Abuja, at the weekend, which has been directed to close down and students vacated immediately.\n\nKidnappers, who invaded Sheda village in Kwali area council, Abuja on Sunday amid sporadic shooting, released Mrs Janet Odoma Ojarume following a firm instruction that she should go and source money for the release of her husband, Sunday Odoma Ojarume.\n\nNarrating her experience to journalists, yesterday, Janet said the kidnappers jumped over the fence and whisked her and her husband away.\n\nOn how she regained freedom, she said: \u201cWhile they were moving us out of the community, the leader of the kidnappers ordered that they should allow me to go back home so that I will go and source for ransom.\u201d\n\nShe explained that the kidnappers had access to their house after she stood up from bed out of fear to open the door, adding that at that point, the kidnappers forced the door opened.\n\nShe said the kidnappers could not enter the room where her two children were sleeping. \u201cThat was what saved my children.\u201d As at press time, she said contact has not been established with the kidnappers.\n\nFollowing the tension, the sporadic gunshots set off among students of the Federal Government College (FCG) Kwali, who were in their hostels, the college has been shutdown and the students evacuated by their parents.\n\nMinister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, in a statement by the Director of Press, Federal Ministry of Education, Ben Goong, yesterday, confirmed earlier reports that indicated that there was a security threat in FGCs in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThere was security breach on Sheda and Lambata villages, suburbs of Kwali Area Council, which also threatened FGC Kwali. It was the timely intervention of security agencies that saved the situation, hence the decision for immediate closure of one the school until calm is restored.\u201d\n\nHe, however, directed that arrangements should be made for final year students to conclude their National Examination Council (NECO) examinations.\n\n\u2022Zamfara kingpin: Govt major beneficiary of loot\n\nA 50-minute British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) documentary titled \u2018The Bandit warlords of Zamfara\u2019 has exposed the modus operandi of bandits and the chain of beneficiaries of their loots as one of the leaders revealed that insecurity has become a business everyone benefits from.\n\nAbu Sanni, who spoke on a range of issues, including the genesis of insecurity in Zamfara State, explained why banditry will not end and how 279 schoolgirls were kidnapped in Jangebe, Talata-Mafara Local Government Area of the state.\n\nExplaining how kidnapping has become a lucrative business for both the kidnappers and government officials among other beneficiaries, Sanni alleged that government was a major beneficiary of the horrific attacks they unleash on the society.\n\nThe documentary \u2018BBC Africa Eye\u2019 was recorded by a journalist, Yusuf Anka who toured remote bandit camps in a forest in Zamfara. Yusuf also interviewed other bandit leaders in the camps he visited.\n\nIt was, however, not clear if Sanni was referring to the Federal Government or the Zamfara State Government or both. But he insisted that kidnapping has since become a lucrative business for all the actors.\n\nOn 279 kidnapped schoolgirls in Jangebe, Sanni revealed it was a revenge mission to teach government a lesson following military attack on his group.\n\n\u201cWhen the rainy season ended, they sent the military after us. We decided to show the government they should not interfere in our problems. We went to Jangebe and took the students. We wanted to get the government angry. We demanded N300 million but after negotiations, N60 million was paid for their release.\u201d\n\nCuriously, Sanni made a \u2018doomsday\u2019 ruling for Nigeria when he stressed that blood splitting would continue. And that is because everybody is benefitting from their loot and therefore the beneficiaries do not want the kidnapping to end soon.\n\n\u201cBecause it has become a business. Everyone wants money. That is why things are deteriorating, from the top to the bottom. They say when there is insecurity, the government gets money. Everyone is benefitting. We also get money. Though for our money, blood is split, so it continues.\u201d\n\n\u2022There won\u2019t be election in North if\u2026. \u2013Northern group\n\nA group, Arewa Youth Assembly (AYA), has threatened that there would be no election in the North in 2023 if Nigerians in the captivity of terrorists were not freed and the region liberated from attacks.\n\nSpeaker of the group, Mohammed Danlami, in a statement, yesterday, lamented the continuous incarceration of victims of the ill-fated Abuja-Kaduna bound train.\n\nHe said it was unfortunate that terrorists holding the innocent Nigerians captive had the guts to celebrate their nefarious activities in a video depicting how they were molesting their victims while the Federal Government kept giving flimsy directives and excuses without results.\n\nThe group said the growing audacity of non-state actors, which led to the invasion of Kuje Prison, Abuja and subsequent release of numerous arrested Boko Haram commanders showed that President Buhari and the Presidential Villa were not safe.\n\n\u2022PDP knocks Buhari over worsening insecurity\n\nPeoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, berated President Buhari over the spate of insecurity across the country, lamenting that his administration has irretrievably failed the people.\n\nSpokesperson for the party, Debo Ologunagba, at a press briefing claimed President Buhari was insensitive to the plight of Nigerians.\n\nHe spoke against the backdrop of the plight of victims of the Abuja/Kaduna train attack who in a video on Sunday were being flogged and dehumanised by terrorists who captured them on March 28.\n\n\u201cAt such a time, in other climes, the president directly leads the charge and takes drastic measures to rescue and protect his citizen.\u201d\n\nOlagunagba said claims by the Presidency that President Buhari \u201chas done all and even more than what was expected of him as Commander in Chief by way of morale, material and equipment support to the military\u2026\u201d is an admission of incapacity and failure by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government.\n\n\u201cBetween 2020 and 2022 about 18,000 Nigerians have been killed by terrorists who continue to be emboldened by the failures and obvious complicity of the APC and to which the PDP had always drawn attention.This is not politics; this is about humanity and leadership, which leadership sadly and unfortunately is missing in our country at this time.\u201d\n\nOn torture of the train attack victims, the PDP spokesperson said: \u201cIt is indeed heartbreaking to watch fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, helpless children, compatriots and citizens of Nigeria in captivity and being tortured, brutalised, humiliated and crying in pain, agony and anguish just because we have the misfortune of being under the All Progressives Congress (APC) government that have proven to be derelict, irresponsible, unconcerned and completely numb to the pains and sufferings of our citizens.\n\n\u201cThe emotional toll of this sad incident on the victims, their families and the entire nation cannot be quantified, particularly on the younger generation who witnessed the humiliation of their parents and breadwinners in such gruesome circumstance. This will certainly have a generational consequence on the emotional and psychological makeup of our young persons with the possibility of losing faith in our nation and the capacity for empathy.\n\n\u201cIndeed, as a party, our hearts bleed! The APC government has irretrievably failed our nation. Under the APC, Nigeria is fast sliding into a Hobbesian State where rule of law, order and leadership are absent and where cruel, inhumane and insensitive bunch of human beings in government have abandoned our citizens to killers, terrorists and bandits.\n\n\u201cThis disquieting video is a heartrending testament of the reported complicity and failure of the APC government to take decisive actions to rescue the victims since the gruesome train attack in which very promising Nigerians including a 29 years old female medical doctor was brutally killed and others taken captive by terrorists since then.\n\n\u201cIt is a painful commentary on the continuing mass killing by terrorists in various parts of our country as well as a confirmation of the agony of hundreds of our citizens including students, who are being tortured and executed in countless terrorists\u2019 dens enabled by the APC government.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba charged Nigerians, irrespective of political, ethnic and religious affiliations to come together, and resist the alleged \u201cfascist-leaning tendencies\u201d of the government. He said the only solution to the current security situation in the country is to hold the APC led administration accountable.",

          "title": "ASUU: National blackout as NLC begins mass protest today",
          "text": "By Bimbola Oyesola, Henry Uche, Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki, Jude Chinedu, Enugu, Obinna Odogwu, Awka, Okey Sampson, Umuahia and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has vowed that nothing would stop its planned protest rallies across the country commencing today to force Federal Government to heed to the demand of workers in the education sector.\n\nIt said it has fully mobilised all its affiliates both in the private and public sectors for a total shut down of all the sectors as it holds a two day solidarity protest in support of the ongoing strike in the educational sector.\n\nThe Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals (ANAP) has threatened to shut down the airports while the National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE) in a letter with reference, NUEE/NS/2022/008, titled, \u201cNigeria Labour Congress/ASUU Solidarity Protest,\u201d dated July 22, said electricity workers would join in the protest to kick against the prolonged closure of tertiary institutions in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the General Secretary, NUEE, Joe Ajaero, \u201cAll members of the union are enjoined to massively mobilise and actively participate in the NLC/ASUU solidarity protest against the continued closure of the nation\u2019s tertiary institutions, schedule for July 26/27, 2022.\n\n\u201cYou are encouraged to work with the leadership of State Executi Councils of the congress in your various states with a view having a successful outing. Aluta Continua.\u201d\n\nThis is in spite of appeals by the Federal Government and security alert by the DSS that the NLC shelves the planned nationwide protest.\n\nThe Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has been at war with the Federal Government since February 14 over failure to honour some past agreements, among others.\n\nThe disagreement has kept students of most public universities at home for the past five months. Some other unions in the university system are also on strike due to disagreements with the Federal Government for different reasons.\n\nNLC President, Ayuba Wabba told Daily Sun the two-day action would begin today in all the 36 states while the national would hold tomorrow in Abuja. He said Congress was confident that it would be a success as all the state councils and affiliates were fully mobilised and charged for the action.\n\nThe Joint Action Committee of Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and the Non-Academic Staff Union of Allied and Educational Institutions (NASU) equally expressed readiness to take the lead in the protest.\n\nSpokesman of JAC and General Secretary of NASU, Peters Adeyemi, said since government has failed to resolve the impasse, the unions would no longer keep quiet. He also expressed dissatisfaction with the Prof. Nimi-Briggs-led committee\u2019s report submitted to the government for approval.\n\nAdeyemi said the committee\u2019s negotiations processes were biased as its members were not duly involved and did not endorse the 10 percent salary increase purportedly recommended in the report.\n\nThe committee was set up in March by the government to oversee the negotiations with the four university-based unions.\n\n\u2022Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu, Abia, Imo ready\n\nAddressing affiliates in preparation for the protest against what it called government insensitivity to the universities workers plight, NLC Chairman in Lagos, Funmi Sessi, said workers would start converging at under the bridge in Ikeja from 6am and move enmasse to Alausa Secretariat by 7am to deliver a letter from the national body to Governor Babajide Sanwo-olu.\n\nShe directed all sectors including the health, electricity and aviation to shutdown operations and join the solidarity protest in support of the striking workers.\n\nShe lamented that students in higher institutions from poor homes have been at home for over five months, adding that government had exacerbate the crisis with the introduction of \u2018No work, no pay policy.\n\n\u201cStoppage of the salary is draconian, we are supporting the struggle of ASUU, SSANU, NAAT and others. Despite efforts to broker peace, government has failed. We are already fully mobilized, we will be on the street using the protest to drum support for the parents of the students who have been home for this long period.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, NLC has charged all institutions owned by state government to abstain from going to work, adding that it is the directive from the NLC that Lagos State University (LASU) and other state-owned institutions should join the protest.\n\n\u201cIf government like, let them bring all their armour tanker and security agencies, we will face them. Holy fire will not allow anything to disturb or cancel the protest. We are using this opportunity to tell all institutions in Lagos State to come out in solidarity with us because the reward will be for all. Injury to one is an injury to all\u201d, she added.\n\nSessi emphasised that the national grid would go down to zero and for health workers only emergency services would be allowed.\n\nAbiodun Aremu, coordinator of the Joint Action Front (JAF) said there\u2019s money to pay the universities workers and revamp the education system drawing inference from money expended on political parties primaries.\n\nChairperson of Anambra State chapter, Mrs. Chinwe Orizu, said over 1,000 workers from across the state would participate in the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are very much ready. We have done our best in terms of mobilisation. We are expecting about 1,000 persons\u201d, Orizu said.\n\nIn Ebonyi State, the chairman, Mr. Ikechukwu Nwafor, said all members would come out enmasse.\n\n\u201c We unanimously resolved to come out in our numbers tomorrow (today) for the protest. We shall gather first at the state office, then March through major streets of Abakaliki and return back whenever we are tired. But I can tell you that we are very prepared for the protest, and all the necessary agencies are already aware of our protest.\u201d\n\nThe leadership of the union, Virginus Nwobodo, said all necessary arrangements have been made to ensure the security of protesters during the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are ready for the demonstration. We have mobilized our members in the state to come out. Once they come out, we move.The starting point is the Labour House.\u201d\n\nSecretary of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Emma Acha, said journalists in the state were ready to join the protest.\n\n\u201cWe have done our best to mobilise our members. We are ready for the showdown. We will all gather at the Labour House,\u201d he assured.\n\nAlthough chairman of NLC in Abia State could not be reached, an official said all affiliated bodies were fully prepared for the rally cum protest.\n\nA veteran labour leader in the state, Obi Igwe, said in addition to the rally, there would be solidarity messages to be delivered by labour leaders.\n\nPresident of the National Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Abia chapter, Ikechi Nwaigwe, said his members were fully prepared for the protest. He said they were not embarking on a strike, hence, people would go to work. He added that the rally was for selected people from the various unions.\n\n\u201cWorkers will actually go to work, we are not observing any strike, but a rally which will take place in Umuahia, in solidarity with ASUU.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that each trade union has those selected to represent them, adding that NULGE will be fully represented at the rally.\n\nImo State secretary of NLC, Ken Onwuemeodo, said the decision of the national body is binding on all the state chapters to abide.\n\nHe said necessary arrangements for a successful protest has been put in place and every union duely notified.\n\n\u2022We\u2019re still waiting for FG, not deterred by salary halt \u2013ASUU\n\nASUU leadership said the Union was still waiting for the Federal Government to do the needful before they can call off the strike.\n\nThe National President, Professor Victor Osodeke, who made the disclosure said withholding of their salary would not dampen their resolve to persevere with the strike until government agreed to their demands.\n\nHe maintained that the proposed warning protest is legal and acceptable under any known law contrary to what the Minister of Information and culture, Lai Mohammed, said.\n\n\u201cWe have finished all negotiations on the issues of agreement with government on June 16 but till date, we have not heard from them. We\u2019re waiting for FG\u2019s response. Since the Federal Government issued a two-week ultimatum to the Ministry of Education to end the strike, nobody has reached out to us. We are waiting. ASUU is under the NLC, so they have the right to protest. It\u2019s allowed by law\u201d he stressed.\n\nHe warned that the two-day protest was just an alarm of what would come thereafter, saying, \u201cNLC has Plan B to register their grief if this two-day protest does not yield expected result. Nigerians are protesting. They have killed education and expect us to clap for them. Instead of solving the problem, the minister is there talking about Legality do NLC proposed protest. All these delay is political.\n\n\u201cThe minister of labour hijacked this issue thinking that we would come begging him after one or two months when he stopped the salary of workers, but here we\u2019re today. If we had set our priorities right from the beginning, we wouldn\u2019t have this issue. Thank God the President has handed back this matter to the minister of Education, we hope to see something different,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "BudgIT, a civic-tech organisation, has expressed concerns over the poor fiscal performance of the Federal Government\u2019s 2022 budget and its soaring subsidy payments.\n\nBudgIT said this in a statement on Monday signed by Iyanu Fatoba, assistant head, media and communications.\n\nThe organisation which said the fortunes of Nigeria have worsened in the last eight months, noted also that one of the most pressing concerns remained the debt service-to-revenue ratio, which has hit an alarming level within the first four months of 2022.\n\nIt added that the country\u2019s current debt service, which stood at N1.94 trillion from January \u2013 April 2022, is over 100 percent of the nation\u2019s revenue which was N1.64 trillion naira, within the same period.\n\n\u201cThis is in spite of warnings given by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that Nigeria would be spending over 100 percent of its revenue on debt service in 2026. Unfortunately, those predictions are Nigeria\u2019s current realities,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nBudgIT, had in a consultation memo released in February 2022 titled: \u2018Leveraging budget reforms for economic development,\u2019 had articulated several reform issues bordering on Nigeria\u2019s public financial management regime that affect the very core of governance, separation of powers, expenditure efficiency, and the livelihoods of millions of Nigerians; 83 million of whom live in extreme poverty\n\n\u201cFour months later, some of those same challenges exist, with additional ones, if not properly managed, may spell fiscal crisis for an already impoverished nation. In particular, the debt service spending is only N93.6 billion less than the combined total personnel and capital expenditure for the period under review. Also alarming are the expenditure targets for the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), which have only been 15 percent (of the total N5.10 billion naira) for the period under review.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying that the fortunes of the most populous black nation on earth, Nigeria, have worsened in the last 8 months after the 2022 budget was passed.\u201d\n\nGabriel Okeowo, BudgIT\u2019s country director, said despite being confronted with a myriad of challenges ranging from the ASUU strike which has crippled tertiary education, Nigerians are waiting with bated breath for the national budget to begin to bring about relief and the positive change it was claimed to have harboured.\n\nThe civic-tech group advised the federal government to discontinue indiscriminate borrowing through ways and means.\n\n\u201cIt is in light of the above that we call on all well-meaning Nigerians, CSOs, media, the private sector, the international community, and reformers to join the call for the federal government to do the following: discontinue indiscriminate borrowing through ways and means, which is creating a ballooning set of interest payments, running parallel to the external debt, as well as increasing the money supply and creating more monetary volatility; check the oil theft that is now commonplace in the petroleum industry, and has encumbered the countries ability to meet its production quotas-the latter having fallen to 1.25 million barrels as at May 2022,\u201d the statement added.",

It could not be confirmed if any ransom was paid for their release although sources claimed that N100 million ransom was paid for each of them.\n\nThe development followed a video released in the early hours of Sunday, showing the kidnapped passengers sitting on the floor and surrounded by their kidnappers who were brutalising them. The terrorists also threatened to kidnap high profile Nigerians, but the presidency reacted to the threat hours after, accusing the terrorists of using propaganda to compel the government to yield to their demands.\n\nIn a statement, yesterday, the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said security forces were not helpless in stemming the tide of insecurity confronting the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Presidency, in the meantime, wishes to reassure the public that the president has done all, and even more than what is expected of him as Commander-in-Chief by way of morale, material and equipment support to the military, and expects nothing short of good results in the immediate.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Tukur Mamu, an aide to popular Islamic cleric, Ahmad Gumi, who has been involved in negotiations for the release of the captives, confirmed the release of the four abducted passengers.\n\nAlthough Mamu did not give details of how the victims were released, he, however, gave the names of the four who regained their freedom yesterday as Gladys Brumen, Oluwatoyin Ojo, Hassan Lawan, and Ayodeji Oyewumi.\n\nAbout 30 passengers on the ill-fated train are still being held captive by the terrorists, while more than 20 of the victims have been freed, with some of them believed to have paid millions of naira as ransom.\n\nOn March 28, 2022, terrorists attacked a train going to Kaduna from Abuja, killed eight people, injured many, and kidnapped over 60 passengers on board the train. Eleven of the 61 remaining abducted people were released following a negotiation with the terrorists in June.\n\nThereafter, the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) temporarily suspended activities while President Muhammadu Buhari directed the security agencies to rescue the victims.",

          "title": "Setting Agenda for Next President \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Segun James writes on expectations of Nigerians from whoever emerges nation\u2019s President in 2023\n\nOn May 29, 2023, when the newly inaugurated President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria settles down behind the presidential desk at the Aso Rock Villa in Abuja, he will be confronted with a daunting basket of problems that will be of no envy to anyone.\n\nOn top of the list, is trying to unify a country now polarized along ethnic and religious lines, and an economy that has gone into recession three times in the last seven years. It would be a formidable task for one man to undertake.\n\nWhosoever that man will be, he would try to defuse the explosive political environment that has created unprecedented levels of animosity among the various ethnic nationalities and religious groupings.\n\nPolitics in Nigeria is undergoing one of the most disruptive transformations in the last two decades: technology is transforming the information highway. It now determines the way we communicate, associate, and the way we live our lives. This is exemplified by the way social media is being used to influence people.\n\nWe are now at a time where we apocalyptically view the new political year grimly and look back at the old exhaustingly, watching our nation fail. This is the situation of the polity in Nigeria today. This is the way the people see the country.\n\nDuring the 4th Republic, elections in the country had been messy\u2013filled with bombast, innuendo, partisanship, and mudslinging. Granted, democracy is not a practice for the faint-hearted \u2013 candidate and voters alike, but this year stands out as it is particularly divisive. Yet despite the turbulent environment, the nation cannot afford to lose sight of the crisis that awaits the next administration.\n\nAngry insurgents rarely prosper in Nigeria\u2019s politics. The country\u2019s voting system is brutal on small political parties, making them forever irrelevant and not a viable alternative to the two big leaguers of All Progressive Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nDespite these circumstances, both foreseen and unexpected, the nation has witnessed commendable progress in the electoral process, a situation that has rekindled the people\u2019s belief that their vote counts. It therefore in 2023 needs strong, purposeful leadership. This fact shouldn\u2019t be lost on the electorate as they support their candidates for the election. Regardless of which party controls the government or which candidate wins, it will be time for proper government work to commence in earnest.\n\nAfter nearly eight years at the helm of Africa\u2019s biggest democracy and economic powerhouse, President Muhammadu Buhari will be expected to hand over the rein of political powers to his successor. He would have successively completed constitutional two terms.\n\nYes, Nigeria has the largest economy in Africa, but it has been shrinking in recent years while supposed reform packages embarked upon by the government have all failed. To understand the stakes for next year\u2019s election is to look critically at issues affecting the polity.\n\nPolitics\n\nNigeria\u2019s political situation is, to say the least, difficult and exasperating. The problem? Bad policies and it is not about to go away anytime soon. With leaders occupying themselves with issues about ethnicity and religion, they do not seem to realize that now is the time to put the politics of the nation on the table. Over the past few years, the forces favouring openness in politics have been gaining ground. Greater public access to information aided by new communication technology is altering the polity.\n\nEconomy\n\nFor many years, Nigeria has been seen as a land of opportunity, economically. Its large population is a potential opportunity for growth. In a world economy, as troubled as today\u2019s, it is surprising that Nigeria is not bankrupt like Sri Lanka. The rate of growth is negative. The high pace of growth that it enjoyed 10 years ago has disappeared. The national currency, the Naira has slumped. Whether Nigeria can return to a path of growth depends on its politicians, particularly the next president -and, in the end, the voters. The omens, frankly, are not good.\n\nWhile Nigeria boasts of the biggest economy in Africa, the disparity between the rich and the poor has become the widest the nation has ever seen, and this is a time bomb that must not be allowed to explode as the nation moves toward the election. Today, Nigeria has the highest rate of poverty in the world. In the last few years, not only do Nigerians spend more time in bumper-to-bumper traffic, they commute longer and spend more on transportation. More Nigerians are homeless and housing is no longer affordable.\n\nEconomic diversification is a challenge for all developing countries, and more so for small economies like Nigeria which are very vulnerable to vagaries and exogenous shocks, whether economic, financial, or political. Whoever becomes the next President must be someone who has economic knowledge. Someone who can perform a miracle and prevent a national collapse.\n\nInsurgency\n\nTwo critical obstacles stand in the way of the country addressing and combatting the threat of insurgency \u2013 Ethnicity and Religion. Of the bloodiest conflicts in Africa in the last 20 years, one, in particular, has been smoldering for at least 15 years, the Boko Haram conflict, and it is happening right here in Nigeria.\n\nThe scale of slaughter within a single country and the frequency with which the country is being bathed in the blood is hard for the world to comprehend, given that the country is not at war, civil, or with any other nation.\n\nOver five decades after the end of the Nigerian Civil War, sectarian violence and drums of war are beginning to beat across the country. In the Southeast, the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) has taken to violence and murder as a weapon of coercion.\n\nIn the Southwest, a group known as the Yoruba Nation has been calling for the breakup of Nigeria; while in the creeks and rivers of the Niger Delta, there\u2019s the silence of the graveyard as the people wait to cause economic sabotage on oil facility, the main sustainer of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nThat this insurgency has gone this far must be looked into by the next government as the Muhammadu Buhari government has been unable to contain it over the last seven years.\n\nLaw and Order\n\nAt most times, Nigeria\u2019s police seem rotten to the core \u2013 riddled with corruption, crime, dirty tricks, political machinations, and even murder. In 2020, the people, especially the youth rose up against police brutality. It resulted in killings, disruptions and arson as never before seen in the country.\n\nAn untold number of residential burglaries go unreported because homeowners know the police won\u2019t investigate such crimes or pursue the thieves. Elected officials at both the state and local government levels have gone soft on crime leaving the people to provide their security.\n\nRoads and Infrastructures\n\n62 years after independence, Nigeria is still struggling to make a deliberate investment in infrastructure and an enabling environment that rewards ability that could deliver substantial results.\n\nThe highways are deplorable because the flow of traffic is much more than the roads can handle and internal roads are deteriorating due to lack of maintenance.\n\nBut surprisingly, the country, especially Lagos state and the federal government have done a lot in rail development. However, this is not enough given the rising demographic situation in the country. Other infrastructure facilities such as pipe-borne water, hospitals and affordable housing are lagging behind.\n\nPower\n\nThe electrical power framework is a mess. The country provides less power than this government met in 2015. Maintenance and modernization of the electrical grid-power stations, transformers, and transmission lines have virtually collapsed, with no hope in sight.\n\nEthnicity and Religion\n\nThe drums of inter-ethnic war are beating once again in the country and it is steaming towards an apocalyptic disruption. Today\u2019s hardliners are ascendant on all sides. Bellicose rhetoric has returned and they are tightening their grips on the home front and lashing out at opponents.\n\nLike many places, Nigeria remains deeply divided on the questions of ethnicity and religion. In recent times, matters relating to both issues have gained momentum.\n\nThis is caused by misunderstandings. The first is understanding the diversities that make up the over 250 ethnic nationalities. The second obstacle is a deeper and more difficult one. It is the threat that may adversely affect the conduct of the general election. The increasing abandonment of issues affecting the nation for religious intolerance has been baffling since the presidential candidate of the APC selected a fellow Muslim as his running mate. The fact that the political parties have ideological leanings has been sacrificed on the altar of religious bigotry.\n\nHealthcare\n\nThere is a growing healthcare crisis in the country. Drug abuse and mental illness are on the rise. This is aside the rise in the death of many people resulting from all kinds of curable ailments including malaria, typhoid, cholera, High Blood Pressure and diabetes, among others. The central mystery in Nigeria\u2019s healthcare crisis is a simple question: why are the country\u2019s health facilities not working? Like many simple questions, it leads to complex answers. Especially when the President and other political leaders rather go abroad than patronize the medical facilities they provided for the people.\n\nCrime\n\nThe years of terrorism have had its numbing effect on Nigeria. Most of the yearly over 200 attacks the country suffered in the last seven years have had a profound effect on the nation\u2019s body polity.\n\nDrugs, extortion, kidnapping, piracy, and people smuggling are now the most lucrative businesses thriving among Nigerian youth. Also growing on the sideline is the highly sophisticated and organized oil theft, known locally as oil bunkering. In 2019, over 4,000,000 barrels of oil were stolen and smuggled out of the country by thieves. They do it in conjunction with international smuggling rings that come into the Nigerian waterways in large ships, load stolen crude, and simply disappear into the night in the presence of Nigerian security agencies and officials of the oil industry.",

This partnership stems from the alignment of our vision to create a transformative society using technology.\u201d\n\nIn his address, the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, noted that the card is important for proper identification and traceability of Lagos residents, which ultimately will help inform the Government\u2019s planning and provision of social services, improve the security of lives and properties within the state and drive the upward mobility of residents.\n\nHis words echoed those of the General Manager of LASRRA, Engr. Mrs. Ibilola Kasumu, who said the card would aid economic growth and provide a reliable database of all residents of the state.\n\nThis partnership is in furtherance of Verve\u2019s goal to create a digitised identification system for Nigerians, as it recently partnered with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to create a digitisation framework for proper identity management for Nigerians.\n\nOther dignitaries present at the event were the Deputy Governor, Femi Hamzat; Managing Director, Sterling Bank, Abubakar Suleiman; Managing Director, LAMATA, Abimbola Akinbajo; and Commissioner of Information, Gbenga Omotosho, among others.",

          "title": "Resisting Moves to Weaponise Pension Issues in Delta \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "While measures are ongoing for this current administration of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to liquidate the pension arrears it inherited, the government has at the same time, resisted moves by some political gladiators to weaponise it, Precious Ugwuzor reports\n\nIn what may not be a surprise to some stakeholders in Delta State, the vexatious issue of outstanding pensions to deserving retirees of the state and local governments may have been weaponised by some political gladiators in the state.\n\nThe confirmation of this development came after the state authorities accused the main opposition party in the state of polticising the issue on Monday.\n\nOver a period of time demonstrators agitating against the failure of the Senator Ifeanyi Okowa government to liquidate the pension arrears it inherited have repeatedly been demonstrating against what they claim as the failure of the government to clear the entitlements.\n\nGiven Governor Ifenayi Okowa\u2019s proclivity towards human capital development, the question of the pension burden is one that understandably question its commitment to a virile working class.\n\nThe controversy over the outstanding pension liabilities has especially gained ground since the commencement of the political season, even more fiercely since Governor Okowa emerged as the vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.\n\nPerhaps it was not surprising that as he returned to Asaba after he was unveiled as the presidential running mate of the PDP in Abuja on June 24, Governor Okowa was quick to explain to the mammoth crowd that received him how his administration inherited a pension liability of N181Billion. Tho\n\n\u201cWhen we came into government in 2015, we were owing about N181 billion and reduced it to 86bn through reconciliation with the collaboration of HR consultants and representatives of Labour.\n\n\u201cWe were able to investigate the sum and it eventually came down to about N86 billion and since then we have been paying N500 million monthly and we have paid over N34 billion over time.\n\n\u201cWe have also made a provision of N20 billion from the proposed bridging finance to see what we can pay down for the past services,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, his explanation and the efforts he had made in cutting down liabilities abandoned by his predecessors has apparently not settled well among some stakeholders.\n\nLast Thursday, a group of protesters poured out into the streets in Asaba, the state capital to demand the payment of their pensions. What was touching to some, especially some top government officials was the use of foul language against the person of the governor by the demonstrators.\n\nWhether it was that or its effort to communicate its achievements in clearing the liabilities it met in that sector, the state commissioner for information, Mr Charles Aniagwu on Monday addressed the press where he cleared the air on the issue.\n\nHowever, in clearing the air, the commissioner introduced another dimension to the issue of the pension controversy.\n\nApparently trying to claim that with the opposition finding nothing to campaign against the Okowa administration and the PDP that it had now resorted to polticising the pension debacle.\n\nThe commissioner gave as evidence of his claim the fact that the lady who led the recent protest on the unpaid pensions was a leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nHe said that the Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa led government had since inception supported the local government councils in the state with funds to ensure payment of salaries and pensions to their workers.\n\nHe said since the state migrated from old pension scheme to the contributory pension scheme, government had been saddled with the huge burden of settling pension arrears for serving and retired workers.\n\n\u201cThe burden of the payment of primary school teachers salaries and pension is that of local government authority and not the state government.\n\n\u201cThe leader of the protest a retired teacher is also the female coordinator of APC from the Ndokwa nation of the state, but we know that the local government councils are in charge of their remuneration and pensions.\n\n\u201cThis group will gather, lie down and try to cast aspersion on the person of Okowa. I have never seen where somebody will work in UAC and proceed to Leventis to receive salary,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that the state has over 1,250 primary schools, adding that many more teachers had to be employed to fill the gap which accounted for the huge burden on salaries and pension demand for teachers and other workers.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the workers were owed several months of salary arrears, so, Okowa looked at the situation and has assisted them with N600 million monthly to augment.\n\n\u201cAnd at other time we gave N3 billion grant to the local government councils to address the salaries issues to get them out of the woods.\n\n\u201d In the area of pension, we have been assisting the local government councils to meet their obligations; since inception, Okowa had on monthly basis released N150 million to the local government councils.\n\n\u201cAfter three years, we increased the pension support from N150 million to N300 million and to N500 million monthly to fast track the payment of the backlog pension owed local government workers including the primary school teachers in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cBy this intervention, the state government has reduced the burden of pension arrears owed the local government workers to 2018 and for the primary school teachers, who were owed several years of pension, we have pushed it up to 2016.\u201d\n\nAniagwu, said the state government was also ready to commit about N10 billion grant to the local government councils for pension matters in the state which informed the recent demand for N150 billion bridging finance.\n\nPerhaps reflective of the efforts of the state administration in clearing the pension arrears, stakeholders point to the recent claim by the National Pension Commission, PENCOM that Delta State was only one of about five states actively contributing to the welfare scheme.\n\nGiven that preceding regimes helped to raise the mountain of unpaid pensions, it is the opinion of Mr Aniagwu that his government in the context of the proverbial lizard would clap for itself if no one else is clapping.\n\nHowever, what may be of concern to some is that the genuine pain of some who have not been paid is now being used as a tool in the political arena.",

          "title": "NGIGE AND THE ASUU STRIKE \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "The problem with Ngige is not that of hijacking the ASUU negotiation, but largely his search for perfection, argues Darlighton Anule\n\nI have always sensed that the dissonance between obstinate patriotism and arrogance of will, may eventually lead to blackmail over who takes the blame for the prolonged ASUU industrial action. This feeling is not aided by a seeming rivalry and connivance, laid bare by the discordant accounts of the meeting between the President, his ministers and heads of relevant agencies over the strike. As seen in some of the headlines, \u201cBuhari Orders Ngige to hands off negotiation;\u201d \u201cMinister of Education Requested Ngige to hands off Negotiation;\u201d \u201cBuhari Didn\u2019t Ask me to hands off talks with ASUU.\u201d Then, came a parody of what ought to be an unambiguous, a tell all readout from the presidential spokesperson about the meeting. Why the statement was skewed to create an impression of a misunderstanding is best known to the author. It was even better to allow Nigerians speculate than leave an innuendo that pitches the Education Minister, Adamu Adamu, as an antithesis to his Labour and Employment counterpart, Senator Chris Ngige. The reports in a section of the media which silhouetted Ngige, look more like a planted insight or a promoted editorial mischief. That the Education Minister was quoted by the Premium Times as saying he abandoned ASUU negotiation the very day Ngige raised in the Federal Executive Council, that once an industrial dispute snowballs into a strike, it becomes the prerogative of the Ministry of Labour, draws more curiosity. I thought that such deliberations in the Federal Executive Council are classified and hidden from the public. Section 3 and 4 of the Trade Disputes Act, Cap T8, Laws of Federation of Nigeria, 2004 clear every ambiguity on the handling of industrial disputes, hence render impotent, this assertion that suggests a hijack of responsibility.\n\nThese sections of the Trade Disputes Act on apprehension state that whenever a union and its parent Ministry, in this case ASUU and the Ministry of Education, fail to resolve a dispute and it ends in strike, the matter migrates inevitably to the Minister of Labour for conciliation. Here, ASUU declared a dispute with the Ministry of Education and both couldn\u2019t resolve it. The union consequently went on strike on the 14th of March 2022, effectively paving the way for transmission to the Minister of Labour and Employment, who acting under section 17 of the Act apprehended the strike at the conciliation meeting, held March 1, 2022. The section also says that once the matter is apprehended, the union shall call off strike while negotiations go on. But Nigeria is not governed by laws, otherwise ASUU wouldn\u2019t still be on strike. The idea of hijacking the ASUU negotiation is therefore not factual, in fact baseless. Such misconception arises because government officials don\u2019t read and do not ruminate on what they dish out to the public. Our press has also been overtaken by untidy and shallow reporters, incapable of little research on beats. If the presidential spokesman had shed light on this simple procedure, this embarrassing suspicion of infighting would have no place. Had the Education Minister also handled the dispute with ASUU successfully, the union would neither have gone on strike nor the matter migrate to the Ministry of Labour. It is a cycle we saw in 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021 and now 2022.\n\nAlso, a clear understanding of sections 9 and14 of the Trade Disputes Act nullifies claims that Labour Minister was asked to hands off negotiation. It explains that when he is unable to settle a dispute, he will either transfer the matter to the Industrial Arbitration Panel or the National Industrial Court of Nigeria. The question will now be why he didn\u2019t migrate this case. My experience in labour activism is that a matter as critical as the current ASUU/FGN imbroglio which straddles the artery of national progress will prove counterproductive at both levels. First is that the federal government is dealing with intellectuals whose willed inflexibility nears outlawry. ASUU is no ordinary union you can coerce especially under democracy. The other is that the sensitivity of the matter and the overriding need to give it a closure for sake of posterity towers above other considerations. Hence, migrating it backwards in de novo, is the best option. In simple terms, the matter goes back to the Ministry of Education for fresh talks and where it fails, the Ministry of Labour will wade in once more.\n\nOverall, Ngige\u2019s pitfall traces to his stubborn patriotism. Those close to him would have warned him that obstinate nationalism of the Great Zik of Africa whose apostleship he claims, is time-worn, hence not the right oars to paddle safely along Nigeria\u2019s windy rivers of intrigues and mischief. Ngige\u2019s matter with ASUU revolves around his unbending devotion to perfectionism where others would ordinarily skate along. It is also about the untrammeled patriotism of an Igbo in high public office, often an orphan who must seek fastidiousness to avoid being sacrificed. Ngige wants everything done the right way, no short cut. He wants the 2009 agreement negotiated in such a manner that government can implement. He doesn\u2019t want a bogus agreement like it was in 2009, an agreement for sake of agreement that has led to this current impasse. He is over protective of the federal government finances as if they belong to him. He insists FG can\u2019t pay N1.9m monthly to a professor. That education currently takes nearly 40% of the federal salaries. This is the departure point with ASUU and perhaps, others who don\u2019t like his style. ASUU which has always been comfortable with Ngige, eulogizing him for pushing their cause and for living an example in having all his children in public university at home, suddenly made him an enemy. ASUU leadership mutters preference for Adamu who would wink at what Ngige would scowl at. Any surprise it accuses Ngige of standing in their way to Udoji awards! ASUU President, Emmanuel Osodeke\u2019s text of press conference on 19th July, 2022 made no pretences about this at all. Just as Adamu declassified FEC deliberations to make Ngige a fall guy, Osodeke squealed that Ngige asked ASUU in one of their meetings to piquet Education Ministry. The tone of his revelation exposes back stage politics. But there is nothing wrong in asking a union to piquet the office of its employer instead of a debilitating strike, after all, the NLC has piqueted Ngige, even blocking his house with a 40 feet petrol tanker. But let me ask as an aside, if Professor Osodeke read that statement before going to press, for I observed over 35 grammatical and typographical errors. Is it part of the failure of the revitalization fund? The standard has fallen so regrettably.\n\nNgige should squarely take the blame for misconstruing Nigeria\u2019s finances for his. Breathing down the neck of ASUU with lessons on dwindling government resources, citing ability to pay as key in collective bargaining, even in the face of longitudinal corruption, conjures an imaginary grinding axe between them. The rejection of 300% pay rise by Muzali Committee did not go down well with ASUU. Rejecting the 180% by Nimi Briggs is adding salt to injury. Perhaps Ngige should have tanked in and let the roof fall on the succeeding administration. But even at that, the urgency he accorded the Briggs Committee says a lot. Unfortunately, his six weeks-time frame was elongated to three months by the Education Ministry. Earlier, the Muzali report gathered dust also at the Ministry of Education until it became moribund, with Ngige kicking. Let Ngige also take the blame. Indeed, at the meeting of March 1, 2022, the newly posted Permanent Secretary of the Education Ministry, profusely apologized for the laxity of his Ministry over the years. He admitted that the ministry wasn\u2019t attending meetings and pushing issues as it ought to. It was at the opening session before the press exit. Ngige should also take the blame. Some of the industrial action won\u2019t last long if concerned parties treat it with dispatch. From absenteeism to under representation at meetings, Nigeria\u2019s bureaucracy is culpable somehow. Ngige has been sighted at the Accountant General\u2019s Office following up payment to ASUU because officers would sleep over it. He also advised ASUU to create the office of a secretary general and deputy who can do the leg work, that Professors might find deigning at the Ministries and relevant agencies. Now that the matter has reverted to Education, let\u2019s see how it also resolves the issue of payment platform where UTAS and IPPIS are at daggers drawn, even in the background of seeming government\u2019s reluctance to ditch IPPIS.\n\nAnule, a labour activist, writes from Abuja",

          "text": "The economic, social, political, and cultural characteristics and opportunities specific to being a woman or a man are referred to as gender. Different cultures have different ideas about what it means to be a woman or a man, and these ideas evolve with time. In terms of sex and sexuality, gender is the social expression of specific traits and roles that are assigned to distinct groups of people. People are treated unequally as a result of gender, which also interacts with other social and economic disparities. Other forms of discrimination, including those based on ethnicity, socioeconomic status, handicap, age, place of residence, gender identity, and sexual orientation, are interconnected with gender-based discrimination.\n\nSex, which refers to the diverse biological and physiological traits of men, females, and transgender people, and gender, which are related but distinct from one another, as well as chromosomes, hormones, and reproductive organs in transgender and intersex people. Despite being closely related, gender and sex are not the same as gender identity. A person\u2019s idea of their own gender is known as gender identity. A person\u2019s gender identification may agree or disagree with their assigned sex. Most people\u2019s gender identities and the numerous biological factors of sex are compatible with one another. The majority of the time, a person\u2019s gender expression matches their gender identification, however this is not always the case. The manifestation of behaviors, attitudes, and appearances that are typical of a particular gender role does not always represent the gender identification of the person expressing them.\n\nPeople\u2019s access to and experiences with healthcare are influenced by their gender. A person\u2019s access to healthcare information, support, and services, as well as the results of those encounters, can be limited or improved depending on how those services are organized and delivered. Like every other government in the world, the federal government has always argued that health care should be offered with quality, equity, and dignity while remaining inexpensive, accessible, and acceptable to all.\n\nWomen and girls have long been at persistent risk for poor health and wellbeing due to the difficulties of gender inequality, discrimination, and other associated issues. Access to health information and services around the world is always hampered more for women and girls than for men and boys. Mobility restrictions, lack of access to decision-making power, lower literacy rates, discriminatory attitudes of communities and healthcare providers toward the needs of women and adolescent girls, and a lack of education and awareness among healthcare service providers and health systems regarding the unique health needs and challenges of women and girls are some of these barriers.\n\nSince women and girls are more likely to become pregnant unintentionally, contract sexually transmitted diseases like HIV, develop cervical cancer, and suffer from malnutrition, lower vision, respiratory infections, and other illnesses, it is important to be aware of these hazards. Female genital mutilation, child, early, and forced marriage, as well as other harmful practices, pose a serious threat to women and girls. Women and girls also experience abnormally high rates of gender-based violence that is rooted in gender inequality. According to data from a World Health Organization (WHO) survey, one in three women worldwide had ever been the victim of non-romantic sexual assault or intimate partner abuse. It is urgent to take action because of this.\n\nThe health and wellness of boys and men have been significantly impacted by harmful gender norms and practices, such as those connected to inflexible ideas of masculinity. For instance, a false notion of masculinity may motivate boys and men to smoke, engage in risky sexual behavior, abuse alcohol, and refrain from seeking medical attention. The violence that boys and men commit and experience as a result of these gender norms is likewise a result of these norms. Their mental health is also severely impacted by them. Rigid gender standards also harm those who identify as people of different genders, who frequently experience violence, stigma, and discrimination as a result, especially in hospital settings. They are consequently more vulnerable to mental health issues like suicide as well as HIV.\n\nSamuel Julius, Programme Officer, Centre for Social Justice",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Allegations Of Cash For Promotion, Nepotism, Other Corrupt Practices Rock Nigerian Anti-Narcotics Agency, NDLEA",
          "text": "Some men and officers of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have been lamenting how the anti-narcotics agency, through its harmonisation and promotion exercise, has allegedly denied them promotion for about 20 years.\n\nThey said some of their colleagues recruited even five to eight years later have been promoted up to two times or more.\n\nSome sources within the agency told SaharaReporters that following the persistent cries of the aggrieved officers, the current leadership of the agency upon assumption of the office promised to clear the backlog of promotion arrears and correct the distortion of seniority ranks to instil discipline among the workforce in the agency.\n\n\n\nTo fulfil its promise, the management of the NDLEA on February 3, 2021, inaugurated a 7-man harmonisation expertise committee headed by Col. Yakubu Bako (rtd) who also serves as Special Adviser to the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer (CCEO) of the agency.\n\n\n\nThe committee was mandated to correct all issues with delayed promotion, and stagnation and produce a proper, accurate and credible seniority roll of all personnel of the agency.\n\nBut sources within the agency said that upon the release of its report, there were more complaints and outrage among officers and men of the agency as the Committee reportedly failed to do justice to the assignment given to it in accordance with the terms of reference in the circular upon its inauguration.\n\n\u201cIt was discovered that the Committee members had gone on to carry out a lopsided harmonisation that further placed the most recently recruited officers with political connections ahead of their seniors who had been stagnated for more than a decade before they were employed in the agency.\n\n\u201cSome members of the committee themselves also secured proper placements for themselves as well as their alliance but failed to do the same for less fortunate other old officers within the system. This further deepened the bad blood in the agency as officers continued to feel disillusioned,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nFollowing more complaints and widespread condemnation of the harmonisation committee\u2019s report by the long-serving officers who said they have only enjoyed single promotion whereas their juniors who were employed less than a decade ago enjoyed proper placement with two promotions, the CCEO, Brig-Gen. Buba Marina, through a circular with ref NDLEA/CCEO/45/VOL.VII, dated July 6, 2021, inaugurated a Review\n\nCommittee headed by the SA, Otunba Lanre Ipinmisho and five others to X-ray the alleged lopsided harmonisation.\n\n\n\nAlso on the committee were the Chairman of the Harmonisation Committee, Col. Yakubu Bako (rtd) and Head of Statistics and Records, Saidu Daniel, as observers.\n\n\n\nThe circular mandated the review committee to look into allegations arising from the harmonisation exercise including \u201cjunior officers who by reason of harmonisation have unjustifiably become senior to their superiors; officers who failed promotion examinations thrice but passed and were promoted at the fourth attempt in 2019 and whose next promotion should have been 2022 but promoted to higher ranks.\n\n\n\n\u201cInappropriate appointment of effective dates of promotion thereby conferring undue advantage; officers who were inadvertently omitted or overlooked, in the promotion exercise; officers who should have reached their promotable bar but without additional qualification have been promoted to higher ranks and any other act of omission or commission in the conduct of the exercise causing dissension among officers and me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe review committee was mandated to make recommendations as considered appropriate and submit its report within four weeks from the date of inauguration.\n\n\n\nThe committee chairman then called on all the aggrieved officers to submit their petitions or complaints to be addressed but one year after its inauguration, the outcome of the review exercise is yet to see the light of day.\n\n\n\nOne of the sources said, \u201cThese have consequently raised a lot of confusion and concerns in the minds of officers who have spent most of their service years in committed service and sacrifice to our dear nation, Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to print out that NDLEA is no stranger to harmonisation expertise as the officers of the agency have once enjoyed harmonisation since the inception of the elitist organisation. The first one was done in the year 2001 by the then Chairman/Chief Executive, a retired SSS Director, Alhaji Lafiaji, of which officers were properly placed on the rank commensurate with their years in service depending on their qualifications at points of entry.

          "text": "Some men and officers of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have been lamenting how the anti-narcotics agency, through its harmonisation and promotion exercise, has allegedly denied them promotion for about 20 years.\n\nThey said some of their colleagues recruited even five to eight years later have been promoted up to two times or more.\n\nSome sources within the agency told SaharaReporters that following the persistent cries of the aggrieved officers, the current leadership of the agency upon assumption of the office promised to clear the backlog of promotion arrears and correct the distortion of seniority ranks to instil discipline among the workforce in the agency.\n\n\n\nTo fulfil its promise, the management of the NDLEA on February 3, 2021, inaugurated a 7-man harmonisation expertise committee headed by Col. Yakubu Bako (rtd) who also serves as Special Adviser to the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer (CCEO) of the agency.\n\n\n\nThe committee was mandated to correct all issues with delayed promotion, and stagnation and produce a proper, accurate and credible seniority roll of all personnel of the agency.\n\nBut sources within the agency said that upon the release of its report, there were more complaints and outrage among officers and men of the agency as the Committee reportedly failed to do justice to the assignment given to it in accordance with the terms of reference in the circular upon its inauguration.\n\n\u201cIt was discovered that the Committee members had gone on to carry out a lopsided harmonisation that further placed the most recently recruited officers with political connections ahead of their seniors who had been stagnated for more than a decade before they were employed in the agency.\n\n\u201cSome members of the committee themselves also secured proper placements for themselves as well as their alliance but failed to do the same for less fortunate other old officers within the system. This further deepened the bad blood in the agency as officers continued to feel disillusioned,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nFollowing more complaints and widespread condemnation of the harmonisation committee\u2019s report by the long-serving officers who said they have only enjoyed single promotion whereas their juniors who were employed less than a decade ago enjoyed proper placement with two promotions, the CCEO, Brig-Gen. Buba Marina, through a circular with ref NDLEA/CCEO/45/VOL.VII, dated July 6, 2021, inaugurated a Review\n\nCommittee headed by the SA, Otunba Lanre Ipinmisho and five others to X-ray the alleged lopsided harmonisation.\n\n\n\nAlso on the committee were the Chairman of the Harmonisation Committee, Col. Yakubu Bako (rtd) and Head of Statistics and Records, Saidu Daniel, as observers.\n\n\n\nThe circular mandated the review committee to look into allegations arising from the harmonisation exercise including \u201cjunior officers who by reason of harmonisation have unjustifiably become senior to their superiors; officers who failed promotion examinations thrice but passed and were promoted at the fourth attempt in 2019 and whose next promotion should have been 2022 but promoted to higher ranks.\n\n\n\n\u201cInappropriate appointment of effective dates of promotion thereby conferring undue advantage; officers who were inadvertently omitted or overlooked, in the promotion exercise; officers who should have reached their promotable bar but without additional qualification have been promoted to higher ranks and any other act of omission or commission in the conduct of the exercise causing dissension among officers and me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe review committee was mandated to make recommendations as considered appropriate and submit its report within four weeks from the date of inauguration.\n\n\n\nThe committee chairman then called on all the aggrieved officers to submit their petitions or complaints to be addressed but one year after its inauguration, the outcome of the review exercise is yet to see the light of day.\n\n\n\nOne of the sources said, \u201cThese have consequently raised a lot of confusion and concerns in the minds of officers who have spent most of their service years in committed service and sacrifice to our dear nation, Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to print out that NDLEA is no stranger to harmonisation expertise as the officers of the agency have once enjoyed harmonisation since the inception of the elitist organisation. The first one was done in the year 2001 by the then Chairman/Chief Executive, a retired SSS Director, Alhaji Lafiaji, of which officers were properly placed on the rank commensurate with their years in service depending on their qualifications at points of entry. It was a widely acclaimed successful exercise as it was done strictly in adherence with civil service rule.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters was informed that the current frustration among the ageing workforce was further heightened when rumours filtered through about an alleged compilation of names for promotion exercise which was alleged to have been for the highest bidders.\n\n\n\nSome of the sources said they investigated the veracity of the claim and found that a circular for notification of the promotion exercise was published along with a list of names of candidates considered eligible.\n\n\n\nSome of the shortlisted officers allegedly paid a certain amount of money to some of the administrative staff who had shortlisted the candidates.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis new development was greeted with widespread condemnation as the pending report of the Harmonisation review committee had not been published and issues concerning distorted seniority list were still pending,\u201d a source said.\n\n\n\nThe sources told SaharaReporters that some candidates shortlisted for the 2022 promotion had recently enjoyed promotion already whereas others who had submitted memoranda to the review committee for consideration for proper placement were yet to be attended to.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo wonder the alleged fraudulent promotion exercise was suspended within 48 hours in a circular titled Re: List of Eligible Officers for 2022 Promotion Examinations CSA to CSN with reference number NDLEA/CON/SUB1/VOL.III/146.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is sad to note that while the CCEO, Brig.

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB.

          "title": "Nigerian tech ecosystem groans under rising inflation and fuel price",
          "text": "Nigerian consumers, who are among the poorest in the world, are miserable because they are increasingly required to pay more money to feed, move around, or be comfortable in their houses due to rising food prices, fuel prices, and bad power supply.\n\nJust last week, inflation in Nigeria rose to 18.6% in June 2022, according to the National Bureau of Statistics\u2019s (NBS) Consumer Price Index (CPI). This inflation, the highest since 2017, is powered by the high cost of diesel and gas, rising prices of food items, and the Russia-Ukraine war which drove up the prices of imported food items such as wheat. But it is not only consumers that are crumbling under the weight of the high cost of living, the businesses serving them are also having a hard time staying afloat during this period.\n\nCaught in the middle of all of this is an Abeokuta-based online food delivery startup, EatUp. EatUp, which started operations in 2020, serves students and the fast-growing working millennials and middle-class population of Ogun state, southwest of Nigeria, who seek to live a convenient life outside Lagos, the centre of economic activities in the country.\n\nSpeaking with TechCabal, EatUp co-founder and CEO, Abiodun Biobaku, said EatUp was founded out of a desire to provide the city\u2019s rising middle class with easy access to quality food and help restaurants bypass physical constraints that limit the number of eat-in consumers they can accommodate.\n\nEatUp partners with restaurants to allow it to deliver food to its consumers from their favourite restaurants in the shortest possible time, and in a nice package. \u201cWe claim to deliver happiness in new boxes, and that is what we\u2019ve been doing so far,\u201d Biobaku said.\n\nBut this has been increasingly difficult to achieve, Biobaku told TechCabal, as the inflation has forced the startup to increase its daily operation costs without a corresponding growth in profits. \u201cWe have watched inflation grow all the way from 14% to its current position right now, and trust me, it has taken a toll on our daily operation costs. We run daily operation costs, and in the last 30 months we have seen it grow by an average of 20%,\u201d the CEO told TechCabal.\n\nRising costs eating up earnings\n\nBiobaku said that, as an online food delivery business it always needs to be online to receive delivery from its website and different social media channels and websites, and even that doesn\u2019t come easy anymore as its internet provider partners have also increased their prices to weather the ravaging inflation.\n\nBiobaku explained that the rising inflation is hurting EatUp\u2019s earnings, mostly because partner restaurants are shortening their food rations in order to mark up their own profit margin, forcing customers to find cheaper alternatives. \u201cWe used to have customers or regular users who at least 3 times per day would have breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but we have now witnessed a reduction in the frequency of ordering,\u201d he said.\n\nIt also costs EatUp more to buy bikes for its riders, pay for data, packaging, and branding and get fuel for its riders\u2014all essential elements of its food delivery operations.\n\nWhile dealing with this, it also witnessed a drop in the number of orders each of its customers makes. \u201cWe currently boast of an 80% return rate for our over 16,000 customers, but the frequency at which they buy is reduced. At every point where there\u2019s an increase in inflation rates, the buying power of every user declines.\u201d\n\nWhile EatUp is searching for funding, it is wary of the value of the amount it is seeking as the prices of equipment and its burn rate are constantly increasing, so they will have to get \u201ccreative\u201d about cutting operating costs, Biobaku said.\n\nEatUp\u2019s daily office operation costs have shot up. It spends more on fuel to provide constant power for its customer experience team who needs to stay online to receive orders and monitor delivery to customers.\n\nEarlier in March, Nigeria\u2019s power grid collapsed twice, depriving thousands of businesses of power supply. At the same time, businesses had to scramble to get petrol due to fuel scarcity, and when they did it was at a higher price.\n\nEatUp is one of the thousands of businesses in the country whose operation costs shot up in the past few months due to fuel hikes and lousy power supply.\n\nWorking-class Nigerians in various cities were left to scramble for petrol for their cars before they could get to work. For those that do not have cars and rely on public transport, a 100% increase in transportation costs means they have to fork out more money from their salaries to transport themselves to work. EatUp\u2019s employees were not spared and Biobaku said that many started coming late to the office while spending more money to transport themselves to the office. This, coupled with the increasing cost of goods and services at the time, made their take-home much lower and Biobaku noted that this dwindling welfare affected the startup\u2019s productivity. At the same time, the startup\u2019s delivery riders groaned at the increasing amount of money they were spending on fuel.\n\nIn a bid to survive the ravaging inflation and increasing fuel prices that month, the food delivery startup had to mark up its delivery fee by 20%, from \u20a6500 to \u20a6600. The startup also established partnerships with fuel suppliers to purchase fuel at a discounted rate and distribute it to its fleet of 15 bikes. But that was only a palliative.\n\n\u201cIn March, we shot way above our expenses budget for the month and that has never happened to us throughout the 30 months of running this business,\u201d Biobaku lamented.\n\n\u201cOur solution to create accessible food for our consumers is being threatened,\u201d Biobaku said.\n\nAfter speaking with its bike riders who were clamouring for the startup to take action in the light of the latest fuel hike, and increase in the cost of spare parts, the startup decided to markup its delivery fee again, this time by 8.33% to \u20a6650. \u201cThis is the reality of every Nigerian business. You cannot have a steady price rate for so long,\u201d Biobaku said.\n\nTo bolster its chances of surviving, the startup has turned to rigorously cutting costs and developing additional money-making avenues. It cut costs by buying spare parts directly from manufacturers to bypass cost-adding middlemen and running strict office hours that see it open its office only when it is in use and putting out the lights immediately it is not. Its new money-making venture involves creating paid advertisements for partner restaurants and initiating the collection of service charges from them.\n\nBut Biobaku doesn\u2019t believe his startup is out of the woods yet; he believes he needs to be prepared for the economic hardship still ravaging the country. \u201cOne of the challenges we\u2019re having right now is that we\u2019ll be churning out new products in the nearest future. We need to make allowance for imbalances in the economy because these unforeseen circumstances are threatening to kill products even before we introduce them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Starting out his career as a software developer in 2001, Oluwapelumi Oyetimein realized that there was more to building a successful app than writing code. After trying his hands at other aspects of business, he decided to focus on marketing. Today, Oyetimein has made a name for himself in the industry, leading marketing and growth for several top companies.\n\nToday on How I Work, he talks about his transition from software development to marketing and how he consistently stays on top of his game.\n\nCurrent role: Marketing Lead at Umba\n\nLocation(s): Ibadan, Nigeria and Nairobi, Kenya\n\nCurrent computer: HP Omen 15\n\nCurrent mobile device: Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra\n\nDescribe how you work in one word: Remotely\n\nTell us briefly how you started out and how you got where you are today\n\nI actually started out as a developer and a lot of people don\u2019t know that. I think because over the past 10 years I\u2019ve done more of marketing, it slightly eroded into the background.\n\nI built my first website in 2001 and eventually went into proper desktop software development around 2007. But in 2011, I decided to switch to marketing.\n\nSo, I built a mobile app which got downloaded a bit, I think about 300,000 downloads at that time. And I think the turning point for me was entering a bus and seeing someone beside me using the mobile app that I built. I realized that a lot of developers who have these ideas don\u2019t learn how to build a business around it. So, I decided that I needed to figure out how proper businesses work and eventually be able to build a business on my own.\n\nI moved from development and started out with operations, then accounting, and then marketing. When I got to marketing, I said, \u201cokay, fine this, works better.\u201d And then with marketing, I started looking at what would be better for me considering my background, so I decided to stay in digital and doubled down on performance marketing and growth. That\u2019s where I\u2019ve played in the past five years now.\n\nWhat does your work entail? Walk us through a typical workday\n\nMy day starts with me going through the numbers on my different dashboards to see their performance, and then backtracking from the numbers to see what can be done to either optimize or keep stuff running.\n\nThen of course, there\u2019s the strategy and the brainstorming part. This is when I sit back and then look at what I can do differently. I have a whiteboard that I use to plan things out. Then I have a proper brainstorming session with my team where we look at the problems we can solve for the week. We sit down and take a couple of minutes to brainstorm and then start implementing that solution for the rest of the week. So it\u2019s data, strategy and then execution.\n\nAnd then of course there\u2019s the team management part where I have to work with other team members, and especially as a lead, ensuring that everybody working on the team is progressing in their own way and also delivering on what we all set out to do. I also have to manage up, because I also have bosses to whom I give updates on what we\u2019re working on and get feedback with respect to the business.\n\nWhat apps, gadgets, or tools can\u2019t you do without?\n\nFor gadgets, the one thing that I always have with me is my phone, and then other times, my laptop. I make a joke in my circles that wherever I am with my phone and laptop, that\u2019s my office.\n\nThe tools which I use on a day to day: Google Sheets for data analysis, the entire Google Workspace, so Sheets, Slides, and Docs. But outside of Google, I use tools like Hotjar, Customer.io, Notion, and Slack. I know a lot of people try to separate work from WhatsApp, but WhatsApp as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite shortcut or hack for getting things done?\n\nOne of the things I do is to ensure that everybody knows their part. If everybody knows what they\u2019re supposed to be doing, it makes your own work easier. I also take note of all the things that I have to do and then check them off as they\u2019re happening so that I have a sense of accomplishment on the things that I\u2019m doing.\n\nWhat task(s) do you dislike but still do?\n\nI hate repetitive stuff. It kills me, really, but then I still have to do them.\n\nFor example, something I\u2019m doing right now is ensuring that the campaigns we have running on Customer.io are documented properly with descriptions and all of that. It\u2019s repetitive because I have to go look at the campaign, copy and paste the link. It kills me but I still have to do it because we can\u2019t keep track without knowing what we have.\n\nHow do you recharge or take a break?\n\nI play games, watch movies and then I sleep. Sleep is very necessary because for people who look at screens a lot, the eyes get tired.\n\nWhat are you currently listening to, watching or reading?\n\nI\u2019m rewatching Suits. For what I\u2019m listening to, I just play any of the nineties or 2000s Hip Hop playlists on YouTube Music. By the way, I rank YouTube Music over all the other ones. Apple Music comes like a distant third after YouTube and Spotify.\n\nI\u2019ve not really had time to read proper books in a while, but there are blogs that I\u2019m looking at. CXL has a very in-depth blog and Ladder.io has really growth focused blogs.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\nOne is to \u201cbe at the right place, at the right time, doing the right thing\u201d. I\u2019ve always tried to live by that.\n\nThe second one is pinned to the top of my Twitter profile: \u201cDon\u2019t just show up, show up with the intention to be excellent. Don\u2019t just do stuff, do it to be the best.\u201d\n\nThe third one is that \u201ceverything is negotiable\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s a problem you\u2019re still trying to solve?\n\nInfluencing customer behaviour for the less digitally-savvy group of Nigerians. It can be quite a pain building a product and recycling the same set of people who are digitally savvy. How do we make certain behaviours second nature so that certain barriers are almost non-existent.\n\nUnfortunately, some people have made it worse by being criminally-minded so while surmounting the initial barrier, you also have to start talking about how safe digital products are. It can be quite exasperating.\n\nWho would you like to see answer these questions?\n\nBukayo Ewuoso, Senior Account Manager for West & Central Africa at Eskimi; Ntongha Ekot, Growth and Marketing professional; and Olumide Akinsola, Group VP of Growth and Marketing at QuickBus.",

You can also use it as a basis for securing financing. So that is a very different situation today and not only that. This also excludes the upstream assets,\u201d Kyari said on Wednesday.\n\nNoting that the country is endowed with oil and gas deposits, he said: \u201cWe think that when the evaluation is completed, we will probably have access to another $80 to $90 billion worth of upstream assets.\u201d\n\nHenry Adigun, an expert in the oil and gas sector, expressed optimism about the future of the NNPC, saying the road to full privatisation of the company is a gradual process.\n\n\u201cFor now, it could negotiate independent businesses and source for deals, and there will be more disclosures on how its operations are run.

Kasunmu appealed to all unregistered residents in the state to register by visiting www.lagosresidents.gov.ng, adding that after completing the online registration process, the applicant should visit the nearest LASRRA registration centre for biometrics capture to complete the process, which is free.\n\nShe urged those who registered before 2018 and those who have changed their names and/or addresses to make the necessary changes by validating their records using the same process, after which they will be contacted to pick up their new identity cards.\n\nKasunmu stressed that one of the reasons residents with the old cards require upgraded ones is because the new one is embedded with a multi-applet chip module that stores the updated biodata and biometric details of the resident for real-time validation and verification of identity.\n\nThe GM, who said the old identity card was for identification purposes only, explained that holders of the old card would need to update their records to obtain the new LAG ID Card, which has a validity period of five years.\n\nShe added that the new card allows flexibility to onboard more features and expand usability because of fast-changing technology trends.\n\nEngr. Kasunmu listed other advantages of the newly upgraded Lagos ID Card to include easy access to educational services for children and students at all levels of education, as well as quicker access to healthcare services from the state-owned facilities.\n\nThe General Manager emphasized that the LAG ID Card project is pivotal to the Lagos Smart City initiative for key purposes of planning and distribution of infrastructure, security, social protection, financial inclusion, and disaster and emergency response management, to mention a few.\n\nSome of the dignitaries that graced the event included members of the Lagos State House of Assembly, members of the State Executive Council, traditional rulers across the state, religious and community leaders, heads of market men and women, associations of artisans, corporate organisations and students, among others.",

It also allows citizens to seek out and circulate information, ideas, comments and opinions and hold those in authority to account. This right extends to the press, providing a platform for multiple voices to be heard.\n\n\u201cThe principle of freedom of expression and human rights must apply not only to traditional media but also to the Internet and all types of emerging media platforms, which will contribute to development, democracy and dialogue.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge that it is not an unfettered right and there are legal safeguards to protect those who may be vulnerable and prevent the abuse of these rights. However, around the world, there are governments and those wielding power who find many ways to obstruct it.\n\n\u201cThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Court reinforced the importance of this right with their recent judgement on the Twitter ban, where it held that access to Twitter, being one of the social media platforms of choice to receive, disseminate and impart information, is one such derivative right that is complementary to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression pursuant to the provisions of Article 9 (1) & (2) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (ACHPR) and Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Consequently, to derogate from such a right requires lawful justification.\n\n\u201cAlthough the court made its position clear, the civic space especially online has been shrinking for some time. We saw the passing of the Cybercrimes Act, the rejection of the digital rights and freedoms bill, the initiation of the hate speech and social media bills and now the draft Code of Practice for Interactive Computer Service Platforms/Internet Intermediaries and Conditions for Operating in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOur call to action goes to all stakeholders involved;\n\nTo the legislature: Pass the digital rights and freedom bill to guarantee the rights of Nigerian citizens in the digital age and to promote trust.\n\nThe Executive: Engage in a broader consultation to achieve an inclusive, democratic and rights-respecting approach to content and platform regulations \u2013 This consultation must be had at a level-playing field for all concerned stakeholders(Private sector, government, human rights organisation and digital rights organisations)\n\nCivil society and citizens must continue to hold government accountable and equally work together with the government for better outputs\n\nThe media must remain dogged to report violations and amplify the voices of citizens who daily use digital platforms to hold the government accountable.\n\nFinally, to our fellow citizens who hold the highest office in the land. Let us continue to partake in governance and hold all and sundry accountable.\u201d",

          "text": "The Yoruba Global Alliance, a leading Yoruba self-determination organisation, has decried the security situation in Nigeria, challenging President Muhammadu Buhari to live up to his reputation as a general.\n\nThe organisation which highlighted the recent video showing terrorists flogging abducted train passengers, wondered whether the hands of the country\u2019s security personnel are tied, while noting that the development demanded immediate action by any responsible government.\n\nThe alliance which spoke in a statement signed by High Chief Tola Adeniyi, its Chairman of Council, and Dr Amos Arogundade Akingba, its National President, further noted that Nigerians are becoming increasingly depressed about the happenings in the country.\n\n\u201cNigerians are saddened and depressed that their President in whom they entrusted their safety, security and general wellbeing could display the unprecedented indifference to their suffering and haplessness in the face of ceaseless attacks by bandits and terrorists across the country,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe Yoruba Global Alliance, a leading Self-Determination Organization along with our allies, the Yoruba Global Congress and the Yoruba Unseen as well as millions of Yoruba people at home and abroad call on Major General Muhammadu Buhari to live up to his reputation as a 2-star General to take immediate action to redeem his image.\n\n\u201cThe video which has gone viral showing the dastardly treatment being meted out to the remaining abductees of the March 28, 2022 train bombardment along Abuja-Kaduna highway calls for immediate action by any responsible government.\n\n\u201cThat some rag-tag jackals in human form could descend to this abysmal fiendish bestiality and inflict punishment by flogging their victims shows to what extent terrorists in Nigeria disregard the government and security agencies in the land.\n\n\u201cWhat is it that has tied the hands of the security agencies? The entire areas where terrorists are holding sway are located in plains or Savanah grassland where there are no thick bushes or forests. Government has on many occasions admitted they know the locations of these bandits. They know their phone numbers. They know their leaders. Dr Gumi and \u2018Jihadist\u2019 El-Rufai are their liaisons.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that Nigeria would allow their citizens to wallow in captivity right on Nigerian soil and governments, state and Federal, would be unconcerned and unsympathetic towards their plight.\n\n\u201cWe call on Buhari to imagine for a moment if his only son was among those being gleefully flogged or if his beautiful daughters including stooge Malami\u2019s 3rd wife were among those being bedraggled and humiliated in full glare of the camera. Atiku, Tinubu, Obi, Kwankwaso and other political shadow-chasers who are begging for people\u2019s votes while the same citizenry is going through hell should march to Buhari in Aso Rock and demand an immediate intervention from the President and the Armed Forces he commands as Commander-in-Chief.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari can use his executive powers to immediately flush out all the imported terrorists stationed in targets across the country, allow for immediate establishment of state police, stop the nonsensical ideas of RUGA and Water Bill, ban Okada operations throughout the country and perish the ruinous scheme of ethnic cleansing with view to handing over indigenous nationalities ancestral lands to some foreigners. If he can do these few things, his 7-year-old sins will be written off.\n\n\u201cThe horrendous humiliation, degradation and tortuous inhumanity which has pervaded the country\u2019s entire landscape should stop.\n\n\u201cWe wish to remind General Buhari that all those flatterers, court jesters, sycophants and political jobbers milling round him and deceiving him will not be there with him on the Day of Judgment. The Holy Qur\u2019an and the Holy Bible say so. In fact, come May 30 2023, they will all disappear into thin air!\n\n\u201cOur President\u2019s name is Buhari, nobody should rename him Nero at age 80.\u201d",

          "title": "MTEF 2023-2025 consultation confirms Nigeria\u2019s bankruptcy",
          "text": "By Eze Onyekpere\n\nOn Thursday, July 21, 2022, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning presented a consultation paper for the 2023-2025 Medium Term Expenditure Framework/Fiscal Strategy. This disclosure reviews the key highlights of the presentation and the logical next steps for Nigeria\u2019s development, economy and the welfare of citizens.\n\nThe consultation started with a review of the economic and budgetary performance for the period January to April 2022 and in some instances, the first half of the year 2022. Oil production averaged 1.32 million barrels per day (mbpd) in April as against the 1.60mbpd projected in the budget. This is exclusive of production for the repayment of arrears of cash calls. It will be recalled that Nigeria\u2019s Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries quota is 1.8mbpd. Oil price as at April averaged $103.60 per barrel (pb) as against the projected $73pb. The official exchange rate was N415.19 to $1 as against the projection of N410.15 to $1.Inflation rate stood at 17.71% as at May but has increased in June to 18.60%, while Gross Domestic Product growth stood at 3.11% as at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe oil production is below the projection in the budget and our assigned OPEC quota. The lame excuse for low oil production is the high incidence of crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism. However, the consultation paper failed to explain to Nigerians that it was FGN\u2019s mismanagement of the oil sector that led to the reduction in the quantity of oil produced. As at the end of 2015, the year the Buhari administration took over, Nigeria\u2019s oil lifting was 2.16mbpd, a little shortfall from the 2.28mbpd projected in the 2015 federal budget.\n\nThe industrial scale oil theft has been estimated to be in the neighborhood of 200,000 to 300,00bpd. 280,000bpd, being the difference between the projected 1.6mbpd and the actual production of 1.32mbpd, is a daily loss of $29m. For the 181 days in the first six months of 2022, this amounts to $5.249bn, being the overall market value before deduction of costs and sharing between the oil producing companies and the FGN based on the respective production agreements. This development questions the execution of the mandate of several security agencies including the Navy, National Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Nigeria\u2019s Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the Army, Nigeria Police and security companies hired by Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and oil producing companies.\n\nThe oil price of $103.60pb as against the budgeted $73pb is an additional $30.6pb. If Nigeria had met the projected production of 1.60mbpd, this would be extra revenue of $8.568m per day and $1.551bn for the first 181 days of the year. The increased oil price offered Nigeria a wonderful opportunity to fund the deficit proposed in the 2022 budget without borrowing or selling down assets. But this opportunity was missed.\n\nThe report on the exchange rate is simply a question of the Central Bank of Nigeria living in denial and presenting Nigerians with alternative facts which are not founded on reality and the lived experience of millions of Nigerians. Since the CBN is by law the authority charged with managing the exchange rate regime, it cannot continue to run the regime through a fixation different from the actual value of the naira. How can the naira that exchanges on the streets of Nigeria in excess of N620 to $1 at the date of the presentation of the consultation paper be stated to have a value of N415.19 to $1? Even if there should be a band or slight difference between the official and street value of the naira, a 33% difference in valuation is such a wide gulf. The inflation and growth indicators missed their budgeted targets. The current inflation rate of 18.60% is in excess of the budget proposal by 249 basis points. The actual growth figure of 3.11% is below the projection of 3.55%.\n\nFGN\u2019s retained revenue as at the end of April 2022, inclusive of the revenue of Government Owned Enterprises (GOEs) was N1.630trn and excluding GOEs, it came down to N1.493trn as against the prorated sum of N3.32trn. The former being 49% of the prorated sum while the latter is 44% of the prorated sum. Essentially, this is sub optimal performance.\n\nThe prorated expenditure by the end of April from the N17.32trn federal budget should be N5.77trn. The actual expenditure of N4.72trn is 82% of the prorated expenditure. However, considering actual revenue at N1.630trn, an extra unearned amount of N3.09trn, being the deficit for the period, was spent. The actual revenue is a mere 53% of the deficit financing of N3.09trn. The actual revenue as a percentage of overall expenditure is a paltry 35%. Now to the disaggregation of the expenditure, N1.94trn representing 41% of the expenditure went to debt service; N1.26trn being 27% went into personnel; capital expenditure took N773bn, being 16% of expenditure, while the unstated expenditure of N726.3bn took 15% of overall spending.\n\nThe explanation of the foregoing income and expenditure figures is that we spent more than we earned to service debt as we borrowed additional N310bn to complete debt service. Borrowing for financing debt service was never in the contemplation of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the enabling debt management framework law. It only authorised borrowing for capital expenditure and human development. Our combined personnel and capital expenditure is just 2% more than debt service. Essentially, FGN is bankrupt, insolvent, and unable to pay its debts or meet its due obligations. It is merely living on borrowed time and under the shield of sovereign immunity.\n\nIn a private sector company/outfit recklessly managed or which has traded recklessly as the managers of the Nigerian economy have done, the directors and managers would have been removed by the creditors and either a liquidator or interim board and managers appointed to recover debts/assets for creditors or help the company return back to normalcy and profitability. The directors and managers are the elected officials and their appointees who have managed Nigeria\u2019s economic, fiscal, petroleum, etc., regimes at the highest level. Yes, we have a Minister of Petroleum who has over seven years supervised the decay and rot in the sector to the point that we cannot meet our budgeted oil production which is lower than our OPEC quota. As to the lame excuse of oil theft and vandalism, the same Petroleum Minister is also the Commander-in-Chief of all security architecture in the country.\n\nFurthermore, those who kept reassuring us that we do not have a debt challenge but a revenue challenge, even when the facts have crystallized that we are heading towards insolvency, should explain to Nigerians how they deliberately led us to this bind. Assuming without conceding that it was a revenue challenge, nothing substantial was done to increase revenues.\n\nNigerians need to act now that we have hit rock bottom; to ask for new managers for the economy; to ask those currently in charge to step aside. If we fail to act now, by the time the lenders, reformers and economic restructurers of the last resort in multilateral institutions like the IMF/World Bank step in to restructure our economy, the pills may be too harsh to swallow. Surely, we are on our way to letting them in if we do not start the reform process at our pace and timing.",

The book excerpts were first reported by The New York Times.\n\nUnbeknownst to Kushner, Trump was aware of the cancer diagnosis: \u201cThe day before the surgery, Trump called me into the Oval Office and motioned for his team to close the door. \u2018Are you nervous about the surgery?\u2019 he asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know about it?\u201d Kushner asked him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the president,\u201d he said. \u201cI know everything. I understand that you want to keep these things quiet. I like to keep things like this to myself as well. You\u2019ll be just fine. Don\u2019t worry about anything with work. We have everything covered here,\u201d he quoted Trump as saying.\n\nKushner revealed the cancer diagnosis in his memoir, \u201cBreaking History: A White House Memoir,\u201d to be published on Aug. 23.\n\nKushner said a substantial part of his thyroid was removed during the surgery, which came during tense negotiations with China about a trade deal.\n\nKushner was a lead negotiator in a U.S.-brokered normalization deal between Israel and several Arab countries in 2020. He now runs the global investment firm, Affinity Partners, and has stepped away from politics for the time being.",

This was shared during the 2-day hybrid event held on July 13-14, 2022, at the prestigious Transcorp Hilton Hotel Abuja which had about 4,000 registered delegates from 55 countries.\n\nGiving a keynote address at the event on the theme, \u2018Rethink, Rebuild, Recover, Accelerating Growth for the SDGs\u2019, Mr. Schmale noted that the theme was apt, timely, relevant, and required given the economic regression across Africa occasioned by the pandemic, the volatilities caused by the Ukraine war and the fact there was just 8 years to go before 2030. He commended the leadership of the Sterling One Foundation stressing that there was need for intensive collaborations and partnerships among African leaders across the public and private sectors including the civil society groups to aid the achievement of not just the 2030 goals but also, the African Union\u2019s 2063 goals.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Mrs. Olapeju Ibekwe, CEO, Sterling One Foundation, noted that the summit had in-depth and insightful panel sessions on climate action, education access and funding, primary healthcare, youth and gender empowerment, impact investment and governance which all give a good appreciation of the 17 interlinked global goals.\n\nShe added that a recurring resolution that came through in all the panel sessions was the need for elimination of silo executions and embracing of collaborations by all sector players. Financing strategies, impact measurement and evaluation of such impact was also discussed as\n\nit was clear that the SDGs require financing to become a reality with an estimated amount of $1.3 trillion annually in Africa as shared by the UN and over $300 billion to block the gap in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cVarious deals from 4 African countries were brought to the summit\u2019s Deal Room with innovative solutions that cut across the education, health, construction, renewable energy, and food security sectors. Most of these businesses already have conditional commitments from our investors at the event and we expect to seal these deals in the coming weeks working with the investees. We will continue facilitating financing for purpose and profit driven business solutions that will help promote access to health and education for all while guaranteeing returns for impact investors locally and globally\u2019\u2019, she added.\n\nShe noted that the Foundation was already working with various partners and will continue in this light as the event was organized in partnership with the United Nations Global Compact Network Nigeria, Sterling Bank, the Coca Cola Company, VFD Group, the Impact Investors Foundation, Giving.ng, the Nigeria Climate Innovation Center (NCIC), the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), Ventures Africa, Proshare and Tech Cabal.",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP has filed a suit against the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC for \u201cfailing to prosecute those suspected to have participated in vote-buying and electoral bribery\u201d in the June 18 governorship election in Ekiti State.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSERAP In a statement on Sunday, cited reports that suggested there was a brazen pattern of vote-buying and electoral bribery at several polling units in the state, including bargaining prices for votes and payments made in uncompleted buildings.\n\nThe group in the suit seeks \u201can order to compel INEC to obtain detailed information about reports of vote-buying by the three leading political parties in the Ekiti election.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSERAP is also seeking to compel INEC to promptly and effectively prosecute those arrested, and bring to justice anyone who sponsored, aided and abetted act.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that, \u201cVote buying is a threat to fair and representative elections. Vote buying amounts to undue influence and improper electoral influence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cWealthy candidates and their sponsors ought not to be allowed to profit from their crimes. Arresting and prosecuting vote buyers will end widespread impunity for vote buying ahead of the February 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nSERAP is arguing that, \u201cVote buying encourages poor governance and weakens citizens\u2019 capacity to hold their \u2018elected officials\u2019 accountable for their actions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSERAP is also arguing that, \u201cVote buying undermines the ability of INEC to discharge its responsibilities under Section 153 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution (as amended), paragraph 15(a) of the third schedule of the Constitution, and the Electoral Act 2022.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also arguing that, \u201cCorruption of the ballot box intrudes on the freedom of Nigerian voters to make up their own minds. Vote buying and other forms of electoral corruption freeze out the less wealthy candidates and parties.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSERAP is arguing that, \u201cWhen political candidates or their sponsors decide to buy the support of the people rather than contest fairly for their votes, there are possibilities that such candidates and sponsors will show a disregard for democratic rules and a disposition to adopt illegal means becomes inevitable.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Opeyemi Owolabi, read in part: \u201cVote buying is entirely an act of election malpractice connected with vested interest since an election can be said to be free and fair when it is devoid of vote buying.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEnding impunity for vote-buying and electoral bribery would contribute to free and fair elections. A corruption-free electoral process is essential for building public confidence in the electoral process, and the credibility and legitimacy of the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the people\u2019s most sacred rights is the right to vote. INEC has a constitutional and statutory responsibility to ensure the effective exercise of the right of all eligible voters to participate in their own government in free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPreventing and combating vote buying and electoral bribery would advance the people\u2019s right to vote and to participate in their own government, as well as bolster the ability of INEC to effectively discharge its constitutional and statutory mandates.\u201dhttps://www.tvcnews.tv/2022/07/nubess-gives-fg-14-days-ultimatum-to-resolve-asuu-strike/\n\n\u201cMany years of allegations of vote-buying and electoral bribery and entrenched impunity of perpetrators have undermined public confidence in the electoral process.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cProsecuting allegations of vote-buying and electoral bribery would be entirely consistent with the Nigerian Constitution, the Electoral Act, and the country\u2019s international human rights anti-corruption obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgents of the three dominant political parties in the state, namely All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Social Democratic Party (SDP), were reportedly involved in buying votes across the state, and voters offered as high as N10,000 in exchange for their votes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution provides in Section 14(1)(c) that, \u2018the participation by the people in their government shall be ensured in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSection 145(2) of the Electoral Act provides that, \u2018a prosecution under this Act shall be undertaken by legal officers of the Commission or any legal practitioner appointed by it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",
