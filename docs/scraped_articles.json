          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nOver one billion people aged 12 to 35 years risk losing their hearing due to prolonged and excessive exposure to loud music and other recreational sounds, the World Health Organisation has said.\n\nGovernments, WHO noted, should begin to address the challenge of excessive exposure to loud music in the communities, warning that it has devastating consequences on the physical and mental health of people.\n\nThe WHO made the call in a statement issued ahead of the 2022 World Hearing Day, adding that young people are more at risk of hearing loss as a result of loud music because they are more exposed to it.\n\nThe global health agency says it has issued a new international standard for safe listening at venues and events, noting that this standard applies to places and activities where amplified music is played.\n\n\u201cMillions of teenagers and young people are at risk of hearing loss due to the unsafe use of personal audio devices and exposure to damaging sound levels at venues such as nightclubs, bars, concerts and sporting events,\u201d said WHO\u2019s Director for the Department for Noncommunicable Diseases, Dr. Bette Mikkelsen.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe risk is intensified as most audio devices, venues and events do not provide safe listening options and contribute to the risk of hearing loss. The new WHO standard aims to better safeguard young people as they enjoy their leisure activities.\u201d\n\nThe Global standard for safe listening at venues and events, WHO said, highlights six recommendations for implementation to ensure that venues and events limit the risk of hearing loss to their patrons while preserving high-quality sound and an enjoyable listening experience.\n\nThe six recommendations are a maximum average sound level of 100 decibels; live monitoring and recording of sound levels using calibrated equipment by designated staff; optimizing venue acoustics and sound systems to ensure enjoyable sound quality and safe listening; making personal hearing protection available to audiences including instructions on use.\n\nOther recommendations are access to quiet zones for people to rest their ears and decrease the risk of hearing damage, and provision of training and information to staff.\n\nThe new standard was developed under WHO\u2019s Make Listening Safe initiative which seeks to improve listening practices, especially among young people, drawing on the latest evidence and consultations with a range of stakeholders including experts from WHO, government, industry, consumers, and civil society.\n\nThe UN body noted that while exposure to loud sounds causes temporary hearing loss or tinnitus, prolonged or repeated exposure can lead to permanent hearing damage, resulting in irreversible hearing loss.\n\nWHO encourages governments to develop and enforce legislation for safe listening and raise awareness of the risks of hearing loss.\n\nIt also urged the private sector to include WHO\u2019s recommendations for safe listening features in their products, venues, and events.\n\n\u201cGovernments, civil society and private sector entities such as manufacturers of personal audio devices, sound systems, and video gaming equipment as well as owners and managers of entertainment venues and events have an important role to play in advocating for the new global standard,\u201d said Dr Ren Minghui, WHO Assistant Director-General.\n\n\u201cWe must work together to promote safe listening practices, especially among young people,\u201d WHO said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Bashir Bello, KANO\n\nKano State chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC has on Thursday kicked against plans by the state government to cut take-home pay of workers for the month of February.\n\nThe State Chairman, Kabiru Ado Minjibir while briefing newsmen on its stand on Thursday at the labour house, said it is disassociating itself from the government plan.\n\nMinjibir hinted that the government said it could not pay the N30,000 new minimum wage to Kano State workers as a result of short fall in Federation Accounts Allocation Committee, FAAC allocation shared among the states and as a result of that resort to use the April 2021 salary template where some percentage was deducted from state workers pay while Local Government workers were paid the N18,000 minimum wage.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe were invited for a meeting with the government under the office of the State Head of Civil Service and precided over by the Head of Service, Barrister Binta Ahmad that the state government could not be able to pay the 30,000 minimum wage as a result of short of funds received from FAAC Allocation.\n\n\u201cBinta revealed that the sum of five hundred and fourtyfour billion naira (N500,44,000,000, 000) was distributed across the states of the federation for the Month of January 2022 as against the six hundred and ninety nine billion naira (N699,000,000, 000) distributed for the month of December 2021, and so they resort to pay workers using the template of April 2021 salary where some percentage was deducted from state workers pay while Local Government workers were paid the N18,000 minimum wage.\u201d\n\nMinjibir stated that by extension, if this payment is made, obviously, there\u2019s going to be a shortfall on the remittance to Kano State Pension Funds Trustees and obviously the payment of monthly pensions will also be reduced.\n\n\u201cAfter this, we met with all leaders of various public sectors in the State on the development with the view to deliberate on the matter and get back to the government.\n\n\u201cWe went back to the government with three recommendations which include; first of all, the state should go ahead and pay the April 2021 salary but with an agreement signed by both parties that the difference should be paid to the workers along the March 2022 salary if the FAAC allocation reach N700billion.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we recommended that a joint committee between the State Government and the Labour should be set up to go for fact finding from neighbouring states like Kaduna, Jigawa, Bauchi and Sokoto to find out how they cope to augment the payment of salary even when there is low distribution of FAAC allocation across the country because we never hear from these states that workers\u2019 salary are reduced based on shortfall in the allocation.\n\n\u201cThirdly, that government intensify efforts on the Internally Generated Revenue, IGR and try to avoid all leakages so that, that surplus could be used to augment whatever deficit in the payment of salary henceforth and the government should also imbibe the culture of saving and as such could help in situation like this and in payment of pension.\n\n\u201cBut alas! They agreed with the second and third recommendations but refused to accept the first one which stated that the deducted amount from workers salary be paid subsequently since the FAAC too will not reimburse them.\n\n\u201cIn line with these, we want to inform all workers in the State and the general public that the NLC and all leaders of other unions in the State disassociate itselves from this decision.\n\n\u201cWe have have written to the national body and call on all workers to remain calm while we await further directives,\u201d Minjibir however stated.",

He explained the goals of NARC, as well as the centre\u2019s reason for occasionally bringing in \u2018The Town\u2019 to interact with course participants.\n\nImmediately he was introduced by the Lead Faculty for the Strategic Management and Policy Course, Dr Okey Ikechukwu, Obi held his audience spellbound with his experiences as governor, and how he managed to get the resources he used in achieving the much he did, saying: \u201cWhether we agree or not, failure of leadership is taking a huge toll on us as a nation, and it could be worse if we do not put the right and committed people incharge of the affairs of critical sectors. Education, Health and provision of basic infrastructure were my main goals and I was able to record success because we planned our programs using a universally certified development formula.\n\n\n\nObi described owing pensioners and going about wasting money on useless social projects as criminal, stressing that \u201cowing people at the most difficult times when the opportunities are less is the worst thing to do to them.\n\n\n\nThe director general, in concluding, thanked Obi for always being ever ready to share his thoughts and experiences with the centre, in the latter\u2019s endeavour to fulfil its mandate of developing high calibre human capital for strategic leadership, national security and holistic national development.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

It must equally be conducted with extant police protocols which emphasises civility to members of the public and must be laced with the highest level of professional decorum. Such must not also be turned into an avenue for extortion.\n\n\u201cConsequently, as strategic leaders, you could be held liable for any violation of this Force policy. You are, therefore, strongly advised to go back to your commands, review this development and ensure that your operations conform strictly to the vision of my leadership.\n\n\u201cAs mentioned during the recently concluded retreat and conference, it is anticipated that the Force would be further challenged by the enhanced political activities that are associated with the upcoming 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThe import of this is that beyond our routine anti-crime activities, we have to be prepared not just to deal with politically-related infractions that could ensue, but also with preparations ahead to guarantee the security and credibility of the elections.\u201d\n\nBaba advised officers to get prepared for the 2023 general election, saying the police authority would liaise with the leadership of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), civil society organisations (CSOs) and the Nigeria Police Legal Chambers to dissect the provisions of the recently amended Electoral Act.\n\nThe IGP also said between January 2022 and now, collated crimes statistics revealed that 36 terror elements, 78 murder suspects, 110 armed robbery suspects, 50 suspected kidnappers and 150 suspected cultists were arrested during various police operations across the country.\n\n\u201cAside these, 204 kidnapped victims were successfully rescued, while 155 firearms of various descriptions and 1,561 live ammunitions were also recovered,\u201d he added.\n\nBaba decorated a police officer, Mary Aina (aka Iron Abbey), who won the World Boxing Foundation (WBF) International Super Bantamweight title belt at the East Sussex, Landon, with her new rank \u2013 from Police Constable to Corporal.",

Such an adverse scenario must be prevented through proactive monetary policy.\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Capital Securities Limited and an economic analyst, Rotimi Olubi, said electioneering for 2023 general elections will further increase foreign portfolio outflows and cause Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) to remain on the sidelines.\n\nHe listed other factors expected to cause further outflow, including rate hikes and capital controls by the monetary authorities.\n\nOlubi added that the foreign exchange would likely come under strong pressure as interest rate hikes in advanced economies would result in portfolio outflows from emerging markets.\n\nHe noted that domestic investors would be the key players responsible for the movement of the market and liquidity. \u201cElectioneering, rate hikes, and capital controls by the monetary authorities are expected to cause further foreign portfolio outflows and cause FPIs to remain on the sidelines.\n\n\u201cEven as the economy continues its recovery, corporate earnings of companies in the consumer goods and industrial goods sector are expected to be impacted by high input costs caused by high inflation and higher cost of capital due to interest rate hikes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInterest income of financial services institutions such as banks are expected to rise in Nigeria if interest rates rise as expected. This is because the U.S could decide to raise interest rates.\n\n\u201cThis act by the U.S could lead to downward pressure on commodity prices, drop in global liquidity, increase in the cost of funds from the international debt market and due to the fact that Ukraine and Russia are still having conflicts, oil prices might go up and production could decrease.\n\n\u201cCompanies in the oil and gas sector are expected to have a solid year driven by strong oil prices, increasing global oil demand and OPEC+ cuts,\u201d Olubi said.\n\nHe added that with relatively low infection rates and fatalities from the pandemic, the likelihood of an economic shutdown was non-existent.",

          "text": "By Gbade Ogunwale and Okodili Ndidi, Abuja\n\nThere is security threat, says PDP\n\nPolitical spending pushes up demand for dollar\n\nInsecurity and neutrality of security agencies are key factors that will shape next year\u2019s general election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said yesterday.\n\nThe election umpire is concerned that millions, especially Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), may be disenfranchised unless threats are neutralised.\n\nTerrorism and banditry have displaced many people in the Northeast, Northwest and Northcentral.\n\nMany people are living in IDP camps and others have fled their homes and communities.\n\nThe United State Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, said the attention of the world will be on Nigeria ahead of and during the polls.\n\nThe European Union Election Observation Mission to Nigeria, which visited PDP chairman Dr. Iyorchia Ayu at the party secretariat in Abuja, said it would take steps to ensure that concerns raised by the main opposition party are addressed.\n\nINEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye and Leonard spoke at a town hall meeting hosted by the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE).\n\nIt was organised with support from U.S. Embassy in Nigeria, with the theme: \u201cAgenda setting for sustainable democratic culture.\u201d\n\nOkoye believes that despite the new Electoral Act, next year\u2019s elections will be faced with challenges.\n\nOn how insecurity will affect the polls, he said: \u201cSo many of the IDPs are in the houses of friends and relatives and have lost their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs).\n\n\u201cIt is next to an impossibility to recreate their constituencies and polling units.\n\n\u201cGrowing insecurity in several parts of the country and the increasing number of IDPs will pose challenges.\n\n\u201cThis is because Section 47(1) of the Electoral Act provides that a person intending to vote in an election shall present himself with his voter card to a presiding officer for accreditation at the polling unit in the constituency in which his name is registered.\n\n\u201cSome of these persons are no longer in their constituencies and can no longer access their polling units and so many of them have lost their PVCs.\n\n\u201cWhile it is easy to recreate constituencies and polling units in clustered IDP camp, it is next to an impossibility to do so for persons staying in scattered locations.\u201d\n\nHe said INEC would surmount the challenge by printing new PVCs for IDPs and recreating their polling units in their camps to enable them to vote, depending on proximity to their state and federal constituencies.\n\nThis, he said, is in accord with Section 24(1) of the Electoral Act, which provides: \u201cIn the event of an emergency affecting an election, the Commission shall, as far as practicable, ensure that persons displaced as a result of the emergency are not disenfranchised.\u201d\n\nOkoye said Commission was at the terminal phase of its Continuous Voters Registration (CVR), adding that insecurity was a factor in getting more Nigerians to register.\n\n\u201cThere are so many communities that are still inaccessible to our registration officers.\n\n\u201cIn the next few weeks, the Commission will roll out modalities for the further devolution and rotation of the CVR to our registration areas and the security of our personnel and the registrants are fundamental to the success of the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to register all eligible registrants but will not expose our staff to unnecessary danger. We will roll out and roll back depending on the security situation in different parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye believes that successful general elections will depend on how quickly security agencies \u201cdegrade if not neutralise the security threats and challenges in different parts of the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cVoting and the exercise of democratic mandate may not be the priority of persons enveloped in a climate and atmosphere of fear and anxiety,\u201d the INEC commissioner said.\n\nOkoye urged the media to continue to highlight the possible solutions to the security challenges and to hold the government accountable.\n\nHe was of the view that the media has a critical role in safeguarding the electoral process.\n\nOur concerns, by PDP\n\nDr Ayu said PDP had misgivings about the neutrality of the security agencies, going by their actions in previous elections.\n\nAddressing the EU delegation, he accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) government of weakening the democratic process and institutions and manipulating agencies that ought to be neutral.\n\nAyu said: \u201cWe have consistently worked hard as a broad-based political party, mobilised people, not just to canvass for votes, but to ensure that we defend the votes against any anti-democratic tendencies.\n\n\u201cIn spite of willingly handing over to the current ruling party in 2015, we have seen a decline in those values which we promoted as a political party, including the establishment and creation of certain institutions that were meant to strengthen democracy in this country.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are very worried that instead of strengthening the democratic process to serve the people of this country, we are seeing a sustained decline in those democratic processes in the conduct of elections and use of security services to attack judges and other citizens, instead of protecting them and preserving the electoral process.\n\n\u201cYou have the 2019 election report, which you have read. It showed clearly some of those problems that we are complaining about and which we will keep complaining about as long as these practices are sustained.\n\n\u201cWe believe that justice was not done in the 2019 election.\n\n\u201cNow that we are moving towards another election in 2023, it\u2019s very important that we stress the need for the electoral umpire to be genuinely independent.\u201d\n\nAyu urged the EU election observer team to take special interest in the upcoming governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun states.\n\nHead of the EU delegation, Ms. Maria Arena, said the team made 30 recommendations in its 2019 general election report.\n\nAccording to her, the visit to the PDP leadership was part of a follow-up process to assess how the recommendations have been taken on board by different authorities in Nigeria.\n\nArena said the delegation would meet with as many stakeholders as possible, including the civil society, the media, the government and other parties.\n\n\u2018All eyes on Nigeria\u2019\n\nLeonard said the eyes of the world will be on Nigeria this year and early next year as the country prepares to choose new leaders.\n\nShe said the NGE had the responsibility of promoting democracy.\n\n\u201cYour leaders have been consistent in calling for the respect of presidential term limits, for example, and they have been quick to condemn military coups in West Africa and the rest of the continent,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Ambassador said beyond public pledges supporting freedom and democracy, the editors and members of the civil society groups must delve deeper into underlying factors that erode faith in democracy.\n\nShe explained that patronage politics, corruption, inequality, and the failure of many democratic governments to deliver for their citizens fuel public and media doubts about the democratic model, causing them to lose hope and cynically accept the status quo as inevitable and normal.\n\nLeonard said: \u201cOne way to restore public confidence in democracy is through free and fair elections.\n\n\u201cThe eyes of the world will, therefore, be on Nigeria this year and early next year as you prepare to choose a new president and transition to a new government.\n\n\u201cWe were pleased that last week President Muhammadu Buhari signed Nigeria\u2019s long-awaited Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law, ensuring adoption of a number of long-sought-after reforms to the electoral process, including the electronic transmission of election results from polling places.\n\nNGE President, Mustapha Isah, underscored the constitutional role of the media in Section 22, noting that \u201call aspects of good governance are facilitated by a strong and independent media\u201d.",

          "title": "Oil Price Surges Above $113 as OPEC Keeps Supply Unchanged",
          "text": "\u2022Nigeria gets 1.735m bpd allocation for April, petrol scarcity persists\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\nCrude oil price yesterday continued its upswing as Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark crude, rose above $113 per barrel for the first time in close to eight years. This was as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) resolved to continue the addition of a measured volume of 400,000 barrels per day, agreed with its allies, OPEC+, in August last year.\n\nThe producers\u2019 group, which decided on the quota for member countries for April, allocated Nigeria 1.735 million barrels per day as its production for next month. But it remains doubtful whether Nigeria would be able to meet its allocation for the month, having consistently, for close to a year, been unable to supply the global market with its required volume.\n\nLast month alone, the country recorded a deficit of over 300,000 barrels per day, even though the total quantity of oil it drilled for that month, roughly 1.4 million bpd, was its best in several months.\n\nThe increasing crude oil price also implies that the controversial subsidy payments in the country would rise when the computation for this month is done, since the pump price of petrol in Nigeria, which does not refine a drop of the product, has a positive relationship with the international crude oil prices.\n\nAlthough by now, Nigeria should be saving as much as $50 per barrel that it sells, the reverse appears to be the case, as the cost of under-recovery continues to soar.\n\nIn January 2022 alone, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited claimed that it expended N210.38 billion on petrol subsidy.\n\nFurthermore, due to the challenge, last month, the oil company failed to remit any money to the federation account, a development that would definitely hamper the ability of sub-nationals to meet their financial obligations.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari recently asked the National Assembly to approve the N2.557 trillion budget for petrol subsidy in 2022.\n\nHowever, aside Brent, which exceeded $113 per barrel, recording over 7.69 per cent hike at the time of writing this report, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the United States benchmark, also surged to $111.24 per barrel, with about 7.57 per cent increase.\n\nIt came as Russia\u2019s flagship crude oil, which was offered for sale at a record discount, got no bidders, the latest indication that trading of oil from the country\u2019s western ports is grinding to a halt.\n\nBut despite the tightening global oil market, OPEC yesterday resisted pressure from the United States and some of its allies to increase supply, although prices were already under pressure before the Russia invasion of Ukraine last week.\n\nThough the United States and other member states of the International Energy Agency (IEA), in a bid to cool prices, announced a strategic oil reserve release, so far it has done little to tame rampaging oil market prices.\n\nDespite calls to ramp up production, OPEC alliance kept additional output at 400,000 barrels per day.\n\nHowever, it did not come as a surprise to those who followed activities of the oil cartel closely, since the producer group had insisted that supply was not the problem. OPEC alone accounts for around 40 per cent of the world\u2019s oil supply.\n\nA release after the 26th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting, concluded yesterday, explained that the market remained balanced and did not need further distortions. It noted that following the conclusion of the 26th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting, the current oil market fundamentals and the consensus on its outlook \u201cpointed to a well-balanced market\u201d.\n\nOPEC stressed, \u201cThe current volatility is not caused by changes in market fundamentals, but by current geopolitical developments.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cThe OPEC and participating non-OPEC oil-producing countries decided to: reaffirm the decision of the 10th ministerial meeting on 12 April 2020 and further endorsed in subsequent meetings, including the 19th ministerial meeting on 18 July 2021.\n\n\u201cIt reconfirms the production adjustment plan and the monthly production adjustment mechanism approved at the 19th ministerial meeting and the decision to adjust upward the monthly overall production by 0.4 mb/d for the month of April 2022.\n\n\u201cOPEC reiterates the critical importance of adhering to full conformity and to the compensation mechanism taking advantage of the extension of the compensation period until the end of June 2022.\u201d\n\nThe Sanusi Barkindo-led organisation stated that compensation plans should be submitted in accordance with the earlier agreed procedure, and it scheduled its next meeting for March 31.\n\nPetrol Scarcity Persists\n\nHowever, in spite of the deteriorating fuel supply situation across the country, the NNPC yesterday said it currently has over 1.7 billion litres of the product in stock.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES), which entered its fourth day yesterday, Group Managing Director, NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, told journalists that the situation was being worsen by motorists who are buying more than they require.\n\nThe NNPC boss noted that loading across the nation was now taking place 24 hours a day, explaining that the company has enough volume to meet the country\u2019s current demand.\n\n\u201cWe want to assure Nigerians that we have adequate supply of petroleum products. Currently, we have over 1.7 billion litres of petrol, both marine and land, and that also means that we have capacity to load from all depots.\n\n\u201cWe have several loading points in all depots. This will ensure that spaces (gap) created by panic buying, which is what you are seeing in the fuel stations, today will be filled,\u201d he stated.\n\nKyari argued that typically, people in the kind of situation Nigeria had been confronted with, would ordinarily buy in excess of what they need, opining that additional supply would resolve address the situation. \u201cI am very sure very soon, you will see relief on this,\u201d he assured.\n\nHe emphasised that neither the government nor the NNPC had any plan to adjust the pump price or ex depot prices of petrol, and therefore called on marketers to sell at the prices approved by government.\n\nHe stated that the NNPC was engaging the unions in the industry and have agreed that NNPC and the midstream/downstream authority will carry out necessary sanctions on anyone found doing underhand business.\n\n\u201cWe have no shortage in the country, cars are taking longer to buy. We sincerely apologise for the pain but we will get out of this soon,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged motorists to trust the NNPC that it has adequate supply in-country, stating that the panic buying remains the problem. \u201cLet them make sure they don\u2019t buy what they don\u2019t need because when they come back, they will still find petroleum products,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GMD said soon the directive not to sell petrol in jerry cans would be relaxed, noting that the decision was taken to ensure safety in the filling stations and to avoid overcrowding.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that those who will ordinarily buy N3,000 are buying N13,000\u201d, he said, adding that it was slowing down the system.\n\nKyari noted that although supply disruptions cannot be stopped totally, recovery time remains very critical. According to him, the NNPC was working with the security agencies to ensure that black marketers stop inflicting hardship on Nigerians.\n\nEarlier, while speaking during the main programme, the NNPC GMD noted that for over 50 years, investment in the oil and gas industry had been stifled because the right framework was absent.\n\n\u201cThis is an energy company and enabler, a company for all of us. But more importantly, the company that is expected to support energy security.\n\n\u201cAnd that can\u2019t work except we collaborate and have the right climate. I\u2019m sure all of us are aware of the struggles that we\u2019ve had, getting the right kind of fiscal and regulatory framework in place to make sure that companies perform in the best manner possible and in the best business environment that is possible.\n\n\u201cIn reality, we have struggled with fiscal change, getting the right environment for business since 1967. That means that we have frozen our environment for close to 50 years, that we haven\u2019t changed essentially for close to 50 years.\n\n\u201cAnd whether intended or not, that took its impact and took its toll. And it\u2019s very visible in our recent history, in the sense that in the last 10 years, investment inflows into Sub Saharan Africa and our country was probably about $3 billion to $5 billion.\n\n\u201cIn reality, we have done nothing. And the reason is very simple: You don\u2019t have the right fiscal structure, you don\u2019t have the right climate, regulatory stability, and the right framework where people can predict what will happen next.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why the cumulative effect is that that\u2019s under-investment, there\u2019s lack of growth. And of course, it produced some other results. Part of it is that many of our partners now in all their ramifications, nobody invested substantially, even for new projects.\n\n\u201cMany of these structures now, when you look at them, you think you are in the war front, and also many of them look like museums. And I think they\u2019re not designed to function, even in the best of companies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that with the passage of the new legislation, which he said was resisted in the past because people did not want to lose influence and control, there is now an opportune moment to turn things around.\n\nWith the new law , which has made the NNPC a commercial company that will deliver dividend to its shareholders, Kyari assured that the company would take off fully in July of this year.\n\n\u201cThe combination of this means that this company must operate in the world class standards, must be fully automated, must imbibe transition and must recognise the necessity for energy transition,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe stated that the company was shopping for the right partners, noting specifically that Nigeria\u2019s gas resources must be developed as a transition fuel.\n\nSpeaking on the topic: \u201cData to Barrel\u201d Chief Executive, Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Agency (NURPC), Gbenga Komolafe, said the industry must acquire big data, to explore, capture, develop, produce hydrocarbon, and monitor reservoir performance and surveillance in real time.\n\nHe explained that the upstream industry was facing challenges that require the need for mass data in high-precision reservoir modelling and surveillance.\n\n\u201cConsequently, superb computing power, high-performance storage capacity, powerful and integrated mapping applications are required to be able to turn big data into barrels and value for money.\n\n\u201c Hence, the key challenge for service providers in producing oil companies is to demonstrate the value that gathering additional data will bring to the asset. So, it is not just about gathering more data, but equally about the Value of the Information (VOI) from the data gathered,\u201d he argued.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Lawan, Omo-Agege, some APC senators endorse Adamu for national chairman\n\n\u2022Party leadership yet to meet on Electoral Act, says Akpanudoedehe\n\n\u2022Sheriff: I\u2019m not aware Buhari is endorsing Adamu\n\nHammed Shittu in Ilorin and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAhead of its March 26 national convention, the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has begun to set machinery in motion for the exercise. The latest move was the constitution of an eight-member committee on the zoning of party offices, headed by Kwara State Governor Abdulrahaman AbdulRazaq. National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator John Akpanudoedehe, disclosed this in a statement, yesterday.\n\nHowever, Akpanudoedehe hinted, in a telephone conversation, that the leadership of the ruling party had yet to meet over the Electoral Act recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nBut as the convention team readied to get the ball rolling, principal officers of the Senate and some senators of the ruling party, led by President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, his deputy, Omo-Agege said they had endorsed the candidature of Senator Abdullahi Adamu (Nasarawa West) for the office of National Chairman.\n\nNonetheless, former Governor of Borno State and frontline chairmanship aspirant, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, said he was not aware of the alleged endorsement of Adamu by Buhari as the next national chairman of the party.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kwara State, a chieftain of APC and Pro-Chancellor of the Federal University, Dutse, Jigawa State, Hon. Benjamin Issa Ezekiel, said one of the chairmanship aspirants from the North-central geopolitical zone, Malam Saliu Mustapha, remained the state\u2019s \u201cunity candidate\u201d for the office of APC chairman.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said, in the statement, \u201cThe National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, has approved the appointment of the Party\u2019s Zoning Committee for the forthcoming National Convention.\u201d\n\nHe named other members of the committee to include Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, who will serve as deputy chairman of the zoning committee. Professor Etim Nyong, Dr. MB Shehu, Mustapha Salihu, Senator Teslim Folarin, and Mr. Sadeeq Sule-Iko Sami were named members of the committee, while Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Nkem Okeke, would serve as Secretary.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said the committee was expected to submit its report on March 7.\n\nBut some senators endorsed Adamu during a meeting held at the Senate wing of the National Assembly complex on Wednesday evening, with the ranking senator in attendance.\n\nThe APC senators, numbering about 10, were said to have resolved to back Adamu in his bid to become the party\u2019s national chairman at the forthcoming national convention slated to hold in Abuja on March 26. Sources told THISDAY that the senators also agreed to engage other stakeholders, including some of the chairmanship aspirants, on the need to drop their ambitions and support the chairman of Senate Committee on Agriculture to emerge as chairman of the ruling party.\n\nOne of the aspirants, who is also a serving senator, Sani Musa (Niger East), attended the Wednesday meeting. But THISDAY could not confirm if he had agreed to drop his ambition and support Adamu.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the senators took a group photograph, with Adamu flanking the senate president on the right\n\nThose present at the meeting included Ovie Omo-Agege; Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi; Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu; Deputy Chief Whip, Senator Sabi Abdullahi; and Senator Jubril Barau.\n\nOthers in attendance were Senators Bello Mandiya and Opeyemi Bamidele.\n\nAlthough it was widely believed that Buhari had expressed his preference for Adamu as the consensus candidate for national chairman, THISDAY had reported that APC stakeholders from the South-east pushed for the office of National Secretary, while the South-west, where the office was originally zoned, was still divided over the party position.\n\nDuring a meeting with the president, APC governors agreed that all the previous positions in the party held by members from the North-west would now go to those from the South-east; all positions that were held by those from the North-east would go to those from the South-west; and all positions previously held by members from the North-central would automatically go to those from the South-south. This meant that the positions of national secretary and chairman had been dealt with.\n\nBut, with the setting up of zoning committee by the party, stakeholders would be on the look out for possible changes in the zoning formula, even though a governor, who preferred anonymity, recently told THISDAY that the zoning formula in circulation was not sacrosanct.\n\nAkpanudoedehe, however, told THISDAY in a telephone chat that the party was currently focused on conducting the convention.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe have a leader of the party, which is the president. We have stakeholders, governors, senators, House of Representatives members, former governors \u2013 it is all embracing. They are critical, legally empowered. We have to consider a number of issues.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to meet on the Electoral Act. Don\u2019t forget it was signed over the weekend, this is a new week. But we are very focused on the convention.\u201d\n\nAsked if the party would be able to conduct its zonal congresses, convention, and primaries between April 4 and June 3, the secretary said he wouldn\u2019t want to pre-empt the leadership of the party.\n\nHe added, \u201cLet me not pre-empt the leadership of the party. Let me not speak as an individual. I\u2019m only holding this position in trust for everybody. I speak the decision of the caretaker committee. The convention is on course.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, another party source informed THISDAY that the reason Akpanudoedehe wanted to remain secretary of the party was to make it easier for him to get the Akwa Ibom State governorship ticket.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cHe (Akpanudoedehe) wanted to remain secretary and contest for governor. But the governors took the secretary to South-west and it is micro-zoned to Oyo State. Buni wants to be Vice President. Namani (Ken) wants to be governor.\u201d\n\nSheriff: I\u2019m Not Aware of Buhari\u2019s Endorsement of Adamu\n\nFormer Governor of Borno State and frontline national chairmanship aspirant of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, said he was not aware of the purported endorsement of a former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, by President Muhammadu Buhari as the next national chairman of APC ahead the March 26 convention of the party.\n\nSheriff stated this while addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, saying the leadership of the party has not communicated to the aspirants that one of them has been endorsed.\n\nThe former lawmaker, however, added that if the president, as the leader of the party, anointed anybody, he would withdraw from the race and stand by the decision.\n\nSheriff said it became imperative to address the press due to some concerns of party faithful regarding the alleged decision and position of the president as well as the party leadership with respect to the national chairmanship.\n\nHe stated, \u201cOf late, I have been inundated by insinuations and rumours that President Muhammadu Buhari has zoned and endorsed a candidate for this all-important position in our party\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, I am not aware of any official statement or position by Mr. President on endorsement of any particular candidate or/and zoning of the chairmanship position of our great party.\n\n\u201cMr. President and, indeed, the party is yet to issue a formal statement on these issues. I am in the race for the national chairmanship position of our party APC, because of my strength of character, capacity and competence. My intentions are clear and explicitly for public good rather than self-interest.\u201d\n\nThe former governor said as a loyal party member, he would abide by the decisions of the president at any time he made an official position known. Sheriff said he had unequivocal confidence in the president\u2019s capacity to make the right choice for the growth of the party.\n\nWhile stressing that he was committed to working with anyone to reposition the party towards a resounding victory in 2023 general election and beyond, Sheriff said, \u201cOur guiding principle will be the party\u2019s constitution and manifesto, and I will be committed to it. On Mr. President\u2019s decision, I stand.\u201d\n\nEx-Kwara Speaker Declares Mustapha State\u2019s Unity Candidate\n\nA chieftain of APC and Pro-Chancellor of the Federal University, Dutse, Hon. Benjamin Issa Ezekiel, said the chairmanship aspirant of the party from Kwara State, Malam Saliu Mustapha, was the state\u2019s \u201cunity candidate\u201d for the office.\n\nThe 49-year-old Mustapha is said to be the youngest of the aspirants vying for the position of the APC national chairman, with experience as former National Deputy Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressives Change.\n\nHe is a long time ally of Buhari right from the latter\u2019s days in the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) through to the CPC.\n\nEzekiel, who is also a former Speaker of the Kwara State House of Assembly, spoke in Ilorin on the sideline of a Personality Public Lecture organised in Mustapha\u2019s honour by the Postgraduate Students Association of Nigeria, University of Ilorin chapter. He stressed that if elected, Mustapha would solidify the party on the strength of his goodwill with the various tendencies in the party.\n\nEzekiel said, \u201cMustapha enjoys the blessings of all tendencies in the APC in Kwara State. Mustapha has a history of a cordial relationship with virtually all major stakeholders of the party, starting with Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq.\u201d\n\nThe former speaker also said the senators representing the state and the two ministers from the state, Alhaji Lai Mohammed and Senator Gbemisola Saraki, among others, supported Mustapha\u2019s aspiration.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe only reason why Mallam Saliu Mustapha is the only candidate contesting from Kwara State is because of his goodwill at home. He is not only loved by the community and traditional leadership of the state, which led to his elevation as the Turaki of Ilorin, he is also very well respected by the political class, especially, within the progressive family.\n\n\u201cThis is unlike other states in the North-central, where there are multiple candidates from the same state. Niger and Nasarawa are ready examples. So, among all the contestants from the North-central, he is the only one with the most formidable state backing that cuts across all interest blocs. This is why we are appealing to the president to pull his weight behind Mustapha, who, incidentally, has been his long time ally.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "More Rot Uncovered In MTN Nigeria As Employees Expose Fraudulent Activities, Sexual Harassment, Victimisation By Chief Sales And Distribution Officer, Adebiyi, Other Principal Workers",
          "text": "More staff members of telecommunications company MTN Nigeria have exposed massive corrupt practices including sexual harassment and victimisation of workers being perpetuated by the firm\u2019s Chief Sales and Distribution Officer, Adekunle Adebiyi, General Manager, Northern Regional Operations, Amina Dambatta, and some other senior officers of the organisation.\n\n\n\nIn an email addressed to the leadership of MTN Nigeria and MTN Group in South Africa on Thursday and seen by SaharaReporters, the aggrieved workers under the banner of \u2018Anonymous Concerned Staff of Sales and Distribution Division\u2019, alleged that a cabal run by the aforementioned officers operating in different regions of the country had grossly violated the rights of workers by stifling their voices and victimising them for daring to complain about certain anomalies they notice within the system.\n\nMTN Nigeria Building\n\nThe group of aggrieved workers also revealed that Adebiyi and Dambatta in active connivance with members of their cabal including Abdulhamid Hassan, a Senior Manager in Sales and Distribution, and Hamza Ibrahim, who was recently appointed Senior Manager in Sales and Distribution, had planted their cronies in key supply and distribution channels of the company, thereby shortchanging MTN and pocketing huge sums of money monthly.\n\n\n\nAccording to the group, some trade partners in the Northern region of Nigeria were owned by either Adebiyi or Dambatta with such firms given preferential treatment over others against the company\u2019s policy.\n\n\n\nThe aggrieved workers in the email to MTN\u2019s management also accused the principal officers mentioned of retaining their cronies, who had earlier defrauded the company of huge sums of money rather than delisting and barring them from doing business with the telecommunications firm again.\n\n\n\nThe whistle-blowers said staff members who complain about these unwholesome practices, are either transferred to remote communities or troubled zones in Northern Nigeria as punishment or dismissed entirely for having the guts to challenge the power brokers.\n\nSee Also Scandal EXCLUSIVE: Female MTN Nigeria Employees Accuse Chief Sales & Distribution Officer, Adekunle Adebiyi, Of Sexual Harassment, Knock CEO, Toriola\n\nThe email partly reads, \u201cWe, the concerned staff of Sales and Distribution Division in the Northern region of Nigeria, write to bring to the attention of MTN Group and MTN Nigeria Communication Plc's Board, Management, Risk and Compliance division about key conflict of interest, fraudulent activities, sexual harassment and threat of dismissal that has continued to be pervasive in the Northern region. Due to fear of victimisation, staff in the North are too afraid to speak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe General Manager, Northern Regional Operations, Amina Dambatta, runs a cabal made up of her, Abdulhamid Hassan (Senior Manager in Sales and Distribution) and Hamza Ibrahim (recently appointed Senior Manager in Sales and Distribution). Amina and her cabal including Adekunle Adebiyi, Chief Sales and Distribution Officer, have interests in some trade partner companies in the Northern region. This makes her compromise, thereby placing other partners at a competitive disadvantage.\n\n\n\n\u201cHere is an example: in the Sokoto area, Munifaz, Gobir Jega and Amali are three dealerships in Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara states and they are all owned by the same person and Amina has interests in all three.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe and Adekunle Adebiyi facilitated the granting of dealerships to the same person under three different names, disguising themselves as different persons against MTN conflict of interest policy. The owner of this company has also not declared to MTN that he is the owner of these three competing companies.\n\n\u201cNobody ever questioned why Amina and Adebiyi approved for one person to own three different dealerships without it being declared to MTN Nigeria for transparency.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis conflict of interest that Amina and Adebiyi have is the reason why Gobir Jega and Munifaz got away with fraud. Their staff defrauded MTN Nigeria to the tune of N17 million and N13 million respectively but they were treated with a mere slap on the wrist. See Also LABOR/WORKERS' RIGHTS Union Issues 14-day Ultimatum To MTN Over Anti-labour Practices\n\n\n\n\u201cAmina insisted on giving a waiver of 50% on the total amount to be recovered. How can a waiver be granted in fraud recovery? When that was not approved by Legal, Amina recommended a payment plan of 10 years.\n\n\u201cWhy would someone defraud MTN and they are given 10 years to pay back when they should be delisted/dismissed and asked to pay immediately? Why are they being retained as dealers?\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother area of conflict is that BENJEE is the trade partner in Sokoto and Kebbi states and this is owned by Amina and Kunle Adebiyi. The same people also own Nagwari Ltd., a customer acquisition partner in the three states.\n\n\u201cThe entire S and D staff in Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara are aware of this but they are too afraid to speak up as they are constantly being threatened with disciplinary hearing or redeployment to states with security challenges. Nobody wants to be redeployed to such states, so they stay mute.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese trade partners where Amina and others have interest earn tens of millions each month. They earn more than other partners and they don't contribute as much as the others in terms of gross connection, revenue etc. Why the unfairness?\n\n\n\n\u201cOther partners in the region feel there isn\u2019t a level playing field as preferences are given to the dealers and CAPs that Amina and Adekunle Adebiyi and Abdulhamid have interest in. The other partners cannot run to Amina because rather than being an unbiased umpire, she sees them as competitors because they are competing with CAPs and dealers where she has a stake.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis conflict of interest is not declared, so it is hurting the business. Some of these dealers are making plans to report this conflict of interest and corruption issues to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother complaint we want to make is in the area of gross connection. The partners and CAPs where Amina has interest engage in fraudulent gross connection activities. This is called kitchen activation. They buy SIM cards at N50, register them using a few people, load N3 to do chargeable activity and they will automatically earn N180 for each SIM. They do this with thousands of SIM cards daily and when they are done, they earn millions for gross connection. A month or two after, these SIM cards will be seen as having churned out of the network. Then they go back to the same circle, earning millions for fraudulent practices.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll managers and above that resigned or took VSS in S and D in the North in the past three years left because they questioned these practices and were victimised.\u201d\n\nThe anonymous group also alleged that a senior male staff member of the company is in the habit of sexually harassing female workers.\n\n\n\n\u201cYet another complaint is that some ladies are being sexually harassed by Abdulhamid Hassan, a Senior Manager in S and D in Abuja. If they refuse to submit, they are posted to distant locations far from their families.\n\n\n\n\u201cHas anyone wondered why there are constant redeployments in the North, especially Abuja axis? Risk and Compliance should interview all female levels 1 and 2 staff in S and D within Abuja and the North to ask about their experiences.\n\n\n\n\u201cA lady called Rabi in S and D in Northern region had to resign because she was being sexually harassed by Abdulhamid. She told colleagues that she would rather quit the job than to submit. Even though she has left, Risk and Compliance should speak with her and investigate the matter.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver a year ago, a senior manager in Abuja named Auwal Abdullahi made a comment during a Northern region meeting as an employee council representative. He said that the staff were not happy with Amina\u2019s management style. Amina was unhappy with the comment. She lashed out at him verbally in the meeting. Afterwards, his relative who was then a staff member in S and D named Maryam Bashir was targeted and dismissed.\n\n\n\n\u201cHamza Ibrahim, the recently appointed Senior Manager in Kano, was promoted against due process. He came second at an interview many years ago and was placed on Keep-In-View, which is only valid for a year. But nearly three years later, the expired KIV is activated to favour him against other staff, who have a right to apply for the same job if it had been open for application as required by policy. This needs to be investigated.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe urge the business to investigate these allegations we have made to verify our claims. We do hope our concerns will be addressed as these are big risks to the business.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen SaharaReporters reached out to the spokesperson for MTN Nigeria, Funsho Aina, on Thursday over the latest round of revelations by aggrieved workers of the telecommunications company, he again declined comments.\n\n\n\nPrevious Allegations\n\nOn Tuesday, March 2, 2022, SaharaReporters published an exclusive story on how some female employees accused Adebiyi of sexual harassment while also knocking Chief Executive Officer of MTN Nigeria, Karl Toriola, of covering up the atrocities committed against workers.\n\n\n\nIn a series of emails and documents sent to MTN Group\u2019s headquarters in South Africa between April 2021 and February 2022, the female employees, who hid their identities and only described themselves as \u2018The Anonymous Whistle Blowers\u2019, accused Adebiyi of being a sexual predator in the habit of using his position within the company to sleep with young female staff whom he often threatens with the sack if they failed to give in to his demands.\n\n\n\nThe aggrieved employees also alleged that Adebiyi had been using his position to plant family members and friends in key units of the telecommunications company even when such persons clearly lacked the requisite educational qualification and skills to occupy such roles.\n\n\n\nThe whistleblowers also accused the Chief Sales and Distribution Officer of inflating contracts, receiving kickbacks and inventing false sales figures to deceive the organisation\u2019s leadership and continue to keep his coveted role.\n\n\n\nThe whistleblowers further alleged that Adebiyi used proceeds of his corrupt dealings in MTN Nigeria to purchase a house in Manchester, United Kingdom, and also built a multi-million-naira state-of-the-art school for his wife in Lagos.\n\n\n\nThe employees said that Adebiyi, despite his gross misconduct and acts of corruption and sabotage against MTN Group, had the full backing of Toriola and other top officers in the company.\n\n\n\nResponding to the allegations in one of the email exchanges seen by SaharaReporters, Nerisha Singh, General Manager, Forensic Services, of MTN Group, said, \u201cWe assure you of our prompt attention to all the concerns raised and that the matters raised will be fully investigated.\u201d",

When that was not approved by Legal, Amina recommended a payment plan of 10 years.\n\n\u201cWhy would someone defraud MTN and they are given 10 years to pay back when they should be delisted/dismissed and asked to pay immediately? Why are they being retained as dealers?\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother area of conflict is that BENJEE is the trade partner in Sokoto and Kebbi states and this is owned by Amina and Kunle Adebiyi. The same people also own Nagwari Ltd., a customer acquisition partner in the three states.\n\n\u201cThe entire S and D staff in Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara are aware of this but they are too afraid to speak up as they are constantly being threatened with disciplinary hearing or redeployment to states with security challenges. Nobody wants to be redeployed to such states, so they stay mute.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese trade partners where Amina and others have interest earn tens of millions each month. They earn more than other partners and they don't contribute as much as the others in terms of gross connection, revenue etc. Why the unfairness?\n\n\n\n\u201cOther partners in the region feel there isn\u2019t a level playing field as preferences are given to the dealers and CAPs that Amina and Adekunle Adebiyi and Abdulhamid have interest in. The other partners cannot run to Amina because rather than being an unbiased umpire, she sees them as competitors because they are competing with CAPs and dealers where she has a stake.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis conflict of interest is not declared, so it is hurting the business. Some of these dealers are making plans to report this conflict of interest and corruption issues to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Nigerian Stock Exchange.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother complaint we want to make is in the area of gross connection. The partners and CAPs where Amina has interest engage in fraudulent gross connection activities. This is called kitchen activation. They buy SIM cards at N50, register them using a few people, load N3 to do chargeable activity and they will automatically earn N180 for each SIM. They do this with thousands of SIM cards daily and when they are done, they earn millions for gross connection. A month or two after, these SIM cards will be seen as having churned out of the network. Then they go back to the same circle, earning millions for fraudulent practices.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll managers and above that resigned or took VSS in S and D in the North in the past three years left because they questioned these practices and were victimised.\u201d\n\nThe anonymous group also alleged that a senior male staff member of the company is in the habit of sexually harassing female workers.\n\n\n\n\u201cYet another complaint is that some ladies are being sexually harassed by Abdulhamid Hassan, a Senior Manager in S and D in Abuja. If they refuse to submit, they are posted to distant locations far from their families.\n\n\n\n\u201cHas anyone wondered why there are constant redeployments in the North, especially Abuja axis? Risk and Compliance should interview all female levels 1 and 2 staff in S and D within Abuja and the North to ask about their experiences.\n\n\n\n\u201cA lady called Rabi in S and D in Northern region had to resign because she was being sexually harassed by Abdulhamid. She told colleagues that she would rather quit the job than to submit. Even though she has left, Risk and Compliance should speak with her and investigate the matter.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver a year ago, a senior manager in Abuja named Auwal Abdullahi made a comment during a Northern region meeting as an employee council representative. He said that the staff were not happy with Amina\u2019s management style. Amina was unhappy with the comment. She lashed out at him verbally in the meeting. Afterwards, his relative who was then a staff member in S and D named Maryam Bashir was targeted and dismissed.\n\n\n\n\u201cHamza Ibrahim, the recently appointed Senior Manager in Kano, was promoted against due process. He came second at an interview many years ago and was placed on Keep-In-View, which is only valid for a year. But nearly three years later, the expired KIV is activated to favour him against other staff, who have a right to apply for the same job if it had been open for application as required by policy. This needs to be investigated.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe urge the business to investigate these allegations we have made to verify our claims. We do hope our concerns will be addressed as these are big risks to the business.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen SaharaReporters reached out to the spokesperson for MTN Nigeria, Funsho Aina, on Thursday over the latest round of revelations by aggrieved workers of the telecommunications company, he again declined comments.\n\n\n\nPrevious Allegations\n\nOn Tuesday, March 2, 2022, SaharaReporters published an exclusive story on how some female employees accused Adebiyi of sexual harassment while also knocking Chief Executive Officer of MTN Nigeria, Karl Toriola, of covering up the atrocities committed against workers.\n\n\n\nIn a series of emails and documents sent to MTN Group\u2019s headquarters in South Africa between April 2021 and February 2022, the female employees, who hid their identities and only described themselves as \u2018The Anonymous Whistle Blowers\u2019, accused Adebiyi of being a sexual predator in the habit of using his position within the company to sleep with young female staff whom he often threatens with the sack if they failed to give in to his demands.\n\n\n\nThe aggrieved employees also alleged that Adebiyi had been using his position to plant family members and friends in key units of the telecommunications company even when such persons clearly lacked the requisite educational qualification and skills to occupy such roles.\n\n\n\nThe whistleblowers also accused the Chief Sales and Distribution Officer of inflating contracts, receiving kickbacks and inventing false sales figures to deceive the organisation\u2019s leadership and continue to keep his coveted role.\n\n\n\nThe whistleblowers further alleged that Adebiyi used proceeds of his corrupt dealings in MTN Nigeria to purchase a house in Manchester, United Kingdom, and also built a multi-million-naira state-of-the-art school for his wife in Lagos.\n\n\n\nThe employees said that Adebiyi, despite his gross misconduct and acts of corruption and sabotage against MTN Group, had the full backing of Toriola and other top officers in the company.\n\n\n\nResponding to the allegations in one of the email exchanges seen by SaharaReporters, Nerisha Singh, General Manager, Forensic Services, of MTN Group, said, \u201cWe assure you of our prompt attention to all the concerns raised and that the matters raised will be fully investigated.\u201d",

          "title": "Group Demands Code Of Conduct Bureau\u2019s Probe Of Federal Lawmaker, Onofiok, Others Over Alleged N327million Fraud",
          "text": "A civil society and anti-corruption group, known as Malpractice and Anti-corruption Interception Project (MACiP), has tasked the Code of Conduct Bureau to immediately probe a former Speaker of the Akwa-Ibom State House of Assembly and member representing Etinan, Nsit Ibom and Nsit Ubium federal constituency, Onofiok Luke, and the Speaker of the state Assembly, Aniekan Bassey, over alleged embezzlement of N327million.\n\nExpressing displeasure over the way and manner the issue was being handled, MACiP in a statement signed by its chairman, Iteveh Ekpokpobe, obtained by SaharaReporters, disclosed that the CBB should step up the investigation of the petition before it.\n\n\n\nAlso fingered in the alleged embezzlement are some senior officials of the state House of Assembly and the state government in the petition before the anti-graft agency.\n\nMACiP had earlier in its petition addressed to the CCB chairman, noted as follows, \u201cThe audited financial statements of Akwa Ibom State in 2016 and 2018 revealed questionable expenditures under the Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly. An analysis of the reports for the period revealed the project under the State House of Assembly has been used as conduit pipe to siphon funds by corrupt officials of the state. Completion and furnishing of Assembly mini press was awarded at the sum of N112million and subsequently retired through the same subhead in 2016 and 2018. Years later, there is no known project on ground that shows evidence and value for the millions of naira reported to have been spent.\n\n\u201cAccording to the 2016 audited report of Akwa-Ibom State, the Assembly mini press project had 100 percent performance as the N100 million budgeted was entirely expended. Two years after, N12million out of N22million budgeted was retired for the purchase of equipment for the mini press. This reported purchase in 2018 amounted to 54.5 percent project performance. However, five years after the initial disbursement of funds for the project and nearly three years since N12million was supposedly spent on equipment, investigations reveal that there is no project executed or purchased at the state assembly.\n\n\u201cDocuments obtained show that three offices have questions to answer. The project was captured in the state\u2019s appropriation act under the state house of Assembly\u2019s budget with the Clerk as the Chief Accounting Officer. The Accountant General of the state disburses funds under the supervision of the finance ministry headed by the Commissioner. The Accountant General is responsible for safe keeping books of account, and ensures internal control procedures are maintained in order to safeguard the assets, detect and prevent fraud and other irregularities.\n\n\u201cThe 2015 budget shows that N100 million was also budgeted for the same item (Assembly Mini Press) with the breakdown showing that N30 million was earmarked for the purchase and installation of guillotine machine, running machine, book sewing machine and stitch expert (Heidelberg). Another N30m was budgeted for the purchase and installation of a 40 KVA generator, N15 million each for training, and purchase of consumables and N10 million for the construction of printing office. Nonetheless, the audited financial statement of 2015 revealed that, only N2 million was eventually spent on \u201cconsumables.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 2016, the State House of Assembly budgeted N100 million for the acquisition and installation of HP high tech multi server audio transmitter/speakers system to link its chambers with members\u2019 offices. These transmitters are digital wireless equipment which could enable state legislators to easily communicate between their offices and the chambers where plenary is held. On the same year, N85 million was also set aside for the Computerization/ Networking of Assembly Complex/ Provision of ICT Broad Band for the Complex.\n\n\"Broadband in ICT stems from the word broad bandwidth. It applies to network which carries multiple channels of data (signal) ranging from moving images, sound or text. Interestingly, the Accountant General\u2019s Report with audited financial statements for 2016 shows that the acquisition and installation of HP High Tech Multi Server Audio Transmitters/Speakers System to link chambers with offices received 100 percent disbursement of funds. The report also revealed that an item tagged, Computerization/ Networking of Assembly Complex/ Provision of ICT Broad Band for the Complex\u201d had 40 percent performance with N34 million expended out of the N85 million budgeted.\n\n\"The project was categorised under an umbrella sub-head tagged, Computerization/ Networking of Assembly Complex/ Provision of internet services/Development of AKHA Information Park (Website). In spite of the recorded expenditures, five years after, investigations reveal that such items do not exist. Another questionable expenditure in the House of Assembly is the construction of speakers\u2019 lodge. Alongside other projects such as the construction of Deputy Speaker\u2019s lodge and permanent resident for principal officers, the sum total of N755 million was budgeted in 2019. For the Speaker\u2019s Lodge alone, a whopping N183 million was budgeted.\n\n\"Checks into the state 2014 Appropriation Law shows that the project was conceived as a storey building with boys\u2019 quarters, and has appeared in subsequent budget since then. The project had a drawdown in 2019 as only N30 million was spent representing 16.4 percent of the total budgeted sum. Today, there is no indication of commencement of the project two years after disbursement of fund. The entire landscape remains undeveloped. Interestingly, the project has even assumed a different dimension according to the 2021 budget. Checks showed that the project has now been re-christened as \u201cConstruction of Assembly Village\u201d with a budget of N120 million.\n\n\"In the breakdown, N50 million was budgeted for design while N70 million went to construction. These line items, especially \u201cdesign,\u201d raise questions as to what the N30 million in 2019 was spent on when the project was not yet designed. Therefore, as a Civil Society Organisation with zero tolerance with violation of the law and in pursuant of our mandate, we are under obligation to urge the Code of Conduct Bureau to investigate these allegations forthwith and charge those culpable before the tribunal or we shall be forced to take legal and other necessary actions to press home our demands.\"\n\nWhen contacted, the former Speaker of Akwa-Ibom State House of Assembly and member representing Etinan, Nsit Ibom and Nsit Ubium federal constituency, Onofiok Luke and the incumbent speaker of the state Assembly, Aniekan Bassey, did not respond to calls and messages sent to them.\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Chris Ngige, minister of labour, says the federal government does not have the funds to meet some of the demands of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).\n\nOn February 14, ASUU declared a one-month strike.\n\nWhile declaring the strike, the union said the decision was taken over the federal government\u2019s delay on an agreement, which included issues on salaries, the adoption of the University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) payroll software, and the revitalisation fund for universities.\n\nSince 1999 when the country returned to democratic dispensation, a report by TheCable Index shows that ASUU has gone on strike for a total of 49 months and seven days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on the development in an interview with Channels Television on Thursday, Ngige said the N1.3 trillion revitalisation fund was a promise made to ASUU by the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan when the country\u2019s finances were stable.\n\nThe labour minister said the current administration informed ASUU of its inability to honour the previous revitalisation fund agreement, adding that the federal government promised to explore other options to fund universities.\n\n\u201cGovernment is a continuum. The N1.3 trillion you are talking about was promised by the Jonathan government. Oil was selling about $100 to $120 per barrel then and the revenue of the federation was rich,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe agreement says that \u2018government is unable to pay this but to show commitment to the intentions of the revitalisation for which this N1.3 trillion was promised\u2019.\n\n\u201cMind you, it was promised by that administration and they promised to kickstart the payment \u2014 and they paid N200 billion which they borrowed from TETFund. They did not take it from the federation account. That payment spiralled even into 2016 \u2014 to our regime.\n\n\u201cGovernment said we don\u2019t have the money to pay for it \u2014 this was the agreement in 2016 to 2017 \u2014 but we will find a way by which we can fund the universities and revitalise infrastructure.\n\n\u201cA committee was set up with ASUU as members. Government said \u2018we are going to drop N25 billion for you to show you in good faith that we are not talking nonsense.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat one was dropped. Again, another money was paid last year because the committee couldn\u2019t come up with anything that will generate funds. Government made it clear that we don\u2019t have N1.1 trillion that is remaining.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have it. It is in the agreement. The government did not say we are going to pay N1.1 trillion that is remaining. They said we don\u2019t have this money and under the principle of capacity and ability to pay, let us renegotiate it because TETFund is still there.\n\n\u201cUnless you want us to take money from TETFund and deceive you like it was done in that period.\u201d",

          "title": "Amid Russian invasion of Ukraine, social media accounts were hacked to share Russian propaganda",
          "text": "On February 27, Nigerian web designer, Olalekan Owonikoko was away from Twitter when a friend shared a screenshot of a tweet from his account, knowing fully well that it wasn\u2019t the kind of post Owonikoko would make. After seeing the screenshot, Owonikoko was confused as he hadn\u2019t made the post.\n\nA few days before this, the Russian government launched an offensive on a neighbouring eastern European country, Ukraine. But we are an internet world, so the war has also gone to social media, with each side trying to control the narrative online. A huge propaganda war is ongoing and social media has been crucial for sharing updates, and misinformation, about the war. TikTok was used to share updates on the Russian army\u2019s march to Ukraine, while on the other side of the war, a 27-year-old Russian TikTokker Niki Proshin live-streamed an anti-war protest in Russia. Photo sharing app, Instagram, is being used by independent journalist Ilya Varlamov to record videos and take pictures that represent his version of Russia\u2019s military action. In a matter of days, Ukrainian influencer Anna Prytula moved away from her lifestyle posts to show footage of missiles attacking her country on Instagram. Social media has also seen the rise of \u201cwar pages\u201d\u2014Instagram meme pages that promise to share updates on the Ukraine conflict but are fake pages hoping to get money from advertisements.\n\nOn February 26, social media accounts linked to Buffer, the social media scheduling tool, were hacked to spread support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine under the hashtag #SupportRussia. \u201cIt was clearly not the kind of content I would share,\u201d Owonikoko said. \u201cMy friend knew this and wanted to be sure I hadn\u2019t shared such a thing. I took a minute to be sure I hadn\u2019t engaged with any content like that and accidentally shared it. It was clear my account had been hacked,\u201d said Owonikoko, who noted that though his Twitter account is set up on Buffer, he rarely uses the app. Like most propaganda and disinformation campaigns, the accounts shared the same tweet, with the same social media asset, and at the same time.\n\nA cross-section of accounts that posted the propaganda post on Twitter. Source: Reddit\n\nBuffer released a statement on February 26, where it acknowledged that Buffer accounts had been hacked to share unauthorised posts that support Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Buffer revealed that 1,552 accounts were affected, while 618 accounts posted 766 unauthorised content across Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Buffer revealed in its statement that none of the 1,552 affected accounts had 2-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, and attributed the hack to reused passwords.\n\nTwitter user, @Downtownrob, revealed that he doesn\u2019t have two-factor authentication (2FA) on his account, and uses a virtual assistant, Fancy Hands, which publishes WordPress articles for him via Buffer.\n\nTechCabal\u2019s Twitter account, which is linked to Buffer, was compromised and also shared the propaganda tweet. The newsroom was alerted to the development; we took the tweet down and shared a statement on Twitter clarifying the situation.\n\nThis is not the first time Russia has tried to shape international opinion about its invasion of Ukraine. Back in 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea Peninsula, a network of trolls, bots, and spam accounts focused on denying military presence in the Peninsula. However, Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign goes beyond Ukraine; they affect users everywhere.

Twitter said it has been removing disinformation networks linked to the Ukraine conflict.

          "text": "What happens to your assets when you die? Do they go to your family or will they become unclaimed assets?\n\nGlobal unclaimed assets are running into billions of dollars. Currently, in the US, unclaimed cash and benefits are worth about $58 billion. In the UK, in 2019, The Telegraph reported \u00a3200 billion in lost assets. In South Africa, unclaimed assets are valued at R45 billion (~$3 billion). Chainalysis also estimates that about a fifth of all bitcoin mined to date \u2014 somewhere between 2.78 and 3.79 million\u2014are unclaimed.\n\nEvery nation in the world has its own reservoir of unclaimed assets.\n\nThese unclaimed properties and assets come from a variety of sources, including abandoned bank accounts and stock holdings, unclaimed life insurance payouts, forgotten pension benefits, forgotten landed properties, and more.\n\nRecently, in Canada, Yomi Osamiluyi, a software engineer, realised that his assets were placed in several investments and wished he could track them all under one platform which his loved ones would have access to claim in the event of his death and in the absence of a will. After doing some digging, he discovered that there was no simple means or tool to integrate his assets.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSimilarly, last year in Nigeria, Oluyomi Ojo, a Lagos-based tech entrepreneur, had just caught the bug of buying shitcoins\u2014dogecoin had just crossed a massive milestone and was trending on social media\u2014and downloaded Binance to buy some units of dogecoin. But, after buying it, the question he asked himself was, who gets the coin should anything happen to him? How would his family claim it?\n\nAs someone who\u2019s built and run businesses, instead of dwelling too long on the question, Ojo began to think of how to solve the problem. There were many ideas, but that of a tool that puts all one\u2019s assets in one place for easy tracking and management was top of the list. So, to test the validity of his idea, he tweeted about it, and within an hour, thousands of people engaged with likes, questions, interest, and more suggestions on how to finesse the idea.\n\nStartup idea. Investment inheritance tech. Somewhere you can connect all your cryptocurrencies & investments with passwords and details. If you pass on or anything happens to you. It shares full access with your next of kin.\n\n\n\nI feel platforms are inheriting unclaimed investments \u2014 Oluyomi Ojo (@OluyomiOjo) January 29, 2021\n\nEven though the idea to build a solution to the problem didn\u2019t come from Twitter, the conviction that it could be a product people would pay to use came from the social media platform. After the tweet went viral, it became apparent that there was a real problem to solve and a market to build for. So, that same day Ojo reached out to Osamiluyi, who was a founding member and CTO at Printivo, a Lagos-based printing company Ojo co-founded, for 4 years before relocating to Canada.\n\nDue to his initial interest, the idea resonated with Osamiluyi, and the duo started working on the product that would be called Cova.\n\n\u201cI reached out to Yomi, and within 24 hours, the first waitlist\u2019s landing page was ready and over 700 people dropped their email addresses,\u201d said Ojo, CEO at Cova.\n\nOluyomi Ojo, cofounder/CEO at Cova\n\nCova app was finally launched into the market December last year.\n\nHow Cova works\n\nCova is built to organise users\u2019 assets in one place and transfer ownership to users\u2019 listed beneficiaries in the event of their death. So, when a user opens an account on the platform and completes the required know-your-customer (KYC) process, they can then go on to file in their assets, create a beneficiary and third-party trustee, and their \u201ccheck-in time\u201d\u2014meaning the threshold of inactiveness that must be exceeded before the platform transfers ownership to the user\u2019s beneficiaries.\n\nCova provides layers of beneficiaries. For now, users can only add one direct beneficiary, which is the first layer, and then a trustee\u2014someone who will take charge if the beneficiary is unavailable to claim the asset.\n\nThe platform notifies the beneficiary when a user fails to check in after they\u2019ve passed their check-in waiting time. The same thing happens to the beneficiary when they fail to claim the asset and the trustee gets it.\n\n\u201cCova is like a single source of truth for everything you own. It gives you the power to aggregate, manage and track everything, even while you\u2019re alive, and also helps your people discover and claim your assets when you\u2019re gone,\u201d said Ojo, CEO at Cova, who is also co-founder at Hallo Creative, a Lagos-based advertising company.\n\nCova supports two types of assets: digital assets like bank accounts and crypto wallets; and physical assets like landed property. The digital assets are called connected or sync assets that can be pulled in from third-party systems holding the assets through API. For instance, users can sync their Cova profile with their local and international bank accounts, savings apps like Piggyvest and Kuda, investment apps like Bamboo and Robinhood, and crypto wallets like Binance, Trust Wallets, and BuyCoins.\n\nPhysical assets, on the other hand, are manually added. Users would have to add the details of the assets themselves\u2014location, certificate of ownership, and other required documents\u2014and their value.\n\n\u201cOur users are saying, \u2018I\u2019m alive now: what else can I do with this app?\u2019 We realise that people are a lot more focused on asset tracking, and we must be able to let them see what their assets are worth in real time,\u201d said Ojo. \u201cSome of them don\u2019t even go to their holding platform anymore; they just come to Cova, see what their assets are now worth, and are good.\u201d\n\nYomi Osamiluyi, cofounder and CTO at Cova\n\nSecurity is top priority\n\nIn this type of business, securing users\u2019 data is at the heart of the day-to-day. According to Osamiluyi, the company CTO and a security engineering , Cova employs encryption strategies to secure users\u2019 sensitive data. \u201cWe have also built a multi-factor authentication feature into the system so that users can add layers of security to their account.\u201d He also said that they will continue to look for better ways to secure users\u2019 data.\n\nThe company operates a subscription-based model and charges $5.99 per month and $59.99 per year. Ojo said, since launch, Cova\u2019s customers have gone into the thousands. What\u2019s also interesting is that the startup is positioned as a global company rather than the usual African company. It\u2019s operational anywhere in the world even though its user base is currently concentrated in the US, Canada, and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cUsers can sync their physical assets from anywhere in the world, but for bank accounts, only users in Nigeria, US, and Canada can do that, for now.\u201d\n\nGlobally, this is a nascent industry that can either be placed in insurance tech, inheritance tech, security tech, and even fintech. But for Ojo, it\u2019s better called wealthtech.\n\nAt the moment, Cova is the only business building at this scale in Africa. But since the company is positioned as a global enterprise, there are global direct and indirect competitors like Everplans, which helps in securing important documents.\n\nBoth Ojo and Osamiluyi believe that this new industry that Cova plays in will be big in the coming years as the proliferation of digital assets like crypto, NFTs, and stocks continue to expand.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside HUB2's digital stack for insurance providers in francophone Africa",
          "text": "Compared to other developed and emerging markets, insurance in Africa remains a marginal product. As of 2018, total insurance penetration in Africa stood at just 3% in a population of 1.2 billion people, per a McKinsey report. And going by data from the African Insurance Organisation, that figure dropped to 2.78% a year later, far below the global average of 7.23%.\n\nBut like most under-tapped sectors, there\u2019s a strong reason to believe that the rapid expansion of digital and mobile services in Africa could change the face of insurance on the continent. Already, a small but growing number of startups\u2014such as Nigeria-based Casava and Kenya\u2019s Lami\u2014have sprung up to broaden insurance coverage in some parts of Africa.\n\nWhile the aforementioned players directly offer insurance products to the mass market through digital channels, some other startups operate as enablers for incumbents. One such is C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire-based HUB2, an insurance-focused fintech company founded in 2018 by Ashley Gauzere.\n\nHUB2 provides a suite of infrastructure services\u2014including payment collections via mobile money, bank cards, and POS agents, chatbots deployment as well as logistics and delivery\u2014that help traditional insurance giants reach last-mile consumers in several francophone African countries.\n\nThe company currently operates in 9 French-speaking countries (C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Senegal, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Mali, Guinea, Niger Republic, DRC, and Gabon) across West and Central African regions. It also serves at least 10 of the biggest insurance providers in the region (including Allianz, Leadway, Ascoma, OLEA, Activa, etc.).\n\nDespite its success so far, HUB2, which works out of the Village by CA R\u00e9union, a French department in the Indian Ocean, was initially launched to serve the e-commerce space in francophone Africa, not insurance.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFrom telecom to tech: founding HUB2\n\nBefore founding HUB2, Gauzere ran a management consulting company based in Mauritius that advised telecom operators across western Africa. Prior to that, he worked at French network operator Orange in Africa and the Middle East, developing broadband infrastructure in several countries.\n\nDuring his time at Orange, while deploying 3G and 4G networks as well as fibre infrastructure, Gauzere would always pay attention to the e-commerce sector and noticed that apart from internet connectivity, the main infrastructure needs that were holding back the sector were logistics and financial services.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, I decided to work on a payments aggregator for e-commerce services in francophone Africa which we launched a year later in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire,\u201d the CEO recalled in an interview with TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAt the end of 2019, we got our first customer from the insurance sector and after recording significant success with that account, saw that there was a huge opportunity there and decided to build a complete and dedicated technical stack to address the challenges that players in the insurance sector face.\u201d\n\nAshley Gauzere, founder and CEO of HUB2.\n\nA digital backbone for insurance services\n\nHUB2 is primarily a payments aggregator enabling interoperability between mobile money wallets within the same country. With regard to payment integrations, it is connected to at least 28 local and national major mobile money operators, including Orange Money, MTN, Moov Moov, Mobicash, Wizall, Yup, etc. through direct or indirect connections (via other aggregators).\n\nThe startup\u2019s main customers come from the insurance sector. Through its infrastructure, insurance companies, brokers, and retailers can carry out transactions, including premium payments and claims, via mobile money and bank cards. The startup also has partnerships with major POS networks, including InTouch, through which end customers can access, purchase and renew insurance covers provided by its clients.\n\nAccording to Gauzere, HUB2 currently processes up to $10 million per month in payments. Meanwhile, insurance providers on its platform can sell their products via 30,000 agents across its markets, with 5,000 of those in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire alone, which accounts for almost 30% of the insurance market in francophone West Africa.\n\nAs part of non-fintech services, HUB2 builds and deploys conversational chatbots to help insurance companies automate their customer engagement efforts, and has partnerships with Glovo and Jumia, to use their logistics services for the delivery of physical insurance certificates to customers.\n\n\u201cI like to refer to HUB2 as a \u2018hybrid\u2019 or \u2018FinInsurTech\u2019 company because we offer financial and non-transactional services, mostly to insurance companies,\u201d Gauzere said. \u201cThe vision is to enhance their traditional systems and make them more reactive and operate in real-time.\u201d\n\nGauzere believes HUB2\u2019s success so far has been down to a \u201creal product-market fit\u201d of its full-stack solution.\n\nFrancophone West Africa has an extremely low insurance penetration rate of 1.2%, according to the McKinsey report. Due to the low rate of insurance in the region of nearly 300 million people (excluding Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), major opportunities exist for this low penetration to grow substantially.\n\nIn addition, digital financial services, particularly mobile money (MoMo) and agency banking are widely used by the public in francophone African markets. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, one of the region\u2019s largest MoMo markets, 75% of the population own a mobile money account, compared to 20% who own bank accounts.\n\nMany traditional insurers are also realising the need to modernise and scale up their technological setup, especially in the wake of the pandemic-induced boom in the demand for remote services.\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s no better way to reach the mass market than through mobile systems,\u201d Gauzere said. \u201cAn additional advantage is that our digital infrastructure is on-demand, so there is no recurring cost for companies. The comprehensive service is available at a very marginal cost for companies to increase their operation and efficiency.\u201d\n\nDespite this, getting insurance companies to buy into using digital solutions hasn\u2019t been easy. The insurance sector in francophone Africa is a largely traditional one where paper certificates are common and delivered three to four weeks after subscription.\n\n\u201cThe adoption curve was a very huge issue early on,\u201d Gauzere said. \u201cYou talk to insurance companies about using mobile money and technology and they\u2019re like, \u2018Okay, so from which planet are you from?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe apathy for tech-enabled services is just one of many challenges the HUB2 team has had to deal with while building and scaling the platform in francophone Africa.\n\nThough HUB2 has secured a total of $1.8 million in total external funding since its launch, Gauzere reveals attracting funding has been difficult. He blames this on the fact that the insurance sector is not one where investors can get the most margin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still the early days,\u201d he said, adding that finding the \u201cright technical talent\u201d to help scale the 4-year-old startup has also been challenging.\n\nRegulation: an enabler and a bottleneck\n\nThe Conf\u00e9rence Interafricaine des March\u00e9s d\u2019Assurances (CIMA)\u2014an insurance oversight body covering 14, mostly francophone, countries with harmonised insurance laws and regulations\u2014was established in 1992 to improve the insurance process across the region.\n\nBy creating a single regulatory structure, the CIMA has been beneficial in promoting stability in the industry. It\u2019s also helped platforms like HUB2 scale relatively easily across the region but Gauzere noted that the one-size-fits-all policy for a diverse array of markets may lead to complexities in some member states.\n\n\u201cThe CIMA zone may enable easier movement across countries but sometimes, the inflexible regulatory demands and rules may hinder innovation in specific member countries,\u201d he said.\n\nGoing forward, Gauzere reveals HUB2 has several agreements with other mobile money providers and agent networks that\u2019ll help expand its market reach to 50,000 agents by 2022 end. However, the logistics side is harder to scale as the startup has to find a reliable partner in each country.\n\nHUB2 has also been contracted by two insurers in the French-speaking region to roll out fully digital micro-insurance products in some of its markets, according to the CEO.\n\n\u201cWe believe that digital micro-insurance, linked with the right network for distribution, has the same potential as mobile banking,\u201d Gauzere said. \u201cIncreasing insurance penetration in the region will largely be achieved through digital micro-insurance.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

I have a list of over 20+ African startups whose bank accounts were mass-blocked at around the same time by @BankMercury yesterday. I love Mercury a lot but they can\u2019t just do this to an entire continent. It is not right & we need to all speak up. https://t.co/vr21Pd9nq4 \u2014 Moe is mourning her crocs (@Mochievous) March 1, 2022\n\nMercury restricted a large number of African startups\u2019 bank accounts enmasse due to \u201cunusual activity\u201d.\n\n\n\nLike that number of accounts. At the same time.\n\n\n\nWild. \u2014 10X Tech Bro (@OdunEweniyi) March 1, 2022\n\nLater on Tuesday, Mercury responded by sending out an email that vaguely indicated that the accounts were blocked due to some compliance issues.\n\nEmail sent to affected startups after blocking their accounts\n\nIn the later hours of the same day, after more bigwigs African founders have directly tweeted at Immad Akhund, cofounder and CEO of the startup, he sent out a personal email to the affected startups. In the email, he apologised and hinted that the restriction of the accounts was as a result of Mercury\u2019s partner bank noticing an \u201cunusual activity and asked us to lock and investigate a large set of accounts with linked activity.\u201d\n\nImmad Akhund\u2019s email to affected startups\n\nThis measure, however, has thrown a couple of businesses into chaos as they can\u2019t fulfill international transactions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no concrete reason why we\u2019re blocked. The last payment we made via the account was our Delaware Franchise Tax and we did that last week,\u201d said Charles Dairo, co-founder and CEO of Beezop, one of many startups whose accounts were temporarily blocked.\n\nWhile Beezop was lucky to have sent out their own tax payment prior to the event, some founders have not yet filed theirs, and failure to do so may lead to them being fined as the deadline was on Tuesday. Other founders who used the bank for more frequent transactions complained that the pending transactions they sent out are getting bounced and this is affecting their fiscal operation.\n\nwe have two vendors and several payments that we can't fulfil and one can imagine the rest of stories https://t.co/9N7mfOCaGC \u2014 ET (@ebottabi) March 1, 2022\n\nThe implications of this incident are bad for the affected startups but it has also put a terrible dent on Mercury\u2019s reputation on the continent.\n\nMany African founders and ecosystem players have come out to suggest a boycott and others have suggested a home-built alternative that only either serves African founders or black owned businesses.\n\nA black community-owned global digital bank for black-owned startups, fund managers, businesses, creators, etc. is needed. \u2014 Dayo Koleowo (@NateKorl) March 1, 2022\n\nNotably, even a home-built alternative will need partnership with foreign banks to fly. Digital business bank account providers like Mercury need to collaborate with, oftentimes, traditional banks who can choose to pull the plug anytime. Like in this case.\n\nThis situation is similar to instances on Wise, Paypal, and other international cross-border payment networks that often lock individual African users out of their accounts. Could this be the beginning of an extension to African businesses?\n\nTechCabal reached out to Mercury for comments and their response was similar to what the CEO had already said.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that one of our backend banks has suspended the accounts of a number of Mercury customers in Africa. While the bank was acting in compliance with its internal procedures, the suspension has adversely affected some customers and we are working with the bank to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. We\u2019re reaching out to the customers impacted directly, and apologize for the disruption this event has caused,\u201d Mercury said in the email to TechCabal.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, the questions that are yet to be answered are: what unusual activity occurred, who is the partner that pulled the plug, why did this affect only African startups, and why didn\u2019t Mercury notify its users before restricting their accounts after it got a nudge from its partner?\n\nShare this article",

But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Inside NIPOST\u2019s latest financial inclusion play: Agency banking and fingerprint authentication",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fintech space, phrases like \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d and \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d have become so prevalent that they\u2019ve almost certainly become buzzwords. Sometimes, it appears that a fintech startup claiming to be the latest saviour is born every second.\n\nThis is hardly surprising considering the proliferation of fintech startups in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem and the largely unsolved problem of the unbanked. According to the Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), the country\u2019s financial exclusion rate is 35.9% \u2014 one of the highest in Africa.\n\nThat leaves almost 54% unbanked. Considering the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) plan to increase that number to 94% by 2024, there\u2019s still quite a bit to be done. And the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has recently thrown its hat in this ring.\n\nIn January 2022, NIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja. The platform comes with a free debit card that works offline and online and is available at all NIPOST outlets in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, the agency banking platform would follow the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) standards on financial inclusion. He also said that this is part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise the postal services and improve financial inclusion in the country.\n\nHow would this work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy UPU standards, NIPOST\u2019s agency banking platform should provide essential services like savings, payments, money transfers, insurance, and credit. However, it appears the platform would work much like a multi-teller PoS-based service, so the exact mechanics of how NIPOST hopes to serve its customers are a bit sketchy.\n\nTechpoint Africa sent a mail to the Postmaster General\u2019s office but received no reply and a visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that not much is known about the platform yet other than its March expected launch date.\n\nHowever, NIPOST is licensed by the CBN as a super agent and, by CBN guidelines, cannot provide insurance or credit facilities.\n\nAccording to Pantami, the free debit card would use biometric authentication.\n\nIn Africa, South Africa-based fintech, Paycode, provides biometric debit cards, which the company says are operational in several countries, including Namibia, Botswana, Nigeria, and Mozambique. In Namibia, Paycode works with the Namibia Post Ltd (NamPost).\n\nA biometric debit card uses the owner\u2019s fingerprints to authenticate transactions, ensuring additional security and ease of use by the uneducated, thus making it suitable for financial inclusion, especially in rural areas.\n\nThis also means the card can be used offline. For example, Paycode says anyone with access to its API can verify users biometrically without connecting to the Internet. ExtoLabs, a California-based software company with plans to launch in Africa, uses a Bluetooth connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn unknown player\n\nInterestingly, NIPOST did not mention a partnership with any fintech company to deliver this card. However, pictures of the ceremony in Abuja reveal a name \u2014 GingrPay \u2014 etched on the demo cards.\n\nA Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) search uncovered a company named GingrPay Nigeria Limited incorporated on May 18, 2021. A Google search led to a third party website with more info like directors, shareholders, persons with significant control, and companies where GingrPay company officers show up as directors or shareholders.\n\nThe website cites GingrPay\u2019s activity description as \u201cTo facilitate electronic circulation of money as well as the exchange of value between individuals and organisations on a timely and consistent basis using technological softwares.\u201d\n\nA search on the CBN website does not turn up any licence registered to the company name.\n\nVisiting other nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, postal services are no strangers to providing financial services. In Brazil, Correios, the state-owned postal company, operates the Banco Postal in partnership with Banco do Brasil, providing banking services to the unbanked.\n\nIn India, the India Post Payments Bank is a subsidiary of the India Post and has been in operation since September 2018, serving over four crore \u2014 40 million \u2014 customers. Initially, because the India Post appeared to be haemorrhaging money, there was some resistance to the initiative.\n\nOn the continent, in Ghana, the Ghana Post provides various financial services like agency banking in partnership with banks, insurance, and GhPostPay, which enables users to make online transactions. Remittance services are currently suspended.\n\nIn the Benin Republic, government-owned Le poste du B\u00e9nin enables customers to have both savings and current accounts, and provides credit facilities, insurance, and remittance.\n\nNamibia\u2019s NamPost gives customers access to a funeral cover and a savings bank that provides investment products, and save-as-you-earn accounts, among other things.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, postal services are used by significantly poorer persons, older, less educated, and people less likely to be employed than those who have an account at a financial institution or both a financial institution and the post office.\n\nLogically, it follows that postal institutions are essential to fostering financial inclusion.\n\nThe financial inclusion play\n\nNIPOST has made several attempts in this arena.\n\nIn 2017, it signed a partnership agreement with Nigerian fintech startup, Paga, to improve financial inclusion.\n\nOn a call with Techpoint Africa, Arike Okunowo, General Manager, Sales and Distribution, explained that the partnership broke down after a few months because there were some issues surrounding the staffing needed to successfully run the business.\n\nThe partnership saw Paga provide the platform, which NIPOST\u2019s workers manned. But Okunowo explained that the staff already had primary assignments and this created conflict.\n\nAs she told Techpoint Africa, \u201cIf you want to run financial services, you need some level of focus so that if the customer comes in, you are always available to attend to them.\u201d\n\nShe also said that NIPOST was very keen on having its staff man the platform with no third-party interference. However, she also said that they would be open to a possible partnership with the postal company in the future.\n\nOn its financial services page, the postal service company says it provides domestic transfers, international remittance, agency banking \u2013 this appears to have been on the page since April 23, 2021 \u2013 and mobile money services.\n\nNIPOST owns an International Money Transfer Operators (IMTO) licence and says it has partnered with companies like Western Union.\n\nA visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that the agency no longer carries out any of these services and doesn\u2019t seem to have done so for a while, an offshoot of Pantami\u2019s decision in 2019, which saw the agency adopt a cashless policy. All cash transactions, including remittance, are to be done in a banking hall.\n\nThere are also plans to create a microfinance bank.\n\nWhat industry players are saying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkunowo believed NIPOST\u2019s infrastructure makes it a good centrepoint as a shared resource.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say NIPOST should actually be a shared resource for all the providers because of its infrastructure, and because it\u2019s such a major part of the Nigerian state.\u201d\n\nWhile Edidiong Uwemakpan, Director, Brand and Corporate Communications, TeamApt, believed the decision is commendable, she worried about fraud.\n\n\u201cWhere I begin to find challenges is that you were trying to eliminate cash. Now, part of agency banking is, of course, bill payments, and that makes sense. But then the cash in, cash out part of things, that\u2019s where I don\u2019t really see how they plan to do it.\n\n\u201cBecause, are you going to be giving your NIPOST workers a float so that they can give people cash? And you were already trying to eliminate cash in the past because of fraud.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that NIPOST appears not to have partnered with well-known fintechs. And while Okunowo could not confirm if NIPOST had approached Paga, Uwemakpan said TeamApt did not receive any communication from the postal agency.\n\nHowever, though Uwemakpan believed that the market is big enough to contain everyone, she raises concerns regarding the number of outlets NIPOST has \u2013 3,000 \u2013 and whether this would be enough to serve customers. She said NIPOST might need to expand its reach to compete.\n\nOne thing Okunowo and Uwemakpan agreed on is that this endeavour requires quite a lot of investment by NIPOST.\n\nA digital economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the Federal Government of Nigeria announced a three-year modernisation plan for NIPOST. By 2020, the postal agency was to have been unbundled into six subsidiaries: NIPOST Banking and Insurance Company; NIPOST Property and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Services Company; NIPOST E-government Services Company; and NIPOST E-commerce Services Company.\n\nIn January 2022, speaking at a media parley held in Abuja, Dr Ismail Adewusi, Postmaster General and CEO of NIPOST, said that NIPOST was to be unbundled once more, this time, in three places: NIPOST Properties and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Company; and NIPOST Microfinance Bank Limited.\n\nHe also said the unbundling would be done before the end of January 2022. However, there has been no announcement to that effect.\n\nThe NIPOST Act is still in the process of being repealed, and the Nigerian Postal Service (Repeal and Reenactment) Act 2021, passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives in 2021, is currently awaiting assent by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWhen assented to, this means that NIPOST can be unbundled into whatever subsidiaries it sees fit and would hold regulatory powers, making the Postal Agency a Commission.\n\nNIPOST has also partnered with several private companies on its path to full digitisation. In December 2021, it announced an agreement with Egyptian startup, eGATE to create an app that automates last-mile delivery. Customers will be able to track communication with drivers and monitor their delivery.\n\nIn 2018, NIPOST introduced its Address Verification System and Digital Address System. Both were done in collaboration with identity verification startup, Youverify, to improve mail delivery and resolve addressing issues, but the link to the website leads to a dummy page.\n\nHowever, interestingly, there are plans to launch a digital postal code system that is expected to solve the same problem before the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface level, NIPOST does seem to have a lot planned that should benefit the average citizen, but implementation and consistency appear to be lacking.\n\nTo pull off its latest scheme, it might require an overhaul of its entire processes \u2013 like its unbundling, for instance. But these are still early days, and there is much that can still happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find anyone who disagrees that most Nigerian companies provide terrible customer service.\n\nAs Nigeria recorded an increase in coronavirus cases in 2020, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was inundated with calls from Nigerians seeking information about the pandemic.\n\nMany of these callers were not attended to, and a small team in Lagos, Nigeria, built a call centre to handle as many as 1,000 calls concurrently. The NCDC never used their solution, and they began to consider other use cases. One, in particular, caught their attention.\n\nImproving customer experience for African businesses\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever encountered challenges while using the services of businesses, especially those in Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications industry, then you\u2019re familiar with the voice prompt that asks you to wait for a customer service agent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn my experience, you often have to wait a while before anyone attends to your problem. In some cases, the customer service agents fail to respond accurately.\n\nFounded in 2021 by Ugochukwu Okoro (CEO) and Joshua Olatunde (CTO), MyServiceAgent is a technology company that provides businesses with a range of tools to improve the customer experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of MyServiceAgent\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cAfter building MyServiceAgent, we discovered that it was a platform that can solve a key issue that was being faced not just by the NCDC but by a lot of businesses where we see customers call in to have their issues addressed, and they\u2019re usually placed on queues.\n\n\u201cFrom a survey we did, we discovered that the time given was usually inaccurate. I have spent 15 minutes waiting to speak to a customer care agent, and it never happened,\u201d Okoro says.\n\nMyServiceAgent is a voice-based customer engagement technology platform powered by artificial intelligence that helps businesses solve customer experience challenges. Its flagship product is the MyServiceAgent Smart Interactive Voice Response (IVR), which enables companies to simultaneously interact with as many as 1,000 customers while providing individual responses.\n\nThe startup does this by integrating with a business\u2019 customer relationship management (CRM) system, enabling it to understand a customer\u2019s needs and provide a response. It also uses artificial intelligence to train its software and improve responses.\n\nMyServiceAgent also provides a module that acts as a CRM for businesses without one that it can plug into, or it helps businesses set up a virtual call centre.\n\nProviding convenient and effective customer service solutions\n\nCustomer service is a crucial aspect of a business\u2019 operation, and poor customer service can lead to high churn. A few innovations have been built to solve this problem in the past decade. Businesses have used one of them, the chatbot, to fill in for human customer service agents, often routing unanswered questions to these agents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkoro believes that MyServiceAgent\u2019s solution is different and even better. One reason is the ability for customers to use its virtual call services without an Internet connection. Such a feature assumes increased importance when considering that Internet connectivity in most African countries is riddled with numerous challenges.\n\nAnother feature of MyServiceAgent\u2019s IVR is its ability to pick up conversations from where they ended and initiate subsequent calls with a customer.\n\n\u201cWith MyServiceAgent, businesses and customers can schedule calls. For example, a customer can call and say, \u2018I have this problem, but I\u2019ll be available within this period to resolve it, and MyServiceAgent on behalf of the business will initiate a call at the time the customer has chosen.'\u201d\n\nIn addition to its IVR solution, MyServiceAgent also provides a voice-powered OTP authentication, survey, and business messaging service for companies. Like the IVR offering, customers can choose a convenient time to respond to the business\u2019 inquiry.\n\nMyServiceAgent\u2019s business model\n\nSome entrepreneurs build solutions to problems without considering how they\u2019ll make money from them. However, except you\u2019re running a non-profit organisation, it helps to think of a way to generate revenue early enough.\n\nFor MyServiceAgent, using its services requires a business to have bought credit from which MyServiceAgent makes deductions based on usage. It charges a base fee of \u20a6250,000* ($500) to set up a virtual call centre. The startup has a \u20a67.50 ($0.015) cost per minute for inbound calls while it charges \u20a630 ($0.06) per minute for outbound calls with speech recognition.\n\n\u201cFor each of these functionalities, you need to have credit to be able to use them, and all of them are on a pay-as-you-go basis. The one that is a bit different is the virtual call centre which we charge a one-time fee to set up. Other than that, every service is on a pay-as-you-use basis.\u201d\n\nWhile MyServiceAgent has a base fee for its services, Okoro discloses that the startup is working hard to reduce the costs for businesses to ensure that small businesses can afford to use its services.\n\nSince its official launch in January 2022, the startup already has seven customers, including AltSchool, TalentQL, Truq, Uncommon Digital Vas, Akin Fadeyi Foundation, and Bumpa, with more going through an onboarding process.\n\nWhile it is still early days for the startup, Okoro reveals that there are already plans to expand into Ghana and Rwanda, with talks ongoing with a potential partner in Ghana. He also hopes that MyServiceAgent is a leading provider of cutting-edge customer service solutions globally. Meanwhile, it is eyeing unicorn status in the next five years.\n\n*at the exchange rate of \u20a6500 to $1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMTN has joined the league of companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Shopify betting big on the metaverse with the purchase of 144 plots of land in South Africa\u2019s first metaverse, Africarare. The land is situated in Ubuntuland, a virtual land modelled after the African landscape in Africarare.\n\nAfricarare was launched in October 2021 to bring African creativity to the metaverse. The launch featured the works of South African contemporary artist Norman Catherine as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the Milla Gallery located in Ubuntuland. The NFTs sold out shortly after the launch, fetching $53,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorman Catherine\u2019s work in Ubuntuland\n\nMTN\u2019s move into the metaverse could be another phase in its tech makeover. The telco rebranded by changing its logo from the popular white MTN text in a blue oval-shaped rim to simple black text in a black-rimmed oval.\n\nMTN Group Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer, Nompilo Morafo, said the rebranding is \u201caligned to our evolution from a telecommunications company to a technology company.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the metaverse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUbuntuland demo\n\nThere are over 200,000 plots of land in Ethereum-powered Ubuntuland positioned and priced based on a tiered value system.\n\nSouth African entrepreneur Mic Mann who co-founded the metaverse, told Newzroom Afrika \u2014 a South African 24-hour digital satellite television news channel \u2014 that he and his team had been working on the metaverse for six months before it launched.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen such an immense amount of growth within the NFT marketplace and metaverses across the USA, Asia, and Europe. But there hasn\u2019t been much coming out of Africa, and we feel this is a great opportunity for Africa to take part in this new world.\u201d\n\nHe likened the metaverse to a video game, saying gamers have been exploring the metaverse even before it became a buzzword.\n\n\u201cThey socialise with their friends by buying virtual goods and virtual assets in games like Minecraft.\u201d\n\nHowever, the metaverse has changed significantly; it is now blockchain and crypto-enabled, making it possible to bring virtual assets into the real world.\n\nThis is how Ubuntuland works. Its metaverse token, $UBUNTU, can be used to purchase land and art and rent out rooms for meetings. Another South African advertising agency \u2014 M&C Saatchi Abel \u2014 purchased land on Ubuntuland. And according to TECHCENTRAL, the agency opened an office in the metaverse to collaborate with global partners.\n\nWith virtual meetings and art and fashion shows taking place in Ubuntuland, one wonders why Africa\u2019s largest telecom company is entering the space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does this amplify the experience of MTN customers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA map of Ubuntuland\n\nIn a press release on the company\u2019s website, MTN\u2019s Group Executive for Marketing, Bernice Samuels, said the move was also part of its Ambition 2025 based on \u201cleveraging trends that amplify consumer\u2019s digital experiences and engagement.\u201d\n\nThough the metaverse is a buzzword often thrown around on the Internet, it\u2019s still very new in many parts of the world.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Vice President for Africa, Derya Matras, told Forbes Africa that while the metaverse could unlock massive economic opportunities for the continent, the connectivity isn\u2019t there yet.\n\n\u201cObviously, the metaverse is not there yet, and it\u2019s going to take a good ten years to build it all together as an industry,\u201d she said.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the end-game?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is MTN entering the metaverse if it isn\u2019t going mainstream soon? The telecom giant\u2019s rebrand will be more than what it wears and more about what it does to complete its transition from telco to tech.\n\nWhile the metaverse has become a popular word on the Internet, it will take well over a decade before it becomes mainstream. It is then interesting to wonder why MTN has chosen to enter the metaverse as part of its tech rebrand strategy.\n\nMTN has already established its dominance as a telecommunication behemoth, and its recent move suggests that the company is looking to shed its telco skin and begin to flex its fintech muscles.\n\nSome of the most prominent fintech startups on the continent, such as Flutterwave, Chipper Cash and Paystack, have a brand positioning that screams tech; with the amount of success recorded by these companies, it is safe to say that positioning has its perks.\n\nIn November last year, MTN revealed that it had gotten approval in principle to operate payment service banks (PSBs) in one of Africa\u2019s largest economies, Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Emmanuel Paul, Senior Reporter, Techpoint Africa, the move into the metaverse could be \u201ca strategic manoeuvre that has nothing to do with the metaverse,\u201d but more to do with remaining in customers\u2019 minds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "title": "Young Nigerian pilots lament \u2018pay to fly\u2019",
          "text": "A number of young Nigerian pilots seeking employment have a new challenge to contend with as some airlines are demanding that they pay to get trained and type-rated on certain aircraft before they are employed.\n\nBusinessDay investigations also show that after paying to get type-rated, some of the pilots still do not get jobs.\n\nA type rating is defined as an authorisation entered on or associated with a pilot licence and forming part thereof, stating his expertise pertaining to certain aircraft type. Such qualification requires additional training beyond the scope of the initial licence and aircraft class training.\n\nBefore now, the practice had always been for airlines to train pilots and get them type-rated to enable them to fly a particular aircraft in the fleet of the airline. But the situation is fast changing as airlines now ask pilots to go and train themselves to get type-rated or pay the airlines to do this for them.\n\nPilots lamented the situation, saying it was becoming very demanding to practice as a pilot.\n\nAccording to them, they have to pay to a training school approved by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, (NCAA) to get their air transport pilot licences and still have to pay to get type-rated to fly for an airline after graduating.\n\nSunday Arome, director of flight operations at Green Africa, who confirmed the situation, said many Nigerians were requested by an airline to do type-rating by themselves but they still did not get employed.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are some airlines that mention specific places where pilots have to be trained because they are sure of the standard of those places. And yet that airline may still not accommodate all of them. It is already happening; it is just that the airlines are failing the people. Pilots spend their money to get type-rated and they still do not have employment.\n\nRead also: Passengers groan as aviation fuel scarcity worsens flight delays\n\n\u201cThis is what Green Africa is trying to address. From day one, we are partnering with them. They are not paying 100 percent; they are paying something. Therefore, they will start to have a sense of belonging and from day one, they are already staff of the airline. We take care of them while they are on that training and they come back to a job.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, once pilots have their licences, all they need to fly for an airline is get type-rated, which is very expensive.\n\nThe NCAA requires a minimum of 1,500 to 2000 hours to fly in Nigeria as a pilot, after which an air transport pilot licence will be issued from the flight training school. After this, pilots can apply for a job in an airline, which is supposed to help type-rate the pilot.\n\nBusinessDay findings revealed that to train in an aviation school and get type-rated as a pilot costs about $40,000.\n\nIndustry stakeholders say being a pilot in Nigeria is fast becoming exclusively for the rich.\n\nBusinessDay learnt that airlines are adopting the new model because they observed over time that after investing in pilots by getting them type-rated, they left them for better offers without completing their contracts with the airlines.\n\nA pilot confirmed to BusinessDay on condition of anonymity that even after some pilots got trained and type-rated, there was still no guarantee of getting jobs.\n\nHe said in the past, airlines would train their crew on one or more of the fleet they were operating and then the crew (flight/cabin) signed a bond, usually for three to five years.\n\nAccording to him, the purpose of the bond is to pay off the training cost while ensuring the crew members do not leave within the contractual time.\n\nHe said, \u201cAirlines are usually the first to break the terms of the bond with late payment of salaries, taxes and pensions, poor conditions of service, etc.\n\n\u201cUsually, before a crew joins another airline, the employer does due diligence to ensure the crew seeking employment isn\u2019t bonded, sometimes as the case may be, a prospective employer may choose to offset the remainder of the bond while the crew will then sign a new contract with the other employer. The reasons given by the airlines are self-serving.\u201d\n\nIbrahim Mshelia, owner of West Link Airlines Nigeria and Mish Aviation Flying School, described the new practice by airlines as \u201cstrange, absurd and unacceptable.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cI have been a pilot for 40 years and I am also an operator. This is very strange to me and it is not a practice that I do. For an airline to ask candidate to type-rate by himself before working for him shows a short-cut to the process because for you to come into the airline business in the first place, you must have done your feasibility study and part of the requirement is that an airline is supposed to be training and retraining the crew.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong and unethical for airlines to demand from a candidate or a young pilot to train himself or pay them to train him. In my entire career, my employers always train me. I was given some bond and I served my bond. In my company, I employ people and train them and give them bonds and they serve their bond,\u201d\n\nAccording to Mshelia, if pilots do not serve their bonds, the pilots and the airlines would reach an agreement and they will pay the airlines off.\n\n\u201cAny pilot that does not live up to the agreement after being trained is a criminal and should be treated as such. They should be taken to court, and due process followed. Also, there are employers who violate terms and conditions of contract and if they do, then they have given room for pilots to exercise their rights to depart,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The $1.3bn planned deal between Seplat Energy Plc, a major energy company in Nigeria, and US-based ExxonMobil looks set to put the Petroleum Industry Act, which seeks to attract new oil and gas investments, to the test.\n\nWhile approving a steering committee to supervise the implementation of the PIA last year, President Muhammadu Buhari said Nigeria had lost $50 billion worth of investments in the petroleum industry since 2011 due to the absence of a new law.\n\nThe United States Energy Information Administration estimated that Nigeria lost over $15 billion annually due to the delay in the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill, which was first introduced in the National Assembly in 2008.\n\nSeplat announced on Friday that it had entered into a sale and purchase agreement to acquire the entire share capital of Mobil Producing Nigeria Limited (MPNU), the shallow-water business of ExxonMobil in Nigeria, for $1.28 billion.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that Seplat Energy and ExxonMobil had submitted their application for ministerial consent for the deal.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) has listed conditions that must be met before the deal sails through. Mele Kyari, the group managing director of NNPC, has said that International Oil Companies (IOCs) that divest from Nigeria\u2019s upstream oil sector must address issues of abandonment and decommissioning of oil assets.\n\nThe state oil firm has expressed concern that many of the oil and gas assets sold to Nigerians since 2012, mostly by the IOCs, are rarely decommissioned or properly abandoned, a development that clearly breaches existing laws regulating the industry.\n\nRead also: Petroleum industry in confusion as FG plans to amend new PIA\n\nNNPC\u2019s position is premised on its belief that as part of a joint venture with MPNU and with a 60 percent stake, it should have the right of first refusal over any sale or pre-empt the purchase, according to industry lingo.\n\nHowever, an analysis of the NNPC Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) with private oil companies by analysts at Wood Mackenzie found that since this is share sale, not an asset sale, NNPC lacks pre-emption rights.\n\n\u201cBecause this is a corporate acquisition, NNPC has no rights to pre-empt a deal under the Joint Operating Agreement, which governs the JV. This means that ministerial consent would be the only hurdle remaining,\u201d it said.\n\nThe analysts, however, said, \u201cNothing can be taken for granted.\u201d\n\nThe same holds true for Shell\u2019s ongoing divestment by its subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company, which similarly rules out pre-emption, the analysts said.\n\n\u201cIf NNPC wants to acquire that portfolio, then it will have to out-bid the competition. If successful in raising up to US$5 billion with Afreximbank, it would have the firepower to do just that, and massively strengthen its position in the onshore delta,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nThe PIA had turned the NNPC into a commercial firm and this was expected to remove its influence over the sector as both a player and regulator.\n\nOn the implications of the deal, Wood Mackenzie analysts said if completed, it would be transformational for Seplat Energy.\n\nThey said, \u201cIt is already the leading indigenous company in Nigeria, but this will triple its working interest production to over 140,000 boe/d. In total, Seplat will operate 15 percent of Nigerian oil production.\n\n\u201cCrucially, the deal diversifies its operations into shallow water, which is largely devoid of the thefts afflicting its onshore operations. Although this is Seplat\u2019s first offshore acquisition, it will acquire all of MPNU\u2019s Nigerian staff, thus allaying any concerns about its operational capabilities.\u201d\n\nThe planned share sale by ExxonMobil covers a portfolio that includes 1.3 billion boe of contingent resources, 75 percent of which is gas and less than half of its 70 fields have been developed.",

It should focus on that area. You are focusing on these social services and amenities at a time when the economy of the nation is depressed and not growing at all.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cSome of the things that happened in the recent past can\u2019t be spoken about publicly. I urge the commission never to allow what happened during the sharing of conditional cash transfer from the Federal Government to happen again.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not happy and are angry with the way the conditional cash transfer and sharing of social and economic amenities were handled. The commission needs to look at that and never allow it to happen again.\u201d\n\nNoting that the visit came at the right time as it was necessary to address the lingering issues troubling Nigerians, Obaseki said: \u201cOur founding fathers thought it wise that, in order to preserve the unity of this country, they needed to create a commission that would complement the policy which ensured that every Nigerian will feel that they are part of the country. This was done so that whatever belongs to the country would be equitably and fairly distributed to all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThank you for keeping the spirit of the constitution alive and trying to enforce the constitution as many people feel marginalised in spite of the effort of the commission. Nigerians feel they are not getting what is due them.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe cake we are trying to share in this country is becoming too small as our focus is to build a bigger cake that will be equitably shared. Everybody should be made to contribute something to the national cake for it to be enough for us to share.\n\n\u201cYou have done well as you go about to implement the first task of your mandate, which is ensuring equitable distribution of positions. In fairness, you have done well in that regard.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Executive Chairman, Federal Character Commission, Dr. Muheeba Dankaka, said the visit is in continuation of her engagements with critical stakeholders in the country, adding: \u201cUpon assumption of office, I made it a matter of policy to consult widely and drink from the wealth of experiences of our leaders of thought like you to guide my actions in the course of my assignment.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Character Commission was established with a primary focus of ensuring a strong, virile and indivisible nation, based on fairness, equity and justice, to promote national unity, foster national loyalty and give every citizen of Nigeria a sense of belonging to the nation, notwithstanding the diversities of ethnic origin, culture, language or religion, which may exist.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Shah, Senior Country Manager for Nigeria, International Finance Corporation (IFC) said in his remarks, \u201cIFC\u2019s commitment to advancing gender equality is anchored in a strong business case that ensures equal opportunities for both men and women to reach their full potential, and help economies achieve sustainable growth and prosperity. By addressing persistent gender gaps and increasing women\u2019s participation as leaders, companies can achieve improved business performance. Through the IFC-led Nigeria2Equal gender program, the goal is to invest in increasing women\u2019s participation in corporate leadership, employment and entrepreneurship. For leadership, today marks a significant milestone in the advancement of women as leaders and board chairs.\u201d\n\nIn her remarks, Erelu Angela Adebayo, Chairperson, NGX Real Estate Limited appreciated the Board of Directors of Nigerian Exchange Limited for the laudable initiative. She acknowledged the transition of NGX Group of Companies from a company with less than 30% female representation on the National Council of The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) to a Group of four companies with two female Chairs. She also commended NGX for its continuous efforts in collaborating with renowned organisations such as the IFC and leveraging its platform to make gender issues front and centre in the economic agenda.\n\nOn her part, Mrs. Catherine Echeozo, Chairman of NGX Regulation Limited, acknowledged and congratulated the board chairperson appointees being celebrated, highlighting the benefits of diversity. She stated, \u201cdiversity is about tapping on the full breadth and depth of talent available and equipping companies with diverse talents and viewpoints so that they can better navigate and address challenges in an increasingly complex and competitive global environment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the prevailing barriers facing women in leadership positions, Dr. Omobola Johnson, Chair, Guinness Nigeria Plc, said, \u201cit is quite ironic that we are celebrating the advancements we have made in corporate governance a day after the National Assembly voted very strongly against a bill that was seeking to address the imbalance in female representation in all facets of our national life. Building a greater nation requires all hands to be on deck. Women want to be partners and collaborators on this journey and we cannot be if we are excluded by law, cultural practices and norms.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the opportunities that corporate organisations can leverage from promoting gender equality, Mrs. Bola Adesola, Chairman, Ecobank Nigeria, stated, \u201cAs a pre-eminent Pan-African institution in over 33 African countries, our focus on gender balance supports our mission to contribute to the economic and financial development of our continent. This is so because one in four Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, in Africa is managed by a woman. Ecobank is very happy to continue to collaborate with NGX and IFC to Break the Bias. I would like to urge us all to diligently work against actions that threaten the human rights of half the population of our dear country.\u201d\n\nDr. (Mrs.) Ajoritsedere Awosika, MFR, Chairman, Access Bank Plc, in her remarks, congratulated all the recent board appointees and highlighted the importance of celebrating female leaders as a critical step to inspiring younger professional women, she said, \u201cthis Closing Gong Ceremony is a laudable occasion where NGX has shown that evidently, there is a need to celebrate women in order for other women to come up. This celebration of women that NGX is implementing in partnership with IFC is going to go a long way to show other institutions the need to promote what is ongoing at all levels of human endeavor that women are actively getting into positions of service to make a positive difference.\u201d\n\nThe event was hosted as a key element of NGX Group of Companies\u2019 2022 International Women\u2019s Day (IWD) celebrations which is hosted annually to showcase the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. This year\u2019s NGX Group of Companies\u2019 IWD celebrations will be hosted on Tuesday, 8 March 2022 alongside the 8th Ring the Bell for Gender Equality in collaboration with International Finance Corporation (IFC), Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) Initiative, United Nations (UN) Women, UN Global Compact (UNGC) and World Federation of Exchanges (WFE).\n\nThe virtual event is expected to feature Dame Pauline Tallen (OFR), Honourable Minister of Women Affairs, Federal Republic of Nigeria; and Amb. Mariam Yalwaji Katagum, Federal Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment of Nigeria, as well as leading financial industry experts such as Ms. Tokunboh Ishmael, MD/CEO, Alitheia Capital; Ms. Tinuade Awe, Chief Executive Officer, NGX Regulation; and Ms. Robyn Oates, Sustainable Finance Specialist, UN Women; among others to discuss the theme, Break the Bias: Gender Equality Today for a Sustainable Tomorrow.",

          "text": "These nine (9) Nigerian men and their personal style stand out wherever they go. They don\u2019t try too hard; they just have that intangible something \u2013 clothes that fit right, appropriate accessories, knowing what to wear and how to mix trends. Their taste is classic with a modern twist, individualist without overthinking or overdoing.\n\nSanusi Lamido Sanusi\n\nDescribed as one of Nigeria\u2019s most intelligent men, former Emir of Kano, former CBN governor and philanthropist, Dr Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, is quite a fashionista. This Kano prince was always luxuriously adorned when he was Emir of Kano. His sense of style, the intricacy of the embroidered robes, rich fabrics, and contrasting turbans and accessories never failed to stun. That wardrobe belongs in an art gallery fit for royalty. Mallam Sanusi is probably one of the most stylish traditional rulers that Nigeria has ever seen.\n\nHerbert Wigwe\n\nThe chief executive officer/group managing director of Access Bank Plc., Herbert Wigwe, is intent on changing the African narrative to the world through driving innovation and supporting African creative talent through the \u2018Avant Garde\u2019 series on CNN.\n\nThis very busy CEO savours the classic style and is always well turned out.\n\nTony Elemelu\n\nInvestor, serial entrepreneur, philanthropist and the list goes on, Tony Elemelu was on the Times list of 100 most influential people in the world in 2020. This hugely successful entrepreneur is not lagging behind in the style stakes. His personal style is contemporary classic with an occasional quirk added with his casual T-shirts and cool sneakers.\n\nEyimofe Atake\n\nEyimofe Atake is a lawyer and senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN). Lawyers are said to be boring dressers, not this man. His style is somewhere between classic and preppy, with a wide collection of colourful shirts, ties and socks, and cool leisure wear. Adventurous and daring, he never fails to turn heads.\n\nJohn Obayuwana\n\nWho hasn\u2019t heard of Polo Luxury Group? If you have a discerning taste for luxury goods, then you probably know of John Obayuwana. This seventy-something-year-old man keeps us on our toes and is constantly pushing boundaries that younger men would not dare to with his impeccable taste in his fashion choices. He never takes himself nor his wardrobe too seriously.\n\nPaul Adefarasin\n\nA minister, philanthropist, author and motivational speaker, Paul Adefarasin is the founder and senior pastor of The House on the Rock. He is known for his yearly concert, \u2018The Experience\u2019, an all-night gospel concert hosted every year in Lagos, and is by far one of the biggest concerts to ever hold in Nigeria, with celebrity gospel stars from around the world in attendance.\n\nPastor Adefarasin has mastered the art of dressing for his build in his crisp single-breasted suits, in his native attire, with emphasis on a clean silhouette and immaculate details.\n\nMai Atafo\n\nFashion designer, bespoke tailor, Mai Atafo\u2019s menswear and womenswear brand specialises in bespoke suits, occasion wear and bridal outfits. He is well known for his flamboyant style, from sharp tailoring to vibrant colour mixes. A man who loves fashion, he\u2019s always impeccably turned out\n\nFemi Otedola\n\nNigerian businessman, philanthropist and founder of Zenon Petroleum and Gas Ltd, with other business interests in shipping, insurance, real estate and banking, Otedola is a very busy CEO who never seems to stop. This, however, doesn\u2019t stop him from looking good. His style is understated \u2013 natural, solid and effortless.\n\nUmar Garba Danbatta\n\nAuthor and professor of electrical telecommunications engineering, Professor Danbatta is the CEO of Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nThis gentle giant is usually dressed in a sharp, yet conservative, suit, and his well-tailored Baban riga traditional wear. He carries every attire well and has an impeccable sense of style.",

          "text": "Nollywood thespian Monalisa Chinda Coker speaks to LeVogue on what shaped her life, her career and the humanitarian work she\u2019s involved in that is bringing joy to her world, among others. And in spite of all she\u2019s done and doing, she says she\u2019s still your girl next door. Enjoy the read.\n\nYou started out as an actress/Nollywood superstar and then made the transition to a talk show host with your show, \u2018You & I With Monalisa;\u2019 how has the journey been?\n\nStarting out as an actor has been great. I met with hurdles and challenges along the way but it\u2019s been worth every experience. Even though acting wasn\u2019t what I had wished for, I did anyway. I studied theatre arts at the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, which, as expected, should be a thing of joy for me, but that is a story for another day.\n\nHaving acted in over 250 movies, produced over seven movies, directed a couple, a publisher of my magazine which was short-lived, and presently owning my own talk show, I actually thought I had arrived (chuckles) but then this is actually the beginning of me \u2018becoming\u2019. Presently in my fifth season, \u201cYou and I with Monalisa\u201d did set out to capture a blend of rich content, inspiring guest interviews and engaging creativity. The wealth of this enigmatic talk show is augmented by the years of hard work and experiences I have garnered over the years, rolling all up on a very popular platform that has stood the test of the time. Through my 27 years in the entertainment industry, be it as a brand ambassador or a screen actor, hosting talk/engagement has always been a dream jealously locked away for the right moment. \u2018You and I with Monalisa\u2019 debuted in 2014 (7 years ago) and I must confess it has been one of the most gratifying and uplifting experience of my career to date.\n\nYou also set up a foundation called Arise Monalisa Foundation to raise awareness for Lupus, Autism and other social issues; how does it feel using your platform to inspire hope and create awareness about these issues?\n\nArise Monalisa Foundation was launched in 2012 and is essentially an Africa-based not-for-profit institution dedicated to inspiring hope, promoting creativity and creating opportunities for the less privileged across the continent. It was initially created for women and children who had been through some sort of gender-based violence, to support women, children and youths living with autism. You can check the website, www.arisemonalisafoundation.org, for further enquiries. I am a humanitarian, with a burning passion to be of service to humanity. Over the years, the organisation has made incredible impact on the lives of people. We work with various organisations, schools, and churches to access the young and support them with mentoring or resources for a brighter future.\n\nYou have interviewed prolific actresses on your talk show \u2013 the likes of Joke Silva, Taiwo Ajayi, Lycett, etc; what does it feel like being in the presence of so much greatness?\n\nThat was Season 3 of the show and the theme was \u2018Made in Nigeria\u2019. It was indeed a blessing to have such great minds gracing the hot seat with their presence. I was honoured and that experience wouldn\u2019t be forgotten in a hurry. We talked about the show that was currently the rave of the moment at the time called \u2018Hear Word, Naija Woman Talk True\u2019 by Ifeoma Fafunwa. The stage play was about the Nigerian woman and her struggles. We talked about everything the women go through in this part of the world, based on true life stories of gender inequality and transformation. You see, that is what the show is about \u2013 people with unique brands. The esteemed guests who honour our invitations to feature on the show are key motivating factors. So, on both personal and professional levels, I am left with a deep sense of purpose and fulfilment with the amazing experiences of live interviews with CEOs, celebrities, young entrepreneurs to skilled professionals. Memories of time spent traversing the many layers of our amazing country, or just simply interacting with the audience encourage me to do more.\n\nWhat is your greatest strength and what is your greatest weakness?\n\nWell, let me start with my weaknesses which I have in abundance \u2026lol, and that is love for humanity. I have carried uncountable acts of kindness that had me question my person and integrity, left me speechless and helpless. But one thing stood out in all of these countless errors \u2013 the universe always conspires to help me out of every sticky situation I find myself in. I don\u2019t know how that happens but it does happen! God by some divine intervention just inadvertently shows up, and on time, to rescue me. That has always been my story. My strengths \u2013 I\u2019d say because I have encountered defeats \u2013 I cannot let myself be deleted. So many people are looking up to me. So many. I can\u2019t let them down. This is where I draw my strength from; therefore, I must at every time reinvent myself, remain focused. My vision has never shifted; it remains clear, no matter the hell or high water ahead of me. I have a clear mind of what I want and I go for it.\n\nYou have always remained level-headed in spite of being a Nollywood superstar; what keeps you grounded?\n\nHmmm! Maybe it\u2019s who I am, nothing moves me, I guess. That\u2019s not to say I do not get excited or I am emotionless, but every of my thoughts, mind, and intentions must be weighed. Again, it has a lot to do with my background! I was raised on strict moral grounds and values. Therefore, I try to stay very calm and sensible even in difficult situations. I pause and think before I react or respond to any critical situation. My mental state is on another level. I have developed my mental faculties in a way that I am able to ascertain when to react and when not to. And above all, staying true to myself and not coming across as someone who is robotic \u2013 if you get my drift.\n\nWhat have you learnt about yourself since you became a celebrity?\n\nBeing a public figure, I have learnt perception management, especially as regards the entertainment industry, social media and people. Because I am a people\u2019s person and an influential brand in the social space and my industry, managing information is key. Communication influences our perception of people and situations. And as the director of communication of the Actors Guild of Nigeria, managing information and how to communicate these messages falls within my purview. So far, so good, my office has done incredibly well as regards that. You see what I mean when I say a lot is expected of me and the organisation I represent. Let\u2019s not make any mistake about it, it\u2019s difficult but it\u2019s worth the trial.\n\nWhat advice would you give young people that want to go into the entertainment industry?\n\nMy advice for the young ones who are likely to try their hands in entertainment is simply to stay true to themselves. Focus more on the business of showbiz and not get carried away by fame. Fame would always be there to find you, not the other way round.\n\nHow has fame affected your daily life?\n\nFame is a blessing to those who are able to turn it into a thing of joy and of good. It is beautiful when you use the fame to change the lives of people who are struggling to understand why they were made to come to the world to witness what they are yet to comprehend. As a humanitarian I\u2019d like to be remembered for reaching out to the needy and to the displaced. I can still remember vividly the impact I made when I was a contributor column writer in the Sun Newspaper way back in 2011 and 2012. You would never have imagined; I garnered a lot of readers who were touched by my articles and sought panacea to their aches.\n\nWho would you consider your role models?\n\nRole models? Women like Ibidun Awosika have helped shape my life. I am not close to her, I doubt if she even knows me, but the way she has carried on with her involvement in capacity building, sitting on boards of conglomerates yet possessing such humility is amazing, impacting both young and old in different sectors and walks of life. She exudes inner beauty, elegance and intelligence. I can\u2019t put into words how much she\u2019s built up my confidence. Gosh, I love that soul. The second is Rev Mrs Oyiks Alfred. She is an epitome of truth undiluted. I call her my living reality. My encounter with her is a story for another day.\n\nIf you weren\u2019t a celebrity, what would you be?\n\nI would have been a female monk. Please don\u2019t ask me how?\n\nHow do you unwind?\n\nSoak myself in a warm bath with all the salts and relaxing mixtures you can ever think of, surrounded by candles of divine scents, listening to soothing travel music like Steve Morgan. When I read, I get lost in a good book and leave my daily tasks behind for a bit.\n\nWhat would your favourite holiday look like? And where would it be?\n\nHoliday spot would be somewhere in the Maldives with a loved one, away from social media for a week or two, with my 13-year-old beside me \u2013 if for nothing, but just to appreciate the wonder of her creator. Also, I love Paris. I never get bored there whether it\u2019s summer or winter.\n\nWho would you want to spend 24 hours with?\n\nHaa, apart from God? Hmm, perhaps with\u2026 I honestly can\u2019t figure that out now!\n\nIf you were given the opportunity to rule Nigeria for just one week, what changes would you effect?\n\nI would honestly want a) The health sector to be completely overhauled, revamped and have doctors and nurses be more compassionate. Compassion is what is missing in that profession. b) The educational sector: Little or no funding from the government leads to lack of educational infrastructure, lack of quality teachers, etc. Funding is key. c) The judiciary: Strengthen judiciary integrity and capacity and better investigation. d) The tourism sector: Develop Nigeria\u2019s beaches, invest in Nigeria\u2019s tourism sector, promote tourist products through social media. Promote buy made-in-Nigeria brands and grow Nigeria\u2026etc. e) Unemployment: Achieving industrialisation, making agriculture more attractive, improving Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals as a source of economic development and raw materials. The list is endless.\n\nIn what way has the Covid-19 pandemic affected the way you view life and the way you do your work?\n\nCovid-19 only made my life and my work a lot easier. 80 percent of the time I work from home, except I am needed on set which seldom happens these days because of the pandemic. I am not exactly a social butterfly, and if I want to socialise I do it in smaller doses. So yes, Covid made me realise my hidden potential \u2013 which is reading and researching. I am always at home and at peace with myself. I do a lot of travelling which is work-related, and when I can\u2019t travel, I am in one zoom meeting or the other. The Covid hasn\u2019t affected me negatively, rather I discovered hidden potential which I am using to change my world and the people around me. And in spite of all these businesses I am running at the moment, I am still very much your girl next door.",

          "title": "Is Skin Bleaching a Nigerian Menace?",
          "text": "In a circulated video on social media, two kids, black and white respectively, were asked to differentiate which was more beautiful between the dark and light-skinned dolls placed in front of them. Both said the dark-skinned doll was ugly. Also, there\u2019s a video of a girl in tears, telling her aunt that she feels ugly because she is dark-skinned. The aunt told her that she is beautiful, and that her skin colour is a blessing. Sadly, it\u2019s mainy believed in African societies that fair skin is more attractive. It is this belief that has pushed many women, and some men, to resort to bleaching their skin to make themselves lighter in complexion.\n\nSkin bleaching occurs when skincare products containing toxic compounds, mixed with agents like mercury, hydroquinone and other chemicals, are used to reduce the concentration of melanin and enhance the skin by making it lighter. Injections and pills are also prescribed and administered for skin bleaching. These chemicals decrease the number of melanocytes on the skin and give it a fairer looking texture. Bleaching is the same as whitening, brightening, and toning. It changes the skin from its original texture. It is also worthy of note that more women than men bleach their skin. Dealers in bleaching products now call them organic skincare products to cover up the word, bleaching. It\u2019s still the same mixture of unknown chemicals for skin bleaching.\n\nA controversial report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2011 revealed that 77.3% of Nigerian women use skin lightening products on daily basis, followed closely by Togo at 59%, Senegal at 27% and Mali, 25%, making it a West African menace. In Nigeria, however, many people link fair skin to beauty while dark-skinned women have often been seen as less beautiful, or downright ugly \u2013 a very unfortunate trend.\n\nFindings by LeVogue has revealed that sale of skin bleaching products is good business. Recently, a woman selling bleaching cream was seen bragging on social media about her business success and how she was able to buy herself a mansion and a luxury car. The business is lucrative in Nigeria. Globally, skin lightening products as of 2020 gulped a whooping $8billion and is projected to grow into $11billion in year 2025.\n\nPeople bleach their skin because of the preference for fair-skinned people. Institutions, entertainment industry, beauty pageants and many others in the society are known to favour fair-skinned people above dark-skinned people.\n\nThis, amongst other factors, is the reason behind the obsession by women to go the extra mile to bleach their skin in order to boost their self-esteem and acceptance in the society. It has been perceived also that a fair-skinned person believes that she is better looking than a dark-skinned person.\n\nBeauty pageantry in Nigeria is mainly dominated by fair-skinned ladies with little or no chance for girls with dark skin, same with video vixen, corporate organisation marketers, etc. In a situation where a fair-kinned person is constantly used to portray and set a standard for beauty, some people feel forced to bleach their skin.\n\nSome people suffer from mental illnesses like depression, anxiety, fear of rejection, and low self-esteem because of the rejection they feel due to their skin tone.\n\nReports have shown that most men prefer to marry or date fair-skinned women because she is seen as more beautiful and attractive. The notion that black is bad and white is good has further affected people\u2019s perception and has led to serious skin bleaching.\n\nThere are looming dangers surrounding skin bleaching. Some harmful chemicals and chemical components used in producing the creams and soaps could lead to kidney failure, skin discolouration, skin and blood cancers like leukemia and skin ulcers and uneven skin tone.\n\nParents, guardians, and the society have the responsibility to educate young children and help in boosting their self-esteem and self-value so that they are comfortable in their own skin.\n\nSkin bleaching is harmful, but it is a personal choice. Adults are expected to make the right decisions, but, ultimatey, everybody should be allowed to choose how they look.\n\nWould you rather bleach your skin for acceptance or maintain your natural skin tone?",

          "title": "FAAC: \u2018How Aregbesola\u2019s N200bn loan landed Osun in -N375m allocation\u2019",
          "text": "The Osun State Government\u2019s fiscal receipts from the Federal Accounts and Allocation Committee ( FACC) got depleted last month following appropriate deductions by the federal government.\n\nAt the end of the last FAAC meeting, the state got negative allocation of -N375million.\n\nThe negative allocation, it was learnt, was a major fallout of the N200 billion loan obtained by the Rauf Aregbesola administration from 2010 to 2018.\n\nThe sharp drop in allocation, it was gathered, was as a result of heavy Petroleum Motor Spirit(PMS) subsidy, otherwise called petroleum.\n\nAregbesola, who is currently the minister of interior, served out two terms as governor of Osun state.\n\nBlueprint gathered from multiple sources that as at the last count, the Governor Adegboyega Oyetola-led administration had repaid about N72 billion of the accumulated debt.\n\n\u201cA breakdown shows that in the first two years of the Oyetola administration, the state government paid N2.4billion (monthly) of the loan obtained by the immediate past administration.\n\n\u201cHowever, after paying N72 billion of the N200 billion loan, the deductions from FAAC dropped to N1.4billon monthly, thus amounting to N72billion of the debt sum so far paid by the current government,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nIt was further gathered that since coming on board, Governor Oyetola has not borrowed any money (local or foreign) in the running of his administration, including paying workers\u2019 salaries.\n\nHowever, our source further revealed that \u201cwith N1.45 billion, being the actual allocation to the state from FAAC last month, the state went home with a negative of \u2013N385million, implying that the sum would be deducted in the next allocation.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to the N1.8billion to be originally deducted in servicing the loan obtained by the Aregbesola administration.\u201d\n\nBlueprint\u2019s findings revealed that despite the huge debt profile incurred by the previous administration in the state, several projects embarked upon by the administration were left uncompleted with about 30-month salary and pension arrears left as liability for the current government.\n\n\u201cDespite the negative allocation, Osun has since paid February salaries.\u201d\n\nEfforts by our reporter to get the state\u2019s Commissioner for Finance, Bola Oyebamiji speak on how February salaries were paid and other obligations met, proved abortive.\n\nBut a top government source, who spoke under anonymity said: \u201cFor Governor Oyetola, he has really brought his dexterity and sense of management to work in running the state\u2019s affairs in the midst of this heavy debt overhang of N200 billion and other daunting challenges.\n\n\u201cIt has been tough no doubt, but we have a man who really prepared for the challenges of governance. Oyetola is brutally prudent as a governor. He has blocked leakages and wastages. By thinking out of the box, he had made projections on how to ensure salaries do not fail for the next four years.\n\n\u201cHe is not the type that gives excuses and that is why he prioritises workers\u2019 welfare. Remember, he hasn\u2019t borrowed a kobo since coming on board, yet, this silent achiever is rolling out projects. Not many governors who found themselves in his shoes would resist the \u2018temptation\u2019 of borrowing like he is doing.\u201d\n\nGovt a continuum \u2013 Ex-gov\u2019s aide\n\nReacting to our story, the media aide to the former governor, Sola Fasure, said government is a continuum and that Aregbesola\u2019s successor inherited both assets and liability.\n\nHe said: \u201cThese are mere allegations. The matter is already in the public domain. There is no such thing like N200billion. It is a false allegation. Some of the projects on which the debts were incurred, the federal government had been reimbursing the state government.\n\n\u201cThe state government has got reimbursement from the federal government. A government will leave for you both asset and liability. When people talk about liability, ask them about the asset. Aregbesola had left four years ago now, both asset and liability is what they inherited.\u201d",

          "title": "Revealed! When Nigeria will pay off $3.5bn loan debts to China \u2013 Blueprint Newspapers Limited",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nFrom 2023, the federal government, under seven elected presidents would require no fewer than 24 years to pay off the $3,593.42 billion loans Nigeria currently owes the China Exim Bank, majority of which life span ranges from a minimum of five to maximum of 20 years.\n\nHowever, the terminal date for the repayment of the bulk of the debts would only remain feasible if Nigeria does not draw further loans from the Asian nation before the end of the life of the present administration and subsequent others.\n\nFive new governments\n\nSubsequent governments beginning in 2023, 2027, 2031, 2035, 2039, 2043, and perhaps that in 2047 will bear the burden of generating funds to upset the loans obtained to execute capital projects, which when completed and optimally operated, should generate enough resources to recoup both the capital and interests accruable to the loans and provide services to uplift the socio-economic well-being of Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\nAll the loans carry 20-year maturity period and seven years of grace-a period the borrower is allowed to gather itself, while each loan instrument attracts varying percentages ranging from 2.50% to 2.75% interest rates, based on the prevalent foreign exchange rate as at the time payment is made.\n\nTotal debts profile\n\nNigeria\u2019s current debt stock is broken into five major categories namely: the multilateral, World Bank Group, bilateral, commercial and promissory notes. Based on the September debts profile released by the Debt Management Office (DMO), the multilateral subtotal is put at $3,469.45bn, next subtotal and the country\u2019s highest debts owed the World Bank group is $18,284.09bn, an amount that is 48.17% of the total debts stock.\n\nThe data equally shows that the sum total of bilateral debts including those to China Exim Bank, India Exim Bank, France (Agence Francaise Development), Japan (Japan International Cooperation Agency), and Germany (Kreditanstalt Fur Wiederaufbua) stands at $4,398.56bn, which is 11.59% of the grand total.\n\nOf this amount, debt to the China Exim Bank is $3,593. 42bn and represents about 87% of Nigeria\u2019s bilateral debts. The commercial subtotal, according to the DMO, is $14, 668.35 billion and is 38.65%, while promissory notes subtotal takes the rear with $604.09 billion, a mere 1.59% of the $37,955.09 billion grand total of Nigeria\u2019s debt stock profile as at the third quarter of 2021.\n\nOur investigations revealed that if everything proceeds as planned, Nigeria would likely have finished paying off the $3.5bn bilateral loans debts it presently owed to the China Exim Bank by 2047.\n\nMost of the debts have a 20-year maturity period with seven (7) years moratorium\u2013period of grace clause-injected into the structure of the various loans agreement to repay the principal.\n\nData obtained from the DMO alluded to the fact that Nigeria\u2019s public debt rose to a record N38 trillion in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nThe data further showed the debt profile has an increase of N2.54 trillion when compared with the corresponding figure of N35.4 trillion at the end of Q2, 2021.\n\nAlso, it indicates that Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) plunged to its lowest in more than a decade in 2021.\n\nThe FDI nosedived to $77 million in Q2, 2021, a 49.6% decline from $154.7 million in the Q1of the year.\n\nThe development led to Nigeria being classified as a high-risk business environment which has continued to discourage foreign capital inflow into the economy.\n\nDMO clarifies\n\nAccording to the November 2021 publication of the DMO, Nigeria\u2019s outstanding debts to China (Exim Bank of China) is $3,593.42 billion, an amount that is second only to the $11,569.51billion it also owed the International Development Association.\n\nClarifying on Nigeria\u2019s debt portfolio to China, the DMO said loans from China to Nigeria at present stands at $3.59billion, and constitutes only 9.4 per cent of the country\u2019s total foreign debt stock of $37.9billion.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s total debt stock as at September 30 was $37.9bn; this figure comprised the external debt stock of the federal government, 36 state governments and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cBut total loans from China stand at 3.59 billion dollars, which is 9.47 per cent of the total external debt. The loans did not require any national asset as collateral; they were largely concessional,\u201d Director-General DMO Ms Patience Oniha said.\n\nIn a document published on its website, DMO reveals that the debts consist of N22.43 trillion for domestic and N15.57 trillion external.\n\n$1.4bn repaid\n\nThe DMO data analysis equally shows that various Nigerian governments since 2002 and up till 2019 had approached and secured loans agreements with the Chinese government totalling $6.1 billion (N2.50trillion) for 15 projects out of which $4.1 billion has been disbursed.\n\nRecords provided by the DMO listed full disbursement of loans sums obtained between December 2010 and July 2013 for the execution of Nigerian National Public Security Communication System project, Nigerian Railway Modernisation (Iddu-Kaduna) project, Abuja Light Rail project, Nigeria ICT Infrastructure Backbone project, and four Airport Terminal Expansion projects (Abuja, Kano, Lagos, Port Harcourt).\n\nWith the exception of the Nigerian Communication Satellite loan which has been fully repaid, the other instruments with 100% disbursement have had both the capitals and interests accruable there from repaid to varying degrees.\n\nThe lifespan of the Satellite loan secured in 2006 terminated June 29, 2018 with the full payment.\n\nAlso, the DMO data shows that Nigeria has repaid to China both the principal amount of $565.23 million as well as the interest of $477.98 million accruable to the loan. This leaves a balance of $3.58 billion being owed to China as at 2019.\n\nBlueprint\u2019s findings further show that eight (8) of the 15 major loans debts were obtained between 2016 and 2019, specifically to raise needed resources for the execution of capital intensive infrastructure basic to the industrial development of Nigeria.\n\nWhy Chinese loans?\n\nProviding some insights into reasons Nigeria was at home with Chinese loans at a media parley last year, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Zainab Ahmed said this was because the World Bank and the African Development Bank (AfDB) had failed to show much interest in Nigeria, especially prior to and during the recession in 2016.\n\nAlso speaking in same direction, Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan said this had become necessary in the face of the dire need for infrastructural facilities and grossly inadequate funds available, occasioned by the oil glut between 2014 and 2016 and the dwindling prices of crude oil\u2013 Nigeria\u2019s main source of funding.\n\nHe said this was the only way to generate the required funds for major economic driving projects.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur options are really very limited as a country. First, we don\u2019t have the necessary revenues. Nigeria is poor, we shouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves. Nigeria is not rich, given the circumstances we live in, given the challenges we have; our resources are so low, our revenues are so low and therefore, the option of not doing anything because we have no money, we shouldn\u2019t go for infrastructure development, is not even an option worthy of consideration. You cannot keep the economy stagnant.\n\n\u201cTwo, you cannot, in my view and judgement, tax Nigerians further for you to raise the money for infrastructure development. Other countries do that, but we have a serious situation across the country, so you cannot put taxes on people.\n\n\u201cThe other option is a public-private partnership. You need to create the environment to attract investors to come into our country because of the security challenges we face today. Not many investors would like to come to Nigeria. In fact, even those inside Nigeria may not like to invest properly in this sector of infrastructure development.\n\n\u201cSo, the only option left is for us to borrow, borrow responsibly, utilise prudently and economically, and ensure that the projects are self-sustaining so that they can pay back the loans that the Nigerian economy will benefit from the implementation of such infrastructure development.\u201d\n\nCheap interest rate\n\nA tax expert and founder of the Sana\u2019a da Ilmi Foundation, Amina Ado, said Nigeria has opted for these loans because of the cheap interest rate of the China Exim Bank loans compared to commercial loans from the international capital market.\n\nIllustrating the benefits of loans from China, she said: \u201cThe current yield on Nigeria\u2019s 2038 Eurobond is 8.5%. So, if Nigeria wants to issue a twenty-year Eurobond today, it will likely have to pay around 8.5% in annual interest. Assuming Nigeria borrows $1 billion for twenty years at 8.5%, with a bullet payment at the end of year 20, it will pay a total interest of $1.7 billion.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, if the loan is from China for the same twenty-year tenure, Nigeria will pay interest of 2.5%, for a total of $397 million. That is a huge saving of $1.303 billion compared to a loan from the international capital market. Given these two options, Nigeria should have no difficulty choosing the Chinese option,\u201d the expert further said in an article.\n\nEconomists believe loans from China to invest in key strategic public projects such as transportation- railways, ICT sectors which have six projects, each financed by loans from the Chinese bank, as well as energy, agriculture and water sectors, respectively, which equally have three and two projects tied to Chinese loans, could well be just the catalyst Nigeria needed to address the lingering chronic infrastructure deficit.\n\nThey also believe ultimately, when these projects are executed, it would guarantee the return of the economy to an appreciable annual real GDP growth rate over and above the current dismal rate of less than 2%.\n\nThe minimum growth rate Nigeria needed to keep per capita income rising and lift millions of Nigerians out of excruciating poverty, is at least 5%, according to a banker and tax expert, Umana Imowo.\n\nProjects loans invested on:\n\n1. Nigerian-Communications-Satellite\n\n2. Nigerian National Public Security Communication system Project\n\n3. Nigerian Railway Modernisation Project (Idu- Kaduna section)\n\n4. Abuja Light Rail Project\n\n5. Nigerian ICT Infrastructure Backbone Project\n\n6. Nigerian Four Airport Terminal Expansion Project (Abuja, Kano, Lagos & Port Harcourt)\n\n7. Nigerian Zungeru Hydroelectric Power Project\n\n8. Nigerian 40 Parboiled Rice Processing Plants Project (Fed. Min. of Agric & Rural Dev.)\n\n9. Nigerian Railway Modernisation Project (Lagos-Ibadan section)\n\n10. Nigeria Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Abuja-Keffi-Markurdi Road Project\n\n11. Nigeria Supply of Rolling Stocks and Depot Equipment for Abuja Light Rail Project\n\n12. Nigeria Greater Abuja Water Supply Project\n\n13. Nigerian Four Airport Terminal Expansion Project Ancillary Project\n\n14. Nigerian Four Airport Terminal Expansion Project Incremental Project\n\n15. Nigerian ICT Infrastructure Backbone Phase II Project.\n\nOf these, perhaps the Nigerian Railway Modernisation project (Idu-Kaduna section), Abuja Light Rail project, Nigerian Railway Modernisation project (Lagos-Ibadan section), Nigerian Four Airport Terminals Expansion project (Abuja, Kano, Lagos and Port Harcourt), and the rehabilitation and upgrading of Abuja-Keffi-Makurdi road project, have recorded visible performances.\n\nThreat to national asset\n\nOn the threat that China could take over national assets should Nigeria default in payments, the DMO DG, Ms Oniha said there are loan agreements which both the lender and the borrower are required to strictly adhere to.\n\nShe said: \u201cthe Loan Agreements provide that where there is a dispute between the parties, the first action is that the parties should resolve it within themselves and if that fails, they go to arbitration. In other words, a lender, in this case, China would not just possess an asset at the first sign of a dispute including defaults.\u201d",

A Russian negotiator, nationalist lawmaker Leonid Slutsky, confirmed the initiative and said it would be implemented soon.\n\nThe two sides met after the fall of the first major Ukrainian city to Russian forces, with Putin apparently unwilling to heed a global clamour for hostilities to end as the war entered its second week.\n\nPutin again said Russia was rooting out \u201cneo-Nazis\u201d, adding during the televised opening of a national security council meeting that he \u201cwill never give up on (his) conviction that Russians and Ukrainians are one people\u201d.\n\nHe earlier told French President Emmanuel Macron that Moscow \u201cintends to continue the uncompromising fight against militants of nationalist armed groups\u201d, according to a Kremlin account of their call.\n\nZelensky has called on the West to up its military assistance, after NATO members ruled out enforcing a no-fly zone for fear of igniting a direct war with nuclear-armed Russia.\n\n\u201cIf you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes!\u201d Zelensky told a news conference.\n\n\u201cIf we are no more then, God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next,\u201d he said, adding that direct talks with Putin were \u201cthe only way to stop this war\u201d.\n\nThe EU has offered fighter jets already, and a source in Berlin said the German government was planning to deliver another 2,700 anti-aircraft missiles to Ukraine.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc agreed further to approve temporary protection for all refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine \u2014 numbered by the United Nations at more than one million.\n\nAt the talks at an undisclosed location on the Belarus-Poland border, both sides shook hands across a table at the outset, the Ukrainian delegates in military attire and the Russians in more formal suits.\n\nA first round of talks on Monday also yielded no breakthrough, and Kyiv says it will not accept any Russian \u201cultimatums\u201d.\n\nThe invasion, now in its eighth day, has turned Russia into a global pariah in the worlds of finance, diplomacy, sports and culture.\n\nThe UN has opened a probe into alleged war crimes, as the Russian military bombards cities in Ukraine with shells and missiles, forcing civilians to cower in basements.\n\nAddressing the Putin regime in a video statement, Zelensky said: \u201cYou will reimburse us for everything you did against our state, against every Ukrainian, in full.\u201d\n\nThirty-three people died Thursday when Russian forces hit residential areas, including schools and a high-rise apartment block, in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, authorities said.\n\n\u2018Just like Leningrad\u2019\n\nZelensky claims thousands of Russian soldiers have been killed since Putin shocked the world by invading Ukraine, purportedly to demilitarise and \u201cde-Nazify\u201d a Western-leaning threat on his borders.\n\nMoscow said Wednesday that it has lost 498 troops, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin praised their sacrifice.\n\nThe Kremlin has been condemned for likening the government of Zelensky, who is Jewish, to that of Germany in World War II.\n\nWhile a long military column appears stalled north of Ukraine\u2019s capital Kyiv, Russian troops seized Kherson, a Black Sea city of 290,000 people, after a three-day siege that left it short of food and medicine.\n\nRussian armoured columns from Crimea \u2014 annexed by Moscow in 2014 \u2014 pushed deep into the region around Kherson, triggering fighting that left at least 13 civilians dead.\n\nNine Ukrainian soldiers were also killed, the Kherson regional administration said.\n\nRussian troops are also besieging the port city of Mariupol east of Kherson, which is without water or electricity in the depths of winter.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to create a blockade here, just like in Leningrad,\u201d Mariupol mayor Vadym Boichenko said, referring to the brutal Nazi siege of Russia\u2019s second city, now re-named Saint Petersburg.\n\nUkrainian authorities said residential and other areas in the eastern city of Kharkiv had been \u201cpounded all night\u201d by indiscriminate shelling, which UN prosecutors are investigating as a possible war crime.\n\nOleg Rubak\u2019s wife Katia, 29, was crushed in the rubble of their family home in Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv, by a Russian missile strike.\n\n\u201cOne minute I saw her going into the bedroom. A minute later there was nothing,\u201d Rubak, 32, told AFP amid the ruins in the bitter winter chill.\n\n\u201cI hope she\u2019s in heaven and all is perfect for her,\u201d he said, adding through tears, \u201cI want the whole world to hear my story.\u201d\n\nJunk status\n\nUN emergency relief coordinator Martin Griffiths urged Russia to allow relief workers to help Ukraine\u2019s people.\n\n\u201cProtect civilians, for God\u2019s sake, in Ukraine; let us do our job\u201d, he told AFP in Geneva.\n\nThe UN\u2019s International Atomic Energy Agency urged Russia to \u201ccease all actions\u201d at Ukraine\u2019s nuclear facilities, including the site of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.\n\nPutin now finds himself an international outcast, his country the subject of swingeing sanctions that sent the ruble into further free-fall Thursday.\n\nRussia\u2019s central bank \u2014 whose foreign reserves have been frozen in the West \u2014 imposed a 30-percent tax on all sales of hard currency, following a run on lenders by ordinary Russians.\n\nThe unfolding financial costs were underlined as ratings agencies Fitch and Moody\u2019s slashed Russia\u2019s sovereign debt to \u201cjunk\u201d status.\n\nTurmoil deepened on markets more broadly. European stocks slid and oil prices approached $120 per barrel.\n\nRussia\u2019s sporting isolation worsened as it lost the right to host Formula One races. The International Paralympic Committee, in a U-turn, banned Russians and Belarusians from the Beijing Winter Games.\n\nLeaving everything behind\n\nMany Ukrainians have now fled into nearby countries, according to the UN refugee agency\u2019s rapidly rising tally.\n\n\u201cWe left everything there as they came and ruined our lives,\u201d refugee Svitlana Mostepanenko told AFP in Prague.\n\nNathalia Lypka, a professor of German from the eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, arrived in Berlin with her 21-year-old daughter.\n\n\u201cMy husband and son stayed\u2026 My husband already served in the army, and he had to return to duty,\u201d she said, before boarding a train for Stuttgart where friends were waiting.\n\nRussian authorities have imposed a media blackout on what the Kremlin euphemistically calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d that Western analysts say has become bogged down.\n\nTwo liberal media groups \u2014 Ekho Moskvy radio and TV network Dozhd \u2014 said they were halting operations, in another death-knell for independent reporting in Putin\u2019s Russia.\n\nBut Russians have still turned out for large anti-war protests across the country, braving mass arrests in a direct challenge to the president\u2019s 20-year rule.\n\nNearly 7,000 Russian scientists, mathematicians and academics had as of Thursday signed an open letter \u201cstrongly\u201d protesting Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine.\n\nRussian oil giant Lukoil on Thursday called for an immediate halt to fighting in Ukraine, one of the first major domestic firms to speak out against the invasion.\n\nAFP",
