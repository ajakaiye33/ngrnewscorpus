There are so many executives in Nigeria that can go to the continent and teach all of us.\n\n\u201cYou have African countries that never expected to have oil; Namibia, Mozambique, Senegal, South Sudan, and these guys are starting from zeros,\u201d Lima said.\n\nLima appreciated Nigeria for guiding Equatorial Guinea through when the country first started its oil and gas exploration.\n\nThe Equatorial Guinea\u2019s Mines and Hydrocarbon minister, however, noted that his country was ready to continue to partner Nigeria to become one of the world\u2019s highest exporter of oil and gas.\n\nLima said that with Equatorial Guinea having built one of the world\u2019s fastest LNG plants in the world, a collaborative effort between both countries would boost production and increase revenue for both countries and the continent.\n\n\u201cA long time before we began producing, we came here and Nigeria advised us. for example one of the things that we learnt from day one is gas utilisation.\n\n\u201cWe do have the big methanol plant in Africa, three per cent of the world methanol comes from here.\n\n\u201cWe built the fastest LNG plant in the world and that is why the project with Nigeria is not to buy the gas, it is just to bring the gas, we process the gas on your behalf and we sell it together.\n\n\u201cThat is why so many Nigeria producers are so excited about it because it is not just buying at fixed price.\n\n\u201cOnce you process it, you sell it to the market price, and then if the price is high we all benefit and if the price is low we have a reasonable benefit.\n\n\u201cBut the key thing is we actually have more benefits with the relations with Nigeria than Nigeria with us.

Uwak before nor has he spoken to his wife since her contract expired in 2019, stating that marriage is for mature minds who have the capacity to handle their internal issues, especially within the first three years of marriage which he said is always challenging and not bringing it on social media.\n\nBut reacting In a statement, he said: \u201cThey are truthful claims of a man who is desperate to save his life and marriage. My attention has been brought to a letter dated the 17th of July 2022, in which Benjamin Kalu through his lawyers demanded, amongst other things, that I retract alleged defamatory remarks which accused him of having an amorous relationship with my wife, Mrs Keiza Robinson Uwak. That he is taking steps to destroy my marriage and using security agents to harass me.

Using the instrumentality of privilege and proximity to power, he has used the instrumentality of influence to frustrate and bully me out of marital bliss.\u201d\n\nUwak said that he finds the timing of Kalu\u2019s letter as suspicious, \u201cas his correspondence comes at a time when the House Committee on Ethics and Privileges is about to open an investigation into the propriety of his relationship with my wife, Mrs Keiza RobinsoMrsak, especially as he released the House Press Crew and House briefing room to her.\n\n\u201cHis actions are tantamount to an abuse of office, a misuse of his position as Chairman of House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, and a desecration of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201dHis attempt to institute an action at this time is a strategy to create a defense before the Committee that the matter is sub-judice and therefore out of the jurisdiction of the House Committee (mentioned above or any other committee of the National Assembly).\n\n\u201cIt is important to state here that such perverse logic does not take into account that the House Committee is looking into his misconduct rather than the statements which he has attributed to me.

Nigerians may wish to know why he has suddenly turned around to constitute himself into impediment to an amicable resolution of the ongoing crisis.\n\n\u201cThe union said it remains focused on its goal of making the Nigerian University system internationally competitive and getting its products to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with their peers in any part of the world.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the teeming Nigerians for identifying with our vision in this respect and we specifically acknowledge the support and sacrifices of our students (including our members who are running their postgraduate programmes).\n\n\u201cWe are as bothered as you are because we share a common interest in the Nigeria project, however, ASUU shall continue to be guided by the sacred canons of integrity, objectivity, and responsibility to which both academics and media practitioners subscribe.\n\n\u201cIt is our fervent hope and desire that the current groundswell of interests would culminate in a convergence of solutions to this avoidable crisis in the overall interest of Nigeria Together, we shall win. The struggle continues,\u201d he said.\n\nHe maintained that if Ngige meant well as a \u201cconciliator, he won\u2019t be putting roadblocks on the path to completing a process that has dragged for more than five years.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Labour and Employment, as the chief labour ministry of the country, is principally expected to apprehend disputes between employers and employees with a view to settling such disputes.\n\n\u201cThe ministry shall normally await reports of disputes by either side to the disputes for settlement. When the Minister apprehends a dispute, he/she must communicate to the parties or their representatives, his or her own proposal for the resolution of the dispute.\n\n\u201cHowever, ASUU has always had serious reservations about the claim of \u201cconciliation\u201d by someone who has taken sides in the dispute, or by unabashed protagonist in the crisis such as the current Minister of Labour and Employment. It is antithetical to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions (98, 151 & 154) on collective bargaining.\n\n\u201cIt is against the principle of natural justice and the doctrine of equality for Dr. Ngige who carries himself as if he has personal scores to settle with ASUU and shoots down the Union everywhere it matters to assume the role of conciliator,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the issue of funding of public universities, he said it has become the pastime of government officials to talk tough about billions and trillions of naira whenever the thorny issues of education and health sectors\u2019 funding come up for mention.\n\nHowever, he lamented that various sums of money in the same region which could have been deployed for human capacity development and public good usually develop into the thin air at the end of the day!\n\n\u201cWe are therefore, not surprised the leadership of the Ministry of Labour and Employment could condescend to the point of denigrating the import of massive injection of fund into the University Education sub-sector as they tried to miserably dismiss the vexed issue of funding Nigerian public universities and uplifting the country\u2019s intellectual capital.\n\n\u201cASUU believes that the idea of availability of funds is a dynamic process. For instance, government can mobilize funds from different sources including non budgetary outlets like stamp-duty, GSM and alcoholic taxes.\n\n\u201cWe are appalled by the recent calls by top government functionaries at both federal and state levels to establish more universities at a time agencies run by same Chief Executives are tightly squeezed for funding,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting on the acclaimed breakaway faction of ASUU, Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Osodeke said the union was not aware of any recognised official faction.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Fred Ezeh, Adanna Nnamani, Abuja, Bimbola Oyesola and Chinyere Anyanwu\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has given the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, two weeks to resolve the impasse that led to the over five-month strike embarked up by Academic Staff Union of Universities, (ASUU), and three other university-based unions and report back to him.\n\nHe gave the directive after he received briefings from relevant government Ministries, Agencies and Departments involved in resolving the face-off with the university unions, yesterday.\n\nASUU had embarked on one-month warning strike on February 14, and was joined by the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), the Non-Academic Staff Union of Allied and Educational Institutions (NASU) and the National Association of Academic Technologists, (NAAT) following inability of the government to meet their demands.\n\nYesterday\u2019s meeting summoned by President Buhari was to get briefing from government team on why the strike has lingered. Sources at the meeting said President Buhari directed that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige must be in all the meetings to resolve the crisis.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation, (SGF), Boss Mustapha, sources say, was also mandated to be part of the team to interface with the striking unions.\n\nThose at the meeting were Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. Zainab Ahmed, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Ngige, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, the Head of Service of the Federation, Dr. Folashade Yemi-Esan, the Chairman of National Salaries Income and Wages Commission, Ekpo Nta, the Director-General Budget Office, Ben Akabueze.\n\nHowever, ASUU National President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, has said if government was sincere and seriously desiring an end to the strike, it should not take more than two days.\n\nHe said two weeks was too long since the issues involved have been discussed and agreement reached. \u201cIf we are serious and we really want to resolve this problem, it should not take two days. Two weeks is too long for resolution. They should just come back to us and say, \u2018sign,\u201d he said on a live television programme last night.\n\nEarlier, while addressing a press conference in Abuja, Prof. Osodeke, said the contentious issues would have been resolved and the strike called off long ago if not for the \u201coverzealousness\u201d of Dr. Ngige. He accused the minister of hijacking the negotiation process at the early stage from the Ministry of Education, even when significant progress was being recorded towards resolving the strike.\n\nIt also accused Ngige of taking upon himself the role of unabashed protagonist in the ongoing dispute with Federal Government for some inexplicable reasons, even when he earlier said he was not the employer of university academics and advised the union to march to the Federal Ministry of Education with their grievances.\n\nSSANU threatens to act against disparities in salary\n\nMeanwhile, SSANU has warned that Professor Nimi-Briggs Committee renegotiating the 2009 Agreement that it will not accept any disparity in University staff salary and would take every legal action against such agenda.\n\nNational President of SSANU, Mohammed Ibrahim, stated this in a statement in Abuja on the alleged proposed salary disparity by the Nimi-Briggs Committee for university staff.\n\n\u201cWe have read in the media that there is a proposal for the review of salary for University staff with a differential of teaching staff taking between 108 to 180 percent and unreasonable of 10 percent for non teaching staff. We are shocked to read that the Nimi Briggs Committee has submitted a report to the government while we only met with them twice. To say the least, SSANU is not happy with the pace of work in that committee.\n\n\u201cWhile we only met twice with them, we are aware that they have met with the teaching staff not less than ten times. We are surprised how the so-called percentage was allocated to non teaching staff. We have not had the opportunity of discussing salary review with them because the committee stated that they have not gotten the approval of their principal to discuss that. We are seriously shocked and taken aback by the media report that a certain miserable, unacceptable percentage was recommended to non teaching staff. We therefore advise that that committee should as a matter of urgency, conclude renegotiation with us.\u201d\n\nHe also commended President Buhari for his intervention in the ongoing strike and praised Senator Ngige for what it described as his dexterity in ensuring that all university-based unions are carried along in the renegotiation exercise.\n\nTUC rallies affiliates for NLC\u2019s ASUU protest\n\nRegardless of efforts to resolve the issues, the Trade Union Congress (TUC) has vowed to team up with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) on the two days nationwide protest against the lingering crisis in the educational sector.\n\nSpeaking at the opening ceremony of the 12th Triennial National Delegates Conference 2022 in Abuja, outgoing President of the Congress, Quadri Olaleye said the TUC and all its affiliates were in support of the two -day protest scheduled for next week.\n\nThe conference is holding in spite of a court injunction stopping it by a some aggrieved affiliate unions of the TUC over the decision of the next president\n\n\u201cWe are in solidarity with the NLC on the protest coming soon and all our members will be on ground to ensure the success of the protest,\u201d he said.",

Forty-Four years later, I was again privileged to sign the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in 2021, heralding the long-awaited reform of our petroleum sector.\n\n\u201cThe provisions of PIA 2021, have given the Nigerian petroleum industry a new impetus, with improved fiscal framework, transparent governance, enhanced regulation and the creation of a commercially-driven and independent National Oil Company that will operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulations such as the Treasury Single Account, Public Procurement and Fiscal Responsibility Acts.\n\n\u201cIt will, of course, conduct itself under the best international business practice in transparency, governance and commercial viability.\n\n\u201cCoincidentally, I, on the 1st of July 2022 authorised transfer of assets from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to its successor company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, and steered the implementation leading to the unveiling of Africa\u2019s largest National Oil company today.\n\n\u201cI therefore thank Almighty God for choosing me to consistently play on important role in shaping the destiny our National Oil Company from the good to the great.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that NNPC Ltd is mandated by law to ensure Nigeria\u2019s National Energy Security is guaranteed to support sustainable growth across other sectors of the economy as it delivers energy to the world.\n\nHe added that the NNPC Ltd will focus on becoming a dynamic global energy company of choice \u201cto deliver energy for today for tomorrow, for the day days after tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHe thanked the leadership and members of the National Assembly for demonstrating uncommon courage and patriotism in the passage of PIA that culminated in the creation of NNPCL.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said with the signing of the PIA, which assures international and local oil companies of adequate protection for their investments, the nation\u2019s petroleum industry is no longer rudderless.\n\n\u2018\u2018From the onset of this administration, Mr. President never concealed his desire to create a more conducive environment for growth of the oil and gas sector, and addressing legitimate grievances of communities most impacted by extractive industries.\n\n\u2018\u2018While the country was waiting for the PIA, Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry lost about $50 billion worth of investments. In fact, between 2015 and 2019, KPMG states that \u201conly 4 percent of the $70 billion investment inflows into Africa\u2019s oil and gas industry came to Nigeria even though the country is the continent\u2019s biggest producer and the largest reserves.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are setting all these woes behind us, and a clear path for the survival and growth of our petroleum industry is now before us,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nSylva described the unveiling of NNPC Ltd as a new dawn in the quest for the growth and development of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry, opening new vintages for partnerships.\n\nHe thanked the President for his unparalleled leadership, steadfastness, and unalloyed support towards ensuring that the country\u2019s oil and gas industry is on a sound footing.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari, announced that the company had adopted a strategic initiative to achieve the mandate of energy security for the country by rolling out a comprehensive expansion plan to grow its fuel retail presence from 547 to over 1500 outlets within the next six months.\n\nHe assured stakeholders and the global energy community that the new company was endowed with the \u201cbest human resources one can find anywhere in the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNNPC Limited is positioned to lead Africa\u2019s gradual transition to new energy by deepening natural gas production to create low carbon activities and positively change the story of energy poverty at home and around the world,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the consequences of the development, former Director, Centre for Petroleum, Energy Economics and Law, University of Ibadan, Prof Adeola Adenikinju, said for the country to ensure energy security it must take the issues of energy affordability, storage, investment and diversification of its energy mix seriously.\n\nHe noted that a situation where energy is concentrated through a single source was not economically acceptable, noting\n\nthat the country must begun to take the issue of renewable seriously to have a balanced energy mix.\n\nHe equally noted that a situation where we don\u2019t encourage indigenous production and refining of Petroleum products remains a huge set back.\n\nHe said Nigeria is heavily dependent on imported Petroleum products, a development that causes constant disruption in the downstream value chain through frequent fuel scarcity.\n\nOn energy affordability, he said when energy is not made affordable that puts a threat to our existence as more people will embrace the use of dirty fuel which\n\nincluded the use of charcoal and firewood,thereby destroying the environment.\n\nAdenikinju who is currently the Head of Economics Deptartment, University of Ibadan, said storage is another area to take a critical look at,saying our energy security must not be for today alone but for the future as we must develop ways of storing energy.\n\nFor his part, Founder Extractive360, Juliet Ukanwosu, said it will definitely take more than just a name change to achieve energy security and grow our reserves.\n\n\u2018\u2019We now need to begin activating the provisions of the PIA and fully activate what it prescribes to supports the NNPC on a commercial driven path. It is very critical to achieve a deregulated downstream sector and open up the entire value chain to a level playing field, where no stakeholder have undue advantage over the other. I believe the time is now to lift NNPC fuel import monopoly and allow more players in the field with equal access to forex and then allow market forces to determine pump price. Until govt gets off price control, it will be difficult to achieve supply stability, needless to mention the pressure subsidy is putting on the economy.\n\nWith subsidy gone and the market open to healthy competition, the downstream sector will flourish and Nigerians will have better value from the sector.\n\nOn reserve growth, of course full implementation of the PIA is equally key. We need to explore for oil and the right fiscal regime and operating environment is crucial to attracting investors. But bear in mind also that the era of investment rush in oil exploration might be over as companies globally are cutting down investments in fossil fuels. Companies now take their monies to where they can get the best returns.\u2019\u2019",

The divestment process itself has already started creating problems and those problems that are associated with the divestment process is currently ongoing and it impacts on the economy of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen this divestment happens there will be loss of job opportunities and when people lose their jobs the economy is impacted and revenue that will get to the government even from the operations of these companies will definitely reduce.\n\n\u201cThe investing entities who do not have the resources, the manpower, technical know-how to handle the problems that are associated with entities that they are inheriting will not be able to create new jobs opportunities. Will they be able to remediate the environment, will they be able to even pay all that the government is entitle to? These are questions that will impact on the economy.\n\n\u201cWhatever happens, there is destruction of citizens livelihoods. There is destabilisation of community cohesion through crisis. When pollution occurs citizens become sick, the rate of sickness become higher and in that government is expected to provide health facility that will take care of citizens that are suffering from ill health and somebody that is sick definitely will not pay tax. In all of this, the economy suffers for it.\n\n\u201cThis is why there should be a greater interrogation of the processes and relevant authorities should put their feet down and ensure that the right things are done in the first place.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we are asking for is that before you divest, put down what we have termed environmental remediation bond, based on amount that will be discussed and agreed by relevant ministries, departments and agencies working together with selected civil society, community leaders and both the divesting and investing entities because environmental bond should be provided by both the divesting and investing entities.\n\n\u201cIn the process, we must recorgnise the communities these resources are extracted as stakeholders that will be involved in the design, development and implementation of the divestment process.\n\n\u201cThese are the keys among many things that can protect both the divesting and investing entities, protect Nigeria citizens and protect Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cDivestment is a double jeopardy for Nigeria because these divesting entities are divesting onshore to go deep offshore where it is difficult for us to monitor their activities. Yet, our government is still giving them incentives to develop their facilities and activities deep offshore. That should not happen again because it is double jeopardy for Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe must collaborate to achieve a greater result, already NNPC has stopped Mobil from divesting and the court has stopped Shell from divesting some of its assets.\n\n\u201cNigeria is our only country, we don\u2019t have any other place to call our own, so we cannot sit back and watch people in the name of oil exploration business destroy our people and our environment. It is our collective responsibility to protect, preserve and defend our country.\u201d",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB.

          "title": "Hannah Subayi believes the gap between Anglophone and Francophone African startups is reducing",
          "text": "Hannah Subayi Kamuanga\u2019s passion for investing is evident in the many hats she wears as a foremost investor in the African tech ecosystem.\n\nShe\u2019s currently the country manager for development finance institution Propaco in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a board member of the African Business Angel Network, and a partner at Dazzle Angels, a female-focused angel fund. She\u2019s also an investment committee member in 2 pan-African investment funds: Aruwa Capital and Launch Africa Ventures.\n\nPrior to her taking up these roles, she spent 7 years at South Suez Capital, an African private equity fund, and 2 years at the Switzerland-headquartered financial services company, Credit Suisse.\n\n\u201cI love to find, identify talent, provide capital, and see talent grow to create something out of the business, see it grow over time,\u201d Subayi shared with TechCabal over a call. \u201cInvesting in companies allows me to combine my data crunching technical skills and legal skills, such as poring over legal briefs or policy documents, while redefining the future of Africa one investment at a time.\u201d\n\nTechCabal sat down with Subayi to learn more about her experience and life as an African investor.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: What does investing mean to you?\n\nHannah Subayi: Investing is really about identifying talent, whether it\u2019s a startup, a large business, or a team of promoters trying to set up infrastructure projects. You assess funding needs, structure a deal, invest and monitor the investments. This turns out to have a massive impact in Africa, which I\u2019m very passionate about, and then obviously, you make money while at it.\n\nCurrently, as Propaco\u2019s country officer in DRC, which is a frontier market, I have the opportunity to invest through the entire spectrum of different projects from infrastructure financing, down to early-stage startups. Without any conflict, I also advise Aruwa Capital and Launch Africa Ventures, which is the most active fund on the continent with 90% of our founders being local African founders and 25% of them being female.\n\nAs an investor, I\u2019d like to ensure that founders in markets like DRC and Madagascar are also getting the funding that they need from institutional investors.\n\nPersonally, I have set up a new investment club here in the DRC. In March, we did our first seed investment in a local Congolese company manufacturing and distributing industrial cleaning products such as soaps and toothpaste, which are made from local African products like palm oil.\n\nThis investment is a big deal for us because DRC is a typical African country where about 80\u201390% of our products are actually imported. We don\u2019t have any active industries outside of the mining industry. One of our mission statements as an investment club is that we\u2019re going to support local companies that\u2019ll turn out to become as big as Africa\u2019s leading industrial conglomerate, Dangote, and help industrialise the economy in DRC.\n\nDA: What has the transition from private equity to angel investing and venture capital been like?\n\nHS: As an investor, I\u2019m quite passionate about reinventing myself. Every 3\u20134 years I discover new industries, new financial instruments, and products. I started out investing through private equity in Africa for a few years; this prepared me as I built my own personal wealth to become an angel investor to back the next wave of entrepreneurs.\n\nI started Dazzle Angels angels back in 2019, right after investing for many years through private equity. I think my experience as an angel investor led me to become more passionate about startups and early-stage investments. And with many investment clubs behaving more like VC firms, despite not having the same technical skills, network and funds, it\u2019s natural that many angel investors move over to become VC investors.\n\nDA: What do you look out for in startups you want to invest in?\n\nHS: For me, I really like to focus on the team, focusing on their consistency and ability to deliver, as well as their resilience, because I think it\u2019s really important in Africa to be resilient.\n\nI ask questions such as do I like the business? Do I understand what they do? Do I feel like there is a prospect for growth and profitability? How disruptive are businesses or what type of impact do they have on the ground?\n\nWhat is the execution risk? Personally, when I look at an investment opportunity I think of how I can mitigate all of those risks. Obviously, you have to consider the competitive dynamics of the sector and the regulatory environment. But again, with the right team and the right business model, you can navigate those things pretty easily.\n\nIn addition, the deal structure is important because you need to make sure that you\u2019re providing the right amount of funding.\n\nDA: What red flags do you look out for when investing in startups?\n\nHS: Personally, it\u2019s always down to the people. For me, a red flag is when the entrepreneur is not completely committed or convinced by his business, his venture\u2014if he\u2019s running 4 or 5 other projects.\n\nThe next has to do with the deal terms, which is also a reflection of the team. I think as an investor if you\u2019re not comfortable with the deal terms, and you feel that the entrepreneur is asking for a valuation that\u2019s too high or asking for terms that are too negative for you, then it\u2019s something you might want to walk away from.\n\nFor example, there have been instances when entrepreneurs that don\u2019t have a turnover or make less than $5,000\u201310,000 per month state that their valuation is $5 or $10 million. I often reply by telling them that\u2019s not how it works. These unreasonable expectations are reflected in the terms of the percentage founders offer investors. This also comes up when founders expect investors to make too many business introductions for them. Obviously, as an investor, you\u2019re to make a few introductions but not to become the commercial director.\n\nSo already during the due diligence phase, if you hear that the entrepreneurs are asking for many things like commercial introductions that you can\u2019t deliver, then I think you should walk away, and vice versa.\n\nDA: Can you share an overview of what investing in the different regions of Africa look like?\n\nHS: The difference between regions in Africa is a reflection of the economic and social development history. As you know anglophone Africa tends to be a bit more advanced than Arab-speaking and francophone Africa.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t speak too much about lusophone Africa\u2014Portuguese-speaking countries\u2014even though I\u2019ve made an investment in a startup in Mozambique because I think these are frontier markets with a different language, which are not that connected to the rest of the continent.\n\nNevertheless, we noticed that in all the 3 main regions\u2014anglophone, Arab-speaking, and francophone\u2014we see more and more local institutional funders being active with the right technical skills and willingness to back local champions, which is very optimistic.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing an improvement in the regulatory environment. More startup investment clubs are being supported by local governments. We see universities putting in place structures to assist students who want to create their own startups. We see VC firms being more active at the seed level, series A, and other levels. Generally speaking on the continent, there is still a lack of sufficient pre-seed funding, which typically is taken care of by the government.\n\nThe quality of companies is increasing everywhere. I\u2019m always happy to demonstrate that even in francophone Africa, you\u2019ll find 5 founders and startups who have better metrics in terms of turnover, number of users, and profitability than in Anglophone Africa.\n\nHowever, we cannot deny that the operational environment remains a bit tougher to some extent in francophone Africa. So, obviously, if you\u2019re a founder in one of these francophone markets, compared to someone who might be in South Africa, or Egypt, you\u2019ll struggle a bit more and the pace at which your business grows is not the same.\n\nWe\u2019re also seeing an increase in intra-Africa transactions. So, we see more North African investors who are trying to get into anglophone Africa. We see more anglophone African investors trying to invest in francophone Africa. So it\u2019s very exciting to be alive at this time when investors and startups are operating across different regions.\n\nPart of the reason why this is happening is that there are more investors just like me who have worked and studied across different regions, enabling them to understand the different contexts and navigate them better. We have more African investors who are well-rounded in terms of understanding the different ecosystems and we see an increase in investment into the 3 regions, and hopefully, francophone Africa will continue to catch up.\n\nDA: Anything more, especially about the francophone Africa space?\n\nHS: Historically, francophone Africa, just by virtue of the language, mainly only looked to France for funding and expansion. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the case anymore.\n\nIf you look at startups, like Wave, you can see that most of the funding came from the US and other international investors. If you look at francophone African startups, they are incorporated in Paris but that\u2019s not any different from other startups that are incorporated in Delaware.\n\nIrrespective of where startups are incorporated, I think that there\u2019s some uniformity around standard practices and strategies of startups in the continent, which also explains why we see an uptick in investments for Africa. There\u2019s a similarity in the way entrepreneurs think about their growth and expansion and how they talk to investors, which is literally what you want because you want to make sure that everybody\u2019s playing on an equal field and to make sure that startups are receiving the right level of funding.\n\nDA: What\u2019s it like being a female investor?\n\nHS: I think there are many features in my profile that some people might interpret in a good or negative way, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about positioning. It\u2019s all about being consistent in terms of who you are as an investor, what you\u2019re trying to achieve, and connecting with the right type of opportunities.\n\nAs a female investor in francophone Africa, I haven\u2019t really felt potentially discriminated against because I\u2019ve worked with entrepreneurs who respect me. Typically, if you demonstrate that you have the right technical skills, the right network, and are a nice person, people will work with you.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to managing our careers or raising funds, it might be more challenging for female investors. But it\u2019s a representation of the issues that female professionals face in all industries. So I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s the worst in the investment space.\n\nIt\u2019s about understanding what you can bring to the table and adapting your strategy to suit the person you\u2019re dealing with. Also, at the end of the day, as an investor, you also have to walk away from situations and opportunities that are clearly not capable or willing to work with you.\n\nDA: How do you spend your time? What does a typical day look like?\n\nHS: When I look at all the great African investors like Mariame Diop, Zachariah George, or Tomi Davies who are doing much more than I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s always humbling.\n\nManaging Propaco in DRC takes most of my time, attending investor committees, talking to CEOs of large companies and startups to talk about due diligence processes monitoring, investment, doing site visits, as well as here in DRC. I also occasionally deal with lawyers to be sure the legal documentation is correct or dealing with litigation.\n\nI do all of this and attend social events like seminars and conferences. We don\u2019t talk enough about that because as an investor, it\u2019s quite important to be well connected to your business community, whether it\u2019s other investors or entrepreneurs.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in the market?\n\nHS: When we started Launch Venture Africa last year, we were investing in startups with no revenue but now it\u2019s difficult for us to look at a startup that\u2019s not generating at least $20,000. That\u2019s how competitive the market has become.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing more and more investments between various financial institutions. We\u2019re seeing more synergies between investment clubs, and there are new structures that are put in place that are a mix of investment clubs and VC funds, like Future Africa and Dakar Network Angels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Microsoft\u2019s Redmond campus inspired this Zambia agritech startup",
          "text": "A small idea born in the Microsoft Redmond campus in Seattle, Washington, has grown to become a full-blown digital farm marketplace in Zambia.\n\nBetween September 2017 and August 2021, Chris Chileshe, a Zambian-American, worked as a software engineer at Microsoft in its Redmond campus, where he got exposed to sophisticated urban farming. The Microsoft campus has approximately 50,000 employees, with over 100 buildings. Each building has its own caf\u00e9 and aeroponic and hydroponic gardens growing fresh vegetables used in the campus\u2019s kitchen and salad bars.\n\nChileshe, as an employee, had the privilege of touring these gardens and investigating the technology involved in hydroponic farming. Automated cultivation machines called urban cultivators are used in the farm. The watering, light cycles, and ventilation system are all automated and can be controlled via a screen. The commercial-scale machines are said to be capable of producing 16 trays of microgreens (young seedlings of edible vegetables and herbs planted very close to home or the kitchen) at a time, and can go from seed to harvest in as little as 8 days. Growing produce inside can help reduce pest pressures, so the produce is grown without using any chemical pesticides or herbicides. The microgreens grown are 100% organic, nurtured with 100% organic compost, and grown with organic seeds.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThese tours would eventually inspire Chileshe to start Aiponics, an aquaponic and hydroponic farming startup based in Zambia.\n\n\u201cThe team spent a year researching and learning about the various techniques involved in conditioning and maintaining an aquaponics ecosystem,\u201d Chileshe told TechCabal in an email.\n\nHe also said that since launching the company, Aiponics has successfully proven its own aquaponic prototype by developing a back-garden system that fits in a 40-foot shipping container.\n\nA pivot in time saves the day\n\nBut as impressive as this may sound, there was a problem: the production cost outweighed the reward. There was a need for business change. Should the company shut down operations, continue the line while booking losses, or pivot into something light on cost and heavy on revenue? The company went for the third option and built HRVST, a digital farm marketplace where people can order farm produce directly from the farmer.\n\n\u201cAfter building the container farm prototype and performing a cost analysis, the team decided to temporarily pivot from manufacturing containers due to how capital-intensive it would be,\u201d said Chileshe. \u201cWe focused on building the digital marketplace where the demand could be derived. This would allow Aiponics to establish the marketplace where the container farms would plug in to address supply shortages in certain regions.\u201d\n\nHRVST allows farmers to list their produce and sell directly to end-users and restaurants, making it easier and more affordable for buyers and sellers. The platform has different functionalities tailored to support each end-user\u2019s needs. For instance, on the vendors\u2019 or farmers\u2019 side, the app includes integrated point-of-sale features to facilitate cashless transactions using mobile money and credit card payments, performance analytics, order management, and fleet management. On the side of the drivers who help in making fulfilment of orders, there are assigned orders, route optimisation, and delivery completion validation. Then the customers who are on the app to shop can order fresh food from an array of farmers to be delivered or picked up at designated locations. They can schedule future orders and explore nutritional benefits of foods listed.\n\nChris Chileshe, founder of Aiponic/HRVST\n\nHRVST was launched into the market this month, and according to a statement the company shared with TechCabal on launch, the 1-week old startup already boasts 79 restaurant partners across Lusaka, Zambia\u2019s capital city, and hundreds of early-access users registered and already getting served by over 20 small- and large-scale farmers, who are a half of the Zambian population and, surprisingly, a decent backbone of Zambia\u2019s economy.\n\nAgritech in Zambia is still heavily hardware-focused\n\nThe agricultural sector, though only contributing about 8.2% to Zambia\u2019s GDP, accounts for employing almost half of the country\u2019s population. And the government and various investors continue to throw their weights behind the sector. However, little has been done in using software to solve most of the sector\u2019s problems. Hardware has been the centre of its technology.\n\nFor example, between April 7\u20139, the 7th edition of Zambia\u2019s biggest agriculture technology event, Agritech Expo Zambia, organised by the Zambia National Farmers Union, took place. Due to its affiliation with the apex farmers association in Zambia, the event website said it promotes the interests of over 600,000 farmers across Zambia and pulls in over 15,000 stakeholders including farmers, agriculture small businesses and corporate companies, financial institutions, investors, and government officials.\n\nWhile this event hosted the big names in the Zambian and African agriculture industry, agriculture software companies were scantily represented. Lima Link was one of the only notable product-led startups in the event and thus hinted at how almost non-existent or, better put, unrecognised this part of tech is in Zambia, one of Africa\u2019s biggest agricultural nations.\n\nHRVST will be joining a host of other small upstart building software to make agricultural prosperity easily accessible to farmers across the region. The platform is currently only available in Zambia but plans to extend into 5 new countries\u2014Kenya, Tanzania, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Africa.\n\n\u201cWith many parts of Africa facing a food crisis and the inherent risk of relying on other nations for food security, there has never been a better time to bring innovation and technology into a space that sorely needs it,\u201d Chileshe said. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on creating hyper-local capacity for food security while increasing the quality and diversity of the food available to every person on the continent.\u201d\n\nHRVST makes money by charging a subscription fee and a transaction fee to vendors. \u201cWe feel this model allows us to have a shared success model with our vendors. We are highly incentivised to see them succeed and further incentivise our vendors by lowering the percentage transaction fee as their sales grow,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the new ambition to scale HRVST across the region is overarching, the idea that was born out of Redmond hasn\u2019t died. Chileshe told TechCabal that \u201cbeyond the digital marketplace, Aiponics will soon continue to build a container-based aquaponic farm franchise model where the team would train local marketers and young farmers in aquaponics to create additional local capacity and empower more people to get out of poverty.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "\u201cHR is something you learn by doing. It is experience, not book. Yes, there are certifications, but those certifications are handy after you\u2019ve worked a while and you know where you want to focus.\u201c \u2013 Weyinmi Barber, SVP, People and Culture, Softcom.\n\nA well-known irony in the job market is that some jobs or industries that were sought after some 10 to 15 years ago no longer occupy that position and others have had to simply evolve to stay relevant. While it looks grim for those ones, some jobs that are now highly rated might also start struggling with relevance in a few years.\n\nSome roles like human resources (HR) have survived every evolution the job market has experienced, yet it remains one of the most underrated in companies. It would be great to dive into why this is so straight away, but we will get there soon.\n\nI was at the Softcom head office in Ikeja on a warm July afternoon to speak with Weyinmi Barber, the SVP, People and Culture, a.k.a, head of HR. While we prepped for our conversation, I was determined to get her take on why startups do not pay attention to HR despite its implied importance. And her response was not far from my theory.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t really understand how important it is. What usually happens with startups is they get to a certain level and they start having HR crisis and at that point, they are running around looking for HR professionals.\u201d\n\nIn conversation with Weyinmi Barber. SVP, People and Culture, Softcom at the Softcom Head office, Ikeja, Lagos\n\nFrom the hour-long chat, I deduced how important it is to have an HR team, from easily hiring the right people to having a defined recruitment process and everything in between.\n\nIt is safe to say that Weyinmi Barber is passionate about HR and is on a mission to make it desirable despite people\u2019s misconceptions. Like me, when you get to know about her quirkiness from childhood, you\u2019d understand that she has been giving away the \u2018people\u2019 vibe for a long time.\n\nFinding a path that fits\n\nWeyinmi Barber. SVP, People and Culture, Softcom\n\nWarri-born Weyinmi still reminisces about her childhood in Delta State, Nigeria, when she spent a lot of time outdoors with other children. Recalling her adrenalin rushes as parents called out to their children at the end of day, she recounted how her favourite time was the twilight, just before sunset.\n\nThere\u2019s more to the Weyinmi we see today, and her parents\u2019 influence contributed largely to it.\n\nWeyinmi\u2019s quest for knowledge to satisfy her curiosity drove her towards books and she tried to associate what she read with real life. Consequently, she built her vocabulary and was comfortable with long texts in school. Expectedly, she developed a vibrant and artistic personality, asking many questions and trying her hands at different crafts.\n\nWeyinmi is careful not to attribute her success to only her work.\n\n\u201cI grew up with parents who valued education,\u201d she said.\n\nPaying attention to everything she loved doing, they were ready to support her in whatever field she chose. We smiled about how she went through various phases trying to choose a career based on self-discovery at different points of her life. It was writing at one point and fashion management at another, with management consulting coming up later in university.\n\nAt a time when the information technology (IT) industry was unpopular, Weyinmi chose to study information resources management at Babcock University, graduating with a First Class as her set\u2019s overall best student.\n\nBut after graduation, she did not have the best experience practising as an information management analyst. In hindsight, it would have been different if she was exposed to the suitable side of the tech industry.\n\n\u201cFor the first two years of my career, I was an IT person but I didn\u2019t really like it. I\u2019ve now been told that I didn\u2019t get the right exposure to tech, to the software side of things.\u201d\n\nWorking in IT more than a decade ago did not necessarily mean you were into software engineering or app development, as is often the case today. The roles were mostly administrative and tech support-related, none of which appealed to Weyinmi. After a while, she decided to get a master\u2019s degree, and got a scholarship \u2014 thanks to her excellent record during her first degree \u2014 to study management and business excellence at the University of Warwick, UK.\n\n\u201cI was very fortunate to go to a school with a career centre. You could go there and have conversations with people, get counsel about what kind of career path you should consider based on your personality, temperament, and strengths. One of the career options that came up for me was HR.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi Barber. SVP, People and Culture, Softcom\n\nThis was a revelation for Weyinmi as her discipline was quite different from her dispositions. She made a mental note to seek a job in HR job once she resumed job hunting and her first job back in Nigeria was at Oando Plc, a multinational in the oil and gas sector.\n\nBecause Weyinmi is driven by the need to have an impact, she has learnt to let time take its course, constantly reminded by a Warren Buffet quote that \u201cYou can\u2019t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to be associated with things that are working, successful, and good. That really drives me and my work ethic.\u201d\n\nBut, changing industries wasn\u2019t as easy as opening a new page or skimming over a paragraph.\n\nTwo years might seem like enough time to build expertise in a field, but Weyinmi\u2019s decision to give up information analysis to pursue HR was a challenge, and she felt she was already behind her peers.\n\n\u201cI really threw myself into it because I had that sense of \u2018I need to catch up. I really need to learn as much as I can and as quick as possible so that I can start to see the kind of growth that I want for my career.\u2019 Because of that, I was very intentional about developing myself.\u201d\n\nConsequently, she took risks to ensure consistent development, one of which was turning down a senior role in another department to spend more time where she was to develop expertise.\n\nIn eight years, she had filled HR support, analyst, business partnership, and compensation and benefits specialist roles. But then, she was ready for another adventure, this time in a contrasting industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m currently building my career in HR leadership in the tech startup space,and I really enjoy what I do. I was very fortunate to have intentionally chosen a career path that I believed was a good fit. And the last two years have been HR in the tech startup space.\u201d\n\nA whole new world of HR\n\nWeyinmi Barber having a chat with other Softcom employees (Softcomers)\n\nIn 2020, Weyinmi joined Softcom and developed an organisational framework for the tech company, an achievement she considers one of her highest points to date. She believes the tech space is a great fit for her, and she sees herself spending many years in the industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed the challenge, I enjoy being around tech people, I enjoy the conversations, the energy, and most of all, I really enjoy that sense of connection to purpose. I haven\u2019t seen it in any other industry.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi is quick to add the striking difference between the corporate and startup space. After eight years in the oil and gas sector, you would have thought she\u2019d seen it all, but that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\n\u201cI did HR for many years, but the tech space is different. Many of the things that are considered best practices in HR work in other industries, but they don\u2019t work in the startup space. So you have to do things differently.\u201d\n\nShe mentioned particularly how the \u201cpeople issues\u201d are unique and created a scenario to pass the message.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of traditional industries, maybe banking and consulting, there\u2019s generally a correlation between your competence and years of experience. That doesn\u2019t work in the tech space, especially for engineers, because someone who has really developed themselves in two years might be writing better code than someone who has been doing it for six years,\u201d she explained.\n\nWeyinmi Barber. SVP, People and Culture, Softcom\n\nTo keep up with industry requirements, Weyinmi has kept herself relevant by doing professional courses. But that\u2019s not all.\n\n\u201cOne thing I really had to learn was stakeholder management. What I learnt is how to listen to all the sides of the story.\u201d\n\nShe went on to mention how this has helped her understand human behaviour and make better judgement, especially in arbitration cases.\n\nSatisfaction, for her, comes in various forms, but she thoroughly enjoys seeing her solutions solve real-life problems.\n\n\u201cI like creating initiatives to solve problems. Then you roll out the initiative and you see it work, and then you\u2019re getting feedback from people. It\u2019s very satisfying.\u201d\n\nGetting a grip on HR\n\nThe past decade has seen Weyinmi in learning and development, talent acquisition/recruitment, compensation and benefits, and HR business partnership, among others,all of which have improved her expertise.\n\n\u201cI was very lucky to be in different roles, it wasn\u2019t like I was doing the same thing. What that helped me do was have time to figure out where in HR do I want to focus?\u201d\n\nAnd having to spend an average of two years in some of these departments, Weyinmi is sure where she fits.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I realised that the aspect of HR I really liked was organisational design. That\u2019s where you develop HR strategies and come up with initiatives to try and solve people issues, whether it\u2019s building a career framework, developing a talent management framework and applying it to your organisation.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi Barber chatting with Softcom COO, Adetoyosi Elegbede\n\nFor context, when there\u2019s a particular people problem in an organisation, the HR professional\u2019s job is to develop a framework to address it and that is applicable for future occurrences. Since no two organisations are the same, the professional has to come up with bespoke solutions for the company, to achieve optimal results.\n\nWeyinmi is proud to have made the employees of 15-year-old Softcom happy. The tech company is the parent company of a number of startups including Eyowo, Kwiksell, Useform, and Usepass.\n\n\u201cI was privileged to build Softwork\u2019s first career framework. Now, every Softcomer knows their band level, they know what the next level is, they know what they have to do to go to another level, and they know the time of the year promotion happens. We built a policy around that,\u201d she noted.\n\nWith people changing career paths easily, she\u2019s doing her best to match the uniqueness of the startup space.\n\n\u201cThey come in as one thing, six months later they are doing something else, and you have to figure out a way that they can grow.\u201d\n\nDuring our chat, Weyinmi categorised the things people looking to get into HR should know based on where they are in their careers.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re still in school or a fresh graduate, look for opportunities to do internships in HR departments of companies in different industries. This will help you understand the kind of HR you prefer.\n\n\u201cIf you already have a job, you can have a conversation with your line manager and the people in your HR department and let them know you are interested. If there\u2019s an opportunity for you to move into the HR team, [take it]. If you go and look for a job in another company, you might not get it because, on paper, you do not have the experience.\u201d\n\nShe also revealed what a professional should expect while joining a team.\n\n\u201cUsually, if you\u2019re the first HR professional to join a startup, you\u2019re literally walking into a storm unless you are lucky to have a founder or co-founder who has had exposure to certain environments and they understand that HR is an important need from get-go. It sometimes takes that storm for the leaders to then realise that they need an HR team.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi listed communication, stakeholder management, behavioural science knowledge, and good presentation skills as important soft skills to acquire while considering a role in HR. And depending on the area of specialisation, it is important to develop proficiency in using spreadsheets and be comfortable with numbers, project management, and administration.\n\nOpening up about how it feels to be an HR professional, she said,\n\n\u201cIt can be very lonely and isolatory being an HR professional. People almost see you like the police of the company, forgetting that you\u2019re an employee too with a career to build and goals and aspirations. Having your peers behave differently around you is not fun.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi\u2019s activities on a typical work day depend on what is going on at the company. Responsibilities during recruitment differ from those during employee appraisal.\n\nShe\u2019s a big supporter of the hybrid work style and how it\u2019s great for work-life balance.\n\nFor productivity, \u201cI set alarms/reminders for the most random things. It helps me to be productive. Another thing that helps with productivity is knowing what time of the day you function best so that you can schedule important tasks for that time of the day.\u201d\n\nWeyinmi has bungee jumping and sky diving on her bucket list and sometimes refers to herself as an adrenaline junkie.\n\nSet a reminder for the next episode.",

          "text": "As the lingering scarcity of foreign exchange (FX) shortage is hampering their ability to import raw materials, manufacturers in Nigeria are increasingly shifting towards local substitutes.\n\nThe FX scarcity in Africa\u2019s biggest economy is helping businesses producing local substitutes increase their capacity as the demand for their products by manufacturers continues to rise.\n\nIf the momentum is sustained, it is expected to save the country billions of dollars that would have been spent on the importation of the inputs as the money will be retained in the economy and would help propel growth and development.\n\n\u201cWhen we started producing our chicken and egg powder in 2016, we reached out to a couple of manufacturers in the country who use them as raw material, but they didn\u2019t want to buy from us since they were importing the products,\u201d said Samuel Sewonike, the head of operations at Answer Industries Limited.\n\nHe said patronage from manufacturers had been on the rise owing to FX scarcity in recent years. \u201cWe now have these manufacturers patronising us,\u201d Sewonike added.\n\nUzoamaka Igweike, chief executive officer at Loom Chocolate, said that in 2021, her company produced and sold 22,000 bags of local chocolates, with a target of producing 70,800 bags of chocolate owing to the recent surge in demand.\n\nWith the naira devaluation and importers\u2019 inability to access FX for imports, bakers and confectionaries makers who ordinarily would buy foreign brands of chocolate for baking are now patronising local craft chocolate producers in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are attributing our recent surge in demand to the fact that FX is difficult to come by, thus making things more expensive to import,\u201d Igweike said.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, Africa\u2019s biggest economy, which depends largely on crude oil proceeds, has seen weak foreign inflows, resulting in a liquidity challenge in the country\u2019s FX market.\n\nIn 2020, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) devalued the naira twice from N306/$ to N361/$, and N379/$. Last year, the CBN also officially adopted the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate as its official rate. The situation has led to serious pass-through effects on imported commodities.\n\nThis year, the Russia-Ukraine crisis has worsened the country\u2019s FX challenges. As of Monday, July 12, the naira closed at 425.75 against the dollar at the official market 615/$1 at the parallel market.\n\nFrom agro-processors to brewers and pharmaceuticals, local sourcing of inputs has been on the rise since 2015 in Africa\u2019s most populous country.\n\nIn the food, beverage and tobacco subsector, the utilisation of local raw materials increased to 68.7 percent in the second half of 2021 from 66 percent recorded in the corresponding half of 2020, according to the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cA large number of players in the manufacturing value chain now source most of their inputs locally to curtail higher production costs triggered by the lingering FX challenges,\u201d Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, said.\n\nRead also: Join export business to save your businesses from forex crisis, expert advises importers\n\nBaker Magunda, managing director of Guinness Nigeria plc, in a 2020 interview with BusinessDay said the brewer was investing locally to mitigate import challenges.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to substitute imports with local production. We have moved quickly from 53 percent local sourcing two years ago to about 80 percent of total production,\u201d he said.\n\nGuinness, Nigerian Breweries, and others are now supplying free inputs such as improved seed varieties to farmers and also giving them technical support to boost local production of sorghum currently used as a substitute for imported bailey by the industry.\n\nGodwin Onyekazi, president of the Nigerian Importers Integrity Association, complained about how the high exchange rate has led to further reduction of importation.\n\n\u201cThe continuous slide of the naira against the dollar is killing importation. Already, the level of importation at the ports has slumped drastically. This has been reflected in the very low volume of work for haulage companies and clearing agents at the ports,\u201d he said.\n\nHelen Ajayi, marketing and communication associate at Johnvents Industries Limited, said that Nigerians are more concerned about locally produced products now than in the past.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we notice that the cocoa that is exported to other countries and comes back to us as processed doesn\u2019t have the necessary nutrients that the natural cocoa seeds have, thus making us produce our cocoa and butter.\u201d\n\nUzo warned that local producers should not be too relaxed and advised that they should further improve the quality and be able to compete, saying that once the FX situation improves, importers will go back to importing again which would be a disadvantage to them.",

          "text": "As the lingering scarcity of foreign exchange (FX) shortage is hampering their ability to import raw materials, manufacturers in Nigeria are increasingly shifting towards local substitutes.\n\nThe FX scarcity in Africa\u2019s biggest economy is helping businesses producing local substitutes increase their capacity as the demand for their products by manufacturers continues to rise.\n\nIf the momentum is sustained, it is expected to save the country billions of dollars that would have been spent on the importation of the inputs as the money will be retained in the economy and would help propel growth and development.\n\n\u201cWhen we started producing our chicken and egg powder in 2016, we reached out to a couple of manufacturers in the country who use them as raw material, but they didn\u2019t want to buy from us since they were importing the products,\u201d said Samuel Sewonike, the head of operations at Answer Industries Limited.\n\nHe said patronage from manufacturers had been on the rise owing to FX scarcity in recent years. \u201cWe now have these manufacturers patronising us,\u201d Sewonike added.\n\nUzoamaka Igweike, chief executive officer at Loom Chocolate, said that in 2021, her company produced and sold 22,000 bags of local chocolates, with a target of producing 70,800 bags of chocolate owing to the recent surge in demand.\n\nWith the naira devaluation and importers\u2019 inability to access FX for imports, bakers and confectionaries makers who ordinarily would buy foreign brands of chocolate for baking are now patronising local craft chocolate producers in the country.\n\n\u201cWe are attributing our recent surge in demand to the fact that FX is difficult to come by, thus making things more expensive to import,\u201d Igweike said.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, Africa\u2019s biggest economy, which depends largely on crude oil proceeds, has seen weak foreign inflows, resulting in a liquidity challenge in the country\u2019s FX market.\n\nIn 2020, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) devalued the naira twice from N306/$ to N361/$, and N379/$. Last year, the CBN also officially adopted the Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate as its official rate. The situation has led to serious pass-through effects on imported commodities.\n\nThis year, the Russia-Ukraine crisis has worsened the country\u2019s FX challenges. As of Monday, July 12, the naira closed at 425.75 against the dollar at the official market 615/$1 at the parallel market.\n\nFrom agro-processors to brewers and pharmaceuticals, local sourcing of inputs has been on the rise since 2015 in Africa\u2019s most populous country.\n\nIn the food, beverage and tobacco subsector, the utilisation of local raw materials increased to 68.7 percent in the second half of 2021 from 66 percent recorded in the corresponding half of 2020, according to the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cA large number of players in the manufacturing value chain now source most of their inputs locally to curtail higher production costs triggered by the lingering FX challenges,\u201d Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, said.\n\nRead also: Join export business to save your businesses from forex crisis, expert advises importers\n\nBaker Magunda, managing director of Guinness Nigeria plc, in a 2020 interview with BusinessDay said the brewer was investing locally to mitigate import challenges.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to substitute imports with local production. We have moved quickly from 53 percent local sourcing two years ago to about 80 percent of total production,\u201d he said.\n\nGuinness, Nigerian Breweries, and others are now supplying free inputs such as improved seed varieties to farmers and also giving them technical support to boost local production of sorghum currently used as a substitute for imported bailey by the industry.\n\nGodwin Onyekazi, president of the Nigerian Importers Integrity Association, complained about how the high exchange rate has led to further reduction of importation.\n\n\u201cThe continuous slide of the naira against the dollar is killing importation. Already, the level of importation at the ports has slumped drastically. This has been reflected in the very low volume of work for haulage companies and clearing agents at the ports,\u201d he said.\n\nHelen Ajayi, marketing and communication associate at Johnvents Industries Limited, said that Nigerians are more concerned about locally produced products now than in the past.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we notice that the cocoa that is exported to other countries and comes back to us as processed doesn\u2019t have the necessary nutrients that the natural cocoa seeds have, thus making us produce our cocoa and butter.\u201d\n\nUzo warned that local producers should not be too relaxed and advised that they should further improve the quality and be able to compete, saying that once the FX situation improves, importers will go back to importing again which would be a disadvantage to them.",

If we continue to rely simply on budgetary allocation, it is never going to happen. So we have to think outside the box,\u2019\u2019 Adamu said.\n\nMr Benson Ajisegiri, a water resources consultant, said the passage of the bill was an opportunity for rapid acceleration to pool funds towards meeting the sustainable development goals.\n\nAjisegiri noted that the media had a huge role to disseminate accurate information to the citizens, adding that this would curb the misinformation going around.\n\nMrs Tanwa Koya, a water resources expert, said legal framework of the national water resources bill was not different from the country\u2019s constitutional provisions.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has unveiled the new Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Limited), affirming that the company is mandated by law to ensure that Nigeria\u2019s National Energy Security is guaranteed.\n\nSpeaking at the historic occasion at State House Conference Centre, the President said Africa\u2019s largest National Oil Company (NOC) would also support sustainable growth across other sectors of the economy as it delivers energy to the world.\n\nAt the event, which featured a Special rendition of the Theme Song \u201dEnergy for today, Energy for tomorrow, Energy for Everyone\u2019\u2018 by an Ensemble, the president recounted how God had used him to consistently play an important role in shaping the destiny of the country\u2019s NOC in the last 45 years.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the NNPC Limited would sustainably deliver value to its over 200 million shareholders and the global energy community; operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulations such as the Treasury Single Account (TSA).\n\n\u2018\u2018This is a landmark event for the Nigerian oil industry.\n\n\u2018\u2018Our country places high premium in creating the right atmosphere that supports investment and growth to boost our economy and continue to play an important role in sustaining global energy requirements.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are transforming our petroleum industry, to strengthen its capacity and market relevance for the present and future global energy priorities.\n\n\u2018\u2018By chance of history, I was privileged to lead the creation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on July 1, 1977. Forty-Four (44) years later, I was again privileged to sign the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in 2021, heralding the long-awaited reform of our petroleum sector,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the provisions of PIA 2021, have given the Nigerian petroleum industry a new impetus, with improved fiscal framework, transparent governance, enhanced regulation and the creation of a commercially-driven and independent National Oil Company.\n\nHe said this would enable the company to operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulations such as the Treasury Single Account, Public Procurement and Fiscal Responsibility Acts.\n\n\u2018\u2018It will, of course, conduct itself under the best international business practice in transparency, governance and commercial viability.\n\n\u2018\u2018Coincidentally, I, on the 1st of July 2022 authorized transfer of assets from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to its successor company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, and steered the implementation leading to the unveiling of Africa\u2019s largest National Oil Company today.\n\n\u2018\u2018I therefore thank Almighty God for choosing me to consistently play an important role in shaping the destiny of our National Oil Company from the good to the great,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nThe president, therefore, assured stakeholders in the industry that Africa\u2019s largest NOC would adhere to its fundamental corporate values of Integrity, Excellence and Sustainability, while operating as a commercial, independent and viable NOC at par with its peers around the world.\n\nHe further stated that the company would focus on becoming a dynamic global energy company of choice to deliver energy for today, for tomorrow, for the day days after tomorrow.\n\nHe thanked the leadership and members of the National Assembly for demonstrating uncommon courage and patriotism in the passage of PIA that culminated in the creation of NNPCL.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said with the signing of the PIA, which assured international and local oil companies of adequate protection for their investments, \u201dthe nation\u2019s petroleum industry is no longer rudderless\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018From the onset of this administration, Mr. President never concealed his desire to create a more conducive environment for growth of the oil and gas sector, and addressing legitimate grievances of communities most impacted by extractive industries.\n\n\u2018\u2018While the country was waiting for the PIA, Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry lost about $50 billion worth of investments.\n\n\u201dIn fact, between 2015 and 2019, KPMG states that \u201conly 4 percent of the $70 billion investment inflows into Africa\u2019s oil and gas industry came to Nigeria even though the country is the continent\u2019s biggest producer and the largest reserves.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are setting all these woes behind us, and a clear path for the survival and growth of our petroleum industry is now before us.\u201d\n\nSylva described the unveiling of NNPC Limited as a new dawn in the quest for the growth and development of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry, opening new vintages for partnerships.\n\nHe thanked the president for his \u201dunparalleled leadership, steadfastness, and unalloyed support towards ensuring that the country\u2019s oil and gas industry is on a sound footing\u201d.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari, announced that the company had adopted a strategic initiative to achieve the mandate of energy security for the country by rolling out a comprehensive expansion plan to grow its fuel retail presence from 547 to over 1500 outlets within the next six months.\n\nHe assured stakeholders and the global energy community that the new company was endowed with the \u2018\u2018best human resources one can find anywhere in the industry.\n\n\u2018\u2018NNPC Limited is positioned to lead Africa\u2019s gradual transition to new energy by deepening natural gas production to create low carbon activities and positively change the story of energy poverty at home and around the world.\u201d (NAN)\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

Abba Ali, the Chairman, Governing Board of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), said the technology was a welcome development due to the importance of agriculture.\n\nIn his contribution, Mr Matthia Schmale, UN Resident Coordinator, Nigeria, expressed gratitude to the AUDA/NEPAD coordinator and the ministry of agriculture for embracing the first phase of the technology in 2019.\n\nAccording to him, the technology is not new in Nigeria, the first Juncao site was established in Abador in Bauchi State with the objectives of combating desertification and addressing the effects of climate change.\n\n\u201cIn order to address the negative effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the AUDA/NEPAD, in collaboration with continental body, initiated the innovative projects on strengthening the smallholder farmers\u2019 capabilities.\n\n\u201d This is to ameliorate the effects of COVID-19 in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe were excited to receive the letter of interest from the coordinator of AUDA/NEPAD of Nigeria early this year to be part of the second phase of this project, we are therefore excited to help Nigeria as the pilot country during this second phase, \u201d he said.\n\nIn his comments, the People\u2019s Republic of China Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Cui Jianchun, expressed his country\u2019s readiness to partner with Nigeria to develop research on economic affairs with the aim of up scaling agricultural production technologically.\n\n\u201cWe are working on developing research on economic affairs.\n\n\u201cSo I do believe that Nigerian team is leading the international community to develop for the people economically, socially.\n\n\u201cAnd today is a very good example for your students in technology and I know that Nigeria has set a very different example in the whole Africa, \u201d Jianchun said.

          "title": "Turbaned bandit kingpin wanted for murdering 52 in Katsina, but...",
          "text": "Katsina State governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has said the state police command is still hunting Adamu Aliero, a notorious terrorist kingpin, who was recently turbaned the Sarkin Fulanin Yandoto by the now suspended Emir of Birnin Yandoto, in Tsafe Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Aliyu Garba Marafa.\n\nThe Katsina governor noted, however, that the police cannot go from Katsina to Zamfara to arrest the bandit leader.\n\nMasari, who spoke in an interview with BBC Hausa Service, expressed sadness over the development, saying his government has yet to forgive Aliero for killing his people, stressing that the state and police are still looking for the terror leader, who has been on police wanted list for the past two years.\n\nThe Katsina State Police Command had in June, 2020 declared Aliero wanted for masterminding the attack on Kadisau village of Faskari Local Government Area of the state, an incident that led to the killing of over 52 people.\n\nThe police further placed a bounty of N5,000,000 on his head to anyone with useful information that could lead to his arrest \u2013 either dead or alive.\n\nCuriously, however, the most sought after terrorists\u2019 kingpin was recently given a chieftaincy title of Sarkin Fulanin Yandoto by Emir Marafa, which led to his immediate suspension by Governor Matawalle.\n\nBut Masari, during the interview, explained that the Katsina State government had not forgiven the notorious terrorist and that the government would work with security agencies to arrest the hoodlum.\n\nHe insisted that even if Aliero, has accepted to live peacefully with the farming communities in Zamfara, his government still considered him a terrorist and would do everything humanly possible to arrest him and make him face the law for the crimes he had committed.\n\nThe governor wondered why a criminal, who has been on wanted list of security operatives for years would be conferred with a chieftaincy title after killing innocent citizens in communities across Zamfara and Katsina States.\n\nHe reiterated that some terrorists recruited by Aliero were still killing, kidnapping and raping residents of Katsina State in villages and communities that bordered Zamfara .\n\n\u201cIt is surprising because Katsina and Zamfara are the same. If a neighbour doesn\u2019t support his neighbour, do you think he would be supported in his time of travail? So, it surprised me how they looked away from the travail of their neighbor (Katsina).\n\n\u201cIt affected them too because a traitor, when he is done with your enemy, would turn towards you. We\u2019ve not forgiven him and just as the police in Katsina said, they are still looking for him. For me, the one I have business with is the governor (Matawalle).\n\n\u201cI tried reaching out to him but he is not around and I did not get him. The police command here (Katsina) has the responsibility to reach out to the police in Zamfara to know what\u2019s actually going on.\n\n\u201cThe only issue is that the police in Katsina can\u2019t go to Zamfara and arrest him. So, if he dares enter Katsina again, we will arrest him so that he can answer for his crimes. Even if they said he has stopped, we know that here in Katsina, he is still killing people; his boys are still killing people,\u201d the governor maintained.\n\nMeanwhile, terrorists on Tuesday, launched fresh onslaught on Ruwan-Godiya community in Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina State and killed nine farmers, who were working on their farmlands.\n\nThe motorcycle-riding terrorists, who stormed the community in broad daylight, also injured no fewer than seven other farmers including their children.",

          "title": "Awomamma massacre: DSS claims murdered Imo youths are ESN members",
          "text": "By Ori Martins, Owerri\n\nDrama has been added to the controversy surrounding the depth of about 14 youths of Otulu in Awomamma community of Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State allegedly killed by the Ebubeagu Security Network.\n\nThe Department of State Services (DSS) in Imo State has claimed that the 14 killed youths allegedly killed were members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the security arm of IPOB.\n\nReleasing an unsigned statement to newsmen at its headquarters in Owerri, the DSS said, \u201cIt was a sting operation with the help of an ESN gang member, Chinonso Mmerem, earlier arrested by the operatives\u201d\n\nThe release noted that the gang was gathered to plan for the enforcement of the illegal sit-at-home the following day, Monday 18 July, and subsequently opened fire on the sting operatives of the DSS and was consequently repelled with a superior firepower of the operatives, leading to the death of about seven of them\u201d .\n\nThe DSS, director, Imo State Command conducted journalists to the alleged ESN member in DSS custody, Mmerem Chinonso who allegedly led the DSS to the alleged hideout of his members where the said gang members were shot to death.\n\nAnswering questions from journalists, Mmerem who revealed he comes from Amiri Ubahu Azu in Imo State confessed he is a member of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its militia wing, the Eastern Security Network (ESN) for about a year. He also noted that he was arrested by the DSS in his hometown about a week before the incident where he led DSS operatives to the hideout of his gang members.\n\nSpeaking about his involvement in the Sunday\u2019s incident where about 14 youths of Otulu were murdered in cold blood by alleged operatives of Ebubeagu, he claimed that he led DSS officers to their new camp at Awomamma where they killed some ESN members just as others escaped with bullet wounds.\n\n\u201cYes I was there. We were in convoy. It was along the road at the place they are camping. We saw them; TUYC, Njaba and those guys. They were gathered there. Their motorcycles were parked by the side. They were gathered there drinking. We met them there and we started shooting. Many of them died there, some of them ran away\u201d, he enthused.\n\nHe equally reveled how he got the information that the ESN was having a meeting at the place.\n\n\u201cI know that if you want to catch them, it will be on a Sunday when they gather to plan on how to go and do work on Monday lockdown,\u201d he noted.\n\nMmerem revealed the identities of some of their alleged members, including the one at Orsu Ihitteukwa which he described as their federal camp.\n\nHe said he has repented and called on all other youths who are still operating as members of IPOB/ ESN to repent from it, as according to him, \u201cthere is no life there.\u201d\n\nUzodinma dismisses outrage over killing as \u2018propaganda\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, amid the angry reactions to the gruesome killing of the youths, Governor Hope Uzodimma said his administration \u201cwill not be deterred by propaganda and blackmail in his quest to protect the lives and property of Imo citizens.\u201d\n\nThe governor who reacted to the development in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary and Media Adviser, Mr. Oguwike Nwachukwu, after the Imo State Security Council meeting, called with regard to the reported killing, said: \u201cGovernment has been briefed on the incident by the Director of State Services, DSS, in an interim report made available to members of the Security Council.\n\n\u201cThe DSS Director confirmed that his men carried out an operation in a camp at Awo-Omamma with the assistance of their informant and not at a wedding place, as claimed by the youths and it was in the process that some bandits were neutralized.\u201d\n\nUzodimma also said that \u201cwhile the Security Council awaits detailed report on the incident, it is important that the public are wary of those using the incident as propaganda tool to blackmail the security agencies and the government.\u201d\n\nGovernor Uzodimma also used the opportunity to describe as \u201cfallacy\u201d, the claim on the social media and sections of the traditional media, about a 15-year old girl allegedly impregnated in the DSS detention.\n\nHis words: \u201cSecurity report indicated that two ladies were caught with bandits about six months ago and they have been helping the DSS in identifying and arresting other dangerous bandits in the state.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, the so-called 15-year old lady happens to be the girl friend to a key gang leader of the bandits terrorizing the state but on the trail by DSS operatives.\n\n\u201cSecurity report has shown that the fleeing gang leader had reached out to his sponsors, who have resorted to using the 15-year old lady in question, to blackmail the DSS and divert attention.\n\n\u201cWhile thing boils down to propaganda and blackmail targeted at the security agencies, know I will never allow anything ungodly to happen in Imo State. Their target is to puncture the relative peace the security agencies have helped us to achieve in Imo State and we are determined to sustain the peace.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be deterred and no amount of propaganda and blackmail will deter the Security agencies from doing their work.\u201d\n\nThe Governor however, urged newsmen to carry out their own investigation into the cases.\n\nMeanwhile, the ever busy Owerri-Onitsha dual carriage was on Tuesday blocked by angry villagers of Otulu, Awo-Omamma and Mgbidi, to protest the gruesome killing of some youths of the communities, by suspected members of Ebubeagu security outfit.\n\nVehicle owners were forced to look for alternative routes to their respective destinations, while economic activities in the area came to a halt, as a result of the protest.",

In fact, the situation has further deteriorated in some of these states with the enforcement of the draconian rule of \u201cno work, no pay\u201d and victimisation of Union leaders.\n\n\u201cThe FG is yet to come out clear on the Union\u2019s preference for UTAS against the troublesome Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System.\n\n\u201cHaving submitted the Union\u2019s charter of demands to the FG team for the renegotiation, the posture and sincerity of government towards meaningful collective bargaining cannot be ascertained until August 2, 2022, when the renegotiation proper begins.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the decision to embark on strike, the union said, \u201cWhile empathetically acknowledging the appeal of critical stakeholders expecting the strike action to be suspended, the NEC painstakingly submitted that the timing must be properly calculated based on the foregoing reservations in order to consolidate on the gains of the struggle.\n\n\u201cTherefore, NEC unanimously resolved that the strike action should continue for the next three weeks within which the Union hopes that the foregoing reservations should have been addressed.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has unveiled the new Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Limited), affirming that the company is mandated by law to ensure Nigeria\u2019s national energy security is guaranteed.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at the State House Conference Centre Abuja where the historic event was held, the president said Africa\u2019s largest National Oil Company (NOC) would also support sustainable growth across other sectors of the economy as it delivers energy to the world.\n\nAt the event, which featured a special rendition of the Theme Song \u201dEnergy for today, Energy for tomorrow, Energy for Everyone\u201d by an Ensemble, the president recounted how God had used him to consistently play an important role in shaping the destiny of the country\u2019s NOC in the last 45 years.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the NNPC Limited will sustainably deliver value to its over 200 million shareholders and the global energy community; operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulations such as the Treasury Single Account (TSA).\n\n\u2018\u2018This is a landmark event for the Nigerian oil industry. Our country places high premium in creating the right atmosphere that supports investment and growth to boost our economy and continue to play an important role in sustaining global energy requirements.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are transforming our petroleum industry, to strengthen its capacity and market relevance for the present and future global energy priorities.\n\n\u2018\u2018By chance of history, I was privileged to lead the creation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on the 1st July 1977. Forty-Four (44) years later, I was again privileged to sign the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in 2021, heralding the long-awaited reform of our petroleum sector.\n\n\u2018\u2018The provisions of PIA 2021, have given the Nigerian petroleum industry a new impetus, with improved fiscal framework, transparent governance, enhanced regulation and the creation of a commercially-driven and independent National Oil Company that will operate without relying on government funding and free from institutional regulations such as the Treasury Single Account, Public Procurement and Fiscal Responsibility Acts.\n\n\u2018\u2018It will, of course, conduct itself under the best international business practice in transparency, governance and commercial viability.\n\n\u2018\u2018Coincidentally, I, on the 1st of July 2022 authorized transfer of assets from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to its successor company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, and steered the implementation leading to the unveiling of Africa\u2019s largest National Oil Company today.\n\n\u2018\u2018I therefore thank Almighty God for choosing me to consistently play an important role in shaping the destiny of our National Oil Company from the good to the great,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president further assured stakeholders in the industry that Africa\u2019s largest NOC would adhere to its fundamental corporate values of Integrity, Excellence and Sustainability, while operating as a commercial, independent and viable NOC at par with its peers around the world.\n\nHe said the company would focus on becoming a dynamic global energy company of choice to deliver energy for today, for tomorrow, for the day days after tomorrow.\n\nHe thanked the leadership and members of the National Assembly for demonstrating uncommon courage and patriotism in the passage of PIA that culminated in the creation of NNPCL.\n\nOur pre-PIA loss -Sylva\n\nAlso speaking, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, said \u201cwith the signing of the PIA, which assures international and local oil companies of adequate protection for their investments, the nation\u2019s petroleum industry is no longer rudderless.\n\n\u2018\u2018From the onset of this administration, Mr. President never concealed his desire to create a more conducive environment for growth of the oil and gas sector, and addressing legitimate grievances of communities most impacted by extractive industries.\n\n\u2018\u2018While the country was waiting for the PIA, Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry lost about $50 billion worth of investments. In fact, between 2015 and 2019, KPMG states that \u201conly 4 percent of the $70 billion investment inflows into Africa\u2019s oil and gas industry came to Nigeria even though the country is the continent\u2019s biggest producer and the largest reserves.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are setting all these woes behind us, and a clear path for the survival and growth of our petroleum industry is now before us.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe described the unveiling of NNPC Limited as a new dawn in the quest for the growth and development of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry, opening new vintages for partnerships.\n\nHe thanked the president for his unparalleled leadership, steadfastness, and unalloyed support towards ensuring that the country\u2019s oil and gas industry is on a sound footing.\n\nNNPC CEO\n\nSpeaking at the event, Group CEO NNPC Limited Kyari announced that the company had adopted a strategic initiative to achieve the mandate of energy security for the country by rolling out a comprehensive expansion plan to grow its fuel retail presence from 547 to over 1500 outlets within the next six months.\n\nHe assured stakeholders and the global energy community that the new company was endowed with the \u2018\u2018best human resources one can find anywhere in the industry.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018NNPC Limited is positioned to lead Africa\u2019s gradual transition to new energy by deepening natural gas production to create low carbon activities and positively change the story of energy poverty at home and around the world,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nReactions\n\nMeanwhile, experts and the generality of Nigerians have continued to react to the rebranding of the giant oil firm.\n\nWhile some of those who spoke Tuesday to Blueprint are of the view that the new NNPCL would guarantee energy security, others believe nothing would change until the underlying factors hindering effective policy direction in the industry were addressed.\n\nIn his view, an economist, Mr Friday Efih, said the increase in the price of fuel from N165 to N185 would only bring temporary relief.\n\nHe insisted that until the underlying issues were resolved, Nigerians would still continue to suffer fuel scarcity.\n\nHe said: \u201cHow do you solve the issue of lack of local refining capacity, foreign exchange challenges, oil market volatility, and oil theft. All these are not what one can wish away just because NNPC Ltd was unveiled today. The Presidency needs to do more than that.\u201d\n\nAlso, a taxi driver who simply identified himself as Usman, said he bought fuel at N175 per litre, noting that the scarcity would only reduce not disappear.\n\n\u201cThis increase by the NNPC to between N175-N185 per litre is not the problem. Many of my friends who drive tankers say with the high cost of diesel, it would be difficult to be transporting fuel to the various filling stations,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, a development researcher, Mr. Adefolarin Olamilekan, said on the surface, the president\u2019s statement was very encouraging considering some of the initiatives the government put in place to stop energy poverty in Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that the failure of the government to ensure local refinery of crude as opposed to importation of all PMS, kerosine, diesel and other petroleum products would not make the statement a reality.\n\nOlamilekan said \u201cthe poor policy direction of this administration in allowing the four national refineries to still be moribund; as well as the failure of the NNPC to sell crude to modular refineries, do not help the course of the government.\n\n\u201cWith the administration less than 10 months to handing over, ending energy poverty is going to be a herculean task. Nevertheless, we also need to acknowledge the president\u2019s statement is directly in relations to the unveiling of the NNPC Limited as part of the PIA\u2019s objective of making the oil and gas sector transparent, responsible and accountable.\n\n\u201cNNPC must feed local modular refineries with crude for them to refine for local consumption. Lastly, there are issues of corruption, policy reversal and challenge of oil thief and pipeline vandalism. These issues must be dealt with if Nigeria truly wants to end energy poverty.\u201d\n\nAlso weighing in, an economist, Mr. Gideon Ekukinam, said: \u201cThe only way the new Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Limited) can guarantee sufficient fuel at filling stations across Nigeria is when it is given free hand to operate. Government has no business running any business. The petroleum downstream sector is a huge business that should be weaned off government control.\n\n\u201cCrude oil accounts for over 70 percent of government revenue, but that doesn\u2019t mean the government should continue to dictate what happens in the sector. A country where the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) still imports petrol for everyone, is not a serious country. The NNPC doesn\u2019t even have the capacity or the storage facilities to continue with this herculean endeavor. Why then don\u2019t we allow private firms to venture into the business, import petrol and sell as the market dictates?\n\n\u201cPetrol is a product. Economics says if Mr. A, B, C and D all sell the same product, competition will someday make Mr. C sell at a lower price to beat Mr. A. It\u2019s called market forces. Demand and supply are what drive any economy, not government regulation.\n\n\u201cYes, petrol pump prices could spike initially in a deregulated market, but someday, competition could force pump prices of petrol down like every other product in the market.\u201d\n\nBusinessmen, civil servants\n\nAlso in his intervention, an Abuja-based businessman, Mr Abubakar Yusuf said: \u201cChange of name does not equal the availability of products. As long as our refineries are moribund, we will continue to have long queues in our filling stations. Show me any country that exports crude oil and imports the finished product. We have refineries in Warri, Port Harcourt and Kaduna that can\u2019t cater to our domestic needs because corruption has made them comatose.\n\n\u201cIn any case, the refineries are probably so outdated right now that even a turnaround maintenance can\u2019t bring them to life. To get out of this perennial fuel scarcity, Nigeria has to begin to produce and refine the petrol it consumes. It\u2019s not rocket science.\n\n\u201cThe reason we have scarcity now is because NNPC imports petrol. So, the product is sometimes inadequate or remains at sea for God knows how long, or is subject to the whims and caprices of the international market.\n\n\u201cOur refineries have to start working. Nigeria has to refine its petrol and not sell its crude and import the same. Private firms should be handed licenses to run modular and standard refineries alongside government ones.\u201d\n\nAlso responding, a civil servant who stays at Mararaba in Nasarawa state but works in Abuja, Mrs Favour Chinwo said she is now having to spend close to double of the usual amount he spends on transportation, to and from his work place.\n\n\u201cTransportation cost has become increasingly high in the past few days and we are having to spend more than usual. Nothing concerns the Abuja conductor and how much you earn as salary. They are opportunists, always taking advantage of situations. I used to spend N900 to 1,000 before the increase in pump price but now I ensure to budget like double the amount when setting out these days to avoid being embarrassed.\n\n\u201cI cannot put the blame on these drivers but on the government that is driving back and forth on the decision to adjust the pump price of PMS while commuters bear the brunt.\n\n\u201cImagine if you spend N1, 000 daily on transport fares to and fro and now witness an average of 25% increment. You know what that translates into when you check it out for the monthly and annual expenditure of the individual,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother civil servant, Ibrahim, resident in Kubwa of the FCT, said the high expectations Nigerians had of the present administration since inception had failed.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor me, the situation on fuel drama has come to stay and it will keep increasing until we think inside the box and make a U-turn for a positive change and not this kind of change Nigeria has suffered.\u201d\n\nAlso, Gbeminiyi, also a Kubwa resident, said the government had failed Nigerians beyond imagination.\n\nThe businessman said he would get his PVC and cast his votes when the time comes in order to get the right person to change the economy for good.\n\n\u201cMadam, Nigeria as a nation has suffered long. For us to change the political narrative, we must take the bull by the horn or else it will be same story come post-election 2023 and I know that at this point, no Nigerian is interested in such madness, or are you?\n\n\u201cFor this issue, whatever will be will be and we even heard rumour that it will still increase and suffer scarcity. The only good thing I see now is that there is fuel without much queue, which they would have done long ago to avoid the scarcity and tough time we faced as a nation. We have this oil and supply neighboring countries but yet the nation is in lack of what it produces. I don\u2019t want to talk because I have better areas to channel my feelings,\u201d he said.\n\nDispatch rider\n\nAnd to a dispatch rider, Ezekiel Sambo, the recent fuel scarcity affected his business and expressed satisfaction with the new rate if the commodity would be in regular supply.\n\n\u201cThe recent fuel scarcity affected our business negatively. We wasted a lot of time at the filling station looking for fuel. Time is of essence in our business. When customers make an order, they expect you to make delivery almost immediately. However, due to the fuel scarcity, we couldn\u2019t meet the delivery request from our client. We lost a lot of business, some even see us as unserious. So, I don\u2019t mind buying fuel at 185 as long as it would be available.\u201d\n\nTransition to halt arbitrariness Cowry Assets\n\nHowever, some experts from Cowry Assets Management said the transition of the NNPC to NNPCL would bring to an end the arbitrariness and control of the company by the government and lead the company to the path of profitability in future.\n\nThey also said the heavy-handed government control in the company would become a thing of the past as the company ultimately becomes and operate as an independent private entity.\n\nThe analysts said the \u201cNigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector is on a global footprint to deliver energy security to Nigerians and the international community with the desired expectation, bring about more emphasis on transparency and accountability in the company as its government-subsidized operations will come to a halt.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, they said \u201cthere\u2019s room for corporate governance principles to influence board decisions and actions, it will propel the NNPC Limited into becoming a publicly traded company on the Nigerian Stock Exchange and any other major exchange where dividends will be paid to shareholders,\n\npropel it into new investment opportunities while also attracting more investments into the company as well as into the oil and gas sector.\u201d\n\nThe NNPC transited into a limited liability company as incorporated by the Company and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) and in line with the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) signed by President Buhari August 16, 2021, after 2 decades.\n\nConsequently, the PIB was passed and assented to by the lawmakers and one of the dividends from the bill was the rebirth of NNPC Limited.\n\nThe president had July 1, 2022, ordered the transfer of the assets of NNPC Group to NNPC Limited, its successor company.\n\nThe assets transfer paved the way for the transition into a private entity which is expected to imbibe the culture of a private-sector-led business with a major focus on profit-making.\n\nHowever, the path to profitability and delivery of long-lasting dividends to its over 200 million shareholders is hinged on the adoption of the principles of corporate governance which must be allowed to influence actions and decision -making in the company.\n\nThe NNPC plays a critical role in the regulation of the oil and gas sector and as noted by Nigeria\u2019s President Buhari at the unveiling, the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) provisions has given the petroleum company the new power to help run without government funding and working in line with the public procurement and fiscal responsibility act.\n\nConsidering the assets available currently to the limited liability company combined with the fiscal regime, it is set to become Africa\u2019s biggest energy company.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

There is currently no cure for the virus.\n\n\u201cGiven the proximity of Ghana to Nigeria as well as the WHO alert, the NCDC-led multisectoral National Emerging Viral Haemorrhagic Diseases Working Group (EVHDWG) that coordinates preparedness efforts for MVD, and other emerging viral haemorrhagic diseases has conducted a rapid risk assessment to guide in-country preparedness activities,\u201d NCDC Director-General, Dr Adetifa, said in the statement.\n\n\u201cBased on available data, the overall risk of both importation of the disease and its potential impact on the Nigerian population is said to be moderate as assessed by NCDC experts and partners given the following: the proximity (same region), high traffic from Ghana and countries that share borders with Ghana, the incubation period of 21 days of the virus, heightened surveillance at point of entry, Nigeria\u2019s capacity to respond to the outbreak in the country and the fact that persons with MVD transmit the virus when they become symptomatic unlike for SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19 that can also be transmitted by infected persons without symptoms.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NCDC DG, Nigeria has the capacity to test for the disease that was first discovered in 1967 after outbreaks in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nTesting for the virus can currently be done at the National Reference Laboratory in Abuja and the University of Lagos Teaching Hospital laboratory Centre for Human and Zoonotic Virology.\n\nDr Adetifa added, \u201cDiagnostic capacity can be scaled up to other laboratories if required. Nigeria has the resources (human, technical and laboratory) for prompt identification and management in the event of a single imported case.\u201d\n\nEven with the measures in place including increased surveillance by the authorities in neighbouring Benin Republic and Togo, the NCDC boss believes changes may be needed.\n\n\u201cThe response situation may change in the coming days with the control efforts in Ghana and advisories as may be issued by the World Health Organisation. In addition, many of the contacts under follow-up in Ghana will soon exit the 21-day quarantine period and so far, there have been no secondary cases reported,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NCDC DG urged Nigerians to adhere strictly to preventive the following preventive measures.\n\nAvoid non-essential travel to locations where the outbreak is reported for the moment\n\nAvoid direct contact with blood, saliva, vomit, urine, and other bodily fluids of people with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus disease\n\nAvoid the animal reservoir (fruit bats), other sick animals.\n\nEnsure all persons with the symptoms described above are promptly taken to healthcare facilities for diagnosis and initiation of supportive treatment\n\nIn suspected and/or confirmed MVD cases, direct physical contact should be avoided by ensuring strict isolation, the use of protective gowns, masks, gloves and safe disposal of needles, bedding, and other contaminated materials\n\nStrict practice of infection prevention control in the healthcare setting for all suspected patients.\n\nMale survivors of Marburg virus disease should practice safer sexual practices and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen test negative twice for the virus\n\nRead the NCDC\u2019s full statement below:",

          "title": "Police Still Hunting Terrorist Turbaned in Zamfara, Says Katsina Governor Masari",
          "text": "Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, on Tuesday painted a rather confounding scenario, when he said the police are still hunting a notorious terrorist kingpin, Adamu Aliero, who was recently turbaned the Sarkin Fulanin Yandoto by the now suspended Emir of Birnin Yandoto, in Tsafe Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Aliyu Garba Marafa, by Governor Bello Matawalle.\n\nMasari, who spoke in an interview with BBC Hausa Service, however, expressed sadness over the development, saying his government has yet to forgive Aliero for killing his people, stressing that the state and police are still looking for the terror leader, who has been on police wanted list for the past two years.\n\nThe Katsina State Police Command had in June, 2020 declared Aliero wanted for masterminding the attack on Kadisau village of Faskari Local Government Area of the state, an incident that led to the killing of over 52 people.\n\nThe police further placed a bounty of N5,000,000 on his head to anyone with useful information that could lead to his arrest \u2013 either dead or alive.\n\nCuriously, however, the most sought after terrorists\u2019 kingpin was recently given a chieftaincy title of Sarkin Fulanin Yandoto by Emir Marafa, which led to his immediate suspension by Governor Matawalle.\n\nBut Masari, during the interview, explained that the Katsina State government had not forgiven the notorious terrorist and that the government would work with security agencies to arrest the hoodlum.\n\nHe insisted that even if Aliero, has accepted to live peacefully with the farming communities in Zamfara, his government still considered him a terrorist and would do everything humanly possible to arrest him and make him face the law for the crimes he had committed.\n\nThe governor wondered why a criminal, who has been on wanted list of security operatives for years would be conferred with a chieftaincy title after killing innocent citizens in communities across Zamfara and Katsina States.\n\nHe reiterated that some terrorists recruited by Aliero were still killing, kidnapping and raping residents of Katsina State in villages and communities that bordered Zamfara .\n\n\u201cIt is surprising because Katsina and Zamfara are the same. If a neighbour doesn\u2019t support his neighbour, do you think he would be supported in his time of travail? So, it surprised me how they looked away from the travail of their neighbor (Katsina).\n\n\u201cIt affected them too because a traitor, when he is done with your enemy, would turn towards you. We\u2019ve not forgiven him and just as the police in Katsina said, they are still looking for him. For me, the one I have business with is the governor (Matawalle).\n\n\u201cI tried reaching out to him but he is not around and I did not get him. The police command here (Katsina) has the responsibility to reach out to the police in Zamfara to know what\u2019s actually going on.\n\n\u201cThe only issue is that the police in Katsina can\u2019t go to Zamfara and arrest him. So, if he dares enter Katsina again, we will arrest him so that he can answer for his crimes. Even if they said he has stopped, we know that here in Katsina, he is still killing people; his boys are still killing people,\u201d the governor maintained.\n\nMeanwhile, terrorists on Tuesday, launched fresh onslaught on Ruwan-Godiya community in Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina State and killed nine farmers, who were working on their farmlands.\n\nThe motorcycle-riding terrorists, who stormed the community in broad daylight, also injured no fewer than seven other farmers including their children.\n\nA resident of the community, Ibrahim Sani, told THISDAY in a telephone interview that, the criminals followed the victims to their respective farms and shot them dead.\n\n\u201cThey (terrorists) attacked us around 2pm this afternoon (Tuesday) and moved to nearby farms and starting killing people on their farms. We have so far recovered nine bodies. They injured seven people also.\n\n\u201cWe are tired of these people (terrorists), because they are killing and kidnapping our people on daily basis. We wonder what we have done to them. Government should please come to our rescue,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Gambo Isah, while confirming the attack on the community, said the terrorists killed six people during the invasion, and added that six other people sustained varying degree of injuries, while the terrorists rustled an unspecified number of cattle belonging to residents.\n\nThe superintendent of police said those injured had already been taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\nFrancis Sardauna in Katsina",

          "title": "Nigerian Airlines Condemn Closure of Lagos Airport Runway",
          "text": "The Airlines Operators of Nigeria (AON) has condemned the decision of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) to close the domestic runway, known as Runway 18L for three months.\n\nThe umbrella body of indigenous airlines in Nigeria said the closure added to additional operational cost, flight delays and disruptions, insisting that there are other alternatives instead of outright closure of the facility.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAON made its position known a letter it wrote to FAAN, dated July 15, 2022m, titled: \u2018Closure of Runway 18L at Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA),\u2019 and addressed to the Managing Director of the agency, Captain Rabiu Yadudu.\n\nAON said it received with surprise, the NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) of July 5, 2022, informing the industry that FAAN would be closing the domestic runway (18L) of MMA from July 8, 2022, for a period of 90 days.\n\nIt added that with such short notice, the association noted sadly that FAAN closed the runway, thus causing unsustainable additional operating costs and severely inconveniencing the airlines and passengers.\n\n\u201cIn light of this, we raise the following critical issues for your urgent attention: The AON welcomes the effort by FAAN to install runway lighting on Runway 18L, at last. However, international best practice for such critical airfield infrastructure projects is for the airport operator to enter into discussions with all affected parties, to arrive at an optimal arrangement that allows the work to be done, while limiting the inconvenience, economic impact and safety implications on all concerned. In this instance, FAAN failed to do this.\u201d\n\nIt also noted that FAAN was aware of the current existential threat of aviation fuel prices to the domestic airlines, noting that the closure of the main domestic runway of MMA automatically adds an additional 10-15 per cent more fuel costs per sector into and out of MMA, based on the additional flight and taxi time incurred as a result.\n\nThe operators also disclosed that the airlines have already felt the additional costs within the first week of the closure of the runway, stressing that this unnecessary burden was unsustainable for a three-month period on the airlines.\n\n\u201cThe closure of Runway 18L has led to a chain of direct flight delays on a daily basis, impacting the entire system of scheduled domestic flights in the country. FAAN is aware that most domestic flights originate from or pass through MMA at some point every day. This is an unnecessary additional negative outcome for the industry.\n\n\u201cAON contends that in line with international best practice, runways of airports are only closed when there is no other option. For infrastructure projects such as this one on 18L, to limit the impact on flight operations, FAAN ought to have ensured that the contractor does the work at night, when the runway is not in use.\n\n\u201cIf there is an absolute need for work to be done during daylight hours, then agreement should have been reached with the runway users on what time window would allow this,\u201d AON said in the letter.\n\nIt also expressed disappointment that for the major airport in Nigeria, Runway 18L has been closed for a week now, with no evidence of any work going on; yet the airlines have been burdened with huge but unnecessary additional costs and flight delays, noting that, \u201csurely this situation is not in the best interests of the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoreover, the additional taxi time due to closure of runway 18L impacts negatively on airlines schedule to sunset airports around the country leading to delays and cancellation of flights to these airports.\n\n\u201cGiven the above critical concerns, AON implores the management of FAAN to urgently review this closure of Runway 18L and enter into discussion with the users of the runway on a procedure for the project, that limits both the cost impact on airlines as well as disruption to normal flight operations,\u201d the operated stated.\n\nAON therefore called on FAAN to convene an urgent stakeholders\u2019 consultation meeting, to discuss the its decision and assured the agency of the operators\u2019 commitment to partnering with FAAN to install the long overdue runway lighting on Runway 18L, in line with accepted international best practice.\n\nChinedu Eze",

          "text": "Promoters of Ping Express have debunked allegations that the company or its past directors were involved in money laundering or fraud.\n\nThis follows the recent 27 months jail term slammed on the founders of the Texas-based fintech firm \u2013 Anslem Oshionebo and Opeyemi Odeyale \u2013 for allegedly failing to combat money laundering on the their platform during financial remittances to Nigeria.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nIn a statement by Ping Express, which was released by Global Marketing Communications Professional, the agency managing the fintech\u2019s public relation, it stated that in the last two and a half years, the company had been dragged through the US court system on unsubstantiated allegations, including money laundering.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cWe deny any allegations that we participated in money laundering activities via our platform; and the court records are available and very clear.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply saddening that a technology that was designed to help immigrants stay connected to their families could have been grossly misused by a few of the platform\u2019s over 80 thousand customers.\n\n\u201cThe company did not steal from anyone and did not know or conspire with anyone to steal a dollar from anyone. The court documents and rulings are clear. No losses and no restitution were imposed on the company nor its founders and this validates that the US court recognised that no fraud was perpetrated within the company\u2019s platform nor was fraud aided or abetted by its founders,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAccording to the statement, Ping Express served more than 80,000 hardworking and honest Nigerians in the US and more in other parts of the world.\n\nPing Express operated in more than 28 countries including UK, Canada and several European countries and served immigrants from 27 African countries with consistent Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) that were reviewed and approved by regulators.\n\n\u201cIt is of importance to note that some of the Ping\u2019s users that were queried by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) were customers of the top two competition.\n\n\u201cThese users paid Ping directly from their personal bank accounts in the US. All its customers were verified and went through extensive screening before their transactions were processed.\n\n\u201cInternal limits, which were subject to review per the Company\u2019s policy, are the basis for which we were non-compliant. In essence, customers have no hard limits per the Company\u2019s policies (not external limits).\n\n\u201cPing operated strict compliance standards, and ensured users paid from their personal bank accounts. Unfortunately, the US government insisted that Ping didn\u2019t consider and file enough suspicious reports on all its customers despite them paying from their personal bank accounts with monies already housed by American banks who in the dynamics that Ping know are the ones responsible for the flagging of the source of the monies in their customers\u2019 accounts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was apparently expected that its owners would know every single Nigerian by name, creed, behavior and track record, as amusing as this sounds, it\u2019s concerning and a pointer to many other things that has crystallized in this matter.\n\n\u201cIt is depressing to view the malicious and baseless claims being reported in the Nigerian media.\n\n\u201cThis becomes a sample case for us all to find company founders being held liable for internal control failures of their company, especially when they had no personal relationship with its users.\n\n\u201cHowever, this is what the Ping former owners are faced with,\u201d it added.\n\nOne of the founders, Oshionebo was quoted to have said: \u201cWe focused on making the simple task of helping a family much easier. We worked very hard with integrity to develop a system that disrupted the marketplace. \u201cRather than join other companies in creating customer service and relations team outside Nigeria, we were passionate about Nigeria and built one of the first outsourcing unit in Nigeria, employing over 40 Nigerians. History is the best judge.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Co-founder and former COO, Odeyale, said: \u201cHaving led an extremely expensive and painful legal battle with the US regulators over the last 3 years, with the full support of my wife, it was simply time to make decision that was only in the best interest of my family.\n\n\u201cI stand proud of what we have achieved for the Nigerian and African community in US and other part of the world.\u201d\n\nEmma Okonji",

          "text": "An end may be in sight to the five-month old strike in Nigerian public universities as President Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday directed the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, to resolve the prolonged industrial action embarked upon by the four university-based unions and report back to him within two weeks.\n\nThis was just as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has urged the federal government to consider mobilising funds from different sources including non-budgetary outlets like stamp duty, GSM and alcoholic taxes to help fund the needs of the education sector.\n\nOn their part, members of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian University, (SSANU) have warned the Professor Nimi-Briggs Committee renegotiating the 2009 Agreement that it would not accept any disparity in university staff salary, saying it would take every legal action to ensure that such doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nBuhari gave the directive to end the 155-day old industrial action embarked on by ASUU as well as other university unions that later downed tools, after receiving briefings at the State House, Abuja, from relevant government Ministries, Agencies and Departments (MDAs) involved in resolving the face-off with the university unions.\n\nASUU had proceeded on one month warning strike on February 14, 2022 and thereafter extended the industrial action, while other unions also withdrew their services after that as a result of the alleged inability of the federal government to meet up with their demands.\n\nThe three other unions that embarked on strike are the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU), the Non-Academic Staff Union of Allied and Educational Institutions (NASU) and the National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT).\n\nHowever, the president was reported to have convened the meeting to receive briefing from the government team on while the strike had lingered for too long.\n\nBuhari after hearing from the relevant MDAs directly involved ordered the Minister of Education to ensure that the impasse was resolved within two weeks and report back to him.\n\nSources at the meeting said the president also directed that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, must attend all the meetings to be called to resolve the crisis.\n\nA sources added that the president, however, commended Ngige in his efforts so far to resolve the lingering crisis with the university unions.\n\nThose who attended the meeting with the president included the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu; his Finance, Budget and National Planning counterpart, Dr. Zainab Ahmed and Ngige.\n\nOthers included Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami; Head of Service of the Federation, Dr. Folashade Yemi-Esan; the Chairman of National Salaries Income and Wages Commission, Ekpo Nta and the Director-General Budget Office, Ben Akabueze.\n\nThe Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) had on Monday expressed its resolve to hold a two-day national protest from July 26th and 27th, to demand the immediate reopening of the country\u2019s public-owned tertiary institutions.\n\nThe NLC had accused the federal government of not negotiating in good faith to resolve the crisis in Nigeria\u2019s public Universities\n\nThe Labour movement had at its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held in Abuja, on June 30, 2022, threatened to embark on a nationwide protest to compel, \u201cthe federal government to conclude the ongoing negotiation with trade unions in Nigeria\u2019s universities and be prepared to commence implementation of whatever Collective Bargaining Agreement arising therefrom so that public universities in Nigeria can resume normal activities.\u201d\n\nThe federal government was then given a 21-day ultimatum to resolve the dispute or face a one-day nationwide labour protest which might culminate in a full blown worker\u2019s strike.\n\nThe federal government had said the proposal made by the Prof. Limi Briggs-led Committee in relation to the demands by members of ASUU and other unions in universities would gulp N1.12 trillion to implement.\n\nNgige, in a statement signed by the Deputy Director Press and Public Relations in the Ministry, Olajide Oshundun, had said having rounded off its work, the Briggs Committee had proposed 109 -185 per cent increase in the university wage structure.\n\nHe had explained that based on the recommendation, federal government would incur, \u201can additional N560 billion as salaries alone, on top of the present N412 billion, less all other allowances such as earned academic allowances and fringe benefits, teaching allowance, field trip responsibility and post-graduate supervision allowances, and hazard allowances which were to gulp another N170 billion.\u201d\n\nASUU Suggests Use of Stamp Duty, GSM, Alcoholic Taxes to Fund Education\n\nMeanwhile, ASUU has urged the federal government to utilise resources from the stamp duty, GSM and alcoholic taxes to help fund the needs the education sector.\n\nThe union also took a swipe on Ngige, blaming him of constituting an obstacle to the process of resolution of the lingering dispute with the federal government.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja on Tuesday, ASUU President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke said the union was of the opinion that federal government could explore the possibility of sourcing funding for the development of the education sector from non-budgetary sources.\n\n\u201cASUU believes that the idea of availability of funds is a dynamic process. For instance, government can mobilise funds from different sources including non-budgetary outlets like the stamp duty, GSM and alcoholic taxes.\n\n\u201cThese were parts of our recommendations at the National Workshop organised by the federal government on sustainable funding of education in Nigeria, held between 27th and 28th November, 2018, at the Banquet Hall of the State House in Abuja,\u201d it said.\n\nOsodeke said the workshop by the MDAs were also challenged to remit, for the purpose of raising budgetary profile, excesses that accrue and not accounted for.\n\n\u201cWe insist that until and unless these sources of \u2018loose funds\u2019 are pooled and appropriated in support of education funding, Nigerian Universities will not be positioned to compete globally as well as develop and attract local and foreign grants,\u201d he added.\n\nThe ASUU president said the union was also appalled by the recent calls by top government functionaries at both federal and state levels to establish more universities at a time agencies run by same Chief Executives had been tightly squeezed of funding.\n\nHe said ASUU was restating its opposition to the proliferation of universities and other tertiary institutions merely for political gains or electoral value.\n\nHe described the intentions of establishing new universities as hypocritical and the handwork of political jobbers who dangle the carrots of siting institutions they have no intention of developing to compete with others in Africa and beyond.\n\nOsodeke also spoke about the delay in reaching a resolution of the dispute with federal government, saying the government had been going back and forth on the issue.\n\nHe accused Ngige of deliberately misrepresenting the International Labour Organisation\u2019s (ILO) convention on the collective bargaining agreement and the roles of a conciliator to serve his alleged propagandist interest in this matter.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, there have been insinuations by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, that there was no agreement between ASUU and the government; that ASUU sat down to fix its own members\u2019 salaries; and that our Union asked representatives of ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) to recuse themselves from the negotiations, \u201d he said.\n\nOsodeke said ASUU participated at several meetings at the instance of the Ministry of Labour and Employment chaired by Ngige as, \u201cConciliator\u201d since it began its strike on February 14.\n\n\u201cTo our utter dismay, nothing concrete came out of the endless deliberations as the Conciliator kept approbating and reprobating. For instance, he would declare that he fully supported our demand that the renegotiation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU be speedily concluded within six weeks while at the same time creating an unrealistic pathway to arriving at a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Ngige kept going back and forth on concluding the integrity test for the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) for replacing the discredited Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information (IPPIS) contrary to the letters and spirit of the Memorandum of Action (MoA) of December 2021. \u201cMatters got to a head when our Union leaders were forced to express their frustration at one of the so-called conciliatory meetings. When we expressed our frustration at the manners the engagement processes were going, Ngige went on to lampoon the Ministry of Education; saying he was not our employer.\n\n\u201cAt a point, he directed our union to go and picket the office of the Minister of Education, who is our employer! Subsequently, he tactfully recused himself, \u201d he said.\n\nOsodeke also accused Ngige of frustrating move by the Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, and supported by the Co-chair of the Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) and President of Christian Association of Nigeria, Revd. Dr. Samson Ayokunle, to get the embargo placed on university workers\u2019 salaries lifted to pave way for amicable resolution of the crisis.\n\nThe ASUU president denied that the union said the president was going to sign agreement between it and the government.\n\n\u201cWhat we said was that our draft agreement was receiving attention by the president. Our claim about a draft agreement was predicated on the fact that it was the second document to be produced by a joint Renegotiating Committee of the 2009 FGN/ASUU Agreement comprising representatives of MDAs and the ASUU team,\u201d he said.\n\nOsodake further questioned the rationale for granting the Minister of Labour the status of. Conciliator, adding that the Trade Dispute Act, the principal legislation for labour relations, does not empower the Minister to assume the office of conciliator.\n\nWe Won\u2019t Accept Any Disparity in Varsity Salary, Says SSANU\n\nOn its part, SSANU has warned the Nimi-Briggs Committee renegotiating the 2009 Agreement that it woulf not accept any disparity in university staff salary and vowed to take every legal action to ensure that such doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nIt however commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his intervention in the ongoing strike embarked upon by the university based unions.\n\nUnlike its sister union, SSANU commended Ngige for what it described as his dexterity in ensuring that all university-based unions are carried along in the renegotiation exercise.\n\nNational President of SSANU, Mr. Mohammed Ibrahim stated these in a statement in Abuja, Tuesday.\n\nWhile commending Ngige for the role he has played in handling the negotiation of the 2009 Agreement, he said, \u201cSSANU is happy with the dexterity of the Minister of Labour and Employment in ensuring that all university-based unions are carried along in this renegotiation exercise.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the proposal for the review of salary for university staff with a differential of teaching staff taking between 108 to 180 per cent and unreasonable 10 per cent for non-teaching staff is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cWe are shocked to read that the Nimi Briggs Committee has submitted a report to the government while we only met with them twice. To say the least, SSANU is not happy with the pace of work in that committee.\n\n\u201cWhile we only met twice with them, we are aware that they have met with the teaching staff not less than 10 times. We are surprised how the so-called percentage was allocated to non-teaching staff. We have not had the opportunity of discussing salary review with them because the committee stated that they have not gotten the approval of their principal to discuss that.\n\n\u201cWe are seriously shocked and taken aback by the media report that a certain miserable, unacceptable percentage was recommended to non-teaching staff. We therefore advise that that committee should as a matter of urgency, conclude renegotiation with us.\u201d\n\nThe SSANU boss told the committee to immediately reconvene to conclude the assignment given to it by discussing frankly and truthfully the 2009 renegotiation document presented to it.\n\nWarning that non-teaching staff would not take it likely any attempt to have different payment table for staff, he said, \u201cThis is because the university system is a universal system comprising two broad categories of staff, the teaching, and the non-teaching staff and the salary consideration has always been the same except for allowances.\n\n\u201cTherefore, any attempt to give preferential treatment to any group will not only be unfair but unjust and inhumane.\n\n\u201cThe way the university operates, we are all in the system because of the students, the students are the most important stakeholder in the university project. Therefore, while the teaching staff is busy imparting knowledge to the students, the non-teaching staff have the responsibility of molding the character of students through the provision of a conducive and secure atmosphere and that is why at the end of any student graduating degrees are awarded to students if they are found worthy in character and learning. The teaching and nonteaching staff play complementary roles in making the university.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",

          "text": "After enjoying a long reign as the king of streaming, Netflix faces a tough fight to keep its crown.\n\nIt lost almost 1m subscribers between April and July, as the number of people quitting the service accelerated.\n\nBut that was not as many as the streaming giant had feared.\n\nAsked what may have stopped subscriptions sliding further, the firm\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, said: \u201cIf there was a single thing, we might say \u2018Stranger Things.'\u201d\n\nThe company reported its first subscriber loss since 2011 in April, news that was followed by hundreds of job cuts and a sharp drop in its share price.\n\nRivals are challenging its dominance, while price hikes have taken a toll.\n\nThe new season of the hit drama has been a phenomenal success, and may have helped stem the exodus of Netflix customers.\n\nThe company reported its first subscriber loss since 2011 in April, news that was followed by hundreds of job cuts and a sharp drop in its share price.\n\nRivals are challenging its dominance, while price hikes have taken a toll.\n\nThe subscriber losses reported on Tuesday were the biggest in the firm\u2019s history, with the US and Canada home to the highest number of cancellations in the quarter, followed by Europe.\n\nGuy Bisson, executive director at Ampere Analysis, said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that Netflix would start to see its grip on the market loosen.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re the leader, there\u2019s only one direction to go, especially when a large amount of competition launches, which is what Netflix has seen in the last couple of years,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is a stark change for Netflix, which enjoyed years of seemingly unstoppable growth, as it revolutionised the way people around the world consumed entertainment.\n\nIts position as a global behemoth was cemented when the pandemic hit in 2020 and people, stuck at home with few other options for entertainment, flocked to monster hits like Squid Game and The Crown.\n\nBut as pre-pandemic habits return, Netflix has struggled to attract new sign-ups \u2013 and maintain the loyalty of existing members, especially as the cost of living crisis leads to belt tightening.\n\nThe company also faces fierce competition from the likes of Apple TV, HBO Max, Amazon Prime and Disney+. Netflix was once the disruptor, making video rental stores like Blockbuster redundant. But the disruptor is fast becoming the disrupted.\n\nNetflix\u2019s move to make its service more expensive has also put off some customers.\n\nPrice hikes more \u2018risky\u2019\n\nA \u201cstandard\u201d plan in the US \u2013 which allows people in the same home to watch on two devices simultaneously \u2013 now costs $15.49, up from $14 in January and just $11 in 2019.\n\nIn the UK, basic and standard plans have both increased since January by \u00a31 a month to \u00a36.99 and \u00a310.99 respectively.\n\n\u201cAt some point, yes, they\u2019re going to reach a threshold where a significant number of people say enough is enough,\u201d Mr Bisson said. \u201cBecause of the additional choice\u2026 price hikes are a more risky strategy.\u201d\n\nFor now, surveys suggest that Netflix is managing to lure back a higher share of deserters than its rivals. Many households also continue to identify it as the streaming option they would retain if forced to have only one.\n\nIn all, the company had roughly 220 million subscribers at the end of June \u2013 still well north of its closest competition.\n\nBut the company, long accustomed to posting double digit growth, is grappling with its most serious slowdown in years, with revenue in the April-June quarter of $7.9bn, up just 8.6% year-on-year.\n\nThe firm\u2019s share price has dropped more than 60% so far this year, as investors sour on its prospects.\n\n\u201cNetflix\u2019s subscriber loss was expected but it remains a sore point for a company that is wholly dependent on subscription revenue from consumers,\u201d said Insider Intelligence analyst Ross Benes.\n\n\u201cNetflix is still the leader in video streaming but unless it finds more franchises that resonate widely, it will eventually struggle to stay ahead of competitors that are after its crown.\u201d\n\nShares climbed more than 7% in after-hours trade on relief that the losses were not larger. The firm had warned it could lose as many as two million subscribers.\n\nNetflix has said it will jumpstart growth with a new ads-supported service and by clamping down on password sharing \u2013 which one study estimated was costing Netflix $6bn a year.\n\nIt is already charging more for sharing accounts in some countries in central and South America. It hopes to replicate this model around the world.\n\nHowever, the company has known about problems with passwords sharing for years, and has so far failed to find a solution.\n\nIn its shareholder update, the company said it was \u201cencouraged by our early learnings and ability to convert consumers to paid sharing in Latin America\u201d.\n\nIt said it expected its less expensive, ad-supported option to launch in early 2023, starting in \u201ca handful of markets where advertising spend is significant\u201d.\n\n\u201cLike most of our new initiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe ad service has the potential to attract both existing customers inclined to cancel over price hikes, as well as new households hesitant to commit to a subscription, Mr Bisson said.\n\nIt should be possible for Netflix to make the same amount of money \u2013 or more \u2013 per user than it did by relying on subscriptions, he added.\n\nStrong content critical\n\n\u201cAssuming they get it right \u2013 and by getting it right I mean the price \u2026 and the amount of advertising on it \u2013 then it\u2019s potentially a strong strategic move for them,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said Netflix\u2019s most critical task is ensuring it has strong material for people to watch \u2013 a job that has grown harder as it pushes to reach an increasingly broad audience.\n\nNew sign-ups in the US, for example, are coming from an increasingly older crowd, with different tastes than the younger viewers who were early streaming converts.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re increasingly competing for that generalist audience, so the breadth of content that is needed becomes much wider and that\u2019s why I think people are saying \u2018there\u2019s now a lot of stuff I don\u2019t like\u2019,\u201d Mr Bisson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big challenge.\u201d\n\nNetflix needs \u201cmore frequent hits\u201d, said Eric Steinberg of Whip Media, adding that Netflix also has room to experiment staggering its releases to keep a hold on its subscribers.\n\nThe company has already taken steps in that direction by releasing episodes of the fourth season of Stranger Things in two batches this year, but the \u201cpressure is on\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the sandpit to themselves anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIn an inflationary environment like the one we\u2019re in and also great programming [at the competition], people are going to re-evaluate how much they\u2019re willing to pay.\u201d\n\nBBC",
