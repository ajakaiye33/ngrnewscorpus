If he wants to write to the press for cancellation, I think we should also have the copy of it so that we will be able to react to it. I am hearing it for the first time from you, I am not aware.\n\n\u201cIt is his right to install chiefs in his own domain.

          "title": "Ongoing doctors\u2019 strike is one too many",
          "text": "A total nationwide strike by the 16,000-strong National Association of Resident Doctors entered its eighth day on Monday, plunging millions of Nigerians further into pain, anguish, and for some, possibly death. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic now in its third wave, a cholera outbreak and rising poverty, the action by professionals sworn to save human lives is one strike too many. In the interest of shared humanity, they should call it off today.\n\nReports indicate tales of agony across the country as patients were turned back, many sick discharged prematurely and emergency services paralysed. Like Nigerian lecturers, doctors have used the strike option too frequently and without considering the plight of patients, who are often the most vulnerable. The wealthy and privileged hardly use public hospitals.\n\nAn extension of an earlier strike in April, the action is hinged on familiar grouses: failure of the government to pay residency allowances, COVID-19 hazard allowance, outstanding salary shortfalls and migration of doctors to agreed payroll platforms. The doctors are particularly angry that a Memorandum of Understanding between NARD and the Federal Government had not been implemented and by the irregular or non-payment of the meagre N5,000 monthly hazard grant. They also complain of inadequate and ill-maintained facilities at public hospitals.\n\nThese are weighty issues. The Nigerian government is often irresponsible, uncaring, and cavalier in managing public institutions and professional cadres. It signs agreements and commitments with unions and refuses to implement them. Such deplorable behaviour has created a toxic industrial relations environment that provokes frequent strikes.\n\nHowever, doctors, as the apex medical professionals, should employ the strike option only as a last resort. They are not factory workers, tanker drivers or excitable students. Their Hippocratic Oath is supposed to be a lifetime commitment to saving and preserving lives. As enlightened professionals, they should explore other means of pressing home legitimate grievances rather than total strikes.\n\nStudents suffer when universities are grounded by striking lecturers, the economy is harmed when oil sector workers down tools, and commuters are stranded when transport unions strike. When doctors withdraw their services completely, however, patients die, and some may suffer permanent disability. In the United Kingdom, in the mid-1970s, consultants and junior doctors decided to withdraw non-emergency services, according to the BBC. And recently when nurses, paramedics, administrative staff, and hospital porters went on strike across the public sector over the pension changes in the same country, it was just a one-day affair.\n\nThere should therefore be more refined ways of doctors making their point. A review of strikes by health care workers across the world by the International Association for the Study of Pain found no evidence of increased mortality because striking doctors preserve emergency services. As their colleagues do elsewhere, Nigerian doctors should adopt a strategy whereby some members will down tools while others continue working. When in April 2016, junior doctors in the UK went on strike over new working contracts, it was only for two days. Moreover, senior doctors, through their professional associations, mobilised and reassured the public that they would fill in the gap during the walkout. The UK doctors also once walked out for only one hour in a symbolic move to draw attention to their complaints. Nigeria\u2019s doctors should adopt such tactics to avoid needless loss of lives. In collaboration with hospital managements, arrangements should be made to attend to emergencies and the critically ill.\n\nLegal action and arbitration should also be considered. As the Health Minister, Osagie Ehanire, hinted, most of the issues raised by the doctors are state matters. The practice of unions sealing agreements with the Federal Government and seeking to make them binding on the states should stop; Nigeria is a federation, and it should operate as one.\n\nThe Federal Government has been insensitive and incompetent. Chris Ngige, the Labour Minister, must drop his unseemly bellicose stance. Both sides should return to the negotiating table to reconcile their positions; while NARD says it gave notice over many days ago, Ngige insists the ministry was not notified contrary to labour laws. Amid a national and global health crisis, the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), who, unfeelingly, is in London to cater to his health, Ehanire and Ngige should be concerned about ordinary Nigerians and persuade doctors to resume work.\n\nIt is inhumane, sadistic, and unprofessional for workers on essential services to embark on strike at the drop of a hat and for maximum effect. Doctors should henceforth use strikes sparingly, creatively and with the milk of human kindness.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

A group in the South West is calling for Oduduwa Republic and others in the South East are also calling for their own Biafra.\n\n\u201cSo you find out that almost every zone of the country is facing one challenge or another in the sense that almost every sector of our national life is faced by one challenge or another.\n\n\u201cAll the zones in the country, look at them, North East, Boko Haram, North West is kidnapping and banditry, North central is farmers-herders crises, South South the militants and the vandalisation of pipelines and so on and so forth.\n\n\u201cYou find the issue of insecurity, you find the issue of unemployment, you find the issue of inflation, you find the issue of social explosion. What I mean by social explosion is that you find youth restiveness, youth gangsterism and so on and so forth,\u201d the don said.\n\nHe said the National Assembly had great roles to play in the current agitations for restructuring, declaring that the legislature were empowered to bring the change the people wanted.\n\n\u201cConstitutionally they are the people required to bring about the changes requested by sections of the country.\n\n\u201cYou cannot just jump out and say you want a country or self determination or we want to restructure the country,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the current reality in Nigeria called for a sober reflection, submitting that there was the need to sit down and look at things as they were in the country objectively.\n\n\u201cReally, the situation calls for sober reflection of the very foundation of the state, I mean the Nigeria nation. We really need to sit down and look at things from an objective perspective because right now the foundation of the country is shaky and we are appealing to people in governance to look at the issue more seriously,\u201d Malumfashi submitted.\n\nSpeaking on the relationship between the National Assembly and the executive, the professor noted that though there is currently\n\na harmonious relationship between the two arms of government, such should, however, be for the benefit of Nigerians and not to short-changed them.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe National Assembly or Parliament must work together for the general good of the country. We have had situations where members of the National Assembly would be involved in padding the budget for whatever reasons and at the end of the day whatever is padded is not meant for the people.\n\n\u201cSo a good working relationship would be for the benefit of Nigerians and I think they are not doing badly but we really need to put them on their toes so that they will do more because the National Assembly can do better.\u201d",

The rate of accidents at this junction is very high. The incident that happened this (Monday) morning was one of such.\n\n\u2018A fully loaded truck, carrying petrol, I think, suffered brake failure, and veered off the road in a bid to avoid ramming into many vehicles at the Celica Junction. In the process, the truck hit a taxi and both of them plunged into a stream by the roadside.\n\n\u2018At that time, the occupants of the taxi had not died, though some of them might have sustained injury based on the impact of the hit. The driver of the cab then attempted to get his vehicle out of the stream. But the tanker fell on the taxi and finished the job, killing the six occupants on the spot.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\n\u2018I must confess to you that the Celica community in Ibadan is not happy that the Federal Government has not completed the rehabilitation work on the new Ibadan-Ife Expressway, which began more than one year ago. So, we appeal to the Federal Government to please ensure timely completion of the road in order to save our lives and that of other road users from preventable deaths through accidents,\u2019 Sunday said.\n\nMen of Oyo State Fire Service and Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) were deployed to the accident scene immediately. The fire brigades were able to put out the fire, preventing effectively it from spreading. Officers of the FRSC controlled traffic and prevented logjam at the Celica Junction.\n\nThe Assistant Director, Oyo State Fire Service, Moshood Adewuyi, confirmed the incident, saying the truck fell on the cab and killed all the occupants on the spot. He added that his men from Gbagi Station were deployed to the scene for the rescue operation.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By David-Chyddy Eleke\n\nTwo persons were Monday allegedly killed in Nnewi, Anambra State, over the sit-at-home order issued by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nPolice authorities confirmed that there was an incident in the industrial city on Monday morning, which led to fatalities, but denied knowledge of who were responsible.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that two persons died during a bloody confrontation that happened at Izuchukwu junction area in Nnewi. An eyewitness said the victims were a member of Eastern Security Network (ESN) and a commercial motorcyclist.\n\nThe source claimed that problem started at about 7.00am in the morning when some IPOB members came out to enforce the sit-at-home order and in the process blocked the major roads in the industrial town.\n\n\u201cSome unidentified soldiers came in to clear the items used to block the roads leading to an altercation between them and the IPOB members.\n\n\u201cThat was how the two victims were actually killed by gun shots by the unknown soldiers.\n\n\u201cThe industrial town of Nnewi has been reduced to a ghost town as the people who initially came out for their daily business had to rush back home.\n\n\u201cSome vehicles were also smashed by aggrieved persons over the attack on the civilians by armed soldiers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe spokesperson of Anambra State Police command, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, who spoke to THISDAY said: \u201cYes, I\u2019m aware of the incident in Nnewi today, but I do not have the details. We are still collating details, and I will inform you later.\u201d\n\nIkenga was unable to tell our correspondent if the security operatives were soldiers or police officers. He said,\u201d we are still investigating.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, major and minor cities in Anambra State, including Awka, Onitsha, Nnewi, Ekwulobia and others were Monday totally shutdown, in compliance with the directive of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe group had called for a shutdown of businesses in the South East states, every Monday until its leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu who is in the custody of the Directorate of State Services (DSS) and standing trial was released.\n\nThere had been confusion whether the sit-at-home would hold or not. This was because of a counter directive by a brother to Kanu, who had said the exercise had been called off to allow students sitting for the NECO examination to do so. Spokesperson of the group, Emma Powerful quickly refuted the claim, saying the order was sacrosanct.\n\nMonday\u2019s sit-at-home registered heavy compliance in Anambra, with banks, schools, markets, shops, eateries and other businesses deserted.\n\nTHISDAY correspondent who moved round to monitor the level of compliance found that even though markets were opened, traders refused to resume for business.\n\nAnambra State government had earlier threatened to withhold August salaries of workers who failed to resume for duties on Monday.\n\nAt the state secretariat complex, it was also observed that most workers came to work because of the order, but they left almost immediately, after signing the attendance register.\n\nMotorparks were also deserted as motorists and passengers alike stayed away from them, leaving streets deserted.\n\nTHISDAY reports that police patrol vehicles were on every major street, providing protection for the few people that were courageous enough to come out.\n\nA market leader at Eke Awka market who did not disclose his name said: \u201cThe leadership of the market did its best by opening the market, but traders refused to come.\n\n\u201cYou can see that some of the traders opened, but there are no customers. I think it is rather out of fear that people did not come to the market, and not because they want to comply with IPOB directive,\u201d he said.\n\nSee photo.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says more than 30,000 suspected cases of cholera have been reported in 22 states and the federal capital territory (FCT) in seven months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChikwe Ihekweazu, director-general of the NCDC, disclosed this in a statement on Monday.\n\nAccording to the NCDC DG, more than 800 deaths have also been recorded within the period under review.\n\nWhile noting that the federal government is working on urgent response efforts to address the situation, Ihekweazu urged state governments to endeavour to improve access to better living conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is leading the national response to an outbreak of cholera across states in Nigeria. This has been exacerbated by poor access to clean water, open defecation, poor sanitation, and hygiene,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cBetween the 1st of January and 1st of August 2021, 31,425 suspected cases of cholera, 311 confirmed cases and 816 deaths have been reported from 22 states and FCT. The affected states are Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross River, Niger, Nasarawa, Jigawa, Yobe, Kwara, Enugu, Adamawa, Katsina, Borno and FCT.\n\n\u201cFollowing an increase in the number of cholera cases, the National Cholera Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated on the 22nd of June 2021. The EOC, which is hosted at NCDC, includes representation from the Federal Ministries of Environment and Water Resources, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), World Health Organization (WHO) and partners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe National Cholera EOC has led the deployment of Rapid Response Teams to support the most affected states -\u2013 Benue, Kano, Kaduna, Zamfara, Bauchi and Plateau States. Additionally, NCDC and its partners have provided states with commodities for case management and laboratory diagnosis, materials for risk communications, response guidelines among other support. A reactive oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign led by NPHCDA was conducted in Bauchi LGA, Bauchi State from 24th to 28th July 2021.\n\n\u201cBut none of these medical interventions will solve the underlying issues leading to cholera outbreaks. Cholera is a waterborne disease, and the risk of transmission is higher when there is poor sanitation and disruption of clean water supply. The wrong disposal of refuse and practices such as open defecation endanger the safety of water used for drinking and personal use. These lead to the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera. Without proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH), Nigeria remains at risk of cholera cases and deaths.\n\n\u201cThe long-term solution for cholera control lies in access to safe drinking water, maintenance of proper sanitation and hygiene. We continue to advocate to State Governments to prioritise action for solutions that ensure access to and use of safe water, basic sanitation and good hygiene practices in communities.\u201d\n\nHe also advised Nigerians to take action by ensuring that their environments are kept clean, and urged those who exhibit symptoms of cholera to seek medical attention immediately.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAdditionally, we urge Nigerians to keep their environments clean, only drink or use water that is boiled and stored safely, ensure food is cooked and stored in a clean and safe environment, avoid open defecation and wash their hands regularly with soap and running water,\u201d Ihekweazu said.\n\n\u201cCholera is preventable and treatable; however, it can be deadly when people who are infected do not access care immediately. Nigerians are advised to visit a health facility immediately, if they have sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and weakness.\n\n\u201cAs the NCDC continues to work with partners to lead the health-sector response to cholera outbreaks, we call for an urgent improvement in access to clean water, proper sanitation and hygiene.\u201d",

          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi. Now think about what the current employees in different logistics, eCommerce and healthtech companies would build in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Inconsistent policies are killing African startups",
          "text": "Policies & African startups is a monthly series written by Titi Akinsanmi. All musings are hers and not attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You. As Nigerians like to say, \u201c\u2026 o di kwa serious?!\u201c\n\nOver the next few \u2018musings\u2019 I will ponder on what we should be prioritising and why. If the data allows and my brain strings the words I will project on the impact \u2013 possibly speak to the future.\n\nTill next time \u2013 keep musing \ud83d\ude09\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Cabal | Author @techcabal",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The round was led by global VC, Speedinvest and New York-based Left Lane Capital.\n\nOthers include DCM Ventures, Clocktower Technology Ventures, thelatest.ventures, London-based LocalGlobe, California-based Tekton Ventures, New York-based FJ Labs, and New York-based Palm Drive Capital.\n\nThe list continues with Singapore-based Roka Works, Dubai-based KAAF Investments, Abu Dhabi-based Spartech Ventures, California-based Class 5 Global, and Victoria van Lennep, co-founder of Lendable.\n\nAfrica focused VC Verod Capital Management, Kepple Africa Ventures, and London-based Emso Asset Management \u2014 one of Moove\u2019s existing lenders \u2014 joined the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Yahoo! Finance, the company says this is the first African investment by many of the US-based VCs in this round. This brings Moove\u2019s total funding to $68.2 million \u2014 $28.2 million in equity and $40 million in debt.\n\nAccording to Technext, Chisom Anoke, Moove Africa\u2019s Country Manager, says this funding would enable the company to expand into more states in Nigeria, increase gender equality in the industry while creating job opportunities both within Moove and for its entrepreneurial customer base.\n\nFounded in 2019 by Ladi Delano and Jide Odunsi, the co-founders initially bootstrapped the company. However, in 2020, Moove raised a $5.2 million seed round and launched fully in June 2020.\n\nMoove\u2019s business model involves providing up to 95% in vehicle financing to its customers, which can be paid back either in 24, 36, or 48 months using a percentage of their weekly earnings.\n\nThe company also has a Flexi-Rental option which gives customers access to new cars for a weekly rental fee. Moove aims to ensure 60% of all loans are used to purchase electric or hybrid vehicles. A trend which seems to be gaining ground in Africa.\n\nAccess to vehicle financing in Africa is a struggle. In Nigeria, for example, as of 2016, Deloitte reveals that only 2% of Nigerians could afford to pay for new vehicles. Quite unimpressive numbers for a country that has a population of over 200 million.\n\nExpounding on this, Delano said, \u201cIn a continent full of opportunity, mobility is key to moving economies forward, and this funding contributes to our ability to provide revenue-based financing, as Moove empowers Africans to become mobility entrepreneurs safely.\n\n\u201cWe help people buy new cars who otherwise couldn\u2019t afford them. And then, using the vehicle as a mobility entrepreneur, they\u2019re able to earn money, which allows them to pay off the vehicle over time,\u201d he concludes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company is Uber\u2019s sole partner in sub-Saharan Africa for vehicle financing and recently announced a partnership with Global Accelerex to make payments seamless for riders in Moove financed cars.\n\nMoove is focused on mobility entrepreneurs \u2014 persons in the ride-hailing and e-logistics space \u2014 and is currently operating in Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa. The company claims its financed cars have completed more than 850,000 Uber trips and currently enjoys a 60% month-on-month growth.\n\nAn instrumental factor, as Stefan Klestil, General Partner at Speedinvest, explains. \u201cWith Ladi and Jide at the helm of a world-class team, and their unique approach to vehicle financing, Moove has quickly established itself as one of the most exciting tech companies in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s expansion to three cities in under 12 months demonstrates the huge demand for vehicle financing in Africa, where just five per cent of new cars are purchased with financing, compared to 92 per cent in Europe.\u201d\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State-Nigerian Erosion and Watershed Management Project has condemned a viral video of a protest by some persons purported to be living around the project catchment area of Gapiona, noting that claims in the said video were falsely represented.\n\nCommunication Officer, Edo NEWMAP, Ivy Adodo, in a statement, noted that \u201cthe viral video was recorded last year and was used as a political tool/campaign against the Government at the peak of the governorship election of 2020 by the proponents of the said video sometime in June 2020.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adodo, \u201cWhile most of the claims in the said video were falsely represented, as at today every person whose property has been affected has been fully paid by the Government of Edo State that is responsible for the payment of compensation and not the World Bank as also erroneously conveyed by the proponent of the video.\n\n\u201cThe project is by the Edo State Government and not a World Bank project as erroneously conveyed in the said video. Furthermore, the Gapiona flood Project was initiated at the instance of the State Government and not the other way.\n\n\u201cThe Gapiona erosion control project consists of various sub-catchments and communities in the catchment area including but not limited to Gapiona, Ruben Agho, Ebo, Ogumwenyin, Ugieokuin, and several other areas.\u201d\n\nThe statement further reads: \u201cThe Proposed Pond 1 area of the current Gapiona flood alleviation project is the lowest point in the whole catchment and naturally the place for settlement of the whole flood within the area. Residents in Gapiona area have lived with the erosion problem for over 20 years, this has led to many residents fleeing their homes while majority of the access roads linking the area has been rendered impassable.\n\n\u201cThe intense flooding being experienced in the area in recent times is due to the impact of climate change resulting from high runoff and higher intensity of rainfall and the indiscriminate fencing and obstruction of waterways by residence.\n\n\u201cThis very problem is the reason for the prioritization of this project by the state government and the reason for its intervention through Edo State NEWMAP.\u201d\n\nNoting the government\u2019s commitment to tackle the problem of flooding in Edo communities and alleviate the sufferings of the people, Adodo stated: \u201cIt, therefore, may not be charitable if NEWMAP, an intervention project is now erroneously being held responsible for the flooding of homes within this area, which is a very unfortunate and regrettable event.\n\n\u201cThe Engineering Design being implemented by the State Government as cleared was designed by the number 1 rated Engineering design firm in Africa, reviewed by the Federal Project Management Unit of NEWMAP, through a renowned Engineering design firm and finally cleared by a combined team of Engineers from the FAO and the World bank.\n\n\u201cThe government is implementing a world class design through one of the best construction companies in Nigeria also approved by the World Bank.\n\n\u201cNEWMAP\u2019s intervention in the area has brought succor to residents in the sections where work has been completed.\n\n\u201cEdo State NEWMAP has worked at 15 locations/sites and has successfully completed six other flood and gully erosion control projects (Edo College, Queen Ede, Ekehuan, all in Benin City; Oshiobugie in Auchi, Ibore and Ewu both in Esan Central LGA) in Edo state in line with best global practices and these communities are now better off.\n\n\u201cThese are all there for verification. The completed work will be to the benefit of all residents in the catchment area in the long run.\u201d\n\nAccording to Edo NEWMAP, \u201cIt may interest you to note that there are 23 participating States in Nigeria and the last two evaluation and ratings of performance, Edo State came tops under the leadership of the Project Coordinator, Dr. Tom Obaseki.\n\n\u201cTrying to malign his professionalism and personality is an exercise in futility. While the project is concerned with the current challenges being faced by the residents, we want to assure that every step is being taken to accelerate the process of implementation. We appeal to residents, particularly those within the Pond1 area for their patience as the project which is in progress is in the advanced stages of completion.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "Climate Change: UN report issues profound warning to mankind",
          "text": "A United Nation climate panel has warned that global warming, caused largely by man, is becoming worse and profound climatic changes already manifesting may be \u201cirreversible\u201d for centuries to come.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) made this known in the latest IPCC report published on Monday. It warned that \u201cstrong and sustained\u201d reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases would limit climate change.\n\nThe report which deals with the scientific basis of climate change and how humans are altering the planet was approved by 195 member states on Friday.\n\nThe 3,949-page report is the first installment of four reports released under the IPCC\u2019s current assessment cycle, with subsequent reports scheduled to be published next year.\n\nThis first part of the IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report(AR6) is aimed towards providing world leaders with a first-class standard summation of modern climate science ahead of the forthcoming Conference of the Parties (COP26) in early November.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in his reaction to the report, described it as \u201ca code red for humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable: greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk,\u201d he said.\n\nHoesung Lee, Chair of the IPCC was quoted to have said \u201cThis report reflects extraordinary efforts under exceptional circumstances.\u201d\n\nHe said; \u201cthe innovations in this report, and advances in climate science that it reflects, provide an invaluable input into climate negotiations and decision-making.\u201d\n\nKey findings and recommendations\n\nThe scientists noted that many of the changes observed in the climate were \u201cunprecedented\u201d and that some of the changes such as continued sea-level rise are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years.\n\nThe highly anticipated report by the UN\u2019s climate panel highlighted that limiting global warming to close to 1.5 degrees Celsius or even 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels \u201cwill be beyond reach\u201d in the next two decades without immediate, rapid, and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIt said the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold is a crucial global target and that beyond this level, the so-called tipping points are most likely going to set in.\n\nTipping points are explained as the irreversible change in the climate system locking in further global heating.\n\nHowever, at 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, the report noted that heat extremes would often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health.\n\nThe report explained that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are responsible for roughly 1.1 degrees celsius of warming since 1850-1900, and finds that averaged over the next 20 years, global temperature is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming.\n\nThe UN climate panel stated that a \u201cstrong and sustained\u201d reduction of carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases would limit climate change.\n\nIt said benefits such as improved air quality would come quickly, while it could take 20 to 30 years to see global temperatures stabilize.\n\nThe report stated clearly that it is not just about temperature, but that climate change is bringing different changes in different regions, noting that all will increase with further global heating.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThese changes include more intense rainfall and associated flooding, more intense drought in many regions, coastal areas to see continued sea-level rise throughout the 21st century, the amplification of permafrost thawing, ocean acidification, among many others,\u201d the report noted.\n\nWhile policymakers across the world who have endorsed the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d are under immense pressure to deliver on promises made ahead of COP26. Yet, the world\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels is expected to get even worse.\n\nThe IPCC had previously recommended that transition away from fossil fuels will be a huge undertaking that requires \u201crapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes\u201d across all aspects of society.\n\nThis, analysts said, clearly shows that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius could go hand-in-hand with ensuring a more sustainable and environmentally friendly ecosystem with clear benefits to both humans and natural habitats.\n\nThe IPCC groups\n\nThe IPCC is a UN body of 195 member states that assesses the science related to the climate crisis and was founded in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization so as to provide world leaders with periodic updates about the scale of the climate emergency, its implications, and risks and to put forward adaptation and mitigation strategies.\n\nIt comprises three working groups: Working Group I, II, and III. The Working Group I deals with the physical science basis of climate change.\n\nThis is the group that presented its contribution to the IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report(AR6) on Monday, while the Working Group II deals with impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability and Working Group III assesses the mitigation of climate change.\n\nHowever, a separate task force assesses methodologies for measuring greenhouse gas emissions and removals.",

          "title": "APC convention fallout How much can Osinbajo do?",
          "text": "By Olusesan Laoye\n\nIt seems that the Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo is now in a Catch-22 situation over his stand on the recently held ward Congresses of the party following the judgment of the Supreme Court on the governorship election in Ondo State.\n\nWhile that contest was chiefly between Ogbeni Rotimi Akeredolu of the All progressives Congress (APC) and Eyitayo Jegede of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), its reveberations have continued one year after, both in scale and scope.\n\nThe vice President, based on the touted flaws discovered in the judgment and the technicality which saved the APC, had opposed the conduct of the ward congresses that were recently held but he was opposed by some powerful people in the cabinet and the party, that insisted the congress should yet hold.\n\nDespite the concerns over the legality of the congress, it was eventually held all over the states of the federation of Nigeria but was full of complaints, Protests and agitation by members and some leaders of the party who felt marginalized through the consensus arrangement adopted for the conduct of the congresses.\n\nThe ward congresses rather than uniting the party have therefore further widened the cracks and animosities between members and leaders, as there are claims that it is those said to have been favoured by the Mai Mala Buni Caretaker National Committee that arranged the Congresses and used it to whittle down the powers of some leaders in their states.\n\nThe crisis since the ward congress has heightened and it has further divided the party.\n\nThe main issue in contention which pitched Professor Osinbajo and others on his side against the other group led by the Attorney General of the Federation, Malami was the Supreme court judgement which raised issues over the legality of the Mai Mala Buni caretaker executive, which had signed Governor Akeredolu\u2019s nomination form to contest the election.\n\nOne of the legs of Eyitayo Jegede\u2019s Appeal was that the Governor of Yobe State, Buni had no right to sign Akeredolu\u2019s form as the chairman of the APC because he was not entitled to hold two executives offices at the same time under the Nigerian constitution and the that of his party.\n\nWhat actually saved the APC in that judgment was that technical ground that Jegede had failed to join Buni in the suit.\n\nHad it been that he did that, Akeredolu\u2019s election would have been nullified as it was actually sustained on the ground of a split judgement of 4 against 3 by the Supreme Court Justices.\n\nBut in order not to fall into the same trap going forward, Osinbajo, Festus Keyamo(SAN) Femi Ojudu and others did not therefore want the ward congresses held because it was Buni\u2019s committee that organized it and the notion was that if the Congress is challenged in court, it would create a big problem for the APC.\n\nBefore the Vice President joined the league of those who wanted the congress put on hold for now it was the Minister of State, Labour, Festus Keyamo that had first publicly pointed out the legality challenge in the Buni controversy as regards the supreme court\u2019s judgment on Akeredolu.\n\nKeyamo (SAN), had warned of the legal implications of holding the exercise following the judgement of the Supreme Court on the appeal filed by the PDP candidate in the October 2020 governorship election in Ondo State, Eyitayo Jegede.\n\nHe argued that the little technical point that saved Gov Akeredolu was that Jegede failed to join Mai Mala Buni in the suit. Jegede was challenging the competence of Gov. Mai Mala Buni as a sitting Governor to run the affairs of the APC as Chairman of the Caretaker Committee.\n\nKeyamo pointed out that Jegede had drew the attention of the court in his Appeal to the fact that it is against Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution which states that \u201ca sitting Governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Keyemi said, \u201chad Buni been joined in the suit, the story may have been different today as we would have lost Ondo State to the PDP.\u201d\n\nApart from the minister, the Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Babafemi Ojudu and the Special Assistant to the President on Niger Delta Affairs, Ita Enang, in a joint statement , also warned the party of the dire consequences should it go ahead with the congresses.\n\nThey argued that if the caretaker committee organised the congresses, it could lead to legal tussles which would affect the party in 2023.\n\nDespite all these warnings,, the APC ignored them and went ahead saying that the trio were merely expressing their \u2018personal opinions which would have little effect on the legitimacy of the party\u2019s interim leadership.\n\nAccording to the APC interim National Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe,\u201dwe stand with our National Chairman, we will go ahead with the congresses as planned.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201dThe clarification is against the backdrop of personal opinions being expressed by some individuals on the status of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and its capacity to conduct the Congresses.\n\n\u201cWhile it is not our intention to join issues with these commentators, the Supreme Court\u2019s Wednesday judgement affirming the Election victory of the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu SAN had no bearing on the CECPC\u2019s status and its membership.\u201d\n\nNow that the congress has been held it has however not fully dispelled the scare created in the party as some members are not happy.\n\nIt has not only divided the party, it has also created a gulf in the Federal Executive Council as members are with different opinions on the Supreme Court judgment and the conduct of the ward congresses.\n\nThe issue was said to have been raised at the Federal executive council meeting where the Vice President Osinbajo held firmly to his stand that the party was not favoured legally by its holding the ward congress and subsequent elections under the present leadership of Buni at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja.\n\nIt was learnt that up till now, the vice president has not changed his position on the committee.\n\nIt was said that Professor Osinbajo took an informed position after analysing the Supreme Court judgement on the Ondo governorship election and his stand has remained the same.\n\nSources hinted that the vice president was very clear and told the council that the APC should do everything possible to avoid legal trap and address the main issue raised, which is against the country\u2019s constitution and section 17 of the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe source further hinted that some minister, especially those who were lawyers in the cabinet argued along the line of the position of Osinbajo, but it was only the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami. that held a contrary view.\n\nBusiness hallmark also reliably learnt that right now the cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari is sharply divided along two groups of Professor Osinbajo and Malami, while it would take the intervention of President Buhari to get the issue resolved. when he comes back. from London where he went to receive medical attention.\n\nMalami was said to have supported that the status quo, be maintained and asked the party not to succumb to what he described as speculative and unsubstantiated fears concerning the status of Buni as the caretaker chairman.\n\nThe Supreme Court had in a split judgement on July 28 upheld the election of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State and dismissed the appeal of the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s (PDP) candidate, Eyitayo Jegede for lack of \u201cany scintilla of merit.\u201d\n\nJegede and the PDP had challenged the October 10, 2020 governorship election and pegged their main relief on the ground that Governor Akeredolu and his deputy, Orimisan Aiyedatiwa, were not qualified to contest the election.\n\nThey contended that the signing of Akeredolu\u2019s nomination certificate (exhibit P21) by the APC\u2019s caretaker committee led by Governor Buni of Yobe State was invalid based on section 183 of the Nigerian constitution, 1999 and Article 17(iv) of the APC constitution.\n\nBoth the majority judgement of four justices and the minority judgement of three justices concurred that Governor Buni had violated section 183 of the constitution, which holds that, \u201cThe governor shall not, during the period when he holds office, hold any other executive office or paid employment in any capacity whatsoever,\u201d as well as Article 17(iv) of the APC constitution, which holds that, \u201cNo officer in any organ of the party shall hold executive position in government concurrently.\u201d\n\nHowever, the majority judgement read by Justice Emmanuel Akomaye Agim submitted that the contention, being one with grave consequences for the governor involving the determination of the constitutional issue of his action, would be unfair to try in his absence.\n\n\u201cThe fair trial of such issue in his absence without joining him as a party is impossible. There is no need to stress the point that he is a necessary party to the case because the issue upon which the appellants have predicated their case, namely, the invalidity of the said exhibit itself cannot be fairly, effectually and conclusively be determined without joining him as a party to the case,\u201d Agim said.\n\nIn his reaction to the legality of Buni\u2019s leadership of the party David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi state, has said the caretaker committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is constitutional.\n\nA statement by Francis Nwaze, the governors Press Secretary \u201cthe governor while assessing the just concluded congresses in his state, said the caretaker arrangement put together by the party was in line with the party\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201dWhen that opinion was expressed, I had to go through the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the constitution of the party, as a section of the party\u2019s constitution empowers the National Executive Committee to set up a caretaker committee and this caretaker committee is to do the job of any of the organs of the party where there is vacancy or vacancies.\u201d",
          "summary": "The crisis since the ward congress has heightened and it has further divided the party.\nWhat actually saved the APC in that judgment was that technical ground that Jegede had failed to join Buni in the suit.\nMai Mala Buni as a sitting Governor to run the affairs of the APC as Chairman of the Caretaker Committee.\nIt was said that Professor Osinbajo took an informed position after analysing the Supreme Court judgement on the Ondo governorship election and his stand has remained the same.\nIn his reaction to the legality of Buni\u2019s leadership of the party David Umahi, governor of Ebonyi state, has said the caretaker committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is constitutional.",

          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nWhen he first stepped into the fray, Valentine Chineto Ozigbo must have seemed like one of those hardly consequential participants there to make up the numbers \u2013 his professional pedigree notwithstanding \u2013 but today the candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) for the November 6 governorship election in Anambra has more than proven he means business.\n\nThere is a sense of Deja Vu, many say, in Ozigbo\u2019s candidacy. The general feeling is that it has brought back memories of the youthful Peter Obi, the immediate past governor of the state who at 42 in 2003, left his thriving boardroom career \u2013 he was chairman of Fidelity Bank Plc, among other top positions \u2013 to join the Anambra governorship race under the platform of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA).\n\nAt the time, many people could have concluded that he stood little chance, given the dominance of the then ruling People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and it\u2019s demonstrated capacity to win by the hook or crook.\n\nObi, who had resisted attempts to lure him into politics by Prof. ABC Nwosu, was eventually convinced when called upon by the founder of Kellogg Graduate School, Professor Dean Jacobs to go back to his country and participate in building public wealth, \u201cbecause public wealth enriches everybody, but private wealth impoverishes everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen Obi contested in 2003, nobody gave him a chance,\u201d recalled Mr. Collins Okek, head, public sector practice group, Olisa Agbakoba Legal. \u201cBut he won, even though he was rigged out. So, Ozigbo might cause a bit of an upset in November.\u201d\n\nObi, in 2014, handed over to Chief Willie Obiano, himself a technocrat whose career had spanned from First Bank of Nigeria, to Chevron and later Fidelity Bank, but who has largely failed to replicate his predecessor\u2019s performance in many people\u2019s reckoning, even as the state now has accumulated domestic debt of N60bn, up from N3bn in 2014.\n\nAs Obiano prepares to hand over to the next governor early next year, many are longing for a return to the Obi years, and Ozigbo \u2013 who at 51, has accumulated a wealth of experience in the private sector, having worked as banker for over 17 years, going from NAL Merchant Bank, Diamond Bank, Continental Trust Bank, FSB International Bank, Standard Trust Bank to United Bank for Africa and Bank PHB, before branching out into the hospitality industry where he served as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Transcorp Hotels Plc, from where he became its President and Chief Executive Officer in 2019 \u2013 fits the bill in many people\u2019s opinions.\n\n\u201cOzigbo is another Peter Obi,\u201d said Mr. Oliver Nwafor, a political enthusiast based in Awka, the state capital. \u201cI think he will do well in the election. People tend to like him because he is humble and seem to be prepared to govern.\u201d\n\nNwafor\u2019s conviction shared by Obi himself, who today is the leader of the PDP in the state, and has been canvassing support for Mr. Ozigbo, as he hopes the party will do better than it did in 2017, when Obiano defeated its candidate Mr. Oseloka Obaze and candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC) to retain his seat.\n\n\u201cOzigbo candidacy is divine and ordained by God for the position and there is nothing we can do other than to support him,\u201d Obi told party stakeholders in the state on Thursday a fortnight ago.\n\nOzigbo had scaled the first major huddle by emerging candidate of the PDP ahead of many other formidable aspirants under the party\u2019s platform, including Anambra Central senator, Uche Ekwunife; former member of the House of Reps, Tony Nwoye, as well as U.S. based billionaire medical doctor, Godwin Maduka, among others.\n\nBut he has had to contend with series of court litigation, as Senator Ugochukwu Uba who emerged candidate of a parallel primary continues to lay claim to being the authentic candidate of the party.\n\nThe series of court judgments emanating there-from, however, appear to have now been settled with the judgment of a Court of Appeal in Abuja which reinstated the Ndubuisi Nwobu-led executive \u2013 which was initially sacked by an Abuja High Court following a suit instituted by Samuel Anyakorah, and replaced by Chukwudi Umeaba, whose faction recognised Senator Uba \u2013 thereby validating the candidature of Mr. Ozigbo.\n\nThe PDP candidate, barring other intra-party controversies, will now focus on the ultimate prize; the goal of beating other candidates on November 6.\n\nAs candidate of Nigeria\u2019s main opposition party, which has massive support in Anambra, he stands on a strong footing. Yet, his humility and ability to address issues have endeared him to many of the state\u2019s populace, some of whom accuse his key rival, Soludo of being too elitist and aloof, even as the backing of Mr. Obi may be an added advantage.\n\n\u201cOzigbo is popular, also based on the popularity of his party, the PDP,\u201d said Chidi Odogwu, a business owner in Onitsha. \u201cHe has a chance of beating Soludo, because a lot of people see Soludo as being too elitist.\n\n\u201cBut, of course, it won\u2019t be as straightforward because politics is a game of strength. I think Soludo has an upper hand because of APGA. APGA has the structure, and Soludo, regardless of the assertions that he is too elitist, is also very popular.\u201d\n\nOzigbo will face the APGA candidate former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Charles Soludo, and other candidates, in what is a battle of Anambra South Senatorial District; the Old Aguata Zone; the zone which is to produce the next governor of the state in line with its informal zoning arrangement.\n\nIt is generally a four-horse race, featuring Ozigbo, Soludo, candidates of the PDP and APGA, respectively; as well as Dr. Ifeanyi Ubah, candidate of the Young Progressive Party (YPP) and Senator Andy Uba, candidate of the country\u2019s ruling party, the APC. But it is one which Soludo and Ozigbo stand shoulders higher above the rest, as the two leading candidates.\n\n\u201cI think the battle is actually going to be between Soludo and the Ozigbo; that is between APGA and PDP,\u201d said Mr. Okeke. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it will eventually play out, but it is clearly a battle between the PDP and APGA. Still, the dynamic is such that APGA appears to be on ground. They have the structure; they have been around for quite some time and that\u2019s a big advantage.\u201d\n\nAPGA has been in power in Anambra for 15 years, from 2006 when Obi became governor. And every attempt by the PDP and more recently, APC to topple its rule has fallen through. The party has built structures in the state over the years, but it has also become increasingly weakened by its own internal contradictions.\n\nFormed initially to serve as a rallying point for the Igbo in the contest for power in Nigeria, the party has since evolved, with many alleging that it\u2019s since become a platform used to make money by its leadership.\n\nToday, from Chief Chekwas Okorie, who originally founded the party, to Bianca Ojukwu, wife of the late Emeka Ojukwu who was the moral and psychological force behind the party, as well as Mr. Obi, its first governor, most of the founding fathers have ditched it on account of irreconcilable differences.\n\nThe party continues to battle crisis, which has also become prominent in the lead up to the election, over the emergence of Soludo as candidate, with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) initially listing Michael Umeoji, who emerged candidate of the Jude Okeke led faction, over Soludo as the APGA candidate, in compliance with the decision of a Jigawa High Court that recognised the faction as the authentic faction.\n\nThe Jigawa High Court decision, was however, eventually reversed by Justice Charles Okaa of an Awka High Court who affirmed Soludo as authentic candidate; a decision that has also been upheld by an Appeal Court, Awka division, which last week struck out an application challenging the judgment of the Awka High Court.\n\nThe court matter appears to have been settled for the moment, but the rifts remain. And it\u2019s these contradictions that the PDP and Ozigbo may hope to exploit to win power.\n\n\u201cSome of the bigwigs in APGA are not backing Soludo, that might be a problem,\u201d said Odogwu. \u201cBut I think the party still has an upper hand.\u201d\n\nThe PDP nonetheless, has its own challenges too, with crisis rocking it from state to national level.\n\n\u201cThe PDP did well in the last election and will hope to replicate that in November,\u201d said Mr. Okeke. \u201cBut the problem PDP will have is that the governorship election in a one-off election, not like the general election of 2019.\n\n\u201cIn 2019, a lot of people voted for the PDP because they didn\u2019t want to vote for the APC given the way Buhari was performing. People didn\u2019t want to vote for Buhari, so they voted massively for the PDP. Again, Peter Obi was also on the ballot. This time, he will not be. So, the dynamics is different. But his support for Ozigbo may also count.\u201d\n\nFor Okeke, apart from Soludo and Ozigbo, the only other candidate that may possibly swing a surprise is YPP candidate, Ubah.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think APC is even in the fight at all; I don\u2019t think Andy Uba will make much impression, except something goes wrong, but I don\u2019t think it will happen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe other person that may swing a surprise, which many people may not realise is Ifeanyi Ubah, though his party YPP is not as strong and I\u2019m not also sure that many people in Anambra will be keen to trust him with the state treasury.\n\n\u201cBut you never know, anything can happen. Ubah is popular in his Nnewi constituency, whether that will be enough is another story.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), has said that a total of 31,425 suspected cases of cholera and 816 deaths have been reported in 22 states and the FCT.\n\nThe Centre, which disclosed this on Monday in its weekly Epidemiological Report for Week 30, listed the states as Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross River, Niger, Nasarawa, Jigawa, Yobe, Kwara, Enugu, Adamawa, Katsina, Borno and FCT.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cAs at 1st August, 2021, a total of 31,425 suspected cases including 816 deaths\n\n(CFR 2.6 per cent ).

The wrong disposal of refuse and practices such as open defecation endanger the safety of water used for drinking and personal use, he added.\n\nThese, the DG said lead to the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera.\n\n\u201cWithout proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH), Nigeria remains at risk of cholera cases and deaths.\n\n\u201cThe long-term solution for cholera control lies in access to safe drinking water, maintenance of proper sanitation and hygiene. We continue to advocate to State Governments to prioritise action for solutions that ensure access to and use of safe water, basic sanitation and good hygiene practices in communities.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, we urge Nigerians to keep their environments clean, only drink or use water that is boiled and stored safely, ensure food is cooked and stored in a clean and safe environment, avoid open defecation and wash their hands regularly with soap and running Cholera is preventable and treatable; however, it can be deadly when people who are infected do not access care immediately.\n\n\u201cNigerians are advised to visit a health facility immediately, if they have sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and weakness.\n\n\u201cAs the NCDC continues to work with partners to lead the health-sector response to cholera outbreaks, we call for an urgent improvement in access to clean water, proper sanitation and\n\nhygiene,\u201d Ihekweazu stated.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), has said that a total of 31,425 suspected cases of cholera and 816 deaths have been reported in 22 states and the FCT.\n\nThe Centre, which disclosed this on Monday in its weekly Epidemiological Report for Week 30, listed the states as Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross River, Niger, Nasarawa, Jigawa, Yobe, Kwara, Enugu, Adamawa, Katsina, Borno and FCT.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cAs at 1st August, 2021, a total of 31,425 suspected cases including 816 deaths\n\n(CFR 2.6 per cent ). Of the reported cases since the beginning of the year, 27 per cent are aged 5 \u2013 14 years. Of all suspected cases, 51 per cent are males and 49 per cent are females.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere has been a decrease in the number of new cases in the last two weeks.Bauchi (773), Niger (183), Katsina (120), and FCT (64) account for 50.9per cent of 1,941cases reported in the last two weeks (29 and 30).\n\n\u201cIn the reporting week, seven states and FCT reported 1,162 suspected cases \u2013 Bauchi (773), Niger (183), Katsina (120), FCT (64), Jigawa (13), Kano (4), Borno (4) and Adamawa (1). Of this, there were two confirmed cases from FCT. There were 30 deaths from Bauchi (11), Katsina (10), Niger (6), FCT (2) and Jigawa (1) states with CFR of 2.6 per cent.\n\n\u201cNo new state reported cases in epi week 30. A total of 1,162 suspected cases were reported this week representing a 44 per cent decrease compared to 2,082 suspected cases recorded in week 29.\u201d\n\nLEADERSHIP reports that following an increase in the number of cholera cases, the National Cholera Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), hosted at the NCDC was activated on the June 22, 2021.\n\nAccording to the director-general of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, the National Cholera EOC has led the deployment of Rapid Response Teams to support the most affected states- Benue, Kano, Kaduna, Zamfara, Bauchi and Plateau States.\n\nIhekweazu, however, said though reactive oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign led by NPHCDA was conducted in Bauchi LGA,\n\nBauchi State from 24th to 28th July 2021, none of the medical interventions will solve the underlying issues leading to cholera outbreaks.\n\nHe said cholera is a waterborne disease, and the risk of transmission is higher when there is poor sanitation and disruption of clean water supply. The wrong disposal of refuse and practices such as open defecation endanger the safety of water used for drinking and personal use, he added.\n\nThese, the DG said lead to the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera.\n\n\u201cWithout proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH), Nigeria remains at risk of cholera cases and deaths.\n\n\u201cThe long-term solution for cholera control lies in access to safe drinking water, maintenance of proper sanitation and hygiene. We continue to advocate to State Governments to prioritise action for solutions that ensure access to and use of safe water, basic sanitation and good hygiene practices in communities.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, we urge Nigerians to keep their environments clean, only drink or use water that is boiled and stored safely, ensure food is cooked and stored in a clean and safe environment, avoid open defecation and wash their hands regularly with soap and running Cholera is preventable and treatable; however, it can be deadly when people who are infected do not access care immediately.\n\n\u201cNigerians are advised to visit a health facility immediately, if they have sudden onset of profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, and weakness.\n\n\u201cAs the NCDC continues to work with partners to lead the health-sector response to cholera outbreaks, we call for an urgent improvement in access to clean water, proper sanitation and\n\nhygiene,\u201d Ihekweazu stated.",

We need security, we need to be safe to be able to go home and pick the pieces of our lives.\u201d\n\nMonday Garba, Ward Head, Mararaba Tipper, Jebbu Miango, stated, \u201cLast two weeks Tuesday, these Fulani people came to us and attacked our village areas, our houses, killed some of our people without any reason. There was security but they did not take any action. As we called them to come and assist, they told us that they were not permitted to shoot, we were left on our own, now see how we are suffering.\n\n\u201cWe want the government to assist us, compel the security to act because all our farms are destroyed by Fulani, even in the night or afternoon, you see cattle grazing on our crops, we need this to stop.\u201d\n\nAnother victim, Monday Hodus added, \u201cOn that fateful Saturday, the Fulani attacked some members of our community during the funeral of our boys who were killed by them. They attacked and burnt down the whole Jebbu-Miango community killing many of its inhabitants in addition to destroying our farmlands.\n\n\u201cMy house and all my vehicles are completely burnt to ashes. Where do I start from again? The Fulani have formed the habit of grazing on our farms and they expect no one to complain otherwise, it would cost you your life. If you dare report a Fulani to the authority after being caught grazing on your land and he is asked to pay you monetary compensation, he would pay the compensation but would tell you to your face that you will not live to enjoy the money (even if it is N5,000).\n\n\u201cAnd surely, the Fulani will definitely attack and kill the person. If a Fulani cow is missing, Government agents would continue to harass and threaten our local Chiefs as if they are responsible for the missing cow. But when they attack us, destroy our homes and farmlands, nothing is done about it. This is the predicament we have found ourselves in.\u201d\n\nHe expressed dismay over Government neglect of the community having suffered a series of attacks stressing that no government official has deemed it fit to visit the community to see things for themselves.\n\nGastro Barry, Chairman Relief and Intervention Committee who narrated the series of attacks in the Chiefdom since 2001 stated, \u201cBut this year, 2021, it took an entirely different dimension.\n\n\u201cAs I am talking to you now, about 39 communities have been displaced, over 700 have been killed with 55 people injured and hospitalized. The number of farmed crops destroyed are close to 3,000. Over the last few days, the Fulani herdsmen have been grazing their cattle freely on crops that were cultivated.\n\n\u201cThe number of residential rooms, exclusive of food barns, kitchens and stores destroyed are over 3,000. A lot of displaced persons are taking refuge in Miango and in the Kwall district of the chiefdom. A few have moved to Jos and Bukuru. Because this thing happened so suddenly, they could not move out foodstuffs, clothing so families are struggling to feed.\n\n\u201cSome people sustained gunshot injuries and are in hospitals, bills need to be settled, they need medical attention. Issue of accommodation is also a challenge. We have not received any support from the government. We pleaded with the clinics to bear with us.\u201d\n\nHowever, Rev. Gideon Para-Mallam who led other officials of the Foundation to visit the people lamented the situation, saying, \u201cWhat happened in Irigwe land moved our hearts. Although we do peace work in this local government area, sometimes it is difficult to bring people to talk and then when it is an hour of need and you cannot provide the kind of help that people want.

          "text": "By Okafor Ofiebor\n\nThe Federal High Court in Port Harcourt has stopped the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) from collecting Value Added Tax (VAT) and Personal Income Tax (PIT) in Rivers State.\n\nThe court held that it is the Rives State Government that should collect VAT and PIT henceforth in the state.\n\nThe court, presided over by Justice Stephen Dalyop Pam, has also issued an order of perpetual injunction restraining the Federal Inland Revenue Service and the Attorney General of the federation, both first and second defendants in the suit, from collecting, demanding, threatening and intimidating residents of Rivers State to pay to FIRS, personnel income tax and Value Added Tax.\n\nJustice Pam made the assertion while delivering judgement in Suit No. FHC/PH/CS/149/2020, filed by the Attorney General for Rivers State (plaintiff), against the Federal Inland Revenue Service (first defendant) and the Attorney General of the Federation (second defendant).\n\nThe Court, which granted all the eleven reliefs sought by the Rivers State Government, stated that there is no constitutional basis for the FIRS to demand for and collect VAT, Withholding Tax, Education Tax and Technology levy in Rivers State or any other State of the Federation, being that the constitutional powers and competence of the Federal Government is limited to taxation of incomes, profits and capital gains which does not include VAT or any other species of sales, or levy other than those specifically mentioned in items 58 and 59 of the Exclusive Legislative List of the Constitution.\n\nThe judge dismissed the preliminary objections filed by the defendants that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the suit and that the case should be transferred to Court of Appeal for interpretation.\n\nJustice Pam, who also dismissed objection raised by the defendants that the National Assembly ought to have been made a party in the suit, declared that the issues of taxes raised by the State government are issues of law that the court is constitutionally empowered to entertain.\n\nHe declared that after a diligent review of the issues raised by both the plaintiff and the defendants, the plaintiff has proven beyond doubt that it is entitled to all the eleven reliefs it sought in the suit.\n\nThe court agreed with the Rivers State Government that it is the State and not FIRS that is constitutionally entitled to impose taxes enforceable or collectable in its territory of the nature of consumption or sales tax, VAT, education and other taxes or levies, other than the taxes and duties specifically reserved for the Federal Government by items 58 and 59 of Part 1 of the Second Schedule of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\nAlso, the court declared that the defendants are not constitutionally entitled to charge or impose levies, charges or rates (under any guise or by whatever name called) on the residents of Rivers State and indeed any state of the federation.\n\nAmong the reliefs sought by the Rivers State Government, is a declaration that the constitutional power of the Federal Government to impose taxes and duties is only limited to the items listed in items 58 and 59 of Part 1 of the second schedule of the 1999 constitution as amended.\n\nThe Rivers State Government had also urged the court to declare that, by virtue of the provisions of items 7 and 8 of the Part II (Concurrent Legislative List) of the Second Schedule of the constitution, the power of the Federal Government to delegate the collection of taxes can only be exercised by the State government or other authority of the State and no other person.\n\nThe State government had further asked the court to declare that all statutory provisions made or purportedly made in the exercise of the legislative powers of the Federal Government, which contains provisions which are inconsistent with or in excess of the powers to impose tax and duties, as prescribed by items 58 and 59 of the Part I of the Second Schedule of the 1999 constitution, or inconsistent of the power to delegate the duty of collection of taxes, as contained in items 7 and 8 of Part II of the Second Schedule of the Constitution, are unconstitutional, null and void.\n\nLead counsel for the Rivers State Government, Donald Chika Denwigwe (SAN), who spoke to journalists after the court session, explained that the case is all about the interpretation of the constitution as regards the authority of the government at the State and Federal levels to collect certain revenue particularly, VAT.\n\n\u201cSo, during the determination of the matter, some issues of law were thrown up like, whether or not the case should be referred to the Court of Appeal for the determination of some issues.\n\n\u201cThe court noted that the application is like asking the Federal High Court to transfer the entire case to the Court of Appeal. In which case, if the court so decides there will be nothing left to refer back to the Federal High Court as required by the constitution.\u201d\n\nAccording to council Denwigwe, the court refused that prayer and decided that the case was in its proper place before the Federal High Court and to determine it.\n\nSpeaking on the implication of the judgement, Denwigwe said it is now, unlawful for such taxes as VAT in Rivers State to be collected by any agency of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cIn a summary, it is a determination that it is wrong for the Federal government to be collecting taxes which are constitutionally reserved for the State governments to collect. The implication of the judgement is that the government (Federal and State) as an authority under the constitution, should be advised by the judgement that it is the duty of all government authorities to comply with and obey the law so long as the court has interpreted it and said what that law is.\n\n\u201cSo, in other words, the issue of Value Added Tax (VAT) in the territory of Rivers State and Personal Income Tax should be reserved for the government of Rivers State.\u201d\n\nCounsel to FIRS, O.C. Eyibo said he will study the judgment and advise his client.",

          "title": "INTERVIEW: 'The problems with Nigeria's aviation sector",
          "text": "Mr. Dare Osamo is a Chartered Accountant of over ten years with an MBA in Financial Management and background in Energy Consulting, Structured Finance, Capital Market, Credit Analysis, Auditing and Asset Management. In this interview, he spoke extensively of the Nigerian Aviation industry, its challenges and way forward, the oil and gas industry, among others. Excerpt.\n\nHow would you compare the Aviation sector in the last six years, how would you rate it now?\n\nThe Aviation sector is a very interesting sector of the economy. If you look at it, the inter-modal connection system in Nigeria, the road takes about 80% and the aviation takes 20%. They are so significant that without the sector, nothing can efficiently move. The aviation sector in Nigeria is an evolving industry. Nigeria has one of the most underdeveloped aviation sector compared to our peers. The income per mileage is so low, airfare seems to be on the high side but when you compare it to other countries-the income per mileage-in Nigeria is extremely low if we compare it to Egypt, Venezuela and other countries with our size and demographic variables. We are very low in that sector because Nigeria is a poor country. Out of about 100 million people, only ten percent are currently flying. So there\u2019s room for the industry to grow. You can imagine how many states you can fly to in Nigeria; less than 20 percent. Talking of the major routes, like Lagos, Abuja, Calabar, Kano, Port Harcourt, and maybe some new ones like the Akwa Ibom, Enugu and others. Do we currently have flights that can take us from Lagos to Ibadan? You know the number of people that ply the road from Lagos to Ibadan on daily basis. Imagine if there are small carriers that can take everybody from Lagos to Ibadan on the same route. These are some of the things that are lacking in the industry. The penetration itself is not there because of a lot of factors, one; the entry capital required for the industry is extremely high. A lot of people come into the industry and were forced to leave because of the capital required. Some, it\u2019s either they don\u2019t have the right capital to set up the airline or when they set up the airline, they don\u2019t use the proper aircraft or just the market is not there. Once you take up to the sky, it is either you make a profit or loss. So if you make a flight ten times a day and you don\u2019t break even, it means you have lost money ten times. So if you like, book an aircraft that instead of making N20 million, you make N10 million. It\u2019s always difficult for a flight to break even, because of the capital of setting up an airline is extremely high. I deal with the sub sector of aviation where we provide fuelling services. Since we provide services to the main sector, whatever that is happening there will directly affect us too. So in the aviation sector, cost of funding is extremely high. For instance, if you want to buy an aircraft, you don\u2019t need a six years facility; you should go after a facility with twenty to twenty-five year tenor compared to other climes where they have thirty to forty years facility at single digit. But in Nigeria, the best of capital come at double digits. How do you break even with that kind of suffocating cost of capital? And the worst is that you will ask to pay back in four/five years in Nigeria. Before you even know it, you are already incurring losses. There is no infrastructure in Nigeria. As at today, for the sector where we play; into plane sector, we move all our product from the port to the terminal with bridgers. We all knew the state of our road network in Nigeria. However, there ought to be a pipeline that will move products from Apapa to the airport, but there is none functioning anywhere in Nigeria. So you have to rely on trucking, sometimes you can be on the road for five days. There is wear and tear on the bridgers and the general cost of operation is extremely high. If you look at airport community itself, power used to be an issue. We ran a company for almost five years on diesel twenty four hours a day. You can imagine how much I was spending, millions every month just to run the business in the airport community. Aside the power issue, infrastructure is another challenge in our sector. Again, let me say the sector where I play is where we provide fuelling for aircraft. Basically is like your conventional car; no matter how big or beautiful your car is, if you don\u2019t have the right quality fuel in the car, it can\u2019t move. Just like that too in aviation. No matter the class of aircraft you are flying, a gulf stream or the best aircraft, without the right fuel, you can\u2019t go anywhere. Sometimes when you get to airport and they announced that flight is delayed for 30 minutes, sometimes; it may have to do with fuelling being a major problem. Unlike the conventional car where you can manage and say \u201clet me buy two liters\u201d, there\u2019s no way you can do that in the sky. So if you need a full tank, you must take a full tank before you leave Lagos to Abuja. For an aircraft designed to airlift 50 people, if your load factor is 25 or 50 percent, i.e instead of carrying 100 people, you carry 50 people, you are still going to burn the same amount of fuel. Lastly, how many people can afford air ticket? Sometimes you see some commercial flights and their load factor is as low as 25 percent because they already scheduled flight, they must take off. So in doing that, they will incur full cost for that flight without a profitable load factor, and that is why they are some airlines are making losses.\n\nSir, you\u2019ve talked about money. Now at times, you see that a plane would crash and they will say they don\u2019t have enough fuel. Why do they say that? What will you say could be responsible?\n\nAviation sector is one of the most regulated sectors in the whole world. If you drive through the breath of Lagos today, you would probably see like 100 accidents. It could be minor or major but if a prop-engine crashed anywhere on the world today, you will hear in the news. So it remains the safest. Back to your question where you said plane crashes because of lack fuel. There are a lot of things that could be responsible. One; negligence. Because for every flight to take place, you need certain volume of fuel to get to your destination. However, when you are flying, a lot of things can come up. Maybe due to weather, you may have some delay in the sky, your engine consumption rate may increase because of the flight altitude. Sometimes when you fly higher, you may have to burn more fuel. Flying at certain altitude burn certain level of fuel but for aircraft running out fuel, it could be negligence and equipment malfunction. For example if you are fuelling an aircraft, you don\u2019t necessarily fuel based on liters, you fuel based on weight. An aircraft of certain class must take certain volume of fuel of the same. So if the equipment malfunction, this is very, very rare. Assuming your meter is not working. Instead of dispensing 50kg for instance, it may be dispensing 40kg.You cannot rule out human error when it comes mechanical issues but those are rare issues because equipments in the aviation sector are well maintained and highly calibrated but you cannot rule out error when it comes to mechanical issues but it is a very rare issue. Operators in the sector are trying to address it, making sure that the technical and mechanical equipments are top notch, go for maintenance all the time, calibrations are done. On the side of the aircraft operators, they have equally put in place a process that checkmates whatever fuellers are selling to them. For example, if you are to give them five tonnes of fuel, they equally have a way of measuring the volume of kilograms you have sold to them. For example if before the tank-up, the weight of an aircraft is 10 tonnes, they tank up with 3 tonnes. So after fuelling, it is expected that gross weight should be 13 tonnes. So those measurements are in place before they sign off on your dispensing invoice. So those are some of the control put in place to make sure that these avoidable human errors are minimized. When problem happens on the road, you can call LASTMA officials but when problem happen in the sky (God forbid), it\u2019s always fatal.\n\nRecently the oil prices have been going up and we know that your sector is also using 28-1 if I am not mistaking. Fuel is also what constitutes the price of air ticket. So what do you see as the solution for an economy so dependent on oil?\n\nThe harsh reality is that a reasonable business man is in business to create value and in the process make money except you are running a non-profit organization. Ideally, it is expected that all costs to a large extend should be transferred to the consumer. I can say that as far as fuel price keep going up, ultimately the flap will be borne by consumers. There\u2019s no way because business can only absorb these costs for so long. The reality is this: the price of jet fuel is outside the control of anybody in Nigeria. We are dealing with a lot of variables, the global oil price, season, because during winter, the production at the refinery ends tend towards the domestic white products, the PMS, AGO and the domestic gas use in heating homes. So the volume of jet fuel being produced sometimes reduced. So naturally, demand and supply law comes into place. People tend to put premium on jet fuel during this season. There are lots of frozen on the high sea, vessels charge premium on cargoes. If you notice recently, Nigeria has been experiencing deficit in jet fuel supply because, it\u2019s all about price. You have so little product and many buyers. So the price keeps soaring maybe during winter. During summer, a lot of people fly around so naturally global consumption may double because people are flying all over the place. At all times, the price of jet fuel is always fluctuating. That\u2019s why you have it up today and down tomorrow but on the average, it\u2019s always going up.\n\nAnd the FX situation in Nigeria is another tragedy, I am sorry to say. FX today is 500 naira per dollar and we are buying most of your FX from black market as banks cannot meet domestic and trade need for FX. You need FX and you can\u2019t get from the banking sector, you have to buy from the parallel market. At the end of the day, by the time you do your cost matrix you discover that price per litre of product will keep going up. Here is an irony. The importer has already brought in their own products; the airline operator has already fixed their own market price. You can\u2019t be going to the airport everyday and they are saying the ticket has increased. There\u2019s going to be riot, so the operator can absorb that variance to an extent. Now who bears the brunt? It is the fuellers like us because we are the ones buying jet fuel, processing it and selling it to the airline operators. Now the airline owner will tell you \u201cLook, I cannot increase my ticket everyday\u201d. We sacrifice our margin and that is why we see many people that are going into-plane operation, running at a loss. There is a contract you must service. The terms of the contracts are so stringent that if you keep on disappointing an operator before you know it, you are off and some of these contracts are not gotten on yearly basis. Some of them, you get them bi annually, so you don\u2019t want to lose your contract. All you do is just keep on remaining in the business absorbing losses here and there until you now see some correction whereby you can make profit. If you look at the price of product ex-depot, it\u2019s extremely high. For you to set up a 2000 metric tonne-depot; you need almost a billion naira and where do you get that? You see at commercial rate, they are charging 30 percent. Before you know it, you just keep on working, your profit just keep going into cost of fund, into absorbing the variance in the cost of product and settling overhead. So it\u2019s an interesting industry, an industry where we find ourselves and we will continue to remain there until maybe, we get it right in Nigeria.\n\nYour company in 2020 as per COVID-19, how did you cope?\n\n2020 has come to change the world, and life itself will never remain the same again. Aviation sector was the most affected sector of the economy; other sectors were still surviving at a point. At the peak of Covid, less than five percent of the world was flying. Where I worked before, we have to sack 90 percent of our staffs because there\u2019s nothing to be done. We provide services to the aircraft and the aircraft is not flying. We are not just talking of one month non flying, aircrafts run on cash. If they don\u2019t fly in a week, some operators don\u2019t have enough cash reserve for more than one week. What they do is, the ticket they sell, are used in running their business. So after one week of not flying, they are already running out of cash. It\u2019s like starting an airline all over again. That\u2019s why you see that the number of airlines that went under globally is unbelievable. Some airlines that have been in operation for more than 50 years packed up because of that covid. Even now, the flying public is not yet back, they are still developing flying and health protocols, you need to have vaccination passport here and there. People are afraid to go places etc. So the load factor globally is low and even the insurance which is a key component of the industry has gone up. The insurance man will say; \u201cLook! If I give you my aircraft with the low load factor and break even, I may have to increase my premium\u201d. Not everybody can fly everywhere now, even some that want to fly; there are protocols of certain countries that prevent you from entering. So it becomes an issue, then hopefully with the coming up onboard of vaccination and every other thing, maybe by Q1 of 2022, it can return to normalcy but for me, I am looking at maybe 2023, so that throughout this year, the number of people that will be on covid vaccination will increase and they will probably increase the flying percentage. Another flip side to this is that ultimately, the sector is going to benefit from it because people will want to go places. For some us who have never witness an outbreak of pandemic like this will say: \u201cBefore I die, let me go places\u201d. There\u2019s another school of thought that says as this thing goes down, the number of flying public will increase because people will want to explore certain things because you don\u2019t know when the next outbreak will happen. Covid has really messed up the aviation sector.\n\nDo you have cases of adulterated jet fuel?\n\nCertainly not in our company! This is another contentious issue in the industry. This is my take and I will stand from the point of an operator. There\u2019s no way you can have issue of adulterated fuel deliberately. An aircraft costs average of 8 to 2.5 billion. A reasonable operator won\u2019t allow anybody to put bad fuel in your machine except you are not a good business man. That is number one. Number two is that when accidents happen up there, it\u2019s always calamity; it is always very disastrous. So, nobody will deliberately consent to buying bad fuel. Of course there are rumours but for me, on our side as a company, what we do is to sell dry jet and quality fuel and some customers and airlines have their own testing kits at the point of fuelling that will tell you the parameters of the jet fuel. Based on IATA standards, if I fuel an aircraft, I am expected to keep my samples for a certain number of times; sometimes for a year. For example, if I fuel an aircraft today and accident happen in the next eight months or one year, they will still come back to audit me. Even though they have used up my fuel and move on, they will still come back and audit me as a fueller. So, people are very mindful of quality. Another thing is the same fuel you are using in Nigeria, is the fuel that another aircraft that flew from far east will take. So quality is one of the most important criteria in into-plane fuelling business and nobody jokes with quality. The assurance system by airline operators in Nigeria is one of the best around. We have Nigerian IATA auditors leading assurance works globally across continents. Airlines won\u2019t even sign you on when they know that you have compromised your quality.\n\nWhy can\u2019t Nigeria produce her own jet fuel instead of importing? What are the challenges?\n\nThere are two dimensions to that. International flights are always well organized. For the next one year, you can know the flight time and flight plan of an international airline. When they tell you they will come by 10am on November 2023. God willing if there is no force majeure, if there are no significant issues, they will still meet that time. An airline will rather prefer certainty than taking chances on country or locations where they perceived stock out; scarcity. As an international operator, they do a survey of the global stock, what is available in certain region of the world and based on this make their schedule. Remember when it comes to international flight, delay is always expensive. They have legal protocol well developed that if you unjustifiably delay flight, you are subject to a lot of damages unlike Nigeria. They want to avoid that those penalties. What they do is that, they rather go for certainty-go to other regional countries. But what we are doing here in Nigeria is make sure that we demonstrate capacity, we have the stock and by the time you are able to demonstrate capacity overtime, you build their confidence on what you can do. What international flights do now is that they don\u2019t just sign one fueller. You have your category A and you back it up with another one. So if your Category A fueller runs out stock, the back-up should not run out stock. With a bit more cooperation among the fueller, even if you run out of fuel, they can tell you; \u2018I have run out of stock or I am having equipment on ground. Can you take my slot for me?\u2019 That\u2019s why you see lately, we\u2019ve been able to reduce the number of stock out. As per why Nigeria is not producing its own jet fuel, it is a multi dimensional problem. The local refineries are in comatose or functioning at abysmal capacity. Just like we can\u2019t produce enough PMS for our local consumption. You know jet fuel too is a derivative of hydrocarbon. So, if you don\u2019t produce certain product, it is not economical for you to refine jet fuel. Jet fuel is not subsidized like your PMS hence it is assumed to be for big men. Pricing for Jet fuel is purely dictated by market forces. It\u2019s not regulated so the business will have to cater for itself until our refinery began to function. Hopefully, by the time Dangote come on board, may be we can have a more sustainable local production that will help our industry.\n\nYou import fuel. Now that the price of dollar has increased, how are you able to access forex as a business person?\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough one and that is why everybody in the industry is making so much losses. As at today, you cannot bring fuel without using the parallel market which is 500 naira per dollar. By the time you do your cost matrix, the landing cost alone should be about around 260, 270. That is getting the product to coastal, you still have to freight it to your facility at the airport, filtrate it and add value. Aside this, whether you make profit or not, you still have to pay FAAN their N2.50k. It is statutory payment. By the time you calculate all these costs, you are landing at almost an unbelievable rate. The cost of Jet fuel will keep on rising as long as we have to rely on parallel market. However, what I think the government should do is that they dedicate a funding line because if you are funding an airline and expended about fifteen million dollars to acquire your fleet size, nothing stops-knowing full well that jet fuelling itself is about 75 percent of the operational cost of all the airlines, all you need to do is to put a line in place in place because no matter how big is your aircraft, no matter how beautiful the machine, if you don\u2019t have fuel, it cannot fly. Commercial planes are designed to fly not on ground. Anytime you are on ground, you are losing money. Common sense is supposed that there ought to be something they have to do, as you are buying new aircraft, make sure that there\u2019s money to be able to import fuel like the operator. But what do we see? Operators like us have to struggle on our own, source for money at the bank at high rate, then you have to come down to the aboki to buy dollar. At the end of the day, you are almost making nothing and you are running cost. Lately it\u2019s been difficult, unbelievably tough for the operators in the into plane sector.\n\nImpact Energy, what has been the success so far?\n\nImpact Energy, so far, like the typical Nigerian coy is here to stay. It\u2019s been tough but we\u2019ve been able to make some traction from where we started. By God\u2019s grace, next year, we will be 10 years and over this period, we\u2019ve been able stay alive. That\u2019s the most important thing. As a business, being alive itself is a success story in the Nigerian context, in our own small space, creating value. How do we create value? We make sure that we are delivering services to our customers in order to make life better for them and that\u2019s been our success story. In terms of naira and kobo, it has not been. The money has not been there, there\u2019s time of say, increased market share, visible in market and equally developing deeper knowledge of the whole economy. We know that we can build on where what we are doing now. Like a typical Nigerian company, we are equally affected by the global micro economy challenges and constrains. But we are trusting God that 10 years to come, it will be another decade to build on what we have achieved so far, then become a household brand in Nigeria.\n\nWho are your major clients, your major customers?\n\nBasically we operate in the oil and gas space, aviation support business. Of course we have to render our services to all the aviation companies. We do not do into plane service. We are into lubricants, and other aviation consumables. So we render services to all the local airlines. In the oil and gas sector, we equally have good principals that we supply products to, meeting their energy needs and their demand but ultimately, our focus is to, from where we are now begin to build a brand that comes to stay and we will be able to fight for space. This itself we believe we can do by God\u2019s grace based on the knowledge we have gathered overtime and the crop of staff that we have.\n\nAviation sector has had challenges since the past three years. Have you ever thought of quitting due to the challenges?\n\nWe\u2019ve faced challenges where you will think oh! What am I doing here? We were almost at that point sometimes, especially when you come to business where people are very vicious. I have the benefit of floating a business with some people; you know the business world is a terrible place. People are wicked, people are not sincere, people are manipulative, they will do anything to bring you down out of envy and a typical Nigerian man is greedy. A typical Nigerian man believes that he should take everything to himself which I don\u2019t believe, especially when they believe money and power is everything rather than create value. Our concept is to have a platform where everybody around us is successful, but I discovered that I have had a situation working with people whereby you are working hard to grow a brand and they do is to destroy it and destroy the process because they want to take over but we are leaving them to their conscience and posterity. On our own, we have done our bits by sowing the seed that bring to life the brand. So we are leaving them to God, who is the ultimate judge of everybody but quitting, no!\n\nHave you faced challenges?\n\nAbsolutely! You have to think about everything especially when the bulk stops on your desk. You have to think how will the business survive, how you will carry your employees along, how do you make your vendors happy, how do you break even? You know, it\u2019s a lot but the beauty of it is that we wake up every day and say we are up again. So every day is different and there\u2019s the hope of what the next day will bring. As a business man you have to be optimistic that things will get better. That\u2019s what is keeping us.",
          "summary": "How would you compare the Aviation sector in the last six years, how would you rate it now?\nThe Aviation sector is a very interesting sector of the economy.\nSo in the aviation sector, cost of funding is extremely high.\nAviation sector is one of the most regulated sectors in the whole world.\nAviation sector was the most affected sector of the economy; other sectors were still surviving at a point.",

He was accompanied by a popular Nigerian doctor in Chicago. He had wanted the surgery in Paris but when rumour was rife about his death, he hurriedly left for Nigeria and went to John Hopkins,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\n\u201cHe left the US for the UK on crutches,\u201d another source revealed.\n\nHas reported on July 31 that Tinubu, who has had several medical trips this year alone, had a surgery about two weeks earlier and could be billed for another one.\n\nThe APC National Leader has been off official and party functions in the country for a while, amidst talks that he is being positioned for the 2023 presidency to succeed the incumbent repressive regime of Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cTinubu is hospitalised in Maryland, US. His health is failing. He couldn\u2019t participate in launching his Arewa library, and he couldn\u2019t participate in the Local Government Area elections last week.

          "text": "The Lagos State House of Assembly has granted the request of the State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for the state government to assume full ownership of the privately-owned Lekki Concession Company Limited (LCC).\n\nThis follows the Executive\u2019s request received by the lawmakers on June 21 and the subsequent directive to the House Committee on Finance to further look into it and report its findings to the House.\n\nSix weeks after the mandate was given, the House Committee on Finance led by Rotimi Olowo submitted its report to the lawmakers.\n\nGiving his presentation on Monday, Olowo explained that upon the buy-out of all the shareholdings interest of LCC by the state, the government has become the subsisting shareholders of the company with 75% shareholding while the Office of Public-Private Partnerships was left with the remaining 25% shareholding.\n\nAccording to him, the original $53.9 million loan obligation from a private sector facility \u2013 the African Development Bank (AFDB) had been resolved after series of engagements between the bank, LCC, and the state government.\n\nThis was to convert the loan to a public sector facility with the benefit of a considerable reduction in interest charges of 1.02% of $1.12 million bi-annual, as against the 4.12% of $2.746 million per bi-annual, thus giving a savings of $1.16 million bi-annual or $3.24 million per annum.\n\nAt the end of Olowo\u2019s presentation, the House granted the executive the approval to convert the AFDB loan to the public sector loan, backed up by a sovereign Federal Government guarantee on behalf of the state government.\n\nIt also authorised the state government to issue a counter-guarantee in favour of the Federal Government along with an Irrevocable Standing Payment Order (ISPO) to deduct from Lagos State Government statutory allocations.\n\nAccording to the report, the servicing of the loan obligations will be a maturity till August 2034.\n\nContributing to a debate on the report, a member of the House, Gbolahan Yishawu, supported the recommendation which he described as a smart move.\n\nHe believes the interest rate will not affect what the state is spending on capital expenditure. Rather, it will reduce the interest risk and rate by moving the loan from the private to the public sector.\n\nAnother lawmaker, Abiodun Tobun, on his part, said saving 3.1% in interest rate difference would further reduce the burden on the state government and encourage the savings to be used to develop other sectors of the economy.\n\nFor his colleague, Femi Saheed, the restructuring of the loan is an indication of transparency in the state financing and gives add-on flexibility for the additional years granted for the repayment of the loan.\n\nHe deemed the request a standard financial procedure practised all over the world.\n\nThe Speaker of the House, Mudashiru Obasa, has directed the acting Clerk of the House, Olalekan Onafeko, to send a clean copy of the resolution of the lawmakers to the governor.",
